Revealing Comparative Advantage:
Chaotic or Coherent Patterns Across Time
and Sector and U.S. Trading Partner?

                                            ABSTRACT

       We map United States comparative advantage between 1980 and 1995, by trading partner and
region, using Balassa’s export-based index of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA).
       We find: temporally stable and ubiquitous US comparative advantage in differentiated
producer goods (except disadvantage in Japan); somewhat less stable and less sweeping US
disadvantage in standardized producer goods; chaotic and diverse patterns of US RCA in consumer
goods (especially in the Chinese market).
       Our most significant findings are surprisingly sharp geographical differences in patterns of US
RCA and surprisingly small differences across sub-sectors of 1, 2, and 3-digit SITC classifications -
regional, but not sectoral, “niche” specialization.
       The high overall variability across regions in RCA indexes seems unrelated to obvious
explanations such as proximity or lingual/historical ties to the US. In producer goods, RCA
variability across regions correlates somewhat better with accounts of trade diversion and of regional
preferences for and discrimination against US exports.
       We find only scant evidence of high or increasing variability across disaggregated commodity
sub-groups in US RCA indexes. Such variability is often the prediction of theories of comparative
advantage that are based on vertical specialization, product differentiation, or scale and agglomeration
economies.

Introduction, Motivation, Novelty, Overview

       In this paper we attempt to honor, by mimicry, Bob Lipsey’s ongoing life work of
innovative and painstaking measurement and analysis.2

        We do so by mapping and interpreting United States comparative advantage across time,
trading partners, and sectors at an increasing level of commodity detail. We use Bela Balassa’s
index of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) measured from US export data. Bela, like Bob,
was a master of measurement and analysis (and the early mentor of one of us).

        To our knowledge, we are among the first to do these mappings simultaneously across
time, sectors, and regional markets (groups of trading partners).3 To coin a term that emphasizes

 Earlier drafts of this paper have been presented at the November 1998 Conference in Empirical Investigations in
International Trade Conference at Purdue University and at Koc University, Istanbul, as well as at the December
1998 Conference in honor of Robert E. Lipsey at the New York Federal Reserve Bank. The authors are indebted to
the active comments of all the participants there.

 For example, Bob’s early work with Irving Kravis to see how closely the available price indexes of internationally
traded goods come to measures that were built up carefully from surveys of actual transactions prices (Kravis and
Lipsey (1971)), continuing in regular contributions to measures of relative prices through the International
Comparisons Project (ICP, (Heston and Lipsey (1998)) most recently, with many references within). Or, for
example Bob’s many attempts (with Kravis) to measure the relative “importance” of multinational-firm production
in world trade and production (Kravis and Lipsey (1992), most recently, which features the measures of revealed
comparative advantage that we use below). We are, for one final example, particular fans of Bob’s painstaking
efforts to measure what economists really mean by “capital formation” (Kirova and Lipsey (1998) most recently,
with earlier references within).



                                                                                                                  1
this, we call some of our indexes RRCA indexes -- they measure Regional Revealed Comparative
Advantage by market groups of US trading partners.

        We are interested in several patterns of variation. The most novel is the variation in US
comparative advantage from region to region. It turns out to be quite diverse; US patterns of
comparative advantage seem to be different in different parts of the world. And the differences
seem to have changed during the period from 1980 to 1995 from which our data comes. And the
differences look different at different levels of aggregation.

        Aggregation defines our second pattern of interest. US comparative advantage is
naturally quite diverse from sector to sector (by definition), but the differences differ in interesting
ways as sectors are more finely defined. Sectors in which US exports are typically strong often
include disaggregated sub-products in which they are not ... and conversely. And these patterns,
too, change between 1980 and 1995.

        What accounts for these changes in differences? Why are they important? Our results
yield several answers.

        Obvious variables such as proximity underlie some of our findings, such as the
quantitatively sharper (larger) US comparative advantage in exports to the Western Hemisphere
and disadvantage in exports to Asia. Less obvious is the apparent influence of per capita income,
especially on manufactures; US comparative advantage and disadvantage are quantitatively
sharper (larger) in countries that are poorer than they are in richer trading partners. 4 We find
this suggestive for evaluating “natural” regional trading blocs, and for detecting trade diversion,
for which there seems to be some evidence with respect to NAFTA.

        Qualitatively, the US has comparative advantage in all regions in differentiated producer
goods (e.g., capital equipment) – though it is less marked in Japan -- and comparative
disadvantage (except for chemicals) in standardized producer goods (e.g., metals) and consumer
goods of all sorts. The producer-goods patterns are very stable over time, and appear in both
aggregated and disaggregated data. The consumer goods patterns are, however, both highly
volatile and remarkably uneven across groups of trading partners and at different levels of
aggregation.



3
 Both Kreinin and Plummer (1994a,b) and Hoekman and Djankov (1997) examine the difference between RCA
indexes defined for one particular region (East Asia and the European Union, respectively) and normal “global-
market” RCA indexes. Balassa and Bauwens (1988), Ch. 3, examine the determinants of regional/bilateral net
exports, but that is a very different measure of comparative advantage than Balassa’s pure export-based measure.
4
 Both traditional and modern trade theories allow for this, of course, explaining it by environmental factors that
range from cones of diversification (Schott (1998)), to global vertical specialization ((Hummels et al. (1998), Yeats
(1998)), to two-way trade within a differentiated-products sector. In some variants of two-way trade, however
(e.g., reciprocal dumping), the very conception of comparative advantage loses relevance, to say nothing of its
measurement.



                                                                                                                    2
       We were far less successful in detecting sectoral “niche” comparative advantage than
geographical “niche” comparative advantage. We expected higher and higher specialization as we
deepened sectoral disaggregation, rising over time with the advent of vertical specialization
(“outsourcing,” “fragmentation”)., as described in Hummels et al. (1998) and Yeats (1998). There
was only limited evidence for this among machinery and equipment exports, and not for
manufactures in general.


Background

       Indexes of Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) have a checkered history since Bela
Balassa developed them decades ago.5 They are arguably useful as one of the few formal ways of
measuring the sector identity and intensity of a country’s comparative advantage and
disadvantage. Yet their consistency with the most familiar theories of trade patterns has not
always been clear, despite Balassa’s efforts (see also Hillman (1980)). Like gravity equations and
Grubel-Llyod indexes RCA indexes are employed frequently but “don’t get no respect”!

        Even empirical properties of RCA indexes remain unexplored. For example, few
researchers have attempted to see if RCA indexes using a country’s import data alone suggest
similar patterns of disadvantage and advantage as RCA indexes using the same country’s export
data alone.6 Likewise, trade-based RCA indexes could be compared to production-based RCA
indexes7 to see if a consistent story emerges.

        Finally, only a few researchers have calculated RCA indexes by regional groupings of a
country’s trading partners, in order to examine similarities and differences in the cross-regional
pattern. That is the chief purpose of our paper (and then see how these patterns vary with
aggregation).


What Do RCA Indexes Measure Anyway?

        RCA indexes measure a country’s comparative advantage, and do so in as fairly natural
way.
5
Balassa (1965, 1977, 1979, 1989), Balassa and Associates (1964), Balassa and Bauwens (1988), Balassa and
Noland (1988, 1989).
6
 We treat the issue of export-based vs. import-based concepts very briefly toward the end of the paper. Balassa
(1965), Balassa and Bauwens (1988), and Balassa and Noland (1988, 1989) all use imports to adjust exports either
linearly (“net exports”) or in ratio form. But imports alone give a uniquely different measure of comparative
advantage, as we show below.
7
 In a world of similar preferences, production-based or value-added-based RCA indexes would be very reasonable
measures of comparative advantage. In practice, the requisite data are hard to compile. For recent examples,
however, relying on Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data, see Wolff (1998), using
manufacturing production, or Leamer (1997), using value-added. For an example using 1963 US data on inter-
state merchandise shipments, see Greytak, Richardson, and Smith, in process.



                                                                                                                 3
        A simple account is that an RCA index is a ratio of ratios -- specifically it is relative
relative trade shares. The two modifiers “relative” both belong in the sentence because the index
is attempting to evaluate comparative advantage, which is itself a relative relative concept -- the
relative competitiveness of one country’s industry to its other industries relative to global norms.

        To be more exact, a generic, export-based RCA index is the following (multiplied by 100),
using the US as a focus:

                                             US exports in sector i
                                            US exports in all sectors
                                            World exports in sector i
                                           World exports in all sectors

                                  ... in either a designated importer’s market,
                                                   or in a region,
                                              or for the whole world.

        As written, the measure corresponds naturally to colloquial and classroom challenges to
“tell me what the US has comparative advantage in ...!” The answer is sectors in which the index
is high. The index itself is the US share of i exports in US total exports relative to the world
counterpart. Equivalently8 it is the US share in world exports of i relative to the US share in
world exports of everything else (non-i). When it is greater than 1 (or 100), the US is a relatively9
heavy exporter of i, and is said to have revealed comparative advantage in sector i; when it is less
than 1, it is considered to have revealed comparative disadvantage.

          The index is not unique, however. Each bolded word in the definition signals an
important choice. Researchers must first define the sectoral boundaries captured by the word all.
Is it all exports of goods and services, a usually troublesome data series to collect? Or is it all
merchandise exports, a more available series? Or all manufactured exports?10 Next researchers
must decide how exhaustively to define the world of “peer” exporters captured by the word
world. Is it all exporters everywhere in the world, or only a group of close rivals, or perhaps
even a particular country against whom a researcher wants to assess US comparative advantage.
Finally researchers must be precise about the customer market. Is it US comparative advantage
in a single market that interests them? Or in a region? Or in the entire world? If regions are the
focus, for example, Europe and Asia, then researchers must be clear that the group of “peer”
exporters will be different for each region; peer exporters into a unified European market do not

    Relatively relatively.
10
  The trouble with these narrower but more widely available measures of all exports is that they would fail to
record comparative advantage accurately for a country that in reality had its exports principally in unrepresented
industries, for example in various services or raw materials, and had net imports of all sorts of goods, especially
manufactures



                                                                                                                      4
include European exporters; peer exporters into a unified Asian market do not include Asian
exporters.11

        The index is, however, quite robust. Export-based RCA and RRCA measures are not very
sensitive to growth and business-cycle differences across trading partners, which tend to affect
both numerator and denominator in the definition similarly. Nor, for the same reason, are they
sensitive to the height of trade barriers -- as long as it is across-the-board, nondiscriminatory
protection against all exporters into the market of that trading partner. They are sensitive to
discriminatory barriers against US exports, and may vary also to the degree that US exports vary
with US and foreign multinational-firm investment, outsourcing, etc. Likewise, export-based
RCA and RRCA measures are not very sensitive to across-the-board exchange-rate strength or
weakness of trading-partner currencies, but they are sensitive to unusual strength or weakness
against the dollar alone.


Data and Terminological Conventions

        In this paper we compare US export performance in 1980 and 1995 to that of 38 of its
largest trading partners and rivals. These 38 also form both the world of US peer exporters and
the markets (regional groups) in which US and peer exporters compete.12 We draw our export
data from Statistics Canada’s World Trade Data Base, which provides annual trade flow data
between countries as reported to the United Nations.

        We adopt several conventions in the terms we use. We will refer to cases of large distance
from 100 in our RCA measures as “sharp” or “strong” comparative advantage and disadvantage.
We will refer to variability over time in our RCA measures as “volatile” comparative advantage
and disadvantage, and variability over trading partners and closely related commodity groups as
“geographically diverse” and “sectorally diverse” comparative advantage and disadvantage,
respectively.

       We will describe the broad commodity classifications of the SITC (Standard International
Trade Classification) by nicknames, as follows:13
11
  The same difference exists when single-country markets are the focus. Peer exporters into the Japanese market
include everyone but Japanese exporters! Production-based RCA indexes, such as those in Leamer (1997) and
Wolff (1998), would not be subject to these differences, but neither could they be used to assess the comparative
advantage of US production relative to Europen rivals, for example, in Japan.
12
  Our selection of 38 large partners only was partly dictated by the cumbersomeness of dealing with the universe of
US trading partners. But it occasionally causes anomalies, such as a measured US comparative advantage in fuels
in Japanese markets -- the really big exporters of fuels to Japan (oil-producing countries) are not among our 38
country sample. We picked the countries according to several criteria: geographic location, size and importance in
US trade; spectrum of traded merchandise; and change over time. The 38 sample countries represent over 75 per
cent of the 1995 US trade. Areas that are not represented are most of Africa, Middle East oil exporting countries,
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, South Asia and Central America.
13
     A more careful description of what belongs in each is:

                                                                                                                    5
                  SITC 1-4: primary products
                  SITC 5-8: manufactures
                   SITC 5: chemicals
                   SITC 6: manufactured materials
                   SITC 7: machinery & equipment
                   SITC 8: finished manufactures

We will often find it helpful to describe SITC 5 and 6 as “standardized manufactures” and SITC 7
and 8 as “differentiated manufactures,” although both caricatures do some violence to the
diversity of the sub-products therein. We will also find it helpful to describe sub-aggregates of
these broad 1-digit classifications as sub-products or sub-categories, and to further identify these
as consumer goods or producer goods, depending on the dominant buyers, whether wholesalers
and retailers on behalf of households, or whether firms purchasing capital equipment and
industrial supplies for themselves.

       We explore US export patterns across trading partners, usually aggregating them into
regional groups. China and Japan are treated separately; the groups are described by the
following nicknames:
       EU 15: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and the United Kingdom
       Nafta: Canada and Mexico
       Latin 6: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela
       Tiger: Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan
       OthAs4: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, and Thailand
       Other: Australia, Egypt, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa


Highly Aggregated (1-Digit SITC) Patterns for All Merchandise

based RCA indexes at the one-digit SITC level for 1980 and 1995.

        RCAs. Table 1 reveals the familiar US comparative advantage with the rest of the
“world”14 in primary products (except fuels) and in manufactured chemicals, and the familiar
mixed pattern across other manufactures. In these other manufactures, the United States does
best in machinery and equipment, but shows comparative disadvantage in manufactured materials
and finished manufactures. Table 1 also shows that the world-wide cross-product pattern of

                           telecommunications, and transportation equipment

broad (1-digit) US comparative advantage did not change much between 1980 and 1995.15 The
correlation between the 1995 pattern and the 1980 pattern is 0.96, though lower (0.88) if the nine
observations are weighted by export shares.16

        RRCAs. In Table 2, these world-wide patterns are broken down into RRCAs – RCAs
across regional trading partners. There are noteworthy sub-patterns. The sub-patterns are least
parallel across trading partners in the differentiated-manufactures sectors (SITC 7 and 8), as
might be expected when the aggregates are not very homogeneous.17 On balance, measures of
both comparative advantage and comparative disadvantage are sharper for Asia than for the rest
of the world. The US “wins big” in some sectors and “loses big” in others against its export rivals
there.

        US comparative advantage in primary products and chemicals (SITC 0-4, 5) is especially
strong in Asia, far weaker in Europe, and often non-existent in the Western Hemisphere (where
US exports compete against other strong primary product exporters18). These regional cross-
market patterns are very stable between 1980 and 1995. Five of the first six cross-market
correlations at the right of Table 2 are above 0.87.

       US disadvantage in manufactured materials (SITC 6) is most pronounced in Japanese
markets in 1980, but vanishes by 1995, whereas in Latin American markets US disadvantage
develops and deepens over the same period. In Europe and China, US disadvantage in
manufactured materials is already deep in 1980 and deepens still more by 1995.19

       In machinery and equipment (SITC 7), US exports are sharply disadvantaged only in
Japanese markets, in both 1980 and 1995. In almost every other market the US is a

     Only food, beverages, and tobacco products show significant growth.
16
  Each of our tables provides summary measures for both weighted and unweighted observations. We generally
focus on the weighted summary measures in the text summary. Weights are for 1980 and 1995, the same years for
which RCAs are calculated. Sectors such as machinery and equipment (SITC 7) and trading partners such as the
European Union account for disproportionately large shares of U.S. exports.
17
     The patterns are also quite diverse across trading partners in fuels, SITC 3.
18
  The rival primary producer exporters would include the Latin6 in NAFTA markets, NAFTA rivals in Latin6
markets, and all other (unmeasured) Western Hemisphere rivals in both markets. In Europe, US export
performance is being assessed against Asian and other exporters. In Asia, US export performance is being
assessed against European and other non-Asian exporters. It may seem paradoxical that US comparative advantage
in Asia could be so much stronger than it is in Europe. But there may be no paradox. This relative strength is what
we would expect, for example, if US exports were highly competitive against European exports (in Asia and
elsewhere), but less competitive against Asian exports (in Europe and elsewhere).
19
  One possible cause of the strange pattern of diminishing US comparative disadvantage in Japan in manufactured
materials is US bilateral policy activism. Recurrent US pressure on Japan to open its markets to imports in such
products as wood products may have tempted Japanese buyers simply to substitute US suppliers for others. The
same pattern is somewhat less pronounced in the Asian Tigers (such as Korea), which were also subject to such
policy activism.



                                                                                                                 7
comparatively competitive machinery and equipment exporter in both years.20 However the
cross-regional diversity of US machinery and equipment exports was greatly reduced. That is, US
RCA indexes moved toward 1 (100) in almost every market between 1980 and 1995. Their
weighted dispersion21 fell by one third from 0.36 to 0.23.

        US disadvantage in finished manufactures (SITC 8) is most pronounced in China and
Southeast Asia in both 1980 and 1995, with some shift between the Tiger countries and the near-
Tigers (Other Asian 4).

        Regional RCAs can be used to detect trade diversion suggestively, if not definitively.
Table 2's NAFTA countries column can illustrate how. Trade diversion in Canadian and Mexican
markets would imply that each is relying more on US exporters after NAFTA in products that are
better produced in non-NAFTA countries. US comparative advantage in NAFTA markets would
thus shift toward “middling” categories; it would correspondingly decline for categories where it
was strongest before NAFTA.22 This pattern actually occurs in Table 2 -- US RRCA in NAFTA
markets is more concentrated on “middling” categories in 1995 and the top 3 RRCAs in 1980 all
decline by 1995 in NAFTA markets. But this pattern is much less distinct for manufactures alone
and within machinery and equipment at the 2- and 3-digit level of disaggregation summarized in
Tables 4 and 6.23



Modestly Aggregated (2-Digit SITC) Patterns for Manufactures

       The most interesting patterns at the two-digit level are in manufactures, so we neglect
primary products from here on.

       RCAs, Summary. Table 3 refines the picture of US world-wide comparative advantage
revealed in Table 1.24 Virtually all 2-digit sub-products show stable comparative advantage over

20
 The US had very mild 1980 and 1995 disadvantage in Europe and mild 1995 disadvantage in the Asian Tiger
markets.
21
  Our measures of dispersion are the standard deviations of the natural logarithms of the RCA indexes divided by
100 (so as to be centered symmetrically on zero). See Wolff (1998) or Leamer (1997), pp. 13ff., for favoring a
similar measure of dispersion, using logarithmic transformations of the RCA indexes, in order to avoid the
skewness implicit in a ratio of ratios that is centered on 100 or 1, limited in downward variation to zero, but
unlimited in upward variation.
22
 The nature of the index is that if “competitive advantage” rises in some categories compared to others,
comparative advantage must rise in the first and fall in the second.
23
  In Table 4, although 9 out of the top 11 NAFTA RRCAs decline by 1995, so do all 11 of the “middling” RRCAs.
In Table 6, although all 12 of the top NAFTA RRCAs decline by 1995, so do 9 out of the 12 “middling” RRCAs.
24
  In Table 3, “all categories” in the definition of the RCA index refers to all manufactured exports; whereas it
refers to all merchandise exports in Table 1.



                                                                                                                   8
time.25 For those goods with fairly standardized specifications and production processes (SITC
51-69), US patterns of comparative advantage and disadvantage are also quite uniform across
sub-products. But in differentiated goods (SITC 71-89), US patterns of comparative advantage
and disadvantage vary diversely across sub-products. The US tends to have stable comparative
advantage in producer-goods sub-categories,26 fairly stable comparative disadvantage in
consumer-goods sub-categories,27 and reversal of comparative advantage between 1980 and 1995
in the one sub-product on the margin of producer and consumer goods, computers and office
machines (SITC 75).

        RCAs, Detail. More exactly, Table 3 reveals remarkable uniformity of comparative
advantage across various types of chemical products (SITC 5), and of disadvantage across
various types of manufactured materials (SITC 6). Finished manufactures (SITC 8) shows more
diversity, as expected of differentiated sub-products. But it is explicable diversity. The US has
strong comparative advantage in instruments (SITC 87), the one producer good among finished
manufactures. It has comparative disadvantage in all the consumer goods, sharpest in luggage,
apparel, and footwear (SITC 83-85), and less sharp in everything else. Machinery and equipment
(SITC 7) seems to show even more diversity, but it, too, is explicable, and falls into the same
pattern as finished manufactures. The US has strong comparative advantage in capital equipment
-- industrial machinery and in transport equipment except road vehicles (SITC 71-74, 77, 79). It
has comparative disadvantage in the largely consumer-goods categories, household electronics
(SITC 76) and road vehicles (SITC 78, largely autos).

       These sub-product patterns are very stable between 1980 and 1995 with just a few
important exceptions. The most noteworthy is the reversal of US comparative advantage in
computers and office machines (SITC 75). US comparative advantage also falls modestly for
medicinal and pharmaceutical products (SITC 54) but rises modestly for fertilizers (SITC 56).
US comparative disadvantage becomes less marked in iron and steel (SITC 67).

         An apparent change between 1980 and 1995 is a moderate evening out of US comparative
advantage across the 34 2-digit manufacturing sub-sectors. Believers in increasing sectoral
“niche” specialization might expect the opposite28 Sectoral niche specialization shows up only a
little better at the 3-digit level for machinery and equipment below. Increased sub-product

25
  The correlation coefficients recording this inter-temporal stability are about the same or higher at the 2-digit level
as at the 1-digit level. See Hoekman and Djankov (1997), p. 475, for a similar finding that the inter-temporal
stability was similar at their 4-digit level of disaggregation to that at a 2-digit level.
26
  Producer goods are taken to include all sub-categories of SITC 7 except computers, telecom, and road vehicles
(SITC 75, 76, 78), plus instruments (SITC 87).
27
  Consumer goods are taken to include telecommunications equipment (a large part of SITC 76, though SITC 76
also includes equipment that is a producer good) and autos (the bulk of SITC 78, which also includes trucks, buses,
and motorcycles), plus all of SITC 8 except instruments (SITC 87).
28
 Proudman and Redding (1997, p. 23) find a very similar decline in their measure of RCA dispersion for British
and German exports from 1970 to 1993.



                                                                                                                      9
specialization is far less pronounced there, however, than increased regional specialization, seen in
increased cross-regional dispersion of the RRCA indexes between 1980 and 1995.

       RRCAs, Summary. When these world-wide patterns are broken down across trading
partners in Table 4, there are noteworthy sub-patterns.

       First, the comparative success of US exporters does differ dramatically from market to
market, in ways that do not match simple explanations such as proximity or lingual ties.
European economic centrality and preferential trade policies do, however, seem to make typical
US RCA indexes lower there than elsewhere.

        Second, sometimes patterns of US comparative advantage change rapidly over time,
especially in China, and especially for consumer goods.

       Third, the US has stable global comparative advantage in most varieties of differentiated
producer goods, but in Japan stable disadvantage (as if US exports of differentiated producer
goods faced discriminatory market barriers,29 as often alleged).

       And, finally, in more standardized producer goods, though US patterns of comparative
advantage and disadvantage are stable over time, they are more mixed across trading partners,
with comparative advantage in some markets and disadvantage in others, depending on product
group.

        RRCAs, Detail. In standardized manufactures (SITC 5 and 6), US patterns of
comparative advantage are surprisingly different across trading partners, both qualitatively and
quantitatively. In chemicals sub-products (SITC 51-59), US comparative advantage is strong
across the board in both 1980 and 1995, except in Europe. But it is exceptionally strong in Asia
(except China),30 often ranging above 200. US comparative advantage in paper and wood
products (SITC 63 and 64) and in non-ferrous metals (SITC 68) is also exceptionally strong in
Asia -- in 1995 especially – and usually non-existent (US disadvantage) elsewhere. In iron and
steel (SITC 67), US export performance in both 1980 and 1995 ranges from strong comparative
advantage (in OthAs4) to strong comparative disadvantage (in Europe and Japan).

        In differentiated manufactures (SITC 7 and 8), there are several varieties of pattern. The
first two varieties characterize producer goods and seem very stable over time. The second two
varieties characterize consumer goods and are chaotic.

            Variety 1: Stable patterns across time, common across trading partners. Instruments
            (SITC 87) shows strong patterns of US comparative advantage for every set of trading
            partners, in both 1980 and in 1995.


29
     Especially relative to exports back to Japan from Asian affiliates of Japanese companies.
30
     In China, US chemicals comparative advantage is quite different across sub-products and quite volatile over time.



                                                                                                                   10
        Variety 2: Stable patterns across time, diverse across trading partners. Producer goods
        other than instruments show stable comparative advantage over time, but diversity across
        trading partners. Non-electrical industrial machinery (SITC 71-74) shows strong patterns
        of US comparative advantage in both 1980 and in 1995 for every set of trading partners
        except Europe and Japan.31 Electrical machinery (SITC 77) shows reasonably strong US
        comparative advantage in both 1980 and 1995 everywhere except Asia. In Asia the main
        exception to temporal stability is China, where US comparative advantage in electrical
        machinery in 1980 becomes strong disadvantage by 1995.32

        Variety 3: Changing patterns across time, diverse across trading partners. Computers and
        office equipment (SITC 75) shows strong patterns of US comparative advantage for every
        set of trading partners in 1980, but the comparative advantage remains in 1995 only for
        non-Asian regions; in Asia, US advantage has turned to marked disadvantage.

        Variety 4: Chaotic patterns across time and trading partner. Consumer goods categories
        (SITC 76, 78, 81-84) all reveal quite erratic patterns, with the exception of footwear and
        photographic apparatus (SITC 85, 88).33


Less Aggregated (3-Digit SITC) Patterns for Machinery and Equipment

        To see whether patterns of comparative advantage become even more interesting at the
three-digit level, we selected machinery and equipment (SITC 7) for deeper analysis. That sector
is both large and tempting as a venue for national industrial policies. The very disaggregated
region-by-region export data is, however, unfortunately suspect in the early years for China and
emerging Asia, and also for office equipment (SITC 75) and road vehicles (SITC 78).

       RCAs. Table 5 refines the picture of US world-wide comparative advantage in machinery
and equipment.34 The US has strong and consistent comparative disadvantage in the three
consumer goods categories (SITC 761-762 and 775, radios, televisions, and other household
equipment). Among producer goods, the US has strong, stable comparative advantage in some

31
  This pattern is consistent with both Japan and Europe importing preferentially from other countries in our data
set. For Japan, such preferential spheres of influence seem likely to include most other Asian exporters; for
Europe, such preferential patterns might be seen with exports from former colonies.
32
  This pattern might occur, for example, if US foreign investors in China displaced their previous exports to China
faster than rival exporters did.
33
  Footwear (SITC 85) shows enormous US comparative disadvantage, except in Asian “near-Tigers” (OthAs4) and
Tigers. US comparative advantage in photographic apparatus, optical goods, and watches (SITC 88) varies
dramatically across trading partners, but is reasonably stable except in Japan, where it declines precipitously from
strong advantage to strong disadvantage.
34
  In Table 5, “all categories” in the definition of the RCA index refers to all selected three-digit categories of
machinery and equipment, whereas it refers to all manufactured exports in Table 3, and to all merchandise exports
in Table 1.



                                                                                                                    11
categories, but not others. RCAs are high and stable for power-generating equipment (except
standard internal-combustion engines), pumps, heating and cooling equipment, agricultural and
specialized machinery, and aircraft. But RCAs are lower and less stable for machine tools,
electrical equipment, and producer goods for more mature, standardized industries (textiles,
paper, printing, railways, and shipping).35

       RRCAs. Across trading partners, the patterns in Table 6 for machinery and equipment
exports recall those of Table 4 for all manufactures.

        Producer-goods sub-products mimic “variety 2” above, stable over time36 (with some
exceptions), but very diverse across regional markets. That cross-regional diversity seems to be
increasing. The dispersion of US comparative advantage across trading partners increases
between 1980 and 1995 for 20 out of 32 producer-goods categories.37

        The three consumer-goods sub-products mimic “variety 4” above, chaotic over time and
regional market. In fact, the dispersions of US comparative advantage across trading partners for
radio and television exports are larger than those for any of the 32 producer goods, and the cross-
regional dispersion for household equipment is 6th highest among the 35 categories.

        There is some, though very limited, evidence of sectoral “niche” specialization. The
cross-product dispersion indexes rise between 1980 and 1995 in five of the eight regional
markets for US exports. But several (especially China’s) are suspect due to the poor quality of
the 1980 data. And though US comparative disadvantage becomes sharper for machinery and
equipment in the Asian Tigers between 1980 and 1995 (part of a niche specialization story), US
comparative advantage does not. Nor is there any evidence of increasing sectoral niche
specialization in US exports of machinery and equipment to Europe or Japan.


Addendum: Using Import Data Alone.

       Our RCA indexes in this paper are based on US export data alone. Comparative
advantage is measured by US versus rival export performance in world and regional markets.
Comparative advantage is signaled by indexes that are greater than 100.

        But comparative advantage might also be signaled by RCA indexes based on US import
data alone. In contrast to export-based measures, these would measure the relative

35
  Moenius and Riker (1998) find that sectoral patterns of US trade in machinery and equipment (SITC 7) are far
more volatile over time than in other sectors. Intervening years between 1980 and 1995 may indeed reveal patterns
of similar volatility, especially because those years marked a period of exceptionally strong real exchange values
for the dollar, especially weak Latin American markets relative to those elsewhere in the world.
36
     The correlations between 1980 RRCAs and 1995 RRCAs drop considerably from their two-digit counterparts.
37
 In Table 4, only 18 of the 34 2-digit sub-manufactures showed increasing cross-regional dispersion between 1980
and 1995.



                                                                                                               12
competitiveness of foreign exporters in US markets. By analogy to the construction above, the
import-based measure would be the share of industry i in total US imports divided by the share of
industry i in the rest-of-the-world’s total imports. US comparative advantage would be signaled
by RCA indexes that were less than 100. If the rest of the world in these measures were to
include just a sub-set of peer importer countries, then we would have the import-based
counterpart to the focus of this paper, our RRCAs, Regional RCA indexes. For example, relative
to its NAFTA partners, the US would be said to have comparative advantage in sector i if its
import shares of i were lower than those of Canada and Mexico (relative to its import shares of
everything else).

         It is not clear that the export-based and import-based measures would (or should) reflect
the underlying reality of US comparative advantage in a parallel way. The most important reason
is that the markets in which US comparative advantage is being measured differ -- non-US
markets in one case, US markets in the other. Export-based US RCA measures would be
expected to differ from import-based US RCA measures, therefore, for precisely the same reasons
that RRCA measures differ across the various trading-partner markets. There is a second reason
the measures will differ. With a trading partner where two-way trade was high, both the export-
derived RCA and the import-derived RCA might be above 100, signalling simultaneous
comparative advantage and disadvantage. The problem is actually in the concept, not the
measure; the apparently anomalous measures are accurately reflecting the intrinsic ambiguity of
any concept of comparative advantage where two-way trade is high.
