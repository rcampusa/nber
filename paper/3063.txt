                 HOW RATIONAL IS THE PURCHASE OF LIFE INSURANCE?


                                    ABSTRACT



     This paper examines whether middle age American households purchase
adequate amounts of life insurance. The analysis is based on SRI
International's 1980, 1982, and 1984 surveys of the financial positions of
American households. Our findings indicate that a significant minority of
American wives are highly under—insured with respect to the possible deaths of
their husbands. Under the assumption that actuarially fair annuities are
available we find that just over 30 percent of wives are inadequately insured,
by which we mean they would suffer a loss in their rate of sustainable
consumption of at least 30 percent in the event of being widowed. If one
assumes that annuities are not available the fraction of wives who are
inadequately insured is 24 percent. These findings on inadequate life
insurance are even more striking if one focuses on those households in which
over half of the couple's present expected value of resources is dependent on
the husband's survival. The fraction of wives in such households who are
inadequately insured is 41 percent if one assumes fair annuities are
available, and 31 percent if one assumes annuities are unavailable. The
problem of inadequate insurance is even more significant among households of
more modest means. Almost half of wives in such households who are in need of
life insurance protection are inadequately insured, and this statement holds
regardless of whether fair annuities are available. The results of this paper
together with those of the related literature strongly suggest that raising
the share of social security benefits that are paid to surviving spouses as
well as increasing in employer—provided group life insurance could have a very
considerable impact on the alleviation of poverty among widows, especially
elderly widows.

I. Introduction

     In 1987, a total of 7.1 trillion dollars of life insurance (measured at

face value) was held by U.S. households. Yet, despite this large aggregate

figure, there remains the question of whether insurance purchases are

appropriate to individual circumstances. The familiar adage that life

insurance is "sold, not bought" suggests a certain lack of information on the

part of households concerning the function of life insurance and the

appropriate level of coverage. How well households meet their insurance needs

is an extremely important policy issue for it influences not only the

incidence of poverty among widows, particularly elderly widows, but also the

efficacy of social insurance schemes aimed at alleviating such poverty. If

poverty of widows is merely an extension of their poverty while married, then

social insurance aimed at the general problem of poverty may be most

appropriate. However, if poverty among widows is attributable to insufficient

insurance purchases by deceased spouses, then survivor insurance is the more

appropriate policy response.

     This paper asks whether households act rationally in purchasing life

insurance. It extends our earlier analysis of this issue (Auerbach and

Kotlikoff, 1987) through the use of a considerably richer data set and by

considering the possibility that annuities are unavailable or too expensive to

warrant its purchase. The new data are SRI International's 1980, 1982, and

1984 surveys of the financial positions of American households. While our
                                     —2—

previous results were limited to young elderly households whose heads ranged

from 58 to 65 in age, the present paper considers younger households whose

heads are between 35 and 55 years old. Younger households are likely to have

a greater fraction of their remaining lifetime resources tied up in human

wealth and, as a consequence may be in greater need of life insurance.

     The findings in this study reinforce our previous finding about the

pervasive inadequacy of insurance coverage. Under the assumption that

actuarially fair annuities are available we find that just over 30 percent of

wives are inadequately insured, by which we mean they would suffer a loss in

their rate of sustainable consumption of at least 30 percent in the event of

being widowed. If one assumes that annuities are not available the fraction

of wives who are inadequately insured is 24 percent. These findings on

inadequate life insurance are even more striking if one focuses on those

households where the husband has no employer—provided group coverage and where

the wife is at risk; "at risk" refers to a situation in which over half of the

couple's present expected value of resources is tied up in income streams

contingent on the husband's survival. The fraction of such wives who are

inadequately insured is 41 percent, if one assumes fair annuities are

available, and 31 percent, if one assumes annuities are not available. This

degree of under—insurance suggests irrational decision—making or, at a

minimum, imperfectly informed decision making.

     The new data set has some special information bearing on the failure of

households to insure adequately. The data indicate the way in which life

insurance is obtained (provision of group insurance through employers versus

individual purchase) and the frequency with which individual life insurance

policies are updated. These data can be used to determine whether provision

by employers of life insurance affects the total level of coverage and the
                                       —3—

diligence of individual households in determining how much insurance to

purchase. We find that group coverage does positively affect the level of

total coverage; households with group policies are somewhat more adequately

insured than those without, although over 26 percent of households with group

policies still have inadequate coverage. The fact that households with group

coverage are somewhat better insured is not surprising since many at risk

households without group coverage hold little or no insurance and/or have not

updated their insurance coverage for several years.

     The data on adjustment of individual life insurance policies is quite

telling. Just over 60 percent of the sample of all husbands and 63 percent of

those husbands with no group insurance report they have not changed their

individual life insurance policies in the last 5 years. Given that the data

cover a period of rapid inflation, this seems prima facie evidence against a

view of rational insurance purchase.

     The paper proceeds in the second section with a brief summary of the

findings of our previous paper and a discussion of several related papers.

Section III discusses our method for assessing the adequacy of life insurance

assuming the availability of actuarially fair annuities as well as life

insurance. Section IV indicates how the method for assessing the adequacy of

life insurance needs to be modified if annuities are not available.

Specifically, we use a dynamic programming algorithm to deal with the case

that annuities are not available and present results both for the cases that

annuities are and are not available. Section V describes the SRI data and the

construction of key variables. Section VI presents our findings on the

adequacy of insurance, and Section VII concludes the paper.



II. Literature Review
                                      -4-

     The literature bearing on the adequacy of life insurance is, to our

knowledge, rather limited. It appears that each of the relevant studies has

focused on the elderly, and each has used the Retirement History Survey. As a

group these analyses support a conclusion that inadequate purchase of life

insurance is an important explanation for the poverty of elderly widows.

     As in this paper, Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987) consider the adequacy of

life insurance by examining changes in the affordable standards of living of

hypothetical widows before and after the hypothetical deaths of their

husbands. Auerbach and Kotlikoff also consider changes in living standards of

actual   widows. Their procedure involves comparing I) the constant and equal

consumption streams that could be guaranteed for both the husband and wife,

when they are both alive, if the couple purchased the appropriate amount of

life insurance with 2) the constant consumption stream that an actual or

hypothetical surviving widow would be able to finance based on the resources

she has or would have upon the actual or hypothetical death of her spouse.

These comparisons i.ndicated that a quarter of all actual and hypothetical

elderly widows and almost one half of the subset of these women who are at

risk are significantly under—insured for the death of their husband in the

sense that their affordable consumption stream did or would decline by at

least 25 percent.

     In addition to examining in this manner the adequacy of life insurance

holdings, Auerbach and Kotlikoff construct a' econometric model of life

insurance demand and test whether the purchase of life insurance, inadequate

though it may be, is influenced by the determinants suggested by economic

theory. For example, do couples with most of their resources tied up in

income streams that are contingent on the husband's survival purchase more

life insurance than couples for whom this is not the case? Econometric
                                      -.5—


analysis of the demand for life insurance produces many results that are

strikingly at odds with theoretical predictions. One example is the

prediction that couples should offset government provision of survivor

insurance through social security by reducing their own holdings of life

insurance dollar for dollar. In contrast to the theoretical one—for—one

offset, Auerbach and Kotlikoff report essentially no private offset to

government provision of survivor insurance.

     A subsequent study by Hurd and Wise (1987) considers the high incidence

of poverty among widows and asks whether a widow's poverty status arises as

the direct result of the death of her husband. The authors show that this is

definitely the case; they point out that while only 9 percent of their sample

of couples (in which the husband subsequently dies) are poor, approximately 35

percent of subsequent widows in this sample are poor. One problem with the

Hurd and Wise paper is that they compare poverty status based on income

immediately before and immediately after the husband's death. As Burkhauser,

Holden and Myers (1986) point out, surveys often incorrectly measure income in

the year a spouse dies by ignoring the income received by the decedent spouse

prior to that spouse's death. Indeed, according to Hurd and Wise the

transition out of poverty of widows after their first year of reported poverty

status is remarkably high. Hence, their analysis may overstate the number of

widows who become impoverished through the death of a spouse.

     In addition to examining changes in the incomes of new widows, Hurd and

Wise compare the wealth of the couples in their sample with the wealth of the

surviving widows from these couples. They point out that a large portion of

the representative couple's wealth, including the present expected value of

the husband's income stream, is lost when the husband dies. While this is

true, it is to be expected and doesn't necessarily reflect inadequate holdings
                                     —6—

of insurance; the reason is that when a family member dies the family's total

expenditures ought also to fall. To pin down the inadequacy of insurance one

needs to consider whether the wealth that remains after the husband dies is

sufficient to maintain the widow's prior living standard — a calculation that

Hurd and Wise fail to do. Notwithstanding this problem of interpretation, the

Hurd and Wise data do convey a strong impression of inadequate life insurance

holdings by many elderly couples.

     Two papers by Holden, Burkhauser, and Myers (1986) and Myers, Burkhauser,

and Holden (1986) that focus on the choice of pension survivor benefits also

lend support for the view of inadequate life insurance protection for actual

and potential widows. The two papers report that requiring all men with

private pensions to choose a survivor benefit option rather than a single life

annuity would have significantly mitigated the decline in living standards

experienced by surviving widows whose deceased husbands were covered by

private pensions.

     Finally, Lewis (1989) consider3 the demand for life insurance, but only

for 150 American households. His theoretical model collapses all future time

periods into one period and fails to take Into account the possibility that

dependents, particular spouses, may die prior to the death of the household

head. His empirical analysis depends on his particular assumptions about

preferences, while our findings and the findings mentioned above are

nonparaxnetric, i.e., they are independent of the particular structure of

preferences. Lewis reports that his model fits his data well, but it is

difficult to compare our results with his because of differences in

methodologies.



III. Assessing the Adequacy of Life Insurance when Annuities   are   Available
                                      —7—

     In this section we assume that households can purchase annuities at

actuarially fair rates; the next section considers the case in which annuities

are not available. The assumption that annuities are available and

actuarially fair may seem unrealistic given that very few American households

own private annuity policies. However, if one considers annuities that are

provided in the form of private pensions, the fraction of American households

with significant explicit private (non—social security) annuities rises to

well over 50 percent. In addition, many, and perhaps, most American

households may have implicit annuities provided in the form of insurance

arrangements between themselves and their children. As Kotlikoff and Spivak

(1981) point out, even a small number of children .r other r2.tives can hedge

almost all of the risk associated with outliving one's resources. Given the

risk—sharing capacity of families and the fact that disproving such risk—

sharing is quite difficult and has not occurred, the benchmark assumption of

perfect annuity insurance seems well worth considering.

    To determine whether household insurance purchases are adequate one must

measure the extent to which insurance reduces the impact of resource changes

associated with the death of a husband or wife. For example, consider a

family in which only the husband works and assume the wife would not work if

the husband dies. If the husband dies the consumable resources of the family

will be reduced due to the loss of his future labor and the possible loss of

pension income. They may also be reduced due to changes in the social

security benefits to which the family is entitled. At the same time, the

needs of the family will be lower, since the widow will require lower absolute

expenditures to achieve the same standard of living previously enjoyed by the

husband and wife. A simple test for the rationality of insurance coverage is

to compare the increase in resources provided by insurance on the husband's
                                     —8—

life (the difference between the face value and the cash value of all his life

insurance) with the additional resources (beyond her earnings, pension

benefits, social security benefits, and the couple's assets) his wife would

need to sustain her current standard of living in the event of his death. We

would expect husbands whose future labor income represents a significant

fraction of the present expected value of family resources to hold substantial

amounts of insurance. Wives in such families are clearly at risk in the sense

that inadequate life insurance purchases means a considerable decline in their

living standards in the event of their husbands' death.

     The definition of living standard is, of course, somewhat arbitrary. In

this paper, as in our earlier work, we define living standard as the sustained

level of consumption of goods and services that can be guaranteed given the

household's current assets and current and future labor income and net

government transfers. Calculating this level both before and after the death

of a spouse requires information on the couple's net worth, future labor

earnings, private pensions, and social security benefits when both spouses are

alive as well when one of the spouses is dead.

     The size of consumption streams that can be financed from a given amount

of resources depends on actuarial factors such as the interest rate, the

extent to which annuities are available, mortality probabilities, and

household economies of scale in joint consumption. Since many household goods

and services are consumed jointly, "two can live cheaper than one." That is,

a husband and wife may be able to enjoy the same standard of living at less

than twice the cost of this standard to a single individual. The greater is

the fraction of joint consumption, the greater the insurance needed to

maintain a given standard of living of a single surviving spouse. In the

extreme case in which all consumption is joint, it is necessary to insure
                                      —9--


fully each spouse's survival—contingent income stream in order to maintain the

surviving spouse's living standard. More generally, the necessary insurance

level would equal the present expected value of this income stream less the

reduction in necessary consumption spending occasioned by the individual's

death.

     Because we do not know precisely how much consumption is of the joint

type, we present calculations based on the conservative assumption that no

such economies of scale in consumption exist. This has the effect of

understating (perhaps greatly) the degree of under—insurance, since we assume

that, in event one spouse dies, family consumption spending can be cut in half

without the surviving spouse surfering a decline in living standard.

     The tables presented below that assume annuities are available compare

pre— and post widowhood (widowerhood) standards of living, where standard of

living is measured by the level annuity that could be financed with available

resources. More precisely, we calculate the combined present expected value

of resources of the couple befoLe the hypothetical death of a spouse and

compute the level annuity, Am, that could be purchased for each spouse based

on these resources and under the assumptions that annuities are actuarially

fair and that each spouse receives an equal annuity. Next, we determine the

annuity that could be afforded by the surviving spouse, A, based on the

surviving spouse's present expected values of life insurance including the

life insurance of the decedent spouse. The ratio of the second annuity to the

first annuity, (As/Am), which we refer to as the consumption ratio, is the

measure used for the adequacy of insurance. We characterize insurance as

inadequate only if this ratio is below .7.

     The annuities are calculated in the following manner. Let FVRm be the

present expected value of resources a couple has when both members are alive.

This variable equals:
                                          —10--




(1)               — NW +          +PVE + PVB   + PVBW   + PVSh +   PVSW
           PVRm            PVEh



In equation (1), NW stands for net worth, PVE for the present expected value

of earnings of husband (h) and wife (w), PVB stands for the present expected

value of each individual's social security and pension benefits, and PVS

stands for the present expected value of each individual's survivor benefits,

the additional social security and pension benefits received if the other

spouse dies. NW includes the cash value of life insurance.

       The effective term insurance amount, equal to the difference between face

and cash values of life insurance, does not appear in (1) because the

expression incorporates the assumption that insurance is actuarially fair.           In


this case, the present expected values of insurance proceeds and payments are

equal and hence cancel in the expression1 Even though the insurance coverage

does not appear directly in expression (1), the ability of households to

purchase insurance is implicit in the conversion of future survival contingent

earnings and benefit streams into components of total household wealth.

       Each of the present expected values appearing in expression (1) is based

on information regarding each household's earnings and social security

benefits, the assumed interest rate, and age— and sex—specific mortality

probabilities. The interest rates and mortality probabilities are also           used

to caiculate the annuities that each hounold could purchase for its members

with the present expected value of resources PVRm• If                and   are discount

 factors for husband and wife based on these variables, the actuarially fair

 level annuity for each that could be funded by PVRW is:




 (2)        Am — PVR./(Dh + Dw)
                                       —11—



      Expression (2) tells us how much each husband and wife could receive

annually if they used all their wealth to purchase equal annuities. However,

families can not convert future earnings streams of one member directly into

annuitized consumption for the other. It is here that life insurance plays a

role by permitting households to transfer resources from states in which a

member is alive to states in which he or she is not. The extent to which this

will be necessary may be seen by calculating comparable annuities for the

cases when either the husband or wife is assumed to die. Let



(3)             —
                     + PVE5 + PVB5 + PVS d


In this expression, the first four variables on the right hand side are as

defined in expression (1). Here, however, they are calculated for spouse s

assuming the spouse's mate d has died. This has no effect on the value of net

worth, but it does change the present expected value of the earnings and

benefit streams. For example, the present expected value of s's survivor

benefits increases, since they are no longer contingent upon the other

spouse's death. The present expected value of S's earnings and own social

security and pension benefits may change, too, if the labor supply behavior of

s depends on whether s is widowed. The final term in expression (3), 'd' is

the effective term value (face less cash value) of life insurance received

upon the death of d. Note that NW should be understood to include the cash

value of life insurance.

      As in expression (2), we may define the maximum level annuity that the

surviving spouse s can purchase with          by:
                                       —12--


(4)         A5 — PVRS/DS



where      is the same annuity discount factor that appears in expression (2)

for the spouse s, equal to Dh or D. Assume for the moment that 1d equals

zero. Then if Am exceeds A5, we may infer that d's life must be insured in

order to maintain a constant level of consumption for s (i.e, for As=Am).



IV. Assessing Insurance Adequacy when Annuities are Not Available

        In comparing the consumption annuities based on (2) and (4) we implicitly

assume that households can convert their present expected resources, PVRm and

 JR, into annuities on actuarially fair terms. While life insurance

purchases are commonplace, the market for private annuities is less well

developed.2 The lack of an annuity market or a close substitute would pose no

problem with respect to our analysis if the husband and wife have all their

resources tied up in equal and constant survival—contingent income streams.

For such couples these income streams are equivalent to annuities, and our

measured values of Am and A5 would equal the true values, where "true" refers

to what is feasible given the annuity market imperfection. On the other hand

if the couple or surviving spouse has resources not contingent on survival

(such as assets) Am and A5 will be overstated relative to their true values.

Am will also be overstated even in the case that all resources are    tied up in

survival contingent streams if one of the spouse's survival contingent income

stream exceeds that of the other. In this the case the couple effectively

needs to transfer, through life insurance, a portion of one spouse's survival

contingent stream (the one that is larger) into a nonsurvival contingent

resource in order to secure an equal consumption stream for the spouse with

the smaller income stream. Since the true values of both Am and A may be
                                              —13—

less than their measured values if annuity markets are imperfect, the measured

ratio of A to Am based on the assumption that fair annuities are available

may under— or overstate the true ratio.

        In the case that annuities are unavailable the constant and equal (for

both spouses) lifetime consumption stream, Am, that can be afforded for the

couple must be calculated using dynamic programming. In contrast, the

affordable consumption stream for the surviving spouse, A5, in the absence of

annuities can be calculatea using the formula in (4), but taking the numerator

in (4) to be the present value (discounting only by the interest rate) of the

surviving spouse's resources and takirg the dnominator in (4) to be the

present    value (discounting only by the interest rate) discount factor.3
       Our calculation of Am when annuities are not available proceeds as

follows. First we write, in equation (5), the budget constraining the size of

the constant affordable consumption stream, denoted                     of the couple if they

both live to their maximum length of life.

      To use (5) to help calculate Lhfll, the husband's purchase of life

insurance on the husband's life (make Lhn_1 positive) if the wife is also

If we subtract (9) from (6) and subtract the analogous equations for the case

the wife dies prior to the husband we find:


(10)        Lh2 — (R_1rh l)Lh 1 —                      +
                                                           ehfll
                                                                   —
                                                                       S1 — A
            L2 —    (R—w1)1 — hn—ln—l + e1 — Shfl 1 — A
Together with (7) and (8), the equations in (10) suggest a dynamic programming

algorithm for solving for Am when annuities are not available. The algorithm

starts by choosing a guess for the value of A.m Given this guess and our

estimated values of non—asset income and survivor benefit streams, we use

equations (7) and (8) to determine the period n—i purch- of lif insurance

assuming the derived values of Lhfll and              are nonnegative. If either or

both of the derived values are negative we have a situation in which the

couple would like to purchase one or more annuities. In this case we set the

values of Lhnl and\or L.1 equal to zero; i.e., when a derived demand for

life insurance is negative we constrain its purchase to be zero.

       Given the nonnegative values of          and          we calculate nonnegative

values of Lhn2 and L2 using (10) and the rule that any negative derived

demand for life insurance is set to zero. Since the first order difference

equations (10) relating life insurance in two adjacent periods holds for any

two periods we can use (10) to calculate nonnegative values of life insurance

for the husband and wife at each period between zero and n. However, these

calculated values of the time paths of life insurance purchases depend on the

guess of Am and the initial guess of Am may not satisfy the budget constraint

given in (5). Hence, we insert into (5) the calculated paths of life

insurance purchases based on the initial guess of Am and use the resulting

equation to solve for a new value of Am We take as our second guess of Am a
                                       —16—

weighted average of the first guess and this value and procedure to calculate

a second time path of life insurance purchases. We continue with this Guass—

Seidel iteration until the guessed value of Am equals the calculated value of

Am i.e. until we reach a fixed point. In implementing this algorithm we

assume that life insurance can be purchased on an actuarially fair basis,

hence we set lrh and       equal to R1 times the respective probabilities of

the husband and wife dying in period i conditional on surviving through period

i—i.




V .    Data

Sample Selection
       Our data come from three waves of the Survey of Consumer Financial

Decisions conducted by SRI International. The surveys were conducted in 1980,

1982 and 1984, and are attractive because of the detailed information on

assets and insurance and the oversampling of wealthy households. While there

is some overlap among households covered by the three cross sections, there

are few families for which usable records are available for more than one

year. Therefore, our analysis simply pools the observations from the three

waves of the survey. All variables are measured in constant 1985 dollars.

        We consider only families in which both husband and wife are present in

the household, the husband is working, and in which the husband is age 35 to

55. Given the method of reporting household income data, several records had

to be eliminated due to our inability to distinguish between husband's and

wife's labor income. The labor incomes of the husband and the wife are not

separately reported in the surveys. Rather the surveys report total labor

income and the share of total (labor plus nonlabor) income received by the

husband, wife, and others. In selecting the sample we eliminate records in
                                      —17—

which the income shares do not add up to 100 percent. We also delete

observations in which the head's labor income is $5000 or less.

     These sample selection criteria leave a total of 1243 observations: 447

from 1980, 439 from 1982 and 357 from 1984. Refore turning to our results we

briefly review the construction of variables needed to calculate the present

expected values in expressions (1) and (3) and the consumption annuities in

(2) and (4).



Net Worth

     The SRI data include a fairly completed list of assets and liabilities.

The asset data include the market values of ownership of businesses, real

estate (including one's home), stocks, bonds, money market funds, checking and

savings accounts, business enterprises, and annuities IRA/Keogh accounts,

value of autos, RVs, boats, planes and tangible assets, employer—provided

pension plans (available only for 1980 and 1982), and the cash value of life

insurance. The liabilities include real estate mortgages, other home related

loans, loans for autos, RVs, boats, planes, investment secured loans, all

unsecured and other loans, borrowing on lines of credit, cash value loans, and

credit card balances.



Present Expected Value of Earnings

     Unfortunately the surveys report only current labor earnings. For our

base case we assume that future earnings through age 65 (the assumed

retirement age) equal current earnings adjusted for growth for both husbands

and wives; hence, wives who are not working at the time of the survey are

assigned human wealth of zero in the base case. As this assumption may bias

our findings toward insurance inadequacy, we also consider alternative
                                      —18—

assumptions concerning wives' future earnings. The assumed rate of growth of

real earnings is zero percent. This assumption of a zero growth rate of real

earnings biases our results toward a finding of greater insurance adequacy.

To form the present expected value of human wealth for both the husband and

wife we discount future real earnings streams at a 5 percent real rate of

interest and apply the sex—specific mortality probabilities reported in Faber

and Wade (1983).

     The projection of future earnings based o. current earnings may, of

course, under— or overstate the individuals' true present expected value of

earnings. The implication of this measurement problem for assessing insurance

adequacy is particularly acute for wives who report they are not working at

the time of the interview. Such wives may normally be in the labor force or

may actively be engaged in unmeasured but valuable home production at the time

of the survey. Alternatively, such wives may intend to work in the future if

their husbands died. In either case, our estimate of the annuity ratio for

hypothetical widows will overstate the problem of inadequate insurance.

Hence, in addition to the base case, we consider two other assumptions about

the future earnings of wives who report zero earnings. The first is that

wives with zero reported earnings earn in each year in the future an amount

equal to the earnings level predicted by a regression relating the earnings of

working wives to their characteristics.5 The second is that wives with zero

reported earnings earn zero while their husbeiLids are alive, but go to work if

their husband dies earning the amount predicted by the working wives' earnings

regression.



Pens ions

     Unfortunately, there is very limited information in the survey concerning

private pensions and what information is available is available only for 1980
                                        —19—

and 1982. For these years the questionnaire contains information on the value

of employer pension plans, which we include in our measure of net worth for

those years. These data appear to understate the amount of pension wealth.

Since most pensions during this period did not offer automatic joint survivor

benefits this understatement of pension wealth is likely to understate the

need for life insurance by understating the resources lost upon a husband's

death.




Taxes

        In calculating the present expected values of the husband's and wife's

future labor earnings, we reduced the projected stream of annual labor

earnings by 20 percent. While this is a crude calculation it appears to be in

the right order of magnitude for at least middle income households. The 20

percent figure, by the way, is meant to include both average federal income

taxes, average employee social security taxes, and average state and local

taxes. The 20 percent figure may be a bit high for low income (relative to

our data) households, but if so, this will, by reducing the size of human

wealth, lead to an overstatement of insurance adequacy for such households.

For higher income households the simple 20 percent average tax rate adjustment

may lead to a small overstatement of insurance inadequacy. Given that the

problem of inadequate life insurance is most severe for poorer households this

assumption appears to bias the findings toward greater insurance adequacy.



Present Expected Value of Social Security Benefits

        The construction of social security wealth is based on projected past as

well as future earnings streams of the husband and wife. Given these earnings

streams we followed Social Security law as amended in 1983 in determining the
                                      —20--

amount of retirement, dependent, and survivor benefits available to each

spouse under each mortality contingency of the husband and wife. Each

individual's future Social Security benefit is determined based on the

individual's projected future and past earnings. The projected past earnings

are determined by taking current earnings and reducing them in real terms

according to the historical rate of growth of real compensation per hour in

the business sector reported in The Economic Report of the President 1987.

      Our procedure for computing social security wealth takes into account

that each spouse's completed earnings history will depend on that spouse's

date of death. This is important for computing the present expected value of

survivor benefits when both members of the couple are still alive; for

example, the survivor benefit available to a surviving wife at say age 66 will

be based on a short earnings history if the husband died at a young age and a

long earnings history if the husband died in his 60s. Our method of

calculating survivor benefits properly adjusts for the probability that a

spouse will die at an early age and, as a result, have a short earnings

history.



Insurance

      All three of the SRI surveys ask about the husband's and wife's

individual insurance and the husband's group insurance. However, only the

1982 and 1984 surveys report the wife's group insurance.



VI.   Findings
Characteristics   of the Data

       We begin with a table that provides an overall picture of the composition

of household resources in the sample. Each column in Table I provides a
                                        —21—

 percentage breakdown of the resource variable PVRm      for   families in a

 particular wealth range, starting in the first column with those families

having between 100 thousand and 250 thousand dollars of total wealth6 (4

percent of the sample) through those having between 250 and 500 thousand

dollars of wealth (29 percent of the sample), between 500 thousand and 750

thousand (36 percent of the sample), between 750 thousand and 1 million

dollars (18 percent of the sample) and more than I million dollars (13

percent). The table also displays for each wealth class the average face

values of insurance for husbands. The face value of insurance coverage is not

a component of a couple's overall wealth, PVR.m.    We   provide the insurance

numbers to offer some initial insight into the patterns of insurance
                                                                               coverage
and adequacy.

        The table indicates several patterns regarding the composition of

resources. First, the fraction of resources accounted for by net worth

increases with total resources, rising from 10 percent for those with total

resources of 100—250 thousand to 33 percent for those with resources above 1

million. Second, the fraction of total PVR. accounted for by wives' human

wealth also increases through the first four categories. The sum         of    these two

components increases throughout, from 17 percent for the lowest resource group
to 43   percent for the highest. Since these are the two major components of

resources that do not decline when a husband dies, there is clearly a greater

need for insurance to protect wives' consumption   at    lower wealth levels. An
examination   of insurance coverage, however, does not reflect this greater

need. While husbands' human wealth accounts for 55       percent   of family

resources for the lowest resource group, declining to 50 percent for the

highest resource group, the ratio of husbands' insurance to overall resources

is 8 percent for the first group and 14 percent for the latter. Note that for
                                     —22—

the lowest resource group only 15 percent of the husband's human wealth is

insured on average. The corresponding figure for the highest resource group

is 28 percent.

     Table 2 presents the distribution of observations by age and PVRm

category. Among younger households, whose heads are age 35 to 39, insurance

on the husband as a percentage of PVRm is similar to that for the entire

sample except for the lowest PVRm class. For the five different PVRm classes

starting with the lowest, husbands' life insurance is 10 percent, 9 percent, 9

percent, 11 percent, and 17 percent of PVRm. The corresponding percentages

for the subsample age 50 to 55 are 5 percent, 8 percent, 9 percent, 11

percent, and 15 percent.

     Table 2 also indicates the fraction of households in each cell who are at

risk, where at risk means that over half of the household's PVRm consists of

income flows that are contingent on the husband's survival. Finally, it

reports the fraction of households with positive life insurance on the

husband's life. The table indicat.s that most (74% for the entire sample)

households are at risk, and most (86% for the entire sample) have insurance on

the husband's life. Among households falling in the lowest three PVRm ranges

the cell fraction at risk often exceeds the cell fraction with insurance on

the husband,




Analysis of Insurance Adequacy

Hypothetical Widows Assuxnjn Annuities are Available

     In Table 3 we assume the availability of actuarially fair annuities and

present consumption ratios for hypothetical widows under the base case

assumption that future earnings equal current earnings adjusted for growth. A

total of 15 percent of the potential widows have an annuity ratio (A5/A,) of
                                     —23—

less than .5; 30 percent have a ratio below .7. Inadequate insurance holdings

is more prevalent among the lower PVRm groups. Of the 410 hypothetical widows

from households with PVRm less than $500,000, 19 percent have consumption

ratios below .5, and 38 percent have ratios below .7. In contrast only 6

percent of the potential widows in the highest PVR.. have a ratio less than .5,

and only 17 percent have ratios below .7.

     The degree of measured insurance inadequacy depends on our estimate of

the future earnings of nonworking wives. Table 4 shows the implications for

the distribution of consumption ratios of assuming that wives with no reported

earnings earn an amount predicted by an earnings regression both 1) when the

husband is alive and when he is dead and 2) only aLer he is dead. Under the

first alternative assumption (all wives always work) the percentage of widows

with ratios below .7 drops from 30 percent in the base case to 19 percent.

Under the second assumption (all widows work) the percentage below .7 totals

16 percent. While substantially smaller than the base case numbers, these

figures still suggest an important minority of hypothetical widows are

underinsured.

     Tables 5 and 6 repeat Tables 3 and 4, but for 888 of the 1243 (71

percent) women who are at risk. Under the base case earnings assumption 20

percent of women at risk have consumption ratios below .5; 41 percent have

ratios below .7. These figures can be compared with the 15 percent and 30

percent, the corresponding percentages for the entire sample in the base case.

If one assumes that nonworking wives always work upon the deaths of their

husbands, the fraction of wives with ratios below .5 drops from 20 percent to

6 percent, and the fraction below .7 drops from 41 percent to 23 percent.

     In constrast to the earlier tables, Tables 5 and 6 seem more relevant to

the issue of adequacy because they focus on those couples who have the
                                       —24—

potential to make the mistake of un&rinsuring. But some of those couples at

risk   may not be making a voluntary decision about purchasing life insurance

because their employers are providing them with life insurance. The subsample

who permit the clearest test of rational insurance choice is, therefore,

households in which wives are at risk, but which have no employer—provided

group life insurance. Table 7 repeats Table 6 for this subsample of 382

observations. The results are striking. The base case fraction of wives with

consumption ratios below .5 is 26 percent; the fraction with ratios below .7

is 51 percent. In other words, slightly more than half of households who need

insurance and are not forced to hold insurance by their employers are

inadequately insured. The fraction of this sample that is inadequately

insured remains quite large even under the assumption that widows return to

work; in this case 31 percent of the 382 wives have consumption ratios below

.7.




Consumption Ratios of Hypothetical Widows When   Annuities   are Unavailable

       Table 8 analyzes insurance adequacy when annuities are unavailable. The

calculations are based on the dynamic programming algorithm of Section IV.

Table 8 should be compared with Table 3; while Table 3, which assumes

annuities are available, reports that 15 percent of wives have consumption

ratios under .5 and 30 percent have consumption ratios under .7, the

respective figures in Table 8 are 11 percent and 24 percent. Table 9 also

assumes annuities are unavailable, but considers wives who are at risk. This

table should be compared with Table 5. In Table 5, 20 percent of wives have

consumption ratios below .5, and 41 percent have ratios below .7. The

corresponding figures in Table 9 are 15 percent and 31 percent. Hence, the

assumption that annuities are unavailable mitigates somewhat the picture of
                                     —25—

insurance inadequacy, but even if one assumes that annuities, both explicit

and implicit, are completely unavailable almost a third of wives who need

insurance are inadequately insured. The picture of inadequate protection is

particularly clear for poorer wives. According to either Tables 5 and 9

almost half of wives at risk who fall in the lowest two resource categories

have consumption ratios below .7.



Hypothetical Widowers

     In Table 10 we again assume that actuarially fair annuities are availab1

and present the base case consumption ratios for the complete sample of

hypothetical widowers based on the 1982 and 1984 surveys. Recall that the

1980 survey fails to ask about the wife's group insurance. Hence, there are

only 796 observations, which corresponds to the entire sample of 1243

observations less the 447 observations for 1980. The results in Table 10 are

also quite striking. Almost 90 percent of hypothetical widowers have

consumption ratios above 1.25. Llearly, there is no evidence of inadequate

insurance for this sample of husbands. Quite the contrary; the evidence

indicates that despite the advances of females in the labor market, husbands

remain the principal earners. While these numbers are sensitive to the

assumption of whether or not currently nonworking wives work in the future,

even if one imputes earnings for wives who report no earnings and assumes

wives always work, the fraction of husbands with consumption ratios below .7

is less than 1 percent. This assumption does, however, significantly reduce

the fraction of husbands whose ratio exceeds 1.75.



Adjustment of Individual Life Insurance Policies

     Table 11 reports by age and PVR the fraction of the complete sample of

husbands who report changing their individual life insurance policies within
                                        —26—

the last five years. It also reports the fraction of recent adjusters for the

subsample that does not have group insurance. In total only 40 percent of the

sample reported altering their individual life insurance policies within the

last five years. For middle age men between 45 and 54 the fraction is even

smaller —   less   than 30 percent. The data suggest that people purchase their

insurance in their 30s and then fail to adjust their holdings for quite a

while. Given that the data cover a period during and immediately following a

rapid inflation, these figures are even more surprising.

     Those with group insurance may not need to adjust their insurance as

often as those without group insurance. The extent of adjustment for the

subsample of men who do not report group insurance is only marginally larger.

Of the 542 men who do not have group insurance only 46 percent report changing

their coverage within the last 5 years.



OLS and Probit Estimation

     Table 12 reports OLS and Probit regressions that "explain" who holds

inadequate amounts of insurance. We use the word "explain" cautiously because

some of the variables in these regressions, such as the group insurance

dummies, are, arguably, endogenous. The dependent variable in the OLS is the

wife's annuity ratio defined using current earnings and assuming fair

annuities are available. The probability at issue in the Probit is the

probability that the wife's annuity ratio is less than .70. The regressions

include dummies for education, sex, the husband's occupation, and the wife's

working status. They also include the ages of the husband and wife and the

level of PVRm•

     There are a number of significant regressors in the OLS regression. The

dummy for working wife suggests that the fact that a wife works raises,
                                       —27—

ceteris paribus, her annuity ratio by almost .33. The variable WRAT       that
captures the ratio of the household's net worth to its PVR.   indicates    that

increasing the net worth share by .10 would raise the annuity ratio for the

surviving    wife by .14. The education dummies indicate that less educated

households are somewhat less adequately insured than better educated

households. Households with only group insurance or with some group insurance

have larger consumption ratios; however, the size of the group dummies is not

overwhelming. The fact that the group insurance dummy for those households

with both group and nongroup insurance is significant suggests, in and of

itself, that such households are not adjusting their insurance optimally at

the margin. If they were, they would fully offset the provision of group

insurance by their employer dollar for dollar by reducing their own positive

purchase of individual life insurance. In this regard it is worth pointing

out that of the 672 households reporting group insurance, 196 have only group

insurance.

     Surprisingly, nonwhite wives are more adequately insured than are white

wives. This may reflect a more equal division of labor income within nonwhite

households. Also surprising is the finding that those with more young

children are less adequately insured than those with fewer children, Compared

to the omitted group, households in which the husband is either a blue or

white collar worker have less adequate consumption ratios. Finally, the

effects of age of the husband and wife on the adequacy of insurance coverage

are small.

     Table 13 uses Probits to evaluate the affect of changes in the exogenous

variables on the probability that insurance coverage is inadequate (defined

here to be an AS/Am for the wife less than either .7 or less than .5). The

table takes as its base case a couple in which 1) the wife's and husband's
                                     —28—

ages and PVPm equal the averages in the sample, 2) the wife works, 3) the

wife's education is that of a high school graduate, 4) the husband's education

is that of a high school graduate, 5) the husband is a blue collar worker, and

6) the couple is white. The table indicates in the first row the probability

of underinsurance for households with these characteristics and then considers

changes in each of these characteristics holding the other characteristics

fixed. The table can easily be used to read off the effect of changes in

explanatory variables on the probability of underinsurance.

     Changes in the wife's work status clearly has a very large effect on the

probability of underinsurance; the switch from working to nonworking status

raises the probability that the annuity ratio is less than .7 from 21 percent

to 71 percent. Other variables have less dramatic, but predictable effects on

the probability of underinsurance. For example, if the wife has less than a

full high school education, she is more likely (by almost 3 percentage points)

to be underinsured.



VII. Conclusion

     The findings in this paper suggest that somewhere between 30 and 40

percent of middle age American wives in need of life insurance protection are

quite poorly insured. While this estimate may be biased upward because of

errors in forecasting the earnings and remarriage potential of wives, it is

biased downward because of the lack of adjustment for the economies of scale

in shared living associated with marriage (two can live cheaper than one).

Two additional reasons that the estimate may be biased downward are first,

that we have made no adjustment for the consumption requirements of young

children, and second, that we have excluded, because of the lack of data, most

pension benefits. On balance, we believe our estimate of insurance inadequacy
                                     —29—

understates the problem of inadequate life insurance holdings of American

households. In addition, our estimate is an average across wealthy households

and those of more modest means. For lower income households our estimate is

that almost half of those wives in need of life insurance protection are

inadequately insured.

     The results of this paper together with those of our previous study and

the related literature strongly suggest that increased levels of social

security survivor insurance as well as ini.reases in employer—provided group

life insurance could have a very considerable impact on the alleviation of

poverty among widows, especially elderly widows.

                                     Notes


1. This could easily be generalized to the case of a fixed loading based on
the insurance amount, in which case this additional cost would be subtracted
from the present expected value of resources. For the sake of simplicity we
do not pursue this issue here.

2. As demonstrated by Yarn (1966), the purchase of an annuity is formally
equivalent to the sale of life insurance and vice versa. The fact that there
is a well developed insurance market in the U.S. means that the market for
sales of annuities is well developed. In contrast, the market for purchases
of annuities is quite thin. The two markets are, however, segmented. Those
selling annuities (buying life insurance) tend to be young and middle age,
while those interested in buying annuities (selling life insurance) are older
individuals. One possible explanation for the poor functioning of the annuit\
purchase market compared to the life insurance purchase market is that adversE
selection due to asymetric information is a greater problem in the annuity
purchase market.

3. In the case of a surviving spouse with no access to           and who does
not wish to borrow against future earnings or other income, the spouse must
arrange his or her consumption such that if the spouse lives till the last
possible date of life the realized present value of the spouse's consumption
equals the realized present value of the spouse's resouces where both of thes€
present values are calculated as of the time the spouse becomes a widow or
widower. Hence, even though the surviving spouse faces lifespan uncertainty
the budget constraint is the same as that which arises if the spouse lived
till the last possible date of life with certainty. The intuition here is
that the spouse must consume t..king into account the possibility of living to
the last period in which case the present value budget constraint just
described can not be violated.

4. The social security survivor benefit depends, in general, on the age at
which the decedent spouse died because the age of death affects the decedent
spouse's earnings record. Our calculations of survivor benefits take this
feature of social security into account. However, to ease notation we do not
index S and Shi by the age at which the spouse dies.

5. These characteristics are a polynomial in age, education dummies,
occupation dummies, number of children.

6. In our sample there are no households with total resources below 100
thousand dollars.

7. The word explain is placed in quotations because not all of the right hand
side regressors, for example the group insurance dummies, are necessarily
exogenous.
