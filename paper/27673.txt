                                        ABSTRACT

This article reviews the global health and economic consequences of the 1918 influenza
pandemic, with a particular focus on topics that have seen a renewed interest because of
COVID-19. We begin by providing an overview of key contextual and epidemiological details as
well as the data that are available to researchers. We then examine the effects on mortality,
fertility, and the economy in the short and medium run. The role of nonpharmaceutical
interventions in shaping those outcomes is discussed throughout. We then examine longer-lasting
health consequences and their impact on human capital accumulation and socioeconomic status.
Throughout the paper we highlight important areas for future work.

1       Introduction

    The COVID-19 pandemic took the world by surprise. While the first documented
case was in December of 2019, it would take just three months before the World Health
Organization would declare that COVID-19 was a pandemic. At the end of its seventh
month, official estimates indicate that 17.3 million have been infected. Of those 17.3
million cases, COVID-19 is officially responsible for nearly 700,000 deaths. These
statistics are despite much of the global economy shutting down in hopes of controlling
the spread. As of July 2020 the pandemic continues with no clear end in sight, and so
these statistics also underestimate the pandemic’s ultimate health toll.
    As the COVID-19 pandemic has unfolded, many are drawn to the parallels with the
1918 influenza pandemic. Both are respiratory diseases caused by a virus, could spread
from casual close contact, and reached most parts of the globe within months. The case
mortality rates for both pandemics are higher than a typical seasonal influenza, with
the 1918 influenza pandemic killing tens of millions worldwide. In both pandemics,
non-pharmaceutical interventions like social distancing and mask wearing were used
to control the spread, though in 1918 the restrictions were far less stringent. These
parallels have renewed interest in understanding the health and economic effects of the
1918 pandemic as a way of inferring something about the future.
    This article surveys the literature on the 1918 influenza pandemic, with a particular
focus on understanding its health and economic effects.1 We review the evidence on
the following questions: How many people did it kill? What were the determinants
of pandemic severity? How did the pandemic affect the economy? How did it affect
fertility? Were there long-lasting effects on health and human capital development?
    1
     We do not review other global pandemics, such as the black death, cholera, or HIV/AIDS. For
reviews on these topics, see the other review articles in this issue. We also do not review the literature
on other influenza pandemics, such as the influenza pandemics of 1890-1891, 1957-1958, 1968, or 2009.
While these pandemics have the potential to enhance our understanding COVID-19, they are beyond
the scope of this review.

                                                    1
Throughout the article, we highlight where papers disagree, perhaps because of differing
methodologies, data sources, or geographic focus.
    COVID-19 has renewed interest in the economics of the 1918 influenza pandemic,
and consequently, many papers we review are working papers. We include these papers
in this review, as they now make up a substantial portion of the economics literature
on the 1918 pandemic and some already have over 100 citations. While some of the
papers may evolve, the working papers that appear in this article were selected because
of their potential to aid our understanding of the economics of COVID-19.
    The first lesson from 1918 is that the health effects were large and diffuse. We
may never know the true mortality consequences of 1918 because of incomplete or in-
accurate record keeping, issues that also undermine our ability to quantify the impact
of COVID-19. The 1918 pandemic likely killed 50 million people, with some esti-
mates suggesting the death toll could be as high as 100 million. There was substantial
variation in the intensity of the pandemic with population density, air pollution, and
non-pharmaceutical interventions playing an important role in determining pandemic
severity. While 1918 was deadly, most that contracted the virus survived. But survival
does not mean that individuals fully recovered. The evidence suggests that in 1918,
those that survived the initial infection faced an elevated mortality risk and some phys-
iological conditions never fully healed. The range of lingering health effects for those
that contract COVID-19 and survive remains to be seen. The cohort in utero during
1918 grew up to be in worse health and of lower socioeconomic status. This finding
is consistent with the broader literature on the fetal origins hypothesis (Almond and
Currie, 2011).2 This literature suggests that the in utero effects of COVID-19 warrant
attention by future researchers.
    The second lesson from 1918 is that it caused an economic contraction, reducing
   2
     The fetal origins hypothesis is the idea that environmental shocks that occur while in utero impair
biological development, generating a wide range of latent effects.

                                                   2
both GDP and employment. Businesses and schools temporarily shut down in many
places, although those shutdowns were less stringent than what occurred in the spring
of 2020. Many studies disagree on the size of the contraction and how long the effects
lasted. Some suggest the economy recovered by the time the pandemic was over,
whereas others argue that the economy recovered in 2 to 3 years. The literature points
to an underlying mechanism of a negative labor supply shock, as working-age adults
had unusually high mortality rates. With COVID-19, working-age adults are among
the most likely to survive. It is thus unlikely that COVID-19 will generate a similarly
sized negative labor supply shock.
   The biggest challenge in estimating the effects of the 1918 pandemic are poor data
quality as well as the existence of concurrent events. While many important data
sets exist, many modern data sets begin shortly after the pandemic and others were
collected at irregular intervals. The 1918 influenza pandemic also coincided with the
end of WWI. The war disrupted economies across the globe. Even neutral countries
were affected, either because of increased demand for their goods or because of the
disruption in trade networks. The deployment of millions of young men, as well as
widespread death and dismemberment of both civilians and service-members, has its
own effects on the economy. These issues, at times, hinder making conclusive inferences.
   The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 discusses the origins of the 1918 pandemic,
as well as its spread, attempts to limit the spread, and its duration. That section also
highlights important contextual details, such as the independent effects of WWI as well
as the prevalence of infectious disease at the time. In Section 3 we review what data
are available during this period and the challenges of working with these data. We also
present some preliminary evidence from data sources that we believe are underutilized.
Section 4 explores the health effects as well as the leading evidence for why some regions
were hit so much harder than others. The literature on economic effects is discussed in


                                            3
Section 5. Section 6 explores the impact on fertility. Section 7 reviews the long-lasting
health consequences of the pandemic, with a particular emphasis on understanding
whether in utero exposure permanently impaired health and labor market outcomes.
Section 8 discusses issues that are of modern importance but for which there is limited
historical evidence or limited historical parallels. Section 9 concludes.



2     Background

    There is a substantial amount of uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.
How long will it last? What is the true mortality rate? Will there be lingering health
or economic effects? When faced with this level of uncertainty it is tempting to look
to history for guidance. Among the set of historical pandemics and epidemics to
consider, the 1918 influenza pandemic is appealing for two reasons. First, the 1918
influenza pandemic is the most recent historical event to match or exceed the scale
of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, the 1918 pandemic occurred after a series of
improvements in data collection and preservation. Because of these improvements, the
1918 pandemic offers a unique opportunity for comprehensive and systematic analysis
across a wide range of countries. While the COVID-19 pandemic has many important
parallels with the 1918 pandemic, there are also important differences. The remainder
of this section provides an overview of similarities and differences in the context, the
severity and duration of the pandemics, and specifics of the two viruses.


2.1    Context

    One key difference between the two pandemics is that quality of life and overall
life expectancy were much lower in 1918 than today. Cities in the 19th and early
20th century were polluted and the risk of contracting and dying from an infectious


                                            4
disease was high (Costa, 2015).3 Throughout the 20th century, a series of innovations
brought about dramatic improvements in health and longevity that many have come
to expect. Cities discovered and invested in new technologies to eliminate waterborne
diseases like cholera and typhoid fever (Alsan and Goldin, 2019; Ferrie and Troesken,
2008; Beach et al., 2016). Sulfa drugs were discovered in 1930, providing the first
effective treatment for infectious diseases (Jayachandran, Lleras-Muney and Smith,
2010). Many cities would adopt pasteurization standards and other milk ordinances
to improve the quality of milk supplies. Life expectancy conditional on surviving to
age 10 increased from 47 in 1900 to 57 in 1940. By the year 2000, that figure would
increase to 67 (Costa, 2015).4 The value of a statistical life in the United States was
between 600,000 and 800,000 dollars (1990 U.S. dollars) in 1920, but by the year 2000
the value would increase to somewhere between 6 and 8.7 million dollars (Costa and
Kahn, 2004).
    The experience of New York illustrates that epidemics were not out of the ordinary
during the early 1900s. Figure 1 plots death rates in New York City from 1804 to
1930. Between 1917 and 1918 New York City’s crude mortality rate increased by 3.173
deaths per 1000 persons. While tragic, the hollow circles in Figure 1 depict 12 other
years where the year-over-year increase in mortality exceeded the magnitude of the
1917 to 1918 change. During the cholera epidemics of 1832, 1834, 1849, and 1854
the year-over-year increase in mortality was 3 to 5 times larger in magnitude than
what occurred in 1918.5 As another comparison, the mortality rate in New York City
was higher in nearly every year between 1800 and 1905 than the mortality rate in
   3
      Costa (2015) provides an excelled survey on this literature. One literature that has emerged since
that article assesses the role of coal-fired air pollution. See, for instance, Clay and Troesken (2011),
Beach and Hanlon (2018), Hanlon (2018), and Clay, Lewis and Severnini (2019a)
    4
      While the patterns are striking, researchers continue to debate how much these innovations
contributed to the gains in life expectancy Perhaps the most intense debate is over the role of water
purification. See for instance, Cutler and Miller (2005), Ferrie and Troesken (2008), Alsan and Goldin
(2019) and Anderson, Charles and Rees (2020).

      The notable epidemics in Figure 1 come from (Bolduan, 1935).

1918. The experience of New York City is not unique. Many cities throughout history
were ravaged by the black death, yellow fever, smallpox, and cholera. During the first
half of the 20th century, Black Americans in urban areas died from infectious disease
at a rate that was greater than what urban whites experienced during the 1918 flu
pandemic every single year (Feigenbaum, Muller and Wrigley-Field, 2019). In the year
1900 the leading causes of death in the United States were pneumonia, tuberculosis,
and diarrhea/enteritis, together accounting for 30% of all deaths. By the year 2000
the leading causes of death in the United States would be heart disease (31%), cancer
(24%), and stroke (7%). The only infectious disease to appear in the top 10 causes of
death in 2000 is pneumonia/influenza, which accounted for less than 5% of all deaths.6
What was perhaps most unique about 1918 was that it was global and that it occurred
following substantial improvements in our understanding of the causes of infectious
disease.
   A second key difference between the two pandemics is that the 1918 pandemic
arrived just as World War I (WWI) was coming to an end. WWI spanned from July
of 1914 to November of 1918. The war led to the mobilization of 70 million military
personnel, 9 million combatant deaths, and an additional 13 million civilian deaths.
The war disrupted most economies, due both to destruction as well as the diversion
of resources to help the war effort. Many countries saw production of key crops and
livestock fall by 50 to 75% relative to prewar levels (Nourse, 1924). The United States,
which remained neutral for most of the war, experienced a boom as the country tried
to meet wartime demand and a bust as the war ended. Many commodities saw prices
increase by a factor of 2 to 3 relative to prewar levels (Rajan and Ramcharan, 2015).
Labor demand increased in both cities, for manufacturing, and in rural areas, as 30
million acres of land were suddenly put into production. As Kitchens and Rodgers

    Population comes from the census and is linearly interpolated between census years. Note that
    data from 1804 to 1865 correspond to Manhattan only, data from 1866 to 1899 correspond to
    Manhattan and Brooklyn, and data from 1900 to 1930 correspond to the all five boroughs. The
    hollow circles denote a year over year increase in mortality that was greater than or equal to 3.173
    deaths per 1000 persons, which is what occurred between 1917 and 1918. The notable epidemics
    come from Bolduan (1935).




                                                                   7
(2020) show, marriages were delayed and fertility fell as women were brought into the
labor force. The United States entered the war just one year before the pandemic,
and in doing so the labor market was further strained as nearly 3 million men, or 7%
of the labor force, was mobilized (Rockoff, 2004; Kendrick et al., 1961). In short, the
pandemic arrived at a time of widespread disruption because of a worldwide war. The
existence of the war is important to keep in mind as it is often difficult to disentangle
the impact of the war from the impact of the pandemic.


2.2     Severity and Duration of the Pandemics

   The influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 was brief but severe. Estimates of the number
of worldwide excess deaths during the pandemic range from 20-100 million (Tauben-
berger, Kash and Morens, 2019). Barro, Ursúa and Weng (2020) estimate worldwide
deaths over 1918-1920 at 39 million, with a mean death rate of 2%. The range of es-
timates is a function of incomplete records and differing opinions about how to define
counterfactual mortality. Nevertheless, even the lowest estimate (20 million) is about
2.5 times the number of combat-induced deaths from World War I (Royde-Smith and
Showalter, 2020). The origins of the 1918 virus are also unclear, with studies suggesting
that the virus may have originated in France, China, or Kansas. Despite its uncertain
origins, the pandemic is generally described as having a number of waves. The first
less lethal wave was in the spring and summer of 1918. A second more lethal wave hit
many countries in September-November of 1918. Two-thirds of the mortality occurred
in 1918. A third wave hit in the spring of 1919. A fourth wave hit a few countries in
1920.
   The precise severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic are not yet clear.
One way to draw comparisons is to examine trends in cumulative mortality rates. Lin
and Meissner (2020) use total weekly deaths per 100,000 from influenza and pneumonia

                                           8
in 46 U.S. cities as a benchmark, since these are among the best high frequency data
available for the period. Cumulative death rates in 1918 went from 1.3 deaths per
100,000 persons to 100 deaths per 100,000 in about 30 days, growing at a constant
rate. As Lin and Meissner (2020) show, many countries saw a similar trend with
COVID-19 over the first 15 days, at which point the COVID-19 death rates have
since flattened and are lower than the 1918 cumulative mortality rates. Whether the
COVID-19 cumulative mortality rates remain lower than 1918 remains to be seen. At
the U.S. state level, COVID-19 death rates were fairly similar to 1918 death rates over
the first 20 days or so in the hardest hit states – New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts,
Michigan, and Louisiana. At the U.S. city level, where comparisons can be made for
the same city in both periods, cumulative mortality rates in the first 35 days in a subset
of cities, including New York City, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Newark are surprisingly
similar across the two pandemics.
   Lin and Meissner (2020) find that country COVID-19 mortality rates in the 42 days
since the first death are positively related to mortality in 1918 and negatively related to
the mortality rate from the 2002-2003 SARS pandemic.7 Some governments have had
experience with infectious disease such as SARS. Many governments, however, have
not had experience with outbreaks of infectious disease of this magnitude in decades.
This may have implications for public response and resistance to efforts to reduce the
spread of COVID-19. Recent governmental experience with infectious disease appears
to have led to a more effective initial response, at least for the first 42 days that the
authors study.




   7
     Le Bert et al. (2020) find that exposure to the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV-1 virus provides some
cross-immunity to SARS-CoV-2.

                                             9
2.3     Novel Highly Contagious Viruses

    Both pandemics involve the spread of a novel, highly contagious virus that induces
respiratory distress. With a novel virus, the consequences of infection are not fully
understood and the scope for medical intervention is limited. Both pandemics involve
viruses that attack the respiratory system, with the H1N1 strain of avian influenza
causing the 1918 pandemic and SARS-CoV-2 strain from the coronavirus family causing
the COVID-19 pandemic. Transmission is also similar, with a typical transmission
occurring by inhaling droplets generated from the coughs or sneezes of an infected
individual. H1N1 turned out to be a “founder virus” with variations of that strain still
circulating today.8 Whether SARS-CoV-2 will also become a “founder virus” remains
to be seen.
    Barry (2005), particularly in chapters 20 and 21, provides a detailed summary of
the pathology of the 1918 virus. As with other strains of influenza, symptoms in 1918
included inflammation of membranes in the throat, pharynx, and nose, as well as fever,
cough, headache, body aches, and exhaustion. Most victims would recover within 10
days. But influenza is transmitted so effectively that there were easily 100 million cases
with severe complications, and the complications were extreme. Some that survived
the initial infection would ultimately die after developing bacterial pneumonia. Today,
antibiotics would be used to fight bacterial pneumonia, but in 1918 antibiotics were still
in the future. Others would suffer from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In both 1918 and today, the only care for ARDS is to provide relief for the symptoms.
    Both viruses are highly contagious. The baseline reproduction rate in 1918 is es-
timated to be between 2 and 3, meaning that in normal circumstances each infected

   8
     In a 2019 review article Taubenberger, Kash and Morens (2019) state (p 1): “The founding 1918
pandemic virus is truly the “mother” of all subsequent influenza pandemics, and we are still in its
“pandemic era” today. Its descendants are still evolving, still killing tens of thousands of people every
year, with no end in sight.”

                                                   10
person is expected to infect 2 to 3 other individuals (Mills, Robins and Lipsitch, 2004).
Early estimates for SARS-CoV-2 suggest a similar level of contagiousness.
   Both SARS-CoV-2 and H1N1 induce respiratory distress. The viruses invade the
lungs, attaching themselves to epithelial cells. Once attached to those cells the viruses
begin to replicate. With H1N1, those cells would burst roughly ten hours later releasing
an additional 1,000 to 10,000 viruses, each capable of infecting other cells. The rapidity
of replication is so great that many victims in 1918 would die somewhere between the
5th or 6th generation. Barry (2005) writes of one healthy person that showed their
first symptom at 4:00pm and was dead by 10:00am the next day. With coronaviruses
the speed of replication is much slower, and so death often comes several weeks after
the first symptoms appear, as we have seen with COVID-19.
   As the viruses replicate they induce a commensurate immune system response. It
was the response of the immune system that was so deadly in 1918. The immune
system followed the virus to the lungs, and in an attempt to eliminate the virus, the
victim’s lungs filled with fluid and debris, limiting the exchange of oxygen. Death took
many forms. Oxygen deprived organs would begin to fail, the heart, strained from
trying to pump blood out of the lungs, might give out, or the victim could die when
muscles overworked from trying to breathe finally become exhausted and stop.
   The populations most vulnerable to COVID-19 differs sharply from 1918. The
1918 pandemic is known for the distinct W-shaped pattern that appears when plotting
age-specific mortality rates. As with many other infectious diseases, mortality rates
were high for the young and the old. Unusually, in 1918 mortality rates were also
high for young adults. Figure 2 plots the median difference in age-specific all-cause
mortality rates during the pandemic (1918-1920) relative to the average of the three
years immediately preceding and following the pandemic. The underlying data set
includes information from 13 countries, and the figure originally appeared in Murray


                                           11
et al. (2006). The high mortality that peaked at 25-29 was particularly notable and
tragic for individuals losing parents, spouses, and breadwinners. Males appear to
have had higher excess mortality than women. The reasons for the disproportionate
effect on prime-age workers and men continue to be debated (Taubenberger, Kash and
Morens, 2019). The two leading explanations relate to the strength of an individual’s
immunological response and cohort-level differences in exposure to other strains of
influenza. With COVID-19, the elderly are the most vulnerable population.9 The
differing mortality patterns of the viruses is an important caveat to keep in mind,
as the economic impact of a virus that disproportionately kills individuals that are
still in the workforce or still caring for children is likely to differ from a virus that
disproportionately kills the elderly.10
   Both viruses are characterized by limited scope for medical intervention and over-
whelming demands on medical resources. In 1918, medical responses were limited by a
lack of knowledge about the virus, existing medical technology, and doctor and hospi-
tal capacity (Jester et al., 2019). The main approach was to provide care that targets
the symptoms while the person recovered. In 1918, hospitals were overwhelmed. This
appears to have been a universal experience from Brazil to India to the United States
to U.S. military hospitals (Guimbeau, Menon and Musacchio, 2020; Ojo, 2020; Crosby,
2003; Byerly, 2010). As the death toll rose, morgues became overwhelmed and many
victims were buried in mass graves (Scanlon and McMahon, 2011). Although our
ability to provide symptomatic care today is greater than it was during 1918, many
hospitals have nevertheless found themselves with a shortage of doctors, hospital beds,
and ventilators. Hospitals and morgues were hard hit in locations like Italy and New
York City. As of this writing antivirals and vaccines are in development but are not

     This is not to say that the older adults do not contribute to the economy. Bloom et al. (2020)
finds that the market and non-market activities of older adults in the U.S. and Europe are on the
order of 7% of GDP.

 average age-specific mortality rate over the pandemic period (1918, 1919, and 1920) and subtract-

 rates are deaths per 100 people.

widely available. It takes time to develop vaccines for novel viruses, and it is worth
noting that vaccines were not developed in time to combat either the 1957-1958 or the
1968-1969 influenza pandemics (WHO, 2009).
    With limited scope for medical intervention, officials in both pandemics encouraged
the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions to help control the spread. These interven-
tions include the closing of schools, churches, and restaurants, as well as encouraging
mask wearing and hand washing.11
    The non-pharmaceutical restrictions in 1918 and 2020 differ in two important ways.
First, the restriction in 1918 were much less strict than the “shelter in place” restrictions
enacted in response to COVID-19. The second difference is that the use of these
interventions was likely more familiar in 1918 than today. Pandemics, epidemics, and
outbreaks of infectious disease were common, intermittent features of life prior to the
twentieth century, and so were attempts to control their spread. In towns with trade
connections, quarantine of ships, sailors, and goods was common after the 14th century,
although it was often incompletely enforced. Thus, the basic principles of quarantine
had been around for centuries (McDonald, 1951; Gensini, Yacoub and Conti, 2004).
The germ theory of disease was established and became widely known in the second
half of the 19th century (Mokyr and Stein, 1996). The germ theory helped public
health officials and many members of the public understand the importance of hand
washing and covering the mouth and nose to reduce transmission of tuberculosis, a
lesson that translated readily to influenza (Tomes, 1999, 2010).

3        Data on the Pandemic

     Before turning to the health and economic effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic,
it is perhaps useful to discuss issues related to data quality and data availability.
This section describes three main sources of data: data on mortality, which are used
to identify the severity of the pandemic, data on non-pharmaceutical interventions,
which are often used for assessing the efficacy of government intervention, and data on
economic activity, which are used to assess the impact of the pandemic on the economy
in the short- and long-run.


3.1      Mortality Data

     A fundamental issue in understanding mortality from both the COVID-19 pandemic
and the 1918 influenza pandemic is the lack of reliable mortality data.12 In 1918, some
countries had reporting systems in place for mortality for some or all geographic units,
but other countries did not. For example, India, the hardest hit country, had reporting
for many British-controlled areas. China, which is believed to have the second most
fatalities, had very little reporting (Cheng and Leung, 2007). The overwhelming rate
of deaths and limited capacity for testing and autopsies made classification difficult.
For instance, deaths from pneumonia in 1918 may have been incorrectly classified as
deaths from influenza or the converse. Political pressures can make it difficult to provide
accurate information in a timely manner. During the 1918 pandemic, many European
countries sought to protect morale among soldiers by suppressing information on the
spread of influenza, both throughout the country and on the front lines (Barry, 2005).
Spain did not face the same incentive to suppress coverage as they remained neutral
throughout WWI. Spain’s lack of information suppression likely contributed to the
    12
     Reliable case data is also of interest. Prior to 1918, in the United States at least, influenza was
not deemed important enough to collect morbidity data. This, of course, changed after 1918.

coinage of the term “Spanish Flu.”
   Because of the difficulty in accurately identifying deaths due to influenza and pneu-
monia, many scholars have turned to all cause mortality to quantify the effects in 1918.
Table 1 presents estimates of excess all cause mortality rates for 43 countries from John-
son and Mueller (2002), Murray et al. (2006), and Barro, Ursúa and Weng (2020). The
estimates differ substantially across sources, reflecting uncertainty in the effects and
differences in approaches to construction of the estimates.
   Although most countries have mortality reporting systems in place today, issues
around determining cause of death and political pressures around reporting are still
salient. One early factor in determining cause of death was the limited testing capacity
in many countries. Not every person suspected of having COVID-19 was tested before
or after death (Leon et al., 2020). Retrospective analyses of all cause deaths suggest
that many countries experienced excess mortality that was substantially higher than
reported COVID-19 deaths.13 This likely reflects two factors – under identification of
COVID-19 deaths and the failure of patients to seek treatment or hospitals to provide
treatment during the crisis for other health emergencies. Politicians may have reasons
for wanting to minimize the severity of the outbreak, whether measured in deaths,
hospitalizations, or positive tests for COVID-19.


3.2       Non-pharmaceutical Interventions

   While social distancing laws and guidelines are well documented during COVID-
19, they are not as well documented for the 1918 influenza pandemic. Many locali-
ties banned public gatherings, closed schools, or required masks, but researchers have
had to aggregate this information from several sources to generate databases on non-
pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). Another issue is that of compliance with social
  13
       The U.S. CDC now has a dashboard that reports weekly excess mortality.

distancing guidelines. Whereas researchers of the COVID-19 pandemic have made
novel use of cell-phone data to measure compliance, research on the 1918 compliance
with NPIs rarely goes beyond anecdotal evidence.14
   In 1918, many countries implemented quarantines of incoming ships, including Aus-
tralia, New Zealand, and South Africa (World Health Organization Writing Group,
2006). During the second and third wave of the pandemic, approximately one-third of
the ships arriving in Australia were determined to be “infected,” yet Australia only had
one-half the influenza death rate as the United States. Remote islands with quarantines
may have been one of the few places on earth to escape the pandemic. Quarantines
of ports may have been ineffective if influenza could still arrive by land. Quarantines
in African ports may have slowed, but did not prevent the arrival of the disease (Pat-
terson, 1983; World Health Organization Writing Group, 2006). While there are many
case studies of non-pharmaceutical interventions outside of the U.S., we are unaware
of any papers that aggregate these data into one data set, allowing for cross-country
regressions. This is a promising area for future research.
   The most commonly used data set on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in
the United States comes from Markel et al. (2007). They collected weekly mortality
data from 43 cities and then combined newspapers and government reports to obtain
non-pharmaceutical intervention dates for those cities. The NPI data in Markel et al.
(2007) have since been used by Barro (2020), Correia, Luck and Verner (2020), and
Lilley, Lilley and Rinaldi (2020). The NPIs include school closures, quarantines, and
bans on public assemblies.15 The authors then generate “total number of days” of
NPIs, where if a single calendar day had, for example, three NPIs implemented, that
day would count as three. Thus, a city that implemented one NPI for 30 days would be
  14
     One exception is Velde (2020) which uses street car revenue to measure social distancing.
  15
     Barry (2007) argues that Markel et al. (2007) incorrectly categorized New York City as hav-
ing implemented a quarantine. While the New York City Health Board announced its intention to
quarantine the sick, it is possible that such a quarantine never went into effect.

                                              18
recorded as having the same amount of social distancing as a city that had three NPIs
for 10 days, although it is likely that the two policies would have different effects on
the spread of influenza. Hatchett, Mecher and Lipsitch (2007) use data for a broader
set of NPIs, but for a small number of cities. It is worth noting that Markel et al.
(2007) limit their collection of NPI data to the 43 cities with weekly influenza data.
For many research questions about the medium and long-run effects of NPIs, annual
influenza data would be sufficient and it should be possible to collect NPI data for the
larger set of cities that have annual influenza data.
   Text mining analysis of newspaper archives may provide an opportunity to increase
the Markel et al. (2007) sample to include other cities. As a proof of concept, we exam-
ined the set of newspapers from the Chronicling America newspaper archive published
by the Library of Congress (LOC). In coordination with the National Endowment of
Humanities, the LOC supports state-level institutions to digitize regional newspapers.
Most states are currently represented in the sample. The archive focuses on news-
papers without active ownership that have ceased publication, which are papers that
are unlikely to be digitized in the absence of the LOC initiative. Thus, the sample of
newspapers available in the archive is not random and likely skews toward smaller and
more localized newspaper coverage.
   Figure 3 shows the number of newspaper pages that mention the word “influenza”
by month and region between September of 1918 and December of 1919. There are
more mentions of influenza in the South and Midwest than the West and Northeast,
but this likely reflects some regions having more digitized newspapers in the LOC
archive. Discussion of influenza mirrors the course of the pandemic. In all four regions
there are effectively no mentions of influenza in September of 1918 and then there
is a peak in coverage in October of 1918, the height of the pandemic. The number
of articles mentioning influenza declined throughout the spring and then we see a

     Figure 4 displays a map of the proportion of times am NPI-related word appears
within 50 words of the word “influenza.” Two words measuring NPIs are considered:
“mask” and “quarantine.” Each color represents a quartile, with darker shades rep-
resenting states in which the word “mask” or “quarantine” appears near “influenza”
more often. The sample suggests that states west of the Mississippi River were more
likely to mention masks or quarantines whenever “influenza” appears. Whether this
reflects greater promotion of NPI adoption or criticisms of those policies is an open

question.16 The western United States did experience relatively lower mortality rates,
which would be consistent with the efficacy of NPIs, but we hesitate to draw strong
conclusions from that correlation.

    Notes: The data are from newspaper pages from the Chronicling America newspaper archive
    published by the Library of Congress. The data are restricted to newspapers published between
    September 1st, 1918 to December 31st, 1919. The share of influenza articles is the number of
    pages for which “influenza” appears within 50 words of the NPI divided by the total number of
    pages in which “influenza” appears.


    A similar technique could be applied using data from the British Newspaper Archive
(www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk). This website represents an ongoing joint effort
by the British Library and findmypast to digitize 40 million newspaper pages from the

   16
      While the archive digitization is useful for identifying keywords, the search algorithm only identi-
fies the page in which the word appears not the specific article. Thus, analyzing the context of specific
articles would require substantial data cleaning and is beyond the scope of this exercise.

                                                   21
British Library’s extensive collection. Similar to the Library of Congress, the sample of
digitized newspapers tends to emphasize content from local newspapers. Despite this,
the resource is quite comprehensive. A search for “influenza” returns 23,039 articles
in 1918, 19,579 articles in 1919, and 8,549 articles in 1920. Interestingly, the coverage
of non-pharmaceutical interventions appears to lag the United States. The data from
the Library of Congress indicate that the share of articles mentioning “influenza” and
“mask” was 3.5% in 1918 and 0.9% in 1919. Among the articles appearing in the British
Newspaper Archive, just 0.77% of the influenza articles published in 1918 mention the
word “mask,” whereas 2% of the articles published in 1919 mention mask. A similar
trend appears with influenza and “ban” or “quarantine.”
   In summary, trends in the digitization of historical print sources present new oppor-
tunities for researchers to assess the role of NPIs in 1918. We have shown that, at least
for the United States and England and Wales, it is possible to construct a measure of
NPI for a large set of cities. These exercises illustrate that our understanding of the
role of NPI does not need to be informed entirely by the 43 U.S. cities that appeared
in the pioneering work of Markel et al. (2007).


3.3    Economic Data

   Economic data collected today are generally more reliable than in the past. How-
ever, the abrupt nature of the COVID-19 outbreak has presented several challenges to
data collection. Shutdowns have suspended in-person interviews in many places, and
there has been some recent controversy of whether to classify individuals who work for
temporarily shutdown businesses as unemployed. The data issues faced by researchers
interested in analyzing the 1918 pandemic are typically much more challenging.
   Annual GDP and consumption data are available for 42 countries from 1911 on-
ward from Barro and Ursúa (2010), although the data go back even further for many

                                           22
of those countries. Barro, Ursúa and Weng (2020) use these data to estimate cross-
country panel data regressions that we discuss in more detail in Section 5. Additionally,
many European countries have annual regional or district-level data on economic activ-
ity, including Sweden, Denmark, and Italy (Karlsson, Nilsson and Pichler, 2014; Dahl,
Hansen and Jense, 2020; Carillo and Jappelli, 2020). Most worldwide data sources are
at the annual level. The lack of monthly and quarterly data presents challenges to esti-
mating the effects of the pandemic, given that the pandemic was largely concentrated
in the last quarter of 1918.
   There are several U.S. macroeconomic time series spanning the pandemic including
real GNP, industrial production, and various employment indices. These time series
are analyzed by Velde (2020) and are discussed in Section 5. Unfortunately, many
macroeconomic time series begin shortly after the pandemic. Figure 5 displays the
number of monthly and quarterly time series that are digitized in the NBER Macro-
history Database. This database is also the source of many of the historical series that
appear in the FRED database published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
While there are a number of series that span the time of the pandemic, the number
of both monthly and quarterly series doubles between 1918 and 1921. Much of this
increase likely reflects the founding of NBER in 1920.
   Cross-sectional economic data during the pandemic are often lacking in the United
States. The most commonly used panel data set is the Census of Manufacturers,
which was taken every 5 years from 1899-1919, and every 2 years thereafter. The
Census of Manufacturers includes total manufacturing employment for U.S. states and
major cities, as well as total wages. That the data are only observed from 1914-
1919 presents several challenges in making conclusive inferences. Any difference in
employment observed between 1914 and 1919 may have occurred before, during, or
after the pandemic. It is uncertain whether the timing of employment changes is more

Luck and Verner (2020) and Lilley, Lilley and Rinaldi (2020).
   Although common measures of city-level economic activity are not available annu-
ally during this period, some annual city-level economic data do exist. For example,
building permit and cost data are available annually for most major cities from the
Statistical Abstracts of the United States. Figure 6 shows estimated costs and the
number of building permits for cities with below- and above-median pandemic inten-
sity from 1914-1925. The data are limited to a balanced sample of 93 cities for which
building permit data are available for all 12 years. We measure pandemic intensity as
the number deaths in 1918 relative to the predicted number of deaths in 1918. The
predicted number of 1918 deaths comes from a regression of the log of deaths on a
linear time trend, using data from 1900 to 1917.17
   Figure 6 shows that permits declined starting in 1917 for all cities, reaching a trough
in 1918, and returning to 1916 levels by 1919. The timing of this downturn is consistent
with resources being shifted away from construction toward war production and might
be unrelated to the pandemic. There is weak evidence that construction costs and
the number of permits issued were higher in below-median intensity cities relative to
above-median intensity cities, though the evidence is not compelling. Construction
is only one industry and may not be representative of the whole economy. However,
the graph does highlight how economic shocks can be missed with irregularly spaced
data. More research would need to be done to see if these preliminary results represent
robust causal estimates.
   As with NPIs, newspapers may provide an additional source for economic data.
Garrett (2009) reviewed two newspapers, The Arkansas Gazette in Little Rock and

  17
     This approach follows from Beach, Ferrie and Saavedra (2018). One could apply a similar tech-
nique to influenza deaths or deaths from influenza and pneumonia. Measuring pandemic intensity
with this variable yields similar qualitative conclusions.

data report the number of permits from 1914 to 1919 and the number of buildings from 1921 to
1925. Both are available in 1920, during which the correlation between the number of permits
and buildings is over 0.99. The number of permits does not always equal the number of buildings
because sometimes a single permit may cover multiple structures.

The Commercial Appeal in Memphis, for examples of how businesses coped with the
pandemic. Garrett documents that the newspapers reported that retail business de-
clined, often by one-third to one-half of usual sales. Industrial plants, railway service,
telephone companies, and coal mines were all operating below capacity as workers were
out sick. Of course, there is likely selection bias in which industries receive coverage in
newspapers.
    Newspapers may also be a useful source for explaining macroeconomic data. Baker
et al. (2020) examine next-day newspaper explanations for stock market jumps. They
identify 23 stock market jumps between March of 1918 (the first wave of the pandemic)
and June of 1920. In no single jump observation was the influenza pandemic cited as
the source for stock market volatility. Similarly, Bodenhorn (2020) uses ratings of
retail and manufacturing activity as reported in the business journals Bradstreet’s and
Dun’s Review. He finds that the pandemic decreased the rating of both retail sales and
manufacturing activity.



4     Health Effects

    This section begins by reviewing mortality worldwide, patterns of differences in
severity, and reasons for these differences, notably poverty. The analysis then examines
the United States. Its experience is well documented, and fighting during World War
I did not occur on U.S. soil.


4.1    Worldwide

    COVID-19 has infected millions worldwide and killed hundreds of thousands within
the first six months of the pandemic. As with influenza, pandemic severity has var-
ied across geographic units for reasons that are not fully understood. Thus far, the


                                            27
countries with the highest reported death rates per 100,000 have included high income
countries (Belgium, Spain, the UK, Italy, France, Sweden and the United States) as
well as middle income countries from Latin America (Brazil, Peru, and Chile).18 Al-
though mortality is positively related to per capita income at the country level, within
those countries, mortality appears to be negatively related to per-capita income once
the effects of population density are accounted for (Jung et al., 2020). That is, the
poor are experiencing higher mortality rates.
    The 1918 pandemic killed millions worldwide.19 The largest numbers were in India,
where the high fatality rate and large population combined to generate between 10 and
20 million deaths. Recent estimates suggests the number was 11-14 million (Chandra,
Kuljanin and Wray, 2012; Hill, 2011). China was next with between 4 and 9.5 million
deaths. In total, Asia accounted for 26-36 million deaths. Africa and Europe accounted
for 2.4 million and 2.3-2.6 million deaths, respectively.20 The Americas accounted for
about 1.5 million deaths. Oceania accounted for 85,000. Johnson and Mueller (2002)
estimate that there were 49 million deaths and that the total number could be as high
as 100 million. Other estimates such as Barro, Ursúa and Weng (2020) are somewhat
lower at 39 million. Given the limited evidence on mortality for important countries,
the total mortality will remain uncertain.
    Pandemic severity varied significantly across countries.21 For example, 4.4 to 6.1%
of the population in India died, while in Denmark fatality rates were between 0.2 and
0.4%. One way to visualize the scale of the effect is to examine the impact on life
expectancy. Period life expectancy is a statistic that reports how long we would expect

  18
      These rankings come from https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality. It is possible that an
excess mortality model, which would ignore official cause of death classifications, would generate a
different pattern.
   19
      The numbers, unless otherwise indicated, are from Johnson and Mueller (2002).
   20
      Ansart et al. (2009) estimates that there were 2.64 million excess European deaths.
   21
      Pandemic severity also varied within countries, an issue that we discuss further in the following
section.

                                                  28
someone would live if they were exposed to the mortality rate every single year. Figure
7 plots period life expectancy for 14 countries from 1900 to 1940.22 We highlight the
patterns for the countries that experienced the smallest and largest percentage change
in life expectancy between 1918 and 1919. Denmark experienced a 1.7% decline in
life expectancy whereas Italy experienced a 38.9% decline. Among these 14 countries,
average life expectancy declined by 17.6% between 1918 and 1919. This is depicted in
the figure with a black dashed line.
   An important question is why pandemic severity varied across countries. A leading
explanation is income or poverty. Using data for 27 countries, Murray et al. (2006)
regress country level severity on country income per head in 1918. They find that
income was negatively and significantly related to severity. A 10% increase in income
was associated with a 9-10% decrease in mortality. In the next section, which examines
evidence from the United States, city-level measures of poverty are positively related
to mortality.
   A related strand of the literature has used individual level data to examine mortality
by economic status and so provides insight into the pandemic’s effect on inequality.
Sydenstricker (1931) did pioneering work using detailed data for 100,000 individuals
in nine urban localities in the United States. Individuals of well-to-do and moderate
economic status experienced a mortality rate of 0.38%. Those of poor economic status
experienced a mortality rate of 0.52%, while the very poor experienced a mortality
rate of 1.00%. Mills (1986) finds that low-caste Hindus in Bombay City (modern
day Mumbai) had mortality that was 3 times higher than other Hindus and 8 times
higher than Europeans. More recent work by Mamelund (2006) using individual and
household level data has shown that controlling for other factors, apartment size, a

lived in two-room, three-room, and four-room apartments had 34, 41, and 56% lower

4.2     United States

   As of June 28, 2020, official numbers for the United States indicate that COVID-19
has infected over 2.5 million and has killed 125,000. Because of its large geographic
area, COVID-19 arrived in different locations at different times. The cities and states
that were the hardest hit early on have been experiencing declining infections and
death rates going into the summer. Other areas that were not as hard hit initially
are in some cases now experiencing rising infection and death rates. Poorer zip codes
are seeing disproportionately higher infection and death rates as compared to richer
nearby zip codes.
   Even in the United States, where historical data are more complete than many coun-
tries, estimates of mortality during the 1918 pandemic vary from 550,000 to 850,000.
The 550,000 appears to have originated with Collins (1945) and been reported by
Crosby (2003) as a conservative estimate. It is used by Patterson and Pyle (1991) and
more recently by Barro, Ursúa and Weng (2020). If the estimate for cities in Clay,
Lewis and Severnini (2019b) is scaled up to the United States, total mortality is esti-
mated to be about 615,000.23 Crosby’s main estimate is 675,000, which accounts for
the fact that the registration area did not cover the entire United States in 1918. This
number is used by Johnson and Mueller (2002). The 850,000 estimate appears to have

  23
     Whether rural areas were affected more or less than urban areas remains an open question. There
is suggestive evidence in Clay, Lewis and Severnini (2019b) and Acuna-Soto, Viboud and Chowell
(2011) that mortality rates may have been higher in rural areas. Paynter, Ware and Shanks (2011)
also finds soldiers from rural areas died at higher rates than soldiers from urban areas.

originated with Dauer (1957).
   Early observers noted that there was substantial variation in pandemic severity
across the U.S. and this led to many hypotheses regarding the causes of the variation.
These hypotheses focus on four determinants of excess pandemic mortality across cities:
i) measures of pre-pandemic health and poverty, ii) the use of non-pharmaceutical
interventions, iii) the timing of onset and proximity to military bases, and iv) air
pollution.
   A number of authors have used measures of population health, poverty, and public
health to predict mortality in 1918. Acuna-Soto, Viboud and Chowell (2011) examine
the relationship between pre-pandemic influenza and pneumonia mortality and pan-
demic influenza and pneumonia mortality, finding that pre-pandemic and pandemic
pneumonia mortality are highly correlated. Bootsma and Ferguson (2007) show that
1918 mortality is correlated with 1917 mortality. Other researchers have explored the
relationship between poverty markers and pandemic severity. Grantz et al. (2016)
examine the ability of percent illiterate, percent homeowners, percent unemployed
and population density to predict pandemic influenza mortality across census tracts in
Chicago. Tuckel et al. (2006) explore the relationship between the percent foreign born
and ward-level influenza mortality in Hartford. While the analysis is at the level of the
geographic unit and not the individual level, the results provide additional evidence
that the pandemic had unequal effects.
   Bootsma and Ferguson (2007), Markel et al. (2007), Clay, Lewis and Severnini
(2018), Barro, Ursúa and Weng (2020), and Correia, Luck and Verner (2020) examine
the effects of public health measures, often referred to as nonpharmaceutical interven-
tions, on influenza and pneumonia mortality drawing on data for 43 cities for which
weekly data is available. Nonpharmaceutical interventions included school closures,
bans on public gatherings, and quarantine or isolation of suspected cases. Correia,


                                           32
Luck and Verner (2020) find that cities with above median days of nonpharmaceutical
interventions had lower peak mortality and lower cumulative mortality. Using data at
the annual level, neither Clay, Lewis and Severnini (2018) nor Barro (2020) find that
nonpharmaceutical interventions had statistically significant effects, although the signs
appear to be correct. Barro (2020) suggests that one issue is that the closures were of
relatively short duration.
   The timing of pandemic onset in the fall is thought to be an important predictor
of mortality, because the virulence may have declined over time (Crosby, 2003; Barry,
2005). The most serious wave originated in Camp Devens near Boston in the first
week of September 1918. The pandemic had surfaced in most East Coast cities by
mid-September and then moved westward, diffusing nationwide by early October. The
movement of military personnel is also believed to have influenced severity through its
role in spreading the virus across the country. Kolata (2001), Crosby (2003), Barry
(2005), and Byerly (2010) provide detailed accounts of the pandemic in the military,
and the role of the Navy and Army in its spread.
   Although pre-pandemic health and poverty and the timing of onset and proximity
to military bases have been discussed in the historical and medical literatures, air
pollution has received far less attention. There is growing biological (Jakab, 1993;
Jaspers et al., 2005), animal (Hahon et al., 1985; Harrod et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2014),
and epidemiological evidence that air pollution can increase susceptibility to influenza
(Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007). Recent empirical evidence suggests that air pollution
interacts with infectious disease. Hanlon (2018) finds that higher underlying rates
of measles, tuberculosis (TB), and other respiratory diseases increased the mortality
effects of pollution episodes in London from 1866 to 1965. Similarly, Clay, Lewis and
Severnini (2019a) show that coal-fired generating capacity, a proxy for air pollution,
led to significantly higher mortality rates during the pandemic.


                                           33
    Because Clay, Lewis and Severnini (2019b) is the most comprehensive analysis of
variation in mortality, we discuss it in more detail. Their study draws on a new data set
of annual mortality in 438 U.S. cities that represent two-thirds of the urban population
for the period 1915 to 1925. The panel structure of the data set facilitates construction
of a measure of pandemic severity for a large sample of cities. The empirical analysis
involves two steps. First, they estimate excess pandemic mortality in every city as the
difference between observed and predicted mortality in 1918. The interquartile range
in excess mortality is 0.39 to 0.78%. Second, they estimate cross-sectional regressions
to assess the importance of: i) measures of pre-pandemic health and poverty, ii) the
timing of onset and proximity to military bases, and iii) air pollution.24
    Clay, Lewis and Severnini (2019b) find that pre-pandemic infant mortality, percent
illiterate, air pollution from coal plants, and rural share are positively and statistically
significantly related to excess mortality.25 To facilitate interpretation control variables
are included as terciles. High and middle terciles are then compared to the lowest ter-
cile. Figure 8 reports the corresponding magnitudes for the main explanatory variables.
Proximity to World War I bases are statistically significant when percent urban is in-
cluded as a control. When all of the covariates are included, however, the coefficients
on proximity to World War I bases are statistically insignificant.
    The results shown in Figure 8 are robust to other measures of excess mortality
and to including a number of additional controls such as measures of religiosity and

  24
      Clay, Lewis and Severnini (2019b) controls for percent urban in the county. Like Acuna-Soto,
Viboud and Chowell (2011), they find that cities in more urban counties had statistically significantly
lower mortality rates. This may have occurred for a number of reasons. More urban areas may
have greater exposure to the milder spring wave of influenza and so have greater immunity. More
urban areas also may have been more able to implement non-pharmaceutical interventions such as
isolation and quarantine of victims, school closure, and cancellation of public gatherings (Bootsma
and Ferguson, 2007; Markel et al., 2007).
   25
      The infant mortality rate is widely used as a measure of population health, since the link between
infant deaths and contemporaneous health conditions – including disease, pollution, and nutrition
– is immediate, whereas adult mortality reflects an accumulation of lifetime exposure (Chay and
Greenstone, 2003; Currie and Neidell, 2005).

   Notes: Coefficients and confidence intervals from Table 1 column 5 of Clay, Lewis and Severnini
   (2019b). The estimates are obtained by regressing excess mortality in 1918 on indicators for
   whether the city has high, medium, or low intensity with respect to each of the explanatory
   variables: pre-existing infant mortality rates, illiterate share, proximity to a WWI base, coal-fired
   electricity capacity (a proxy for air pollution), and urban share. The “low” classification is the
   omitted category. Excess mortality is the difference between observed mortality and predicted
   mortality in 1918, where predicted mortality is calculated based on a linear city-specific trend.




                                                         35
religious fractionalization, city public health infrastructure, and access to trade (Clay,
Lewis and Severnini, 2019b). There is some evidence that greater religious fractional-
ization is associated with higher pandemic mortality. Pre-pandemic local public health
infrastructure appears to be unrelated to pandemic mortality, consistent with local
public health response having been overwhelmed by the magnitude of the pandemic
(Crosby, 2003). Finally, greater access to trade, as measured by total miles of rail-
way in 1911, is associated with increased pandemic severity, consistent with recent
evidence on the role of transportation in accelerating the spread of influenza (Adda,
2016). Including these variables does not alter the results in Figure 8.



5     Economic Effects

    In this section, we discuss how the 1918 influenza pandemic affected the economy.
We start by discussing the short-run economic effects, which we define as the period
when the pandemic was still ongoing. This literature is most consistent with a negative
labor supply shock, most likely because the pandemic disproportionately killed or in-
capacitated working-age adults. We then turn to what we refer to as the medium-run
economic effects, or the effects on the economy after the pandemic had ended, gener-
ally from 1920 to 1930. In the medium-run, there is some evidence that the pandemic
reduced economic growth, but much of this evidence comes from countries involved in
WWI, making conclusive inference challenging.


5.1    Short-run economic effects

    The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a historic downturn in the global economy. The
OECD has projected that global GDP will drop between 6 and 7.6% and unemployment
will increase by 3.8 to 4.6% in 2020, depending on whether there is a second wave of


                                           36
COVID-19 later in the year (OECD, 2020). While these are projections, they do
highlight that the pandemic has caused a contraction of historic size and abrupt onset,
as well as a high degree of economic uncertainty. The current pandemic raises the
question of whether global pandemics always cause economic crises, or whether the
reaction to COVID-19 is unique. To answer this question, many economists are turning
their attention toward 1918.
    In 1918, countries with higher influenza mortality had deeper recessions.26 Barro,
Ursúa and Weng (2020) use annual panel-data from 43 countries during the 1901 to
1929 period to estimate the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic. Holding WWI
combat-fatalities per capita fixed, an additional percentage point of influenza mortality
is associated with a 3 and 4% decline in real GDP per capita and real consumption
per capita, respectively. The 1918 influenza pandemic killed approximately 2% of
the population for the average country in the sample, suggesting that the pandemic
resulted in a 6% decline in real GDP per capita and an 8% decline in real consumption
per capita on average. These estimates are remarkably close to the OECD projections
for the real GDP decline in 2020 (OECD, 2020).
    Countries with higher pandemic mortality had higher rates of inflation, lower short-
term government bill returns, and may have had lower stock returns as well (Barro,
Ursúa and Weng, 2020). The panel data regression suggests that a country with a 2%
influenza mortality rate experienced a 20 percentage point increase in the inflation rate,
although the effect on prices is temporary. Similarly, average pandemic mortality is
associated with a 14 percentage point decrease in real returns on government bills and
a 26 percentage point decrease in real returns for stocks, however the latter estimate is


  26
     There is a related literature in economics that asks how recessions affect health. See the seminal
paper of Ruhm (2000), which finds that recessions can lead to improvements in health. Evidence from
historical settings is less consistent with that idea. See Arthi, Beach and Hanlon (2019) as well as the
recent review by Arthi and Parman (2020).

                                                  37
noisy and statistically insignificant.27 An increase in prices accompanied by a decrease
in output is consistent with a negative supply shock.
   In the United States, a brief V-shaped recession coincided with the pandemic. Velde
(2020) uses high-frequency time series data (often weekly or monthly) to examine the
immediate economic impacts of the pandemic. Industrial production dropped 20%
from July 1918 to January 1919 but rebounded quickly. Relative to August of 1918,
ten-cent stores and dry goods/clothing stores saw a decrease in sales.28 Drug stores
showed a modest increase in sales in October and larger decreases as the pandemic
ended. Mail-order catalogs saw an increase in sales, an increase Velde attributed to
an “early Amazon effect.” Employment indices from Ohio, Massachusetts, Wisconsin,
and New York show that employment fell between 7 and 15% during the pandemic,
but all recovered by the end of 1919. Bodenhorn (2020) finds that influenza mortal-
ity decreased ratings of retail sales and manufacturing activity as reported in trade
journals.
   Coal production fell during the pandemic, largely due to labor shortages. Every
week, the U.S. Fuel Administration reported the percent below capacity coal mines were
operating, along with whether the shortfall in production was due to labor shortages or
strikes. Labor shortages increased in October 1918, peaking in November, and returned
to pre-pandemic levels by January of 1919 (Velde, 2020). Cumulative lost production
due to labor shortages was higher in states with more excess influenza and pneumonia
mortality. There were similar production declines in the textile and lumber industry
(Bodenhorn, 2020).
   At least in the U.S., the stock market did not decline during the pandemic (Velde,

      Jordà, Singh and Taylor (2020) study the macroeconomic effects of 15 pandemics that killed at
least 100,000 people, starting with the black death in the 14th century to the 2009 H1N1 influenza
pandemic. They find that real rates of return are lower following pandemics for a 40 year period.
They show that their results are robust to excluding the 1918 pandemic.

the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the London Security Price Index. Both indices
are normalized to have a value of 100 as of January of 1915. There was not significant
movement in either index during the pandemic, although U.S. stocks did briefly peak
in October of 1918. By contrast, the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than a
third of its value during both 1917 and 1920. Newspapers during 1918 did not identify
the pandemic as being the source of any major stock jumps (Baker et al., 2020). Taken
together, the evidence suggests that the 1918 pandemic was not a major determinant
of U.S. stock market volatility.

    The brevity of the recession and the lack of stock market volatility raises the ques-

                                                    39
tion: why were the concurrent effects of the influenza pandemic on the U.S. economy
so modest in 1918 and so large during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic? First, the U.S.
had a lower mortality rate in 1918 than most of the world. For example, the esti-
mated mortality rate was only one-quarter of the average of the Barro, Ursúa and
Weng (2020) sample. Second, the pandemic in 1918 occurred in a time when infec-
tious disease was a common cause of death (see Figure 1). Americans in 1918 may
have become accustomed to the risk of dying from infectious disease in a similar way
that many modern-day Americans are accustomed to the risk of dying from heart dis-
ease. Third, although there were non-pharmaceutical interventions during the 1918
pandemic, they were not as severe as the social distancing laws that were implemented
in the spring of 2020. Many businesses and schools in 1918 either did not close, or did
so only briefly. Fourth, the demand for munitions for the war may have prevented the
closing of businesses and factories.


5.2    Medium-Run Economic Effects

   The medium-run consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic remain highly uncertain.
The answer will likely depend on if and when a vaccine is discovered and if there are
multiple waves of the disease. We will not know the lasting economic consequences of
COVID-19 until it is too late for policymakers to intervene. Economic historians, how-
ever, have measured the medium- and long-run economic effects for the 1918 influenza
pandemic.
   There is recent within-country evidence that the influenza pandemic stunted eco-
nomic growth, but the economy recovered after approximately 3 years. Carillo and
Jappelli (2020) find that Italian regions that were hit hardest by the pandemic experi-
enced a 6.5% decline in real GDP compared to the least affected Italian regions. The
effect is largest the year after the pandemic and fades out by 1922. Dahl, Hansen and

                                          40
Jense (2020) find similar results using a panel of 76 Danish municipalities. They find
that income growth fell for 2 to 3 years after the pandemic, after which there is some
evidence of a medium-run effect in 1922 to 1925, although the estimates are noisy.
They do not find evidence that the pandemic had long-run effects on income growth.
    Using annual panel data, Karlsson, Nilsson and Pichler (2014) find that Swedish
regions with worse pandemic mortality had lower capital earnings in the short-run
(1918-1920) and the medium-run (1921-1930). While the pandemic had no effects on
poorhouse rates in the short-run, poorhouse rates increased in the medium-run. To
put the effect into perspective, the authors find that increasing excess mortality from
the 25th to the 75th percentile resulted in a 10 percentage point increase in poorhouse
rates. Although the estimates for earnings are negative, the effect sizes are small and
statistically insignificant in both the short-run and long-run.
    Turning to the United States, Correia, Luck and Verner (2020) use city-level data to
test whether there exists a trade off between non-pharmaceutical interventions and eco-
nomic activity. They show that high- and low-NPI cities had similar levels of economic
disruptions during the pandemic, as measured by wholesale, retail, and manufacturing
disruptions reported in Bradstreet Trade. The authors then use data from the 1904
to 1927 Census of Manufactures29 as well as annual banking data and show that NPI
intensity either increased economic activity or had no effect on economic activity in
the medium-run.30
   29
       The Census of Manufacturers was not done annually and is only available every five years from
1904 to 1919 and every two years after 1919.
    30
       Lilley, Lilley and Rinaldi (2020) critiqued an earlier version of Correia, Luck and Verner (2020).
They show that the while NPIs during the pandemic predict employment growth from 1914-1919, most
of the correlation goes away after control for 1910-1917 population growth, suggesting that the faster
growing cities were more likely to implement NPIs. It should be noted that the 1917 population number
is an interpolation from the 1910 and 1920 Census and not an actual count. Lilley, Lilley and Rinaldi
(2020) then show that cities that adopted NPIs had different preexisting trends and after accounting
for pre-trends in the regression, the effect of NPIs on employment has large confidence intervals.
Correia, Luck and Verner have responded to the critique challenging whether the interpolated data
are reliable. This debate highlights the difficulty in making inferences when population data are not
collected annually.

                                                   41
   The pandemic and WWI reduced the size of the labor force and increased wages
(Garrett, 2009). The servicemen killed in WWI would have almost exclusively been
working age males, and because the influenza pandemic had a W-shaped mortality
curve, the pandemic killed a higher percentage of prime-aged adults than a typical
influenza. Similarly, researchers have argued that the black death resulted in a nega-
tive labor supply shock and increased wages (see discussion in Jedwab, Johnson and
Koyama (2020)). For 30 states with influenza data, Garrett regresses manufacturing
wage growth on 1918 influenza deaths per capita and WWI combat deaths per capita.
Both WWI mortality per capita and influenza deaths per capita predict 1914-1919 wage
growth and are statistically significant. Increasing WWI combat fatalities by 10% from
its mean increased wage growth by 1.9 percentage points. A similar increase for in-
fluenza fatalities would have increased wage growth by 0.9 percentage points. While
data on the WWI combat fatalities do not exist at the city level, Garrett repeats the
influenza exercise for a sample of 50 cities and finds similar results.
   Wartime production may have affected economic growth in U.S. cities, potentially
confounding estimates of the effect of the pandemic. Rockoff (2004) documents how the
U.S. economy changed leading up to and during the war. The economy experienced an
economic boom starting in 1914, three years before the U.S. entered the war, and the
manufacturing sector expanded as the U.S. produced munitions for its allies. In which
direction this would bias estimates of influenza’s effect is unclear. On the one hand,
proximity to railways and ports may have meant that cities experiencing production
booms may have been harder hit by the flu. Additionally, city officials may have
hesitated to implement social distancing laws that would have hindered war production.
In this case, we would expect that the estimates of influenza on employment growth
would be underestimated. On the other hand, cities far from Boston tended to be less
affected by influenza and West Coast cities had numerous shipyards which may have


                                            42
expanded production after 1914 due to the war. It is possible that West Coast cities
grew because of the boom in war production, rather than from escaping the worst of
the pandemic.
   Brainerd and Siegler (2003) examine whether the pandemic affected economic
growth of U.S. states from shortly after the pandemic (1919-1921) to 1930. The au-
thors measure economic growth as the growth rate in real personal per capita income,
as reported in Lindert (1978). The authors estimate that influenza and pneumonia
mortality predicts higher economic growth conditional on control variables. States
with higher death rates among prime-aged workers had more business failures between
1919 and 1921. This suggests states more affected by the pandemic were not operating
at full capacity. Thus, the effect may reflect that the pandemic caused a recession
and growth rates increased afterwards as the economy returned to the natural rate of
output.
   The medium-run economic consequences of the pandemic are complicated by the
1920 to 1921 recession in the U.S. Wholesale prices more than doubled between 1915
and 1920, and in response the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate (Friedman and
Schwartz, 2008). Wholesale prices then collapsed, dropping more than 50% between
1920 and 1921, contributing to the forces leading to a recession. A lack of European
production increased crop prices during the war, which in turn increased agricultural
land values in the United States (Jaremski and Wheelock, 2018). When prices fell after
European production resumed, many local banks failed. Between WWI production and
the 1920 to 1921 recession, identifying the impact on the pandemic on U.S. economic
growth remains challenging.

6     Fertility

    Pandemics may affect population growth either directly by killing inhabitants or
indirectly by affecting fertility and migration. Unlike the 1918 influenza pandemic,
COVID-19 kills women of childbearing age at relatively low rates. Despite the absence
of a mortality channel, COVID-19 may still impact fertility, as women may delay
childbearing in response to economic and public health uncertainty.
    There is a significant literature on the effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic on
fertility that spans several countries (Japan, India, Norway, Sweden, Taiwan, and the
United States). The literature has consistently found a drop in fertility during the
pandemic, as the disease killed potential parents, increased miscarriages, and may
have decreased coital frequency. After the pandemic, a baby boom occurred in most
countries, perhaps representing births that were delayed until the pandemic was over
or parents attempting to “replace” a child who died of influenza.
    A confounding event is that World War I may have affected fertility by changing
the marriage market, income, and women’s labor force participation. As men dis-
proportionately died in the war, the male-to-female sex ratio declined, improving the
marriage market for men and worsening the marriage market for women. For example,
Abramitzky, Delavande and Vasconcelos (2011) show that war fatalities increased the
probability that men married and decreased the probability women married and that
men were less likely to marry women from lower socioeconomic classes. As some women
were left without husbands and less income, labor force participation for women in-
creased (Boehnke and Gay, 2020; Vandenbroucke, 2014). Countries that fought in WWI
saw a decline in fertility during the war years followed by a baby boom (Mamelund,
2004).
    For these reasons, its important to examine evidence from neutral countries. Neu-



                                          44
tral Sweden, Norway, and the Netherlands saw declining fertility rates from 1905 to
1930, with an upward blip in 1920 (Mamelund, 2004). Mamelund (2004) examines
whether the 1918 influenza pandemic can explain the 1920 increase in births in Norway.
He documents that relative to pre-pandemic years, there was a deficit in conceptions
during the pandemic and a surplus of conceptions in 1919 as the pandemic was ending,
leading to an increase in fertility in 1920. In Sweden, Boberg-Fazlic et al. (2017) find
that districts with higher levels of influenza had lower fertility rates during the pan-
demic (August to November 1918). Child quantity increased in rural districts shortly
after the pandemic (December 1918 to December 1920). A similar baby boom was not
observed in urban districts. Both urban and rural districts observed lower fertility in
the long run (January 1921 to December 1927).
   Several studies have documented a decline in births approximately nine months af-
ter the pandemic. Time series data from Japan (Chandra and Yu, 2015a) and Taiwan
(Chandra and Yu, 2015b) show that influenza deaths were followed by a decline in births
nine months later, implying that the pandemic resulted in either fewer conceptions or
increased miscarriages during the first weeks of pregnancy. Similarly, Chandra et al.
(2018) use panel data from 19 U.S. states and find that excess influenza deaths result
in a drop in births 3 to 7 months later (likely reflecting an increase in miscarriages)
and 9 to 10 months later (likely reflecting a decrease in conceptions). Bloom-Feshbach
et al. (2011) use monthly data from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the United States.
They find that the birth rate dropped approximately six months after the peak of the
pandemic. The number of “missing births” exceeds the number of women of childbear-
ing age who died in the pandemic, implying that the pandemic decreased the birth
rate, at least in part, by increasing miscarriages during the first trimester.
   The selection induced by altering fertility decisions may have also affected average
“investments” or “child quality” for post-pandemic birth cohorts. Boberg-Fazlic et al.


                                           45
(2017) find that births to married mothers increased after the pandemic in rural areas
of Sweden. In urban districts, births to high socioeconomic status mothers, as proxied
by surnames, increased following the pandemic. These findings suggest that high so-
cioeconomic status mothers may have delayed pregnancy until after the pandemic. In
India, Donaldson and Keniston (2016) argue that rural districts were in a Malthusian
equilibrium. Population and income were relatively stagnant. Influenza was particu-
larly virulent in India and some districts lost over 10% of their population. Donaldson
and Keniston (2016) show that despite the population loss, agricultural output re-
mained unchanged, resulting in higher per capita income.31 As in Sweden, Donaldson
and Keniston (2016) find that births during the pandemic declined and there was an
increase in child quantity after the pandemic. The baby boom lasted longer, however,
from 1921 to at least 1931. There was also an increase in child quality, as children
ages 10-15 from high influenza districts were more literate, taller, and less likely to be
married in 1931.



7        The Pandemic’s Lasting Health Legacy

     This section reviews the long-term health consequences of infection. We begin with
an overview of post-infection complications and the interaction of influenza with pre-
existing conditions. We then assess whether those who were exposed to the pandemic
during key periods of fetal development were left permanently scarred by that exposure.




    31
     These findings relate to an earlier debate over the issue of whether there was surplus labor
in India’s agricultural sector. Schultz et al. (1964) tested this hypothesis using the 1918 influenza
epidemic as a shock to the labor force. Schultz et al. finds that agricultural output declined between
the 1916-1917 season and the 1919-1920 season (two seasons with similar weather), suggesting there
was not a surplus of labor. This led to a debate between Sen (1967) and Schultz (1967) on using the
influenza pandemic to test the theory of surplus labor.

                                                 46
7.1     The Sequelae of Influenza Infection

    With many diseases, those that survive the initial infection may still be left with
chronic health conditions. These sequelae can range from something as mild as aches
and pains to a range of life-threatening complications. For instance, some young and
otherwise healthy individuals have recovered from a seemingly mild case of COVID-19
only to show up at a hospital several weeks later after experiencing a severe stroke.
For the 1918 flu, Collier (1974) writes of complications like deafness that persisted
for up to one year, debilitating physical weakness, and breathing difficulties. More
serious complications include cardiac disorders, pulmonary tuberculosis, encephalitis,
and early-onset Parkinson’s disease.32
    A 1920 supplemental report on the pandemic written by England’s registrar general
provides some of the earliest estimates of influenza infection and subsequent mortality
risk. The estimates are derived from excess mortality models, which means they are
sensitive to how counterfactual mortality is defined. This is not a trivial issue for
England or other countries engaged in World War I. One approach is to compare
mortality rates for women in 1918 with the average mortality rate from 1914-1917.
This comparison suggests that while influenza mortality rates in England increased by
a factor of 20, pneumonia mortality rates increased by 68%, bronchitis mortality rates
increased by 10%, and pulmonary tuberculosis increased by about 16%. While some
of these deaths may have been misclassified influenza deaths (e.g., pneumonia), there
is nevertheless some evidence that the pandemic may have elevated the mortality risk
from certain underlying conditions.
    Given the pandemic’s widespread infection rates, many have wondered if other 20th
century patterns in mortality and morbidity can be traced back to the pandemic. One
  32
     On the issue of deafness, Heider (1934) plots the distribution of birth years among those enrolled
in deaf schools, which indicates a sharp increase in enrollment for those born in the second half of
1918.

                                                  47
such pattern is the rapid decline in tuberculosis rates. Contemporary observers and
public health reports discuss a relative peak in tuberculosis mortality in 1918 and 1919
followed by a permanent decline that brought mortality rates down to about 50% of
the pre-pandemic average.33 Noymer and Garenne (2000) and Noymer (2011) provide
evidence to support the idea that those with tuberculosis may have been particularly
susceptible to the 1918 flu, and by disproportionately killing those infected with tuber-
culosis, the pandemic may have helped stop the spread and accelerated the elimination
of tuberculosis in the United States.34 Another broad pattern that may have been
influenced by the pandemic is the wave of encephalitis lethargica (commonly known
as sleeping sickness) that emerged worldwide, killing an estimated 500,000 and leading
to an additional million cases of severe neurological disease between 1919 and 1928
(Ravenholt, Foege et al., 1982). The precise role of influenza is unclear, since scientists
have not been able to find evidence of influenza spreading to the brain. Nevertheless,
it is still possible that influenza may increase susceptibility to encephalitis lethargica,
as generating compelling empirical evidence in either direction has proven difficult
(McCall et al., 2008).


7.2     In Utero Scarring

    Those in utero during a pandemic will likely suffer from worse health and cogni-
tive performance, but the extent of those damages will not be observed for decades.
The evidence in support of this claim comes from the literature on the “fetal origins
hypothesis.” According to that literature, insults that occur during key periods of
fetal development can generate a wide set of latent effects leading to chronic health

  33
      See Abbott (1922) as well as reports on trends in tuberculosis that appear in England’s registrar
general reports and the United States mortality statistics from 1920-1922.
   34
      This hypothesis is not universally accepted, see for instance the Bradshaw, Smith and Blanchard
(2008) critique of Noymer and Garenne (2000), and the response by Noymer (2008).

                                                  48
conditions and worse cognitive performance, which together undermine human capi-
tal accumulation and lower socioeconomic status in adulthood (Almond, Currie and
Duque, 2018; Almond and Currie, 2011; Currie and Almond, 2011). While the precise
biological mechanisms are difficult to identify, economists have generated substantial
empirical support for this hypothesis through the use of “natural experiments” that
leverage variation in exposure to disease and deprivation to recover a causal effect. Key
drivers of these insults during a pandemic could include the biological stress induced
if the mother becomes infected, maternal stress from coping with the pandemic, nu-
tritional deficiencies, or worse medical care. On the other hand, decreased pollution
because of shutting down economic activity could work in the opposite direction.
   Almond (2006), which leverages variation in in utero exposure to the 1918 influenza
pandemic, is among the most influential papers in this literature. Before Almond
(2006), most empirical evidence in support of the fetal origins hypothesis came from
randomized experiments with animals. While those experiments speak to lasting health
consequences, they cannot speak to socioeconomic differences or the ability of social
programs to mitigate those harmful effects. As Almond argued, the pandemic provides
a unique opportunity to explore this relationship for humans because it was severe,
unexpected, and widespread, but also temporary. These features, in turn, generate
sharp exogenous variation in the health environment for those born before, during,
and after the pandemic. Much of the literature following Almond (2006) has leveraged
similar types of variation to further our understanding of the importance of the fetal
environment.
   Figure 10 reproduces Almond’s main results. The figure draws on data from the
1970 Census, as made available from IPUMS.org. That Census asked individuals about
their quarter of birth, and so we define a birth cohort as the set of individuals born
between the fourth quarter of year T to the third quarter of year T+1. Since the 1918


                                           49
pandemic emerged in the fall of 1918, this ensures those with any in utero exposure are
categorized as the same birth cohort. We then plot cohort by sex averages for three
outcome variables: whether the individual graduated high school, whether their house-
hold income was below the poverty line, and whether the individual was disabled.35
As in Almond (2006), we also plot a quadratic fit between 1912 and 1926 (omitting
the year of the pandemic). For all three outcomes we see that the cohort with in utero
exposure performed relatively worse than what would have been predicted by trend.
The tables in Almond (2006) indicate that these deviations are statistically significant
at conventional levels.
   While the above results are often cited as the purely biological consequences of in
utero exposure to the pandemic, there are reasons to be skeptical of that interpretation.
Parman (2015), for instance, provides evidence that households in the United States
may have reinforced the in utero shock by reallocating resources towards healthier
siblings.36 Brown and Thomas (2011) note that parents of the in utero cohort may have
been selected, since the pandemic coincided with the height of World War I enlistment.
Importantly, Brown and Thomas (2011) argue that WWI veterans were positively
selected from the population, raising the possibility that the 1919 birth cohort was
more likely to be born into a lower socioeconomic status household. Unfortunately,
Almond (2006), Almond and Mazumder (2005), and Mazumder et al. (2010) lack
comprehensive data on parental characteristics to assess whether the results are driven


  35
      The causes of disability are not reported in the Census, but Almond and Mazumder (2005)
examine an alternative data set and find that those with in utero exposure suffered from a range
of functional limitations, including trouble hearing, speaking, lifting, and walking. The magnitudes
of these effects are meaningful at roughly 17% of the sample mean and as high as 35% for trouble
speaking. Mazumder et al. (2010) show that in utero exposure is associated with a roughly 20%
increase in cardiovascular disease.
   36
      As Royer (2009) notes, whether behavioral responses should be thought of as a confounder
depends on whether the goal is to identify the net consequences of early life health shocks or if
we are only interested in isolating the biological effect. Decomposing the behavioral and biological
components remains an important avenue for future research.

September to September. Since the U.S. pandemic was primarily from October to December, this
ensures that those with any in utero exposure all appear in the same cohort.

by negative parental selection.37 Brown and Thomas (2011) do construct proxies for
parental controls from historical census data and find that many of the results in
Almond (2006) are sensitive to the inclusion of those proxies, suggesting that parental
selection may be an important confounder.
    Beach, Ferrie and Saavedra (2018) re-assess the idea that parental selection is a
potential confounder with linked data. Their linked data set allows them to observe
individuals twice: first as a child with their parents and again as an adult. Information
on parents is available from either the 1920 or 1930 Census (when the relevant birth
cohort is between the ages of 0 and 1 or 10 and 11). Because of data restrictions,
the latest publicly available adult outcome data are from World War II enlistment
records, roughly 20 years before Almond begins his analysis. While this sample is
clearly selected, it is notable that their baseline estimates not only point to lower
high school completion rates and educational attainment but that the magnitudes are
comparable to Almond (2006). When using a sample and empirical framework closest
to Almond (2006), the authors find evidence that the cohort with in utero exposure
to the pandemic was also born into slightly lower SES households. Controlling for
observable parental characteristics attenuates results, but even with a large set of
controls there is still evidence that the 1919 birth cohort experienced a meaningful
decline in human capital accumulation.
    To provide evidence that in utero exposure affected human capital accumulation,
Beach, Ferrie and Saavedra (2018) adopt a differences-in-differences framework that
exploits variation in both the timing and the intensity of the 1918 pandemic. This
strategy was first introduced by Almond (2006), although since Almond did not use
linked data, state-of-birth was the finest geography available, and historical mortality
statistics are only available for 22 states for the time of the pandemic. Beach, Ferrie
  37
     Almond (2006) does observe whether the individual’s parents were foreign born in the 1970 census
and finds no departure from trend.

                                                 52
and Saavedra (2018), make the assumption that city of enumeration, in April of 1920,
was also the city in which the child spent the in utero period. This allows the authors
to incorporate information on the intensity of flu exposure from local health reports of
over 200 cities. The authors then ask whether individuals born in the same year but in
areas with greater pandemic exposure had lower socioeconomic status as adults. Within
that specification, the authors find no evidence of parental selection and continue to
find strong evidence supporting Almond’s conclusion that in utero exposure to the
pandemic had lasting effects on educational attainment.
    While Almond (2006) receives a substantial amount of attention because it was the
first paper in this area, there is no reason to expect the elasticities in that paper to
translate to other settings. For instance, when baseline mortality rates are high, it
may be the case that those affected the most by their exposure do not survive early
childhood, working against a finding of persistent scarring effects. Alternatively, where
the returns to human capital are low, the cognitive impairment induced by in utero
exposure might not be large enough to translate into an appreciable loss of education
or income. Even in the United States we might expect the effects to be different for
groups whose labor market opportunities were hindered by widespread discrimination.
    A large literature has emerged examining the relationship between in utero exposure
and long-run outcomes across a range of settings.38 One notable example is Lin and
Liu (2014), which provides a comprehensive assessment of the Taiwanese experience.
Taiwan offers an interesting point of comparison because baseline health and educa-
tional attainment were much lower than in the United States. Taiwan was also not
involved in WWI and is thus not subject to the critique raised in Brown and Thomas
  38
     Vollmer and Wójcik (2017) draw on 117 census samples from IPUMS.org and compare the adult
outcomes for the in utero cohort to the outcomes of adjacent cohorts. The findings in this study
are generally imprecise. However, this meta-analysis approach only leverages variation across birth
cohorts, rather than variation in both the intensity and the timing of the pandemic. We focus our
discussion on studies that incorporate both types of variation, as that is a more convincing empirical
design.

                                                 53
(2011). Taiwan experienced two waves of the pandemic, and the authors find strong
evidence that affected cohorts were less educated and in worse health as adults. Oga-
sawara (2017, 2018) document a link between in utero exposure and stunting in Japan.
In Sweden, we continue to see strong health consequences from in utero exposure, but
the evidence for socioeconomic status is less conclusive (Helgertz and Bengtsson, 2019).
Neelsen and Stratmann (2012) find a negative education effect in Switzerland, although
the effects are about one fifth of the magnitude of Almond (2006). Nelson (2010) and
Guimbeau, Menon and Musacchio (2020) find strong evidence that the 1918 pandemic
had lasting effects on human capital development in Brazil.



8     Issues with Limited Historical Evidence

    This section briefly describes issues that are relevant to COVID-19 but that have
limited historical evidence and, in some cases, limited historical parallels. These include
the impact of COVID-19 on human capital accumulation, political economy, migration,
and inequality. We summarize the evidence and discuss the parallels for each of these
below.


8.1      Human Capital Accumulation

    What is the effect of pandemics on human capital accumulation? COVID-19 has
disrupted primary, secondary, and post-secondary education worldwide. The extent of
the impact on educational attainment and long-run outcomes remains to be seen, but
it is likely to be an active area of future research.
    The literature on the human capital effects of the 1918 influenza pandemic offers
little guidance on this issue. As we discussed in section 7.2, there is a large literature
examining whether in utero exposure to the disease impairs cognitive ability. There


                                            54
is very little research on the impact of the 1918 pandemic for children that were born
before the pandemic. One important exception is Parman (2015), which finds that
households appear to have shifted resources to older siblings in response to the pan-
demic. Compared to siblings born during the pandemic and younger siblings, older
siblings had higher educational attainment and high school graduation rates.
   Schools were closed for weeks in many locations in 1918 and in some cases during
1919, but it is not clear what those closures can tell us about today. In the United
States at least, the 1918 pandemic struck while states were still strengthening—or
in a few cases, adopting—compulsory schooling laws. Because of this, primary and
secondary education attendance was much more sparse, and so, compared to today,
school closures were likely less disruptive.39 Older students may have decided not
to return once schools reopened, as was the case during the widespread U.S. polio
epidemic of 1916 (Meyers and Thomasson, 2017). But, those that were of schooling
age during the pandemic would ultimately grow up to enter a labor market where the
returns to education were by some estimates lower than today (Feigenbaum and Tan,
Forthcoming; Goldin and Katz, 2009), and so dropping out of school may not have
affected long-run occupational standing. Moreover, the returns to education during
this period appear to be driven by schooling at lower grade levels (Clay, Lingwall
and Stephens Jr, 2016), and younger children probably didn’t drop out because of
temporary school closures.


8.2     Political Economy

   What is the effect of pandemics on political economy? COVID-19 has the potential
to affect politics, as voters respond to political leaders’ actions with respect to the
  39
      Today, technological advances allow for online instruction, which might mitigate the harmful
effects of school closings for some students. One concern with online instruction is that students
without reliable access to high speed internet or computers may be left behind.

                                               55
virus. Also some issues around masks and social distancing in some countries, notably
the U.S., have become highly politicized. An obvious question is whether there are
similar historical parallels to 1918. The short answer is largely no. Individuals in
1918 had experienced a number of epidemics, particularly if they lived in cities. The
response of political leaders was certainly relevant. At the same time, expectations
around the ability of politicians to control the epidemic, particularly in wartime, were
likely limited. There were some anti-mask rallies, but generally the 1918 pandemic
appears to have been less heavily politicized than the current one.
   What is the effect of political economy on pandemics? This question is likely to
attract substantial scholarly attention in light of the substantial heterogeneity of po-
litical responses to COVID-19. Troesken (2015) offers some guidance on this question,
although that book does not explicitly consider the influenza pandemic. Troesken’s
hypothesis is that institutions that promote economic activity, e.g., secure property
rights and limited government, also shape the state’s approach to public health. The
book then examines how institutions affected responses to three types of epidemics:
smallpox, yellow fever, and waterborne diseases like cholera and typhoid fever. One
of the central conclusions is that, countries with institutions that promote economic
liberty have a mixed effect on public heath. For instance, in the U.S., secure property
rights benefited municipalities because they were able to finance water and sewer in-
frastructure at low interest rates. But the U.S. also suffered with smallpox because of
its unwillingness to adopt universal mandatory vaccination laws. Thus far, the U.S.
response to COVID-19 seems to conform to this hypothesis, as shutdown decisions and
mask wearing mandates have been adopted at the state and local level rather than the
federal level.
   Although the 1918 pandemic was less politicized, it may have affected political
economy by changing the demographic composition of electorates. Preliminary work


                                          56
by Blickle (2020) finds that in German municipalities, influenza deaths were negatively
correlated with later per capita public spending and argues this might be driven by the
1918 pandemic disproportionately affecting young adults. He also shows that influenza
mortality was associated with higher vote share for extremist political parties. He finds
that a one-standard deviation increase in influenza mortality increased the vote share
for the National Socialist Party by 3%.
   There is also evidence that the 1918 pandemic influenced voting behavior. In the
United States, the pandemic coincided with the fourth and final liberty loan campaign.
The liberty loan campaigns were a widespread effort to fund the Allied cause. Over
23 million Americans purchased liberty bonds, and for many Americans, liberty bonds
were their first experience with owning a financial instrument. In turn, the perfor-
mance of those bonds was suddenly relevant for many potential voters. Hilt and Rahn
(forthcoming) find that sales of liberty bonds during the fourth campaign were lower
in places with greater influenza intensity. Liberty bonds had depreciated in value
during president Wilson’s 1916-1920 Democratic administration and appreciated in
value during 1920-1924 Harding/Coolidge Republican administration. Hilt and Rahn
(forthcoming) go on to show that the variation in ownership of bonds induced by the
pandemic influenced vote shares in both the 1920 and 1924 presidential elections.
   While epidemics can influence voting behavior through economic or demo-
graphic/selective mortality channels, they may also influence voting behavior by af-
fecting trust in politicians and leaders. Survey evidence presented in Brück et al.
(2020) suggests that COVID-19 has lowered trust in institutions and in general, par-
ticularly among those that have had contact with someone that is sick or those that
have lost their job. Aksoy et al. (2020) show that exposure to epidemics since 1970
permanently lowers trust in institutions and political leaders. Those beliefs may also be
transmitted across generations. Aassve et al. (2020), for instance, shows that, among


                                           57
descendants that migrated to the United States, trust is negatively correlated with the
severity of the 1918 pandemic. While the above papers highlight a general distrust,
if the epidemic is politicized then it is possible that one party may be disproportion-
ately punished/rewarded. Mansour, Rees and Reeves (2020), for instance, show that
U.S. congressional districts that experienced greater mortality during the HIV/AIDS
epidemic were more likely to turn out and vote for Democratic candidates.


8.3    Migration

   Do pandemics induce or impede migration in the short and medium run? In re-
sponse to COVID-19, many nations have closed their borders and imposed immigration
restrictions. Additionally, COVID-19 has hit urban areas especially hard, which has
caused some temporary and perhaps permanent migration to less densely populated
areas. The virus may also change the composition of goods demanded by consumers,
and workers may migrate away from localities in which economic activity has shut
down, such as tourist destinations.
   There has been considerably less research on the effect of the 1918 pandemic on
migration. If the pandemic led to a negative labor supply shock and increased wages, it
is possible that laborers would migrate to the areas hardest hit by the pandemic, thus
offsetting the effects of the pandemic on population. Using data from India, where
mortality rates were very high, Donaldson and Keniston (2016) measure migration
by examining the proportion of individuals in each district who were born in a dif-
ferent province. Their point estimates are all positive, suggesting that districts with
higher levels of influenza may have had experienced more immigration, but only one
of four specifications is statistically significant and the magnitude of the estimates are
relatively small.
   We are unaware of any research on the effect of the pandemic on either internal

                                           58
or external migration in the United States, and there are a variety of data sources
that could be used to answer this question. The Census microdata contain state or
country of birth. In some Censuses, year of immigration is available. Recent advances
in Census linking have made it significantly easier to link individuals from the 1910
and 1920 Censuses (Bailey et al., Forthcoming; Abramitzky et al., Forthcoming). One
challenge with answering this question is that two shocks to immigration occurred in the
U.S. around the same time. The U.S. entered WWI the year before the pandemic, and
starting in 1917 and continuing into the 1920s, the U.S. passed a series of immigration
restrictions, both of which reduce immigration (Greenaway and Gushulak, 2017).


8.4    Inequality and disparities

   How do pandemics affect economic and health inequality? Pandemics may exacer-
bate health disparities by disproportionately affecting groups who are more likely to
suffer from risk factors, such as pre-existing chronic conditions. Gross et al. (2020)
find that COVID-19 age-adjusted mortality rates for blacks are 3.5 times higher than
for whites. It is unlikely that socioeconomic status alone can explain the disparity, as
McLaren (2020) finds that counties with higher black shares have higher COVID-19
mortality rates even after controlling for socioeconomic status. Similarly, inequality
may have recently increased as some occupations can be done remotely, whereas other
industries have shut down. For example, females who are disproportionately repre-
sented in sectors that require face-to-face interactions have been more affected by the
current recession than in previous recessions (Alon et al., 2020; Montenovo et al., 2020).
   Økland and Mamelund (2019) reviews the literature on how the 1918 influenza
pandemic affected mortality and morbidity for blacks and whites in the United States.
Using data from military, insurance, and death records, they show that blacks had lower
morbidity, lower mortality rates, but higher case-mortality rates than whites during

                                           59
the second wave of the pandemic. This finding is striking given the evidence from
other contexts that lower socioeconomic groups were more affected by the pandemic
(see Section 4). The reasons for the lower morbidity for blacks are unclear, but it is
possible that blacks may have had greater exposure to the milder spring wave and thus
some immunity to the more deadly second wave (Crosby, 2003).
   There has been less evidence on how the 1918 influenza pandemic affected economic
inequality. In theory, the pandemic may have reduced economic inequality. If the
poor were more likely to die, then the surviving population may have been a more
equal one. In India, Mills (1986) finds that low-caste Hindus had mortality rates
that were three times higher than high-caste Hindus. Most estimates suggest that the
mortality rate in India was approximately 10 times higher than that of the United
States, suggesting that the mortality differential between low- and high-caste Hindus
may have been sufficient to affect standard measures of inequality. On the other hand,
if the pandemic lowered the incomes of those who were sick, and mortality rates were
sufficiently low to not change the composition of the population, then the pandemic
may have increased economic inequality. Galletta and Giommoni (2020) find that the
1918 influenza pandemic increased economic inequality in Italian municipalities, and
the effect is driven by reducing incomes of the bottom half of the distribution. It seems
unlikely that the 1918 pandemic significantly affected gender equality, as few married
women participated in the labor force during 1918. On the other hand, a man who lost
their spouse to influenza likely would been less economically affected than a widowed
women.

9     Conclusion

    The 1918 influenza pandemic is the most recent pandemic to share a number of
important parallels with COVID-19. Both pandemics involve novel, highly contagious,
respiratory diseases that were caused by a virus. Both pandemics spread across the
globe in a matter of months. As of July 2020, both pandemics lack medical treatment,
and so both pandemics saw the adoption of non-pharmaceutical interventions to slow
the spread.
    In this article we surveyed the literature on the health and economic effects of
the 1918 influenza pandemic in order to distill lessons for COVID-19. The pandemic
was severe, although there was substantial variation in the intensity of the pandemic.
While NPIs were somewhat effective at reducing mortality in 1918, they were also far
less stringent, and the extent to which more restrictive NPIs would have further reduced
pandemic mortality remains debated. Variation in pandemic severity has proven to be a
useful tool for understanding the health consequences of 1918. That literature suggests
that the health effects were large and diffuse, extending well beyond the binary outcome
of survived or not. The 1918 influenza pandemic, however, has less to say about the
impact of COVID-19 on the economy. There is evidence that the 1918 pandemic caused
an economic contraction, although there is disagreement on the size and duration of
the contraction. Regardless, it seems that the contraction may have been driven by a
negative labor supply shock, as many prime-aged workers died during the pandemic.
With COVID-19, working-age adults are among the most likely to survive. It is thus
unlikely that COVID-19 will generate a similarly sized negative labor supply shock.
    There are many questions about 1918 that we still don’t know how to answer. What
role did WWI censorship play in spreading the disease? How did the pandemic affect
public finance, political economy, and cultural norms? What were the impacts of the



                                          61
pandemic in Africa, Asia, and Latin America? These questions may not have direct
implications for COVID-19, but are nevertheless important for our understanding of
the 1918 influenza pandemic.
