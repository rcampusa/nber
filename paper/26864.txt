                                           ABSTRACT

Women continue to be underrepresented in academic ranks in the economics profession. The
Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession of the American Economics
Association established the CeMENT mentoring workshop to support women in research careers.
The program was designed as a randomized controlled trial. This study evaluates differences
between the treatment and control groups in career outcomes. Results indicate that relative to
women in the control group, treated women are more likely to stay in academia and more likely
to have received tenure in an institution ranked in the top 30 or 50 in economics in the world.

       Women continue to be underrepresented in academic jobs in economics. To address this

problem, the Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession (CSWEP) of the

American Economics Association (AEA) built on an initial workshop (Bartlett and Ziegert,

2000) and established the recurring CeMENT workshops to mentor women in research careers.

The national CeMENT workshop (now the Workshop for Faculty in Doctoral Programs) focused

on junior female economists employed at institutions where research weighs heavily in the

promotion decision. The program was designed as a randomized controlled trial, held biannually

from 2004­2014. Starting in 2015 the AEA began funding the workshops every year. An interim

evaluation of the first three cohorts showed that the CeMENT program increased the number of

publications and the number of federal grants for treated individuals (Blau et al., 2010).

       This study evaluates differences between the treatment and control groups in tenure status

and academic employment, as well as publications and grants. The dataset covers all six cohorts

of randomized program participants. Individuals are observed for four to fourteen years post

intervention, depending on cohort, enabling us to investigate longer-run outcomes for a

reasonably large sample. Since we are primarily interested in tenure, we keep all those who, as of

the fall of 2018, are observed for seven or more years since PhD. Results indicate that relative to

women in the control group, treated women are more likely to stay in academia and more likely

to have received tenure in an institution ranked in the top 30 or 50 in economics in the world.


       I.      The Context

       Women remain underrepresented in the economics profession and progress in reducing

gender disparities in economics has slowed over the past two decades (Lundberg and Stearns

2019). The annual reports of CSWEP have long documented a "leaky pipeline" from PhD

programs to tenured academic jobs. A gender gap in tenure probability remains in economics

                                                 3
even after controlling for productivity indicators and other factors, in marked contrast to other

social sciences and the natural sciences where such gaps have been narrowed or eliminated

(Ginther and Kahn 2014, Ginther and Kahn 2009, Bayer and Rouse, 2016).

       Research has highlighted numerous barriers that likely contribute to women's

underrepresentation. Examples include reduced access to mentoring and social networks as well

as possible biases in the refereeing process (see Lundberg and Stearns 2019 for a review). Based

on a professional climate survey fielded by the AEA, the past, current, and future presidents of

the Association acknowledged that "many members of the profession have suffered harassment

and discrimination during their careers, including both overt acts of abuse and more subtle forms

of marginalization" (Blanchard, Bernanke, and Yellen 2019).

       The AEA has taken a number of steps to counter these problems, including the adoption

of a professional code of conduct, the establishment of a standing Committee on Equity,

Diversity, and Professional Conduct (CEDPC), and the development of EconSpark, a website

designed to promote information exchange and safe and respectful discussion among economists

(Blanchard, Bernanke and Yellen 2019). Programs like CeMENT can complement such

activities and contribute to the advancement of women in the profession by addressing

mentorship and networking challenges (Buckles 2019; Blau et al. 2010).


       II.     The CeMENT Intervention

       The national CeMENT workshops were designed to expose participants to role models

(senior female economists), to transmit information about what it takes to be successful, and to

build peer networks of female junior faculty working in similar research areas. Each workshop

lasted two days and was held in conjunction with the AEA annual meetings. Participants were

arranged into small groups (4­5 participants and 1­2 mentors) based on research interests. The

                                                 4
workshops were widely advertised. 1

           Each participant circulated a research paper or other related work (like a grant proposal)

before the workshop. During the workshop, the small groups met to discuss and provide

feedback on each participant's work (approximately one hour for each participant). In addition,

plenary sessions were held consisting of panels of the senior mentors. Topics included research

and publishing, grants, professional exposure, teaching, the tenure process, and work-life

balance.

           Applications for each workshop significantly exceeded available slots. After incomplete

or inappropriate applications were eliminated, applicants were divided into groups by research

area and were then randomly assigned to treatment (participant) or control (non-participant)

status within each group. In an effort to maximize access to the program, more participants than

non-participants were usually selected. For example, in a group of eight, five participants and

three non-participants might be selected. Both non-participants and participants were told that

CSWEP had received more applicants than could be accommodated, and that participants had

been randomly selected from the pool of eligible applicants. 2


           III.       Sample and Data Collection

           Table 1 shows the number of people from the treatment and control groups who are

included in each cohort of our sample, as well as information about the seven people who were

lost to follow-up (see column 5). Most people were easily traceable in public databases and

supplied additional information if contacted. If we could find no record of the person's current

job, we assumed that they were not in a tenure-track position. Appendix 1 provides additional

 CSWEP also ran regional workshops for economists outside research universities that were not evaluated by random assignment.
2
 The experiment started before the AEA had established a pre-registration data bank and was registered ex post. Institutional Review Boards at
Vanderbilt and Princeton Universities approved the study design.

                                                                       5
details on our data collection methods. A larger problem is that significant numbers of those

initially assigned to the control group later reapplied, and some of them were treated, as shown in

column (4). In order to deal with this issue, we adopt an "intent to treat" framework in which

initial assignment to treatment or control group is used to instrument whether the person was

eventually treated. In addition, because 28 members of cohort 6 received their PhDs after 2011

and had to be dropped from the sample, we have re-estimated all our models using only the first

five cohorts. The results (shown in Appendix 2 of this paper) are quite similar.

       Information about the outcomes of individuals in our sample was collected from a variety

of sources. Publications and publication dates come from Web of Science. Grants include all

National Science Foundation and National Institutes of Health grants where the person is listed

as the principal investigator (or co-PI). The use of these public sources enabled us to obtain

consistent information on publications and grants for virtually the full sample. We note that we

do not have information on articles that were forthcoming at the time tenure decisions were made

nor on grants from sources other than NSF and NIH. In order to verify tenure status, we searched

online curriculum vitae and university web sites with faculty listings. In cases where tenure

status could not be determined in this way, we contacted individuals to ask if they had tenure.

The tenure variable can be considered current as of September 2018.

       Given this information, and using the rankings of journals and the world rankings of

institutions in economics from Kalaitzidakis, Stengos, and Mamuneas (2003), we defined the

following variables: TenureStreamJob is a job that is either on the tenure track or tenured (e.g.,

in a US context this would exclude lecturers). TenureRank is a tenured job. We distinguished

between tenured jobs at institutions ranked in economics as 1­30, 1­50, 1­100, 1­200, or 201




                                                 6
plus (unranked). 3 We also investigated whether the last job reported was a non-academic job.


           IV.        Results

           The results of the treatment are evaluated as of fall 2018, four to fourteen years after the

intervention, depending on cohort. Table 2 shows a comparison of selected pre-intervention

characteristics of participants and non-participants.

           Overall, most of the sample, 86­90 percent, had an academic first job. Most (90­92

percent) received their PhD from a US institution, with 73­76 percent obtaining their degrees

from a top 40 institution. A substantial portion (26­30 percent) of the sample had their first job at

institutions ranked in the top 40 (1­40), with 11­13 percent at top 10 institutions. While there are

some differences between participants and non-participants on these dimensions, none is

statistically significant.

           Table 3 shows our main results. The fundamental goal of the CeMENT program was

increasing the probability of holding an academic job and being in a tenured or tenure-track

position. The results indicate that the treatment significantly increased the probability of women

having a tenured or tenure-track position (i.e., having a tenure stream job) both overall and in an

institution ranked in the top 100 in economics. The probability of having a tenure stream job was

increased by 11 percentage points, or 14.9 percent relative to the mean; the probability of having

a tenure stream job in a top 100 institution was increased by 15.9 percentage points or 56.4

percent. With respect to tenure itself, the treatment significantly increased the probability of a

tenured job in an institution ranked in the top 30 by 6.9 percentage points (78.7 percent), and the

probability of tenure in a top 50 ranked institution by 9.3 percentage points (73.8 percent). The


3
 Kalaitzidakis, Stengos, and Mamuneas (2003) provide world rankings of institutions in economics through 200; the 201+ category comprises
institutions not included in their rankings. We added the Review of Economic Studies to their "Top 4" publications so that rank 1 here is the "Top
5." Rank 2 publications include journals like RESTAT JOLE, JMCB, etc., and rank 3 includes other refereed journals.

                                                                        7
treatment was also estimated to have increased the probability of a tenured job at an institution

ranked in the top 100 or top 200, but these effects were not significant. At the same time,

participants had a significantly lower probability of having a tenured position at a 201+

(unranked) institution; this probability was reduced by 12.0 percentage points (64.5 percent).

These offsetting effects help explain why the "Any Tenure" coefficient is small and statistically

insignificant. The treatment also significantly lowered the probability of holding a nonacademic

job by 9.5 percentage points (40.8 percent).

       In Table 4, we explore possible mechanisms for the effects on tenure, focusing on the

impact of the treatment on the number of pre-tenure grants and publications. Estimated effects on

grants and publications are shown in columns (1)­(5). Overall, we find that treatment

significantly increases the number of pre-tenure grants (by 0.150) and publications (by 1.594).

Women in the treatment group have 0.216 more top five publications, 0.460 more second-tier

publications, and 0.918 more third-tier publications. Note that while the effect of the treatment

on the number of second-tier publications is not statistically significant at the five percent level

of confidence, it is large relative to its standard error and narrowly misses significance at the 10

percent level.

       How important are these treatment effects on publications and grants in producing the

observed tenure results? Columns (6) and (7) examine the probability of holding a tenured job in

a top 30 or 50 institution controlling for total numbers of pre-tenure publications and grants. The

estimated effects of the treatment on tenure in a top 30 place declines by almost half and

becomes statistically insignificant, while the estimated probability of holding tenure in a top 50

institution declines by about a third and remains marginally significant. These estimates suggest

that increases in publications and grants may not be the only drivers of the treatment effects on



                                                  8
tenure, at least at schools outside the top 30. Less tangible factors such as the provision of role

models, networks, and information about how to navigate the system may play a role.


   IV.      Conclusions

         We find that the CeMENT workshops were effective in retaining women in academia,

and in helping them to achieve tenure in top 50 ranked schools. It is remarkable that a two-day

intervention could have had such an effect. That said, the workshops were designed to create

ongoing and lasting relationships. Indeed, we know of many women who kept in touch with

contacts from CeMENT for years after their workshops and used each other as a source of

support and advice. Our results speak to the importance of having mentors and peer networks

and suggest the difficulties many women in economics face in developing these relationships.

We hope that these results will inspire others to step forward with additional ways of tackling

this persistent problem.

                             Appendix 1: Data Collection Methods



       We collected data from several sources in order to create the analysis data on women in

the CEMENT treatment and control groups. We conducted web searches for women in the

CEMENT treatment and control groups in order to find their current employment status.

University websites and LinkedIn allowed us to locate most in the sample. For those that we

could not locate, we reached out to colleagues at their last known institution to find their current

whereabouts. Whenever possible, we downloaded the most recent CVs and recorded

employment history, publications and grants in an Access Database. Some individuals did not

have a recent CV, and we used sources such as LinkedIn to fill in employment records.

       Given that some CVs were out-of-date or missing, we used public sources to find

publications and grants. Publications, journals, and publication dates come from Web of Science.

We searched for each woman by name using Python code to query the Web of Science interface

and downloaded all publications associated with the name. We used publications listed on CVs,

affiliations listed on publications, and the field of the journal to identify publications associated

with the women in our sample. Grants include all National Science Foundation (NSF) and

National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants where the person is listed as the principal investigator

(or co-PI). Grant awards were downloaded from NSF and NIH award websites and matched by

name, affiliation, and field of study to those in the CEMENT sample. We used the matchit

routine in STATA to create fuzzy name matches, and then reviewed and verified low-quality

matches. The use of these public sources enabled us to obtain consistent information on

publications and grants for virtually the full sample. We note that we do not have information on

articles that were forthcoming at the time tenure decisions were made nor on grants from sources

other than NSF and NIH.

                                                  16
       In order to verify tenure status, we searched online curriculum vitae and university web

sites with faculty listings. In some cases women reported the date of receiving tenure on their

CVs. In other cases, we used data from the CSWEP survey of economics departments to impute

tenure status for many universities. If an institution reported no untenured associate professors,

we assumed that anyone reporting an associate professor rank at that institution was tenured. If a

person reported that they were a full professor, we assumed that they were tenured. In cases

where tenure status could not be determined in this way, we contacted individuals to ask if they

had tenure and when they received it. The tenure variable can be considered current as of

September 2018.

       The data in the original version of this working paper contained two minor errors. First,

an older version of the treatment variable and instrument was incorrectly merged onto

publications and grants data. This coding mistake affects the results in columns 1-5 of Table 4.

In the process of correcting that error, additional coding errors that originated when the data were

hand-entered from the CVs into the database were discovered. Three people who applied twice

to CEMENT were coded incorrectly. As a result, these three observations appear in both the

control group and the treatment group of the sample in the previous version of the paper when

they should have only appeared in the control group. These two mistakes changed the point

estimates but did not affect the qualitative findings in the paper.

                         Appendix 2: Robustness Estimates for First Five Cohorts


              We re-estimated the results in Tables 3 and 4 in the paper, limiting the sample to the first

      five cohorts. We did so because approximately half of the sixth CEMENT cohort would not

      have sufficient time to achieve tenure. This reduced the sample size by 28 individuals. The

      results appear in Table A1 and A2 below.      In Table A1, the magnitude and significance of the

      intent to treat coefficients are very similar to those found in Table 3. However, the estimated

      effect of having a non-academic job is no longer statistically significant.

              In Table A2, the coefficient estimates are also very similar is magnitude and significance

      to those found in Table 4.
