                                           ABSTRACT

        Since the abandonment of the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates in the
early 1970s, exchange rates have displayed a surprisingly high degree of time-conditional
volatility. This volatility can be explained statistically using autoregressive conditional
heteroscedasticity models, but there remains the question of the economic source of this
volatility. Central bank intervention policy may provide part of the explanation. Previous
work has shown that central banks have relied heavily on intervention policy to influence the
level of exchange rates, and that these operations have, at times, been effective. This paper
investigates whether central bank interventions have also influenced the variance of exchange
rates, The results from daily and weekly GARCH models of the $/DM and $/Yen rates over
the period 1985 to 1991 indicate that publicly known Fed intervention generally decreased
volatility over the full period. Further, results indicate that intervention need not be publicly
known for it to influence the conditional variance of exchange rate changes. Secret
intervention operations by both the Fed and the Bundesbank generally increased exchange
rate volatility over the period.

I. Introduction

         Foreign exchange intervention operations are a controversial policy

option for central banks. In one view, exemplified by the                 quote.

intervention policy is not only ineffective in influencing the level of the

exchange rate, but also dangerous1 because it can increase the volatility of the

rate. Others argue that intervention operations can influence the level of the

exchange rate, and can also "calm disorderly markets', thereby decreasing

volatility. Yet others argue that intervention operations are inconsequential,

since they neither affect the level nor the volatility of exchange rates. There

are a number of empirical studies that examine whether intervention operations

affect the level of exchange rates,' but little has been written on the effects of

intervention on the variance of rates.2 This paper examines the effect of

intervention on foreign exchange rate volatility over the period 1985 through

1991.

         During the period in. which countries adhered to the Bretton Woods

 exchange rate system, intervention operations were required whenever rates

exceeded their parity bands. After the breakdown of the system in 1973,

intervention policy was left to the discretion of individualcountries. It was not

until 1977 that the IMF Executive Board provided its member countries three

guiding principles for intervention policy: (1) countries should not manipulate

exchange rates in order to prevent balance of payments adjustment or to gain

unfair competitive advantage over others; (2) countries should intervene to

counter disorderly market conditions; and (3) countries should take into

account the exchange rate interests of others.3 These principles implicitly

assume that intervention policy can effectively influence exchange rates, and

explicitly state that countries should use intervention policy to decrease foreign

exchange rate volatility.

         After actively engaging in foreign exchange intervention in the 1970s,

the U.S. abandoned intervention policy altogether during the period 1981

through 1984. In early 1985, after the dollar had appreciated by over 40%

against the mark, and the U.S. trade deficit was nearing $100 billion, the U.S.

joined with the German Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan to intervene against

the dollar. In the autumn of 1985 the U.S. and the rest of the G-5 engaged

in an unprecedented number of large and coordinated intervention operations

as part of the Plaza Agreement. The C-S continued to intervene episodically

throughout the rest of the 19 SOs.

           The scale of central bank intervention operations has been large in the

post-1985 period relative to that in the early 1980s, but small relative to the

overall size of the foreign exchange market. The New York Fed reports that

the average daily volume of foreign exchange trading was $192 billion

(eliminating double-counting) in the United States in April 1992. By

comparison the average coordinated intervention operation during the late

1980s involved $350 million.4 Figures 1 and 2 present bar graphs of U.S.

and German intervention operations in the 1980s.' The Bundesbank has

maintained the most consistent presence of the 0-5 countries in the foreign

exchange markets. The Bundesbank intervened steadily during the period

before 1985 when the Fed was absent from the market. Germany was

reported to have been the major initial force in starting the dollar on its decline

in early 1985 through both its own intervention operations and its pressure on

the U.S. and Japan to join in coordinated operations.




      The average coordinated sale of dollars by the Fed and the Bundesbank
over the period 1985 through 1988 involved $350 million, and the average
coordinated purchase of dollars by the two central banks involved $368
million.

    $ The Bundesbanic intervention data used in this paper end in December
1988 and the Fed data end in December 1991.

          Did the G-5 intervention operations, over the period 1985 through

1991, influence the volatility of the $/DM or the $/Yen exchange rates?

Section ii begins with a discussion of how central bank intervention policy can

influence exchange rate first moments. Section IH presents daily and weekly

models of exchange rate changes that allow intervention operations to influence

both the conditional mean and variance. Estimates of the models are presented

in section IV. Section V presents conclusions. Overall, the econometric

results indicate that official exchange rate policy often significantly influenced

exchange rate volatility.

TI. Can Central Bank Jntervention Influence Exchange Rates?

          Foreign exchange market intervention is, most broadly defined, any

transaction or announcement by an official agent of a government that is

intended to influence the value of an exchange rate. In most countries,

intervention operations are implemented by the monetary authority, although

the decision to intervene can often also be made by authorities in the finance

ministry, or treasury department depending on the country. In practice,
central banks define intervention more narrowly as any official sale or

purchase of foreign assets against domes tic assets in the foreign exchange

market.

          Although each central bank has its own particular set of practices,

intervention operations generally take place in the broker's market. During

major intervention episodes, the Fed often chooses to deal directly with the

                                       4
 foreign exchange desk of several large commercial banks simultaneously to

achieve maximum visibility. As with any other foreign exchange transaction,

trades are officially anonymous. However, most central banks have developed

relationships with traders which allow them to inform the market of their

presence within minutes of the original transaction.6

           Data on daily official central bank purchases and sales in the foreign

exchange market have rarely been made available to researchers outside the

central banks,7 let alone market participants. Although intervention data have

not been published on a daily basis by the central banks,8 daily intervention

operations are frequently reported in newspapers and over the wire services.

So, although current official data are unavailable, there exist numerous

unofficial sources of the data. The Appendix to Dominguez and Frankel

(1993c) provides a listing of all the news of intervention activity (as well as

more general exchange rate policy announcements) by central banks reported

in the Wall Street Journal, the London Financial Times and the New York

Times over the period 1982 through 1990. Non-reported interventions are not



    6
        Dominguez and Frankel (1993c) provide a detailed description of this
process.
    '  Exceptions include Neumann (1984), Dominguez (1990a,b, 1992) and
Dominguez and Frankel (1993a,b,c) who were given access to Bundesbank
intervention data. There were even fewer exceptions in the case of Federal
Reserve Data prior to 1991.

        The daily U.S. data is now available with a one year lag.

                                       S
differentiated in central banks' official data, but one can roughly infer which

operations were secret by comparing the official data with published reports

of intervention activity in the financial press. Although traders may sometimes

know that central banks are intervening without such knowledge appearing in

the financial press, this relatively conservative accounting for reported

intervention reveals that the bulk of recent intervention is not secret. In the

empirical tests described in the next section 1 distinguish "secret" and

"reported" interventions to examine whether the distinction matters in the

volatility regressions.

         Regardless of whether interventions are made public, intervention
                             -
operations may influence         the   domestic monetary base. Nonsterilized

intervention operations involve a change in the domestic monetary base; they

are analogous to open-market operations except that foreign, rather than

domestic, assets are bought or sold. Sterilized operations involve an offsetting

domestic asset transaction that restores the original size of the monetary base.

The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is thought to fully and automatically

sterilize its intervention operations on a daily basis. In practice, the foreign

exchange trading room immediately reports its dollar sales to the open market

trading room, which then sells enough bonds to leave the daily U.S. money

supply unaffected. The Bundesbank also claims to sterilize their foreign




                                         6
 exchange intervention operations routinely as a technical matter.9
 Nevertheless, the general perception is that both the Fed and the Eundesbank

 have at times allowed intervention operations to influence monetary

 aggregates. Although the degree of monetary accommodation is limited to the

 extent that they both target their money supply growth.

          The standard monetary approach to exchange rate determination

 indicates that nonsterilized intervention will affect the level of the exchange

rate in proportion to the change in the relative supplies of domestic and foreign

money, just as any other form of monetary policy does. The effects of

sterilized intervention are less direct and more controversial. In portfolio-

balance models of exchange rate determination investors diversifst their

holdings among domestic and foreign assets based both on expected returns

and on the variance in returns. According to the theory, as long-as foreign

and domestic assets are considered outside assets and are imperfect substitutes

for each other in investor's portfolios, an intervention that changes the relative

outstanding supply of domestic assets will require a change in expected relative

returns. 10 This is likely to result in a change in the exchange rate.




        See Neumann and von Hagen (1991) for a detailed discussion of
German sterilization policy.
    °   Branson   and Henderson (1985) provide a survey and analysis of
portfolio balance models.

                                       7
        The second channel through which sterilized intervention can affect

the level of exchange rates         is known as the signalling channel.'1

Intervention operations affect exchange rates through the signalling channel

when they are used by central banks as a means of conveying (or signalling),

to the market, inside information - information known to central banks but not

the market - about future fundamentals. If market participants believe the

central bank intervention signals, then even though today's fundamentals do

not change when interventions occur, expectations of future fundamentals will

change. When the market revises its expectations of future fundamentals, it

also revises its expectations of the future spot exchange rate, which brings

about a change in the current rate. The magnitude of the signalling effect of

a sterilized intervention operation may exceed that of a nonsterilized operation,

depending on the magnitude of the future change in monetary policy that the

signal conveys.

        Is there empirical evidence that intervention operations affect the level

of exchange rates?      In 1982 the G-7 economic summit at Versailles

commissioned a comprehensive study of intervention policy in order to answer

this question. The (3-7 working group report, completed in 1983, draws no

firm conclusions, but suggests that the effects of sterilized interventions on the

exchange rate were (at most) small and transitory over the period 1973-198!


    " One of the first descriptions of the signalling channel can be found in
Mussa (1981).

                                       8
(Jurgenson 1983, Henderson and Sampson 1983). Studies of intervention

policy in the 1980s suggest that more recent operations may have been more

effective.'2   in particular, these studies find that intervention had a

statistically significant effect on exchange rates over the period 1985-1988

through both the portfolio balance and signalling channels, but that only the

signalling channel effect was economically significant.       Moreover, the

evidence suggests that coordinated intervention operations were more effective

than unilateral operations."

III. A Model of Daily and Weekly Exchange Rate Behavior

         It is standard to model exchange rates as forward looking processes

that are expectationally efficient with respect to public information. The

current spot rate can be represented as




    12 For example, Dominguez (1990a,b), Black (1992), Catte, Galli and
Rebeccheni (1992), Ghosh (1992) and Dominguez and Frankel (1993a,b,c).
However, Humpage (1989) finds little evidence of a statistical relationship
between intervention and exchange rates over this period.

    "Loopesko (1984) also finds this to be the case in the late 1970s.

                                     9

where ; is the current spot exchange rate (domestic currency per unit of

foreign currency) in log form, 5 is the discount factor,'4      is a vector of

exogenous driving variables, and f1 is the public information set at time t. If

intervention operations, denoted I,, provide relevant information to the market,

then they will enlarge the market's information set (0, C        0 + I)     and

influence the spot exchange rate, For example, if a central bank intervention

in support of the domestic currency signals future contractionary domestic

monetary policy, the domestic currency will appreciate relative to the foreign

currency:


            = (1
                 —S)   S'EI(z,+kIQ,) > (1 —O) okEg(z,÷kIot+It)             (2)


where, in this example, I represents an official purchase of domestic assets.

         In practice, exchange rate determination models that include variables

other than the current spot rate have had limited success in explaining short-

term movements of exchange rates.'5 Daily and weekly changes in the spot

 exchange rate appear to be largely driven by unanticipated news. At the same

 time, studies by Westerfield (1977) and Hsieh (1988) find evidence of

 unconditional leptokurtosis in exchange rate changes. This suggests that there

 exists temporal clustering in the variance of exchange rate changes: large

changes are followed by large changes, and small changes by small changes.

Hsieh (1989) and Diebold and Nerlove (1989) document that there is strong

evidence of autoregressive conditional beteroscedasticity (ARCH) in the one

step ahead prediction errors for daily and weekly dollar exchange rates.'6

They conclude that the disturbances in the exchange rate process are

uncorrelated but not stochastically independent. This suggests that even if

short-term exchange rate changes are not predictable, the variance of exchange

rate changes may be.

         if we denote the one period change in the exchange rate as i, then

an empirical model of exchange rate changes can be represented as


                              us,   = z,(3 + €,                          (3)

where ; includes news and intervention variables, and c1 is the disturbance

term. The conditional mean of the disturbance in (3) is E[cjR.]=0 (where

    now includes 'H) and the GARCH(1, 1) conditional variance is var[c


    16
         Engle   (1982) is the first application of ARCH to price data.
Bollerslev 's (1986) generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity
model (GARCH) extends the ARCH class of models to allow the conditional
variance of exchange rate prediction errors to depend on lagged conditional
variances as well as past sample variances.

= var[Ls, fit_li =     = cx.3 +   a1v1 + cv41.'1 If central bank intervention

does not signal future fundamentals, but instead is based on current movements

of the exchange rate, then E[e, I k-1I    0;   will not be an appropriate right-

hand-side variable in (3). Dozninguez and Frankel (1993c) find that the

intervention operations that took place in the mid-1980s cannot be well

explained on the basis of past exchange rate movements. But this hypothesis

will be tested in the next section of the paper.

         A GARCII specification of the conditional variance of the
disturbances in (3) allows for adaptive learning by market participants; the

variability of today's exchange rate depends on past variability. Diebold and

Nerlove (1989) suggest that the nature of incoming information in asset

markets may explain this nonlinear serial dependence. When signaLs are

relatively clear (i.e. easily and unambiguously interpretable) then, conditional

upon those signals, exchange rate volatility is likely to be low. When there

is disagreement about the meaning of incoming information, or when clearly

relevant and significant information is scarce, we would expect greater market

volatility" (Diebold and Nerlove 1989,19).

         A hypothesis that can be tested using the (JARCU model is that secret

interventions are inherently ambiguous signals and they are consequently more




    17
      The unconditional mean of the disturbance term is E[r]=O and the
unconditional variance is var[cj = var[asj a01(1-a1-a2).

                                         12
likely to increase uncertainty in the market. Secret interventions are likely to

be ambiguous signals of both intervention policy and future fundamentals.

Reported interventions presumably provide clearer signals of intervention

policy. Chosh (1992) and Kaminsky and Lewis (1993) test whether

intervention helps forecast future monetary policy. Both studies find evidence

that knowledge of intervention policy does improve predictions of future

monetary policy.

         flsieh (1988) finds evidence that both thy-of-week and holiday

dummy variables should be included as explanatory variables in daily exchange

rate GARCH models. Further, Hsieh (1989) shows that, in practice, it is

difficult to identify the correct number of lags to be included in the conditional

variance equation of a OARCH model. Bollerslev (1986), Hsieh (1989), and

Baiflie and Bollerslcv (1989) find evidence that the OARCH(1,1) using a

conditional Student : distribution, rather than the normal distribution, is the

most appropriate model for daily exchange rate data.'9 I follow this


    '   Kaniinsky and Lewis (1993) strongly reject the hypothesis that
intervention provides no information about future monetary policy. But they
find that subsequent monetary policy changes are frequently in the opposite
direction to what was signalled.
    '   Bollerslev (1986) estimates a GARCH(1,1) for daily exchange rate
observations for the period 1980 to 1985 using a conditional Student t
distribution. Baillie and Bollerslev (1989) estimate a GARCH(1,1) for daily
exchange rate observations for the period 1980 to 1985 using the Student r and
the power exponential distributions. Hsieh (1989) estimates a GARCH(1, 1) for
daily exchange rate observations for the period 1974 to 1983 using the normal,

convention and include thy-of-week and holiday dummy variables in the daily

model specification. Secret and reported intervention variables are included

separately in both the conditional mean and variance equations. In the

conditional mean equation, the intervention variables are included, so that

positive values denote purchases of dollars, and negative values denote official

dollar sales. In the conditional variance equation, intervention variables are

included in absolute value form.     J also include the spread between the

German or Japanese interbank interest rate and the U.S Federal Funds rate in

both the conditional mean and variance equations to control for relative

contemporaneous monetary policies in the three countriesY The
GARCH(1, 1) models of the $IDM and $fYen exchange rates that I estimate

have the following general specification:




Student z, GED, normal-Poisson, and normal.-lognormal distributions. All
three studies found that daily exchange rate data was best modelled with the
Student t distribution.

        In the daily model the German and Japanese interest rates are the
 interbank money spot offer rate (Reuters), and the U.S. interest rate is the
 effective Federal Funds rate (Federal Reserve Bank of New York). The source
 for these series is DRI. In the weekly model, the German data is the Repo rate
 (Monthly Report of the Bundesbank), the Japanese data is the Call Money rate
 (Fed H. 13 release) and the US data is the weekly average Federal Funds rate
 (Federal Reserve Board).

          The Fed and Bundesbank intervention data series used in the empirical

tests measure consolidated daily official foreign exchange transactions in

billions of dollars at current market values. The Fed data exclude so-called

"passive intervention operations. Passive interventions are Fed purchases and

sales of foreign currency with customers who would otherwise have dealt with

market agents? The Bundesbank data excludes non-discretionary
interventions required by EMS rules.

weakly heterosceda.stic. These findings are consistent with the previous

literature.

          The subsamples used in the empirical tests throughout the paper were

chosen on the basis of pre-announced intervention regime changes and data

availability. The first subsample includes the period January 1985 through
                                                                                    V

mid-February 1987.        During this period, which includes the Plaza
Agreement, the dollar fell by over 50% against the mark. In the early part

of subsample (1) the 0-5 central banks explicitly stated that their goal was to

depreciate the dollar. But by 1986 both the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan

indicated - both verbally and through their intervention operations - that the

dollar had fallen far enough, while the U.S. continued to 'taft" the dollar

down, but abstained from further interventions against the dollar.
Nevertheless, throughout the period the central banks' staled intention was to

affect the level rather than the variance of exchange rates. Subsample (2) is the

full sample over which the both the Bundesbank and Fed data are available,

January 1985 through December 1988. Subsample (3) covers the Post-Louvre

Accord period, February 1987 through December 1991. The G-7 (excepting
                                                                                    I,

and prospective changes in fundamentals, some orderly appreciation of the

and Governors] stand ready to cooperate more closely to encourage this when
to do so would be helpful' (05 Announcement, September 22, 1985).

nominaL exchange rates were "broadly consistent with underlying economic

 fundamentals" and should be stabilized at their current levels (0-6

 Communique, February 22, 1987). Subsample (4) is the full sample over

which the Fed data are available, January 1985 through December 1991.

          The statistics in Table 1 indicate that skewness and kurtosis are

generally significant in the raw daily and weekly $IDM and $IYen data.

Percentage changes in both the $IDM and $/Yen spot data consistently exhibit

a high degree of kurtosis over all subsamples for all but the weekly percentage

change in the $IDM rate. The Box-Pierce Q-statistic tests for high-order serial

correlation generally indicate that the squared percentage change spot data

exhibit substantially more autocortelation than the unsquared data.' This is

indicative of strong conditional heteroscedasticity. The first four sample

autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation coefficients for the raw $/DM and

$/Yen exchange rates over the full sample period are presented in the lower

portion of Table 1; they indicate homogeneous nonstationarity. The first lag

of the sample partial autocorrelation is approximately one, and subsequent lags

are insignificantly different from zero. Standard Dickey-Fuller tests for unit



       Two recent papers have examined whether dollar exchange rates in the
post-Louvre Accord period behaved as if they were in a target zone (Klein and
Lewis (1991), Baillie and Humpage (1992)),

        Under the null hypothesis of iid, the Q-statistic is asymptotically a chi-
squared distribution with x degrees of freedom. The null hypothesis requires
that x increase with the sample size but at a slower rate (Hsieh, 1989, 307).

roots fail to reject the hypothesis of a unit root in the daily and weekly spot

data over all subsamples, while the Hasza and Fuller (1979) test for two unit

roots is rejected.

IV. Estimation Results

         Tables 2a through 6b present estimates from the (3ARCH(l, 1)

exchange rate model described by equations (4)-(6) over the four subperiods

using daily and weekly $IDM and $/Yen data. Table numbers with the suffix

a present the daily model estimates, and table numbers with the suffix b

present the weekly model estimates. Tables 2a and 2b present estimates of the

conditional mean equation (4) over all four subperiods. Tables 3a through 6b

present estimates from three alternative specifications of the conditional

variance equation. Each table covers one of the four subperiods. Table 7

presents results of Granger-Causality tests of the GARCH conditional variance

and the independent variables from the model.

         Although the focus of this paper is the influence of exchange rate

policy on the volatility of exchange rates, it is interesting to examine the

results from the GARCH conditional mean equation. The results from the
                                                                                   I
daily model, presented in Table 2a, indicate that the day-of-the-week dummy

variables are statistically significant in samples (2) and (4) for both the $IDM

and $/Yen exchange rates. The holiday dummy variable is never statistically

significant. The coefficients on the reported intervention variables are



                                      20
     generally significant. But the coefficient sign on the intervention variables is

     typically positive, suggesting that on the day following a dollar supporting

     intervention operation, the dollar felt in value. Reported Fed intervention in

'w   the Plaza period, however, is significant and negative for the $/DM rate. The

     coefficient on the News variable is also negative and generally highly

     significant over all the subperiods. The interest rate spread variable is never

     significant.    The GARCI-I-in-mean term is always positive and often

     significant, suggesting that higher volatility generally led to dollar depreciation

     over this period. Estimates using the weekly data, presented in Table 2b,

     provide similar results in terms of the signs on the coefficients. However,

     particularly in the $/Yen equations, few of the coefficients in the weekly

     regressions are statistically significant.

              Tables 3a through 6b include three specifications of the conditional

     variance equation. The first is a basic GARCH(1 , 1) model excluding the

     additional exchange rate policy variables, the second is the specification

     described in equation (6), and the third is a modified version of equation (6)

     where the intervention variables are included as (0,1) dummy variables rather

     than as magnitudes. It may be that what influences volatility is the presence

     of central banks in the market, regardLess of the magnitude of the actual

     intervention operation. The (lARCH model specification that includes only

     dummy variables allows a test of this hypothesis.



                                             21
        A number of regression diagnostics are presented at the bottom of the

tables: (in L) denotes the value of the log-likelihood function, p denotes the

number of iterations that were needed to reach model convergence, Q(x) and

Q,(x) denote the Box-Pierce Q-statistic (with x lags) for the standardized

residuals (z=c1(vJ)   and   the squared standardized residuals, respectively.

According to the distributional assumptions in equation (5), the standardized

residuals should be normally distributed if the GARCII model accounts fully

for the leptokurtic unconditional distribution. The standardized residuals from

all the regression specifications over all subsamples have mean values that are

insignificantly different from zero and variance values that are approximately

equal to one. Further, the absolute size of both the Q-statistics and the

coefficients of skewness and kurtosis in the standardized residuals is generally

smaller than that of the unadjusted residuals, presented in Table I, providing

support for the GARCU models.

         The estimates in Tables 3a and 3b are for the pre-Louvre Accord

subsample, January 1985 through mid-February 1987. The first three

explanatory variables included in the first and fourth columns of Table 3a are
                                                                                   'a

generally highly significant, indicating that the GARCH parameters (cv43,a1,a2)

have explanatory power in the daily model. The magnitude of the coefficient

on the lagged conditional variance, a1, is about .8 and highly significant,

indicating that the variance effect is highly persistent. In both the $/DM and



                                      22
$/Yen equations reported Fed and Bundesbank intervention are significant and

negative, indicating that intervention reduced volatility in this subperiod. In. the

$/Yen equations the interest rate spread variabLe is also significant and

negative. The distribution parameter n is highly significant and relatively

small, suggesting that the disturbances are not normally distributed.

         The estimates of the distribution parameter ii in the GARCH models

using weekly $/DM and $/Yen data were generally extremely large (greater

than 500) over all the subperiods, indicating that the disturbances from the

weekly model are approximately normally distributed. Therefore the weekly

conditional variance equations were estimated assuming normally distributed

disturbances. The log-likelihood function for the weekly GARCH(l,1) models

is given by:


                                     T                    2
                       L7(O)=!_!1ogv+.!L

                                                                              (8)


where 8=QS,cw44').        The standard GAItCH model using the normal

distribution contains a potentially important restriction in the conditional

variance function. Intuitively, this functional form forces larger innovations

in t1 to increase volatility at a rate proportional to the square of the size of the

innovation. Engle and Ng (1992) provide a set of diagnostics that test the

restrictions in GARtH models with normally distributed disturbances. The

row labeled E&N at the bottom of each of the tables presenting weekly results


                                         23
indicates whether any coefficient estimate from the Engle and Ng (1992)

diagnostic regression indicates that the (JARCU restrictions are violated.

         In the weekly models over the pre-Louvre subperiod, the only

GARCIT parameter that is significant is the lagged conditional variance. In the      t

$/DM equations the variance effect is similar in size to that in the daily model.
                                                                                     I,
The variance effect is much smaller in the weekly $fYen equations. Reported

Bundeshank intervention magnitudes are significant for both the $/DM rate and

the $/Yen rate, but the sign on the coefficient is not the same. In the $/DM

case Bundesbank intervention increased volatility and in the $/Yen case

Bundesbank intervention reduced volatility. Secret intervention is significant

for both currencies and always positive. The interest rate spread variable is

also highly significant and positive for the $/DM rate.

         Tables 4a and 4b present estimates for the full period over which the

Bundesbank data is available, 1985 through 1988. The three GARCII

parameters are again highly statistically significant in the daily equations and

the daily variance effect is highly persistent. The holiday dummy variable is

now positive and significant. In the weekly tests, the size of the coefficient on
                                                                                     S

 the conditional variance term remains high for the $/DM rate, and is about .3

 for the $IYen rate. In the daily (lARCH estimates both secret intervention and

 the interest rate spread variable are significant and positive for the $/DM rate.

 1301 intervention is significant and positive, and Bundesbank intervention is

 significant and negative for the $/Yen rate. In the weekly (lARCH estimates,

                                       24
presented in table 4b, the coefficient on publicly known Fed intervention is

negative and generally statistically significant for both currencies. This

suggests that, overall, Fed intervention that was known to market participants

decreased weekly volatility over the period 1985 through 1988. Likewise, the

coefficient on secret intervention is generally significant but positive for both

currencies. Bundesbank intervention is significant and differs in sign over the

two currencies. BOJ intervention is also significant and positive for the $/Yen

rate.

         Tables Sa and Sb present estimates over the post-Louvre subsample,

starting in late Febniary 1987 through December 1991. The three GARCH

parameters and the holiday dummy variable continue to be statistically

significant over this period for the daily data. In the weekly tests the

coefficient on the conditional variance term is significant and about .8 for both

the $/DM and $IYen rates. The coefficient estimates on reported Fed

intervention and the interest rate spread variable are significant and positive

in both the daily and weekly models for the $/DM rate.              Secret Fed

intervention is positive and significant in both the daily and weekly models for

both currencies. In the weekly tests BOJ intervention is generally significant

and negative for both currencies. The Engle and Ng (1992) diagnostic test

indicates that there remains positive size bias in the weekly model for the

$/DM rate. Nelson's (1991) exponential GARCH (EGARCH) model provides



                                       25
an alternative specification that allows large innovations to have a larger

impact on the conditional variance.3° EOARCR estimates of the conditional

variance of the $IDM rate over this period provided essentially identical results

for the parameters of interest as those reported in the tables.

         Tables 6a and 6b provide the final set of conditional variance equation

estimates over the full period over which Fed data are available, 1985 through

1991. The daily CARCH parameters continue to be highly significant.

Likewise the weekly lagged conditional variance and sample variance are now

both significant. The holiday dummy is positive and always significant; the

size of the coefficient suggests that exchange rate volatility increased by

between 0.15 and 0.19 when the market reopened after a holiday. In the daily

$/DM models the interest rate spread variable is positive and significant. In the

weekly $/Yen models both BOJ intervention and the exchange rate news

variable are significantly positive. The reported Fed intervention variable is

marginally significant and negative for both currencies in both the daily and

weekly regressions. The average reported Fed dollar purchase and sale over

this period is $213 million, and the average sample variance of the daily

percentage change in the $/DM and $IYen rates is 0.601 and 0.472,

respectively. So the average effect of publicly known Fed intervention is to

reduce daily volatility by approximately .06 for both currencies. A similar

calculation for the weekly data suggests that reported Fed intervention reduces

weekly volatility by approximately .04.' Secret intervention is generally

significantly positive in the regressions. The average daily secret Fed dollar

purchase and sale over this period is $97 million, so the average effect of

secret Fed intervention is to increase daily volatility by approximately .02 for

the $/DM rate and .06 for the $fYen rate. On a weekly basis, secret Fed

dollar purchases and sales averaged $138 million, so the average effect of

these operations is to increase weekly volatility by approximately .03.

         Overall, reported Fed intervention reduced exchange rate volatility

over the period 1985 through 1991. However, the subsample results suggest

that reported Fed intervention reduced volatility in the period 1985 through

1988 and increased volatility over the period 1989 through 1991.
Interestingly, in 1989 there is evidence from FOMC meeting minutes that it

       The average reported weekly Fed purchase and sale over this period
was $500 million, and the average sample variance of the weekly percentage

average effect of publicly known Fed intervention on volatility is: (Ov/8I)(I/v).

was the US Treasury, and not the Fed, that dictated U.S. intervention

policy? The minutes suggest that a number of the Fed Board members were

uncomfortable with the heavy dollar selling intervention operations in 1989,

because Fed monetary policy was relatively contractionary during this period.

Governors Angell and Johnson, in particular, were concerned that the Fed was

sending the market mixed signals.33 Reported Bundesbank intervention

consistently reduced daily exchange rate volatility over the period 1985

through 1988. Reported Eundesbank intervention also reduced volatility in the

weekly $/Yen data. But Bundesbank intervention increased volatility in the

weekly $/DM rate over the period 1985 through 1988. Fed and Bundesbank

intervention operations that were not picked up by the financial press
consistently increased volatility over all the periods for both currencies. The

sign and significance of the intervention variables measured in magnitudes or

dummy variable form were quite similar. This result confirms that just the

presence of a central bank in the foreign exchange market influences volatility.

         The results from the various conditional variance equations indicate

that intervention and exchange rate volatility are often correlated, but it may


    n In the US, the Treasury department has official jurisdiction over foreign
exchange intervention policy. In practice the Treasury Department and the
Fed typically jointly decide when the US should be in the market, kit on
occasion a decision may be made by Treasury over the objections of the Fed.
Even though the Treasury can mandate intervention policy, it is the Federal
Reserve Bank of New York that actually implements the policy.

be that volatility causes intervention, rather than the other way around. This

gets us back to the issue of whether intervention is truly an exogenous signal,

or whether it is based on past exchange rate changes. Changer's (1969)

causality regressions provide a test for this possibility. One variable (3 ranger-

causes another, if forecasts of the second variable can be improved by using

past observations of the first variable in addition to past observations of the

second variable. Tables 7a and lb present F-statistics from a series of

(hanger-causality tests using reported and secret intervention magnitudes, the

intervention dummy variables, and the news and interest rate spread variables

in separate regressions.TM The tests regress each explanatory variable on its

own past lags and past lags of the conditional variance from the GARCH

models. The null hypothesis is that all the lags of the conditional variance are

equal to zero. The F-statistics reported in the table suggest that volatility does

not Granger-cause the reported intervention variables in either magnitude or

dummy variable form. This is also the case for the news and interest rate

spread variables, However, this hypothesis is often rejected for secret Fed

intervention in subperiod (3), the post-Louvre Accord subsample. This

evidence suggests that the Fed entered the market secretly when the foreign

exchange market was volatile over this period. This result will be the subject

of further investigation.

V. Conclusions

         The results in the previous section suggest that exchange rate policy

variables belong in daily GARCH models of the exchange rate. Changes in

relative contemporaneous monetary policy and intervention policy were often

found to influence the conditional variance of exchange rates. Granger-.

causality tests, moreover, suggest that it is not volatility that causes
intervention. However, the tests suggest that volatility may make the Fed more

likely to keep its intervention secret.

         One of the more surprising results in the paper is that intervention

need not be publicly known in order that it influence volatility. Secret

interventions were generally found to increase volatility. This result provides

evidence in support of the Diebold and Nerlove (1989) hypothesis that the

more ambiguous are signals, the higher is volatility.

         The evidence provided in this paper suggests that intervention had

mixed effects on volatility. The regression estimates suggest that secret central

bank exchange rate policy did increase volatility, but secrt interventions make

up less than 20% of all intervention operations. Reported central bank

intervention over the full period generally led to a reduction in both daily and

weekly exchange rate volatility, Overall, therefore, intervention policy in the

19 SOs did not increase the volatility of foreign exchange rates.
