                     FIRMS' CHOICE OF METHOD OF PAY


                                  ABSTRACT


      Three types of pay-setting methods are piece rates (pay mechanically linked

to output), merit pay (pay based on less formal judgments by one's supervisor),

and standard rates (pay based on one's job classification and perhaps seniority,

but not directly on performance). Firms' choice among methods depends on

balancing the gains from more precise links between performance and pay against

the costs of either precise or judgmental measures of output. Using data from the

BLS Industry Wage Study program, hypotheses suggested by this observation are

tested and for the most part confirmed,
