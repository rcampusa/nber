                                         ABSTRACT

India, seeking to reduce electricity shortages, set up a new power market, in which transmission
constraints sharply limit trade between regions. I use confidential bidding data to estimate the
costs of power supply and simulate market outcomes with more transmission capacity. I find that
the returns to building transmission hinge on market conduct. Under a competitive model of
supply, transmission investments roughly breakeven. Under a strategic model, the same
transmission expansion increases market surplus by 19 percent, enough to justify the investment,
because low-cost sellers increase supply in response to a more integrated grid.

1     Introduction

Is power scarce in India? In a narrow sense the answer is clearly yes. At the retail level, roughly

300 million Indian citizens, one-quarter of the population, are not connected to the electric

grid, and for those on the grid, the government conservatively estimates supply to be ten

percent short of demand (International Energy Agency, 2011; Central Electricity Authority,

2011b).1 Yet this ground-level scarcity is obscured in a broader view of the power sector. In

the face of rationing, we might expect plants to be running non-stop, but the utilization of

generators is instead low (Malik et al., 2011). Nor has the rapid addition of generating capacity

     The real costs of this shortage are starting to be documented, for example in terms of foregone manufac-
turing output (Economist, 2012; Allcott, Collard-Wexler and O’Connell, 2014). Many customers without grid
power run their own costly generators instead (Nag, 2010).


                                                      1
lessened shortages over time (Bhattacharya and Patel, 2008).2 Shortages, therefore, are not

due to an absolute physical scarcity, but a host of constraints, from distorted retail prices to

limits on wholesale trade, that prevent the economic production and allocation of electricity

(Wolak, 2008). India recently began to address these constraints by adopting market-oriented

reforms in the power sector in order to increase private investment and intra-national trade

(Thakur et al., 2005).3

       Countries around the world have similarly restructured their electricity sectors, from in-

tegrated utilities towards open markets, to try to provide better signals for investment and

supply (Joskow, 2008). Experience has shown that the efficiency of wholesale electricity mar-

kets, and in particular the degree of market power they admit, is very sensitive to market

conditions (Borenstein, Bushnell and Wolak, 2002; Puller, 2007) and market design, for exam-

ple arrangements for bidding or vertical contracting (Reguant, 2014; Bushnell, Mansur and

Saravia, 2008) or limits to arbitrage between sequential market segments (Ito and Reguant,

2016). In theory, market power should also depend critically on transmission infrastructure,

which determines the extent of competition on the grid (Borenstein, Bushnell and Stoft, 2000;

Joskow and Tirole, 2000).

       This paper studies the effect of transmission constraints on the competitiveness of a new

wholesale power market in India, created by the recent reform. Given the state of the Indian

power sector and the proven sensitivity of power markets, an important question is how

adverse initial conditions affected the benefits from opening up wholesale trade.

       I take the day-ahead market as a window on the effect of transmission constraints on

the whole power system. This market is fairly well-integrated with other short-term power

trade, but disproportionately affected by transmission constraints, making it the right segment

in which to study this problem. Private-sector firms are also overrepresented on the day-

ahead market. While the market is active and unconcentrated, it does not follow that it is

competitive, since 46 percent of the time the grid is congested, meaning more power cannot

physically flow between regions. When the grid is congested, suppliers may be able to raise

prices in the thinner, regional markets that are broken off by transmission constraints. Indeed,
   2
      Peak demand exceeded supply by 18 percent in 1996, 13 percent in 2002 and 13 percent in 2011 (Central
Electricity Authority, 2011b).
    3
      The Electricity Act of 2003 delicensed power generation, allowed open access to the power grid and estab-
lished power exchanges to encourage trade. An important precursor to this Act was the Electricity Regulatory
Commissions Act of 1998, which established state regulators in order to rationalize the process of setting retail
tariffs.


                                                       2
I present reduced-form evidence that binding transmission constraints greatly increase market

concentration and decrease the magnitude of the elasticity of residual demand faced by sellers

in constrained regions, thus raising the incentives of sellers to exercise market power.

   The empirical approach of this paper is to build a model of supply bidding in a constrained

power grid, to estimate how much market surplus would have changed, if transmission capacity

were greater. I use confidential data on hourly bids, offers and transmission constraints in

the day-ahead market. I calculate conditions for profit-maximizing supply offers given the

competition that strategic sellers face over the grid, and then use these conditions as moments

to estimate the marginal costs of electricity supply (Wolak, 2003; Reguant, 2014). Because

transmission congestion curtails power flows and thus competition across regions, I innovate

by constructing the moment conditions for each seller to reflect the competing offers, and

hence the residual demand, they face within their own region of the grid. This local residual

demand depends on the distribution of others’ bids and the transmission constraints those

bids cause to bind, which can have large effects on optimal bidding.

   For example, consider a firm in a region that is importing electricity competing with a

supplier in another region. Such a firm would typically respond to the competing supplier

bidding more aggressively (offering more elastic supply) by bidding more aggressively itself.

However, if the competitor increases its offered quantity enough to cause an import constraint

to bind, then the firm in the importing region becomes isolated from further competition, and

may instead withhold in order to raise prices. This may be important in the Indian market: in

the frequently constrained North region, conditional on an import constraint binding, prices

are 39 percent higher than in the rest of the grid. It is not clear, from such simple comparisons,

to what extent this difference is due to regional differences in cost versus the exercise of market

power.

   With estimated costs in hand, I simulate counterfactual outcomes to trace out how market

surplus would increase if more transmission capacity was built. In these simulations I vary

assumptions on market conduct to isolate whether gains in surplus are mainly due to increases

in trade across regions with different costs of supply or valuations for electricity, or to the

mitigation of market power. Under competitive conduct, sellers are assumed to offer power at

cost using the same supply functions in counterfactuals as in the data. Market surplus may

increase with more transmission capacity because power can flow from those offering at the


                                                3
lowest cost and to those willing to pay the highest price, regardless of where they are located.

Under strategic conduct, I restrict strategic sellers to Cournot (quantity) strategies and vary

whether these quantities are allowed to respond to the expansion of the grid (endogenous

bids) or not (fixed bids). I argue that the Cournot simuluation with endogenous bids is the

best representation of counterfactual outcomes in this setting. Market surplus in this scenario

may change due to regional differences in cost and demand, as under competition, but may

additionally change because sellers, facing greater competition in a more integrated grid, offer

more supply. The fixed-quantity bid scenario serves as a benchmark to separate these channels

for surplus gains, since it uses the same form of bidding as Cournot but does not allow this

strategic response.

   The main finding of the paper is that the surplus gains from simulated transmission

expansions are much larger under strategic conduct than under competitive conduct. In a

strategic model of supply, counterfactual increases in import capacity to the North and South

regions large enough to nearly eliminate congestion produce estimated gains of 19 percent of

the total baseline market surplus. By comparison with counterfactuals that hold the quantities

of strategic sellers fixed, I calculate that 81 percent of this welfare gain is due to transmission

expansion decreasing market power. Competitive counterfactuals, wherein supply offers are

fixed, but quantity supplied may respond because these offers are price-quantity functions,

also show markedly lower gains in surplus than the full strategic counterfactuals. That is to

say, the primary cost of transmission constraints is that the best strategy for generators when

transmission constraints bind is to withhold power to raise prices against inelastic demand.

Consonant with this finding, most of the surplus gains from new transmission accrue in

exporting regions, whose sellers are able to supply more and at higher prices when they can

reach distant but high-demand customers. Importing regions have modest net gains in surplus

because undercutting sellers’ market power, and hence surplus, offsets the gains to the buy

side of the market from lower prices and greater quantity. (In the import-constrained North

region, this effect is large enough that expanding import capacity actually lowers total surplus

for the North region overall.)

   A second finding is that these potential investments in transmission create net gains in

surplus under strategic conduct but are marginal under competitive conduct. I compare the

social benefits, or increased surplus, from transmission expansion to the costs of building the


                                                4
needed infrastructure. Because transmission investment is subject to cost-plus regulation,

good data on the costs of existing transmission system elements is available from regulatory

rulings. I apply this cost data to proposed grid expansion plans, in order to estimate the

investment needed to relieve congestion at the margin. Under strategic Cournot conduct,

expansions of transmission capacity into the North and South regions have estimated benefit-

cost ratios of 1.65 and 3.24, respectively, indicating that greater transmission capacity between

regions would increase social surplus. By contrast, under competitive conduct, the case for

additional transmission investment looks marginal, with benefit-cost ratios slightly below one.

Thus the gains from infrastructure investment depend on market conduct and, conversely, the

success of the market has been limited by transmission infrastructure.

       This paper contributes to the literature on the determinants of market power in electricity

markets. One line of studies of market power uses observed cost data to simulate market prices

and quantities and then compares these simulated market outcomes to observed outcomes.4

This paper follows a parallel stream of literature that instead backs out marginal cost from

observed bidding behavior and simulates the impact of changes in market structure on mar-

ket outcomes (Gans and Wolak, 2008; Reguant, 2014). The role of transmission in mitigating

market power has been less studied empirically.5 Wolak (2012) studies the competitive effects

of transmission constraints, in the Alberta market, by predicting in reduced-form the offers

strategic suppliers would have made, if lower congestion had raised the elasticity of residual

demand they faced. This paper extends the literature by using the structure of the transmis-

sion grid in the estimation of costs and emphasizing the role of transmission in determining

market power. Knowledge of the grid structure and transmission constraints allow me to

estimate costs and structural counterfactual outcomes that account for congestion.

       The setting of the study is also novel, in an economically meaningful way, because the
   4
     Wolfram (1999) finds prices in the UK market above cost but below the predictions of most oligopoly
models. Borenstein, Bushnell and Wolak (2002) find that market power in California’s restructured wholesale
electricity market resulted for 59 percent of the nearly $7 billion rise in expenditures between 1999 and 2000.
Bushnell, Mansur and Saravia (2008) show that vertical arrangements are an important reason why these high
prices do not generally obtain in U.S. markets.
   5
     Davis and Hausman (2014) study the costs of a nuclear plant closure in California that induced transmission
constraints to bind. Mansur and White (2012) show how centralized as opposed to bilateral market-clearing
improves market efficiency, an effect mainly due to better aggregation of information about transmission
constraints. A related literature on congestion in operations research has focused on solution concepts for
complex transmission networks (Neuhoff et al., 2005; Benjaming F. Hobbs and Pang, 2000; Xu and Baldick,
2007). A range of other empirical papers on electricity markets have noted the importance of congestion in
the markets under study without analyzing it explicitly (Hortaçsu and Puller, 2008; Bushnell, Mansur and
Saravia, 2008; Allcott, 2012; Reguant, 2014).



                                                       5
Indian power market has some features that differ sharply from the norm in markets in

developed countries, such as a lack of financial contracting and elastic demand from electricity

distribution companies (i.e., distribution companies that allow blackouts rather than pay a

high price for power). I believe this paper is the first micro-econometric study of a wholesale

power market in a developing country.6 Empirical evidence on market power in this setting

is therefore important, because it is not clear a priori whether, for example, more elastic

wholesale demand due to the use of retail-level rationing might reduce the ability of wholesale

suppliers to raise prices.

        There is a growing literature in development economics on the effects of market integration

due to many types of public infrastructure projects, of which transmission can be taken as

an example.7 Most of this literature considers competitive markets like agriculture, whereas

I focus empirically on the effects of infrastructure specific to imperfectly competitive markets

like electricity generation. In such markets, the gains from economic integration may come

as much through reductions in market power as through changes in production cost.

        The rest of the paper runs as follows. Section 2 describes the Indian power sector and the

nature of transmission congestion. Section 3 introduces the data. Section 4 introduces a model

of supplier bidding and a related counterfactual model of supply and Section 5 describes the

estimation strategy. Section 6 presents estimated firm costs. Section 7 presents the estimated

benefits and costs of counterfactual transmission expansions and Section 8 concludes.



2        The Indian electricity sector

The Indian electricity sector is characterized by persistent imbalances. Artificially low agri-

cultural and domestic tariffs and large distribution losses have perpetuated retail shortages

and huge financial losses in electricity distribution (Wolak, 2008). Generation, traditionally

the province of the state and central governments, was opened to private investment, but such
    6
      Several papers survey the experience of developing and transition countries with different stages of elec-
tricity liberalization (Bacon and Besant-Jones, 2001; Jamasb, 2005; Williams and Ghanadan, 2006). Other
studies, such as Zhang, Parker and Kirkpatrick (2008), estimate cross-country regressions to evaluate electricity
reform in a structure-conduct-performance paradigm.
    7
      Mobile phone infrastructure increases the efficiency of market allocation under perfect competition (Jensen,
2007). Transport infrastructure that lowers the cost of trade raises incomes, but with complex effects on
the pattern of factor allocation and production across space (Jensen, 2007; Donaldson, 2012; Faber, 2014;
Banerjee, Duflo and Qian, 2012; Donaldson and Hornbeck, 2013). Electricity distribution networks have been
found to increase labor supply, labor productivity and housing values (Lipscomb, Mobarak and Barham, 2013;
Dinkleman, 2011). McRae (2014) studies the adverse incentive effects of subsidies for electricity consumption
on distribution investment and service quality in Colombia.


                                                        6
investment remained low given that the most prominent buyers, distribution companies, were

bankrupt monopsonists in their respective states (Bhattacharya and Patel, 2008).

       The Electricity Act of 2003 was a major reform intended to correct some of the structural

problems with the electricity sector in India and to create a larger role for market forces. This

reform touched on nearly every aspect of electricity generation, transmission and distribution

but was particularly meant to foster competition and private supply by opening access to the

power grid across the country (Thakur et al., 2005). The Act sanctioned wholesale markets

for electricity and in 2008 a day-ahead market, which gets its name for hosting trade one

day ahead of when the power is to be delivered, opened. The following subsections place the

day-ahead market, the focus of this paper, in the context of the Indian electricity sector.


(a)      Generation and Ownership

India’s power sector is small for a country of its size. The peak generation in India of 110

GW on capacity of 187 GW in 2010, serving about 900 million grid-connected customers of

a population of 1.2 billion, is comparable to the 127 GW peak on 167 GW of capacity in the

Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) market, which serves 51 million people (Central

Electricity Authority, 2011b, 2012b; International Energy Agency, 2011). Thermal plants

generate the bulk of electricity: in 2010-11, coal plants generated 69 percent of the country’s

electricity, gas 12 percent, and hydroelectric 14 percent, with the balance from nuclear and

imports (Central Electricity Authority, 2011c). Outside the formal power sector, India also

has a large number of captive generating units.8

       Electricity generation remains dominated by state actors but the role of the private sector

has grown rapidly in the last decade. In 2003, the year the Electricity Act was passed, the

private sector held 10 percent of total generation capacity, but that increased to 18 percent

in 2010 and leapt up to 31 percent by 2013 (Central Electricity Authority, 2011a). (This

tripling of capacity share represents a six-fold increase in private-sector megawatts against a

backdrop of overall capacity roughly doubling.) The short-term electricity markets, described

in detail below, have private sector participation above the private share in capacity overall.

Large state producers sell most of their capacity through long-term physical contracts well
   8
    Captive units are owned by particular industrial, commercial or residential facilities for their own use.
Total captive generation capacity was estimated at 25 GW in 2010 (13 percent of grid generation capacity)
(Nag, 2010).



                                                     7
in advance of delivery, whereas private plants wait to sell until closer to delivery. Thus in

the day-ahead market state utilities provided 20 percent of cleared sell volumes in 2009 and

a mere 7 percent in 2010 (author’s calculation). Aside from private firms devoted to selling

power, industrial plants in other businesses commonly buy and sell power in the wholesale

market from their captive capacity.


(b)    Segments of the Wholesale Electricity Market

There are three ways to trade wholesale electricity in India: bilateral contracts between buyers

and sellers, the day-ahead market and a real-time balancing mechanism called unscheduled

interchange. These segments differ in when electricity is traded relative to the date of delivery,

how prices are set and regulatory limits on trade. While the empirical analysis will treat the

day-ahead market in isolation, it is helpful to understand where this market fits in the context

of other market segments.

    Consider the market segments moving forward in time towards the date when electricity

is physically delivered. Most trade happens through bilateral contracts set more than one

year in advance of delivery, which are called long-term. In fiscal 2010, 90 percent of total

electricity generation (809.45 terawatt-hours) was traded on long-term contracts, typically

between state-owned generators and distribution companies for a large share of a generator’s

output (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, 2011). The remaining trade, less than

one year in advance of delivery, is called short-term. Bilateral contracts set less than one year

in advance of delivery, called short-term contracts, comprise a further 5 percent of generation.

These contracts are mediated by power traders and most often apply to daily or monthly

blocks covering all hours in a day. The last opportunity for scheduled power trade is the

day-ahead market, which handles 2 percent of generation. Scheduled power is reported to the

system operator before delivery. The balance of about 3 percent of generation is not scheduled,

but demanded and supplied in real time in regulated quantities and at administered prices

through a mechanism called unscheduled interchange (UI) (Described in Appendix A).

    Despite very different market rules across segments, the short-term market, consisting of

short-term contracts, the day-ahead market and balancing, is fairly well integrated. Contract

price levels have been near or above day-ahead prices.9 These prices move closely together.
   9
     For example, the prices of electricity transacted on the power exchanges in fiscal 2010 averaged USD 69.40
per megawatt-hour (MWh), lower than the prices through contracts (USD 95.8/MWh).


                                                      8
Appendix Table A1 shows the correlations between prices across the different short-term mar-

ket segments. The correlation between day-ahead prices on the Indian Energy Exchange, from

which this paper uses data, and the Power Exchange India, the other day-ahead exchange, is

0.92 at hourly frequency and 0.98 at weekly frequency. This high correlation, which is natural

given that bidders can move freely between the exchanges, implies that the use of only IEX

data in this paper represents conduct on both day-ahead market exchanges accurately. The

power exchange prices are also fairly highly correlated with prices on other market segments.

The correlation between the IEX price and balancing prices is 0.60 at hourly frequency and

0.81 at weekly frequency, and with short-term market prices is 0.71 at weekly frequency.

   If sequential markets were perfectly integrated, and neglecting uncertainty, we may ex-

pect prices to move exactly together. However, in practice there are limits to arbitrage across

segments in electricity markets (Ito and Reguant, 2016). In the Indian market, these limits

include rules limiting how much market participants can adjust their advance schedules in

real time and differing treatment of transmission congestion across segments. The Appendix

describes regulatory limits to arbitrage between the scheduled day-ahead market and un-

scheduled interchange, including penalties designed to prevent sellers from withholding power

from the schedule and supplying it through UI instead. Neglecting these differences, it is

clear that the short-term market segments move closely together. Moreover, when there is

no transmission corridor available on the day-ahead market, there is no corridor left for other

markets either. Therefore, analysis on how transmission congestion affects conduct in the

day-ahead market segment will apply in part to other market segments, for which micro-data

is not available. I interpret the implications of the empirical results for other market segments

in Section 7 (c).

   It may be hard to imagine how the electricity market clears with such a small share of trade

in the day-ahead market (two percent) and indeed in all short-term segments together (ten

percent less than one year, five percent less than one day). The simplest explanation is that

the market does not clear, since the sector has an extra degree of freedom in shedding up to 13

percent of load in peak hours (Central Electricity Authority, 2011b). Market institutions also

tend to discourage short-term trade. For example, due to restrictive financial regulation, India

has no forward financial contracting tied to electricity spot prices (Sharma and Vashishtha,

2007). Thus suppliers in the Indian market day-ahead market earn the day-ahead price on


                                               9
their entire cleared quantity, which makes waiting to buy or sell power risky.10

       The overall picture of short-term power trade is then of linked but still imperfectly inte-

grated markets. Buyers and sellers arbitrage to some extent between the short-term contract,

day-ahead and UI segments, but these markets do not offer perfect substitutes.


(c)      Transmission Capacity and Charges

Power that is traded on any platform must flow through the electricity grid. The high-voltage,

long-distance transmission lines that carry power between regions have physical limits on how

much power they can carry, determined by engineering standards. These physical limits are

not the last word on the declared capacity of a line: the system operator, here the National

Load Dispatch Centre (NLDC), accounts for externalities in the power grid and a reliability

margin in determining how much power can flow on various paths. The transmission capacity

set between regions is then allocated in an administrative manner prioritizing first long-

term trade, then short-term contracts and lastly the day-ahead market (Central Electricity

Regulatory Commission, 2008a, see Appendix A for details). The net effect of the allocation

process is that the day-ahead market becomes the residual claimant on transmission capacity

across the system and is greatly exposed to transmission congestion.

       The pricing of transmission does not reflect its scarcity. In the Indian market, transmis-

sion charges are flat per MWh “postage stamp” charges that apply to use of the grid and

transmission across regions, regardless of the available capacity at the time of use.11 I neglect

these transmission charges in the analysis below as they are small, about four percent of the

mean energy price, and would not change in any counterfactual scenario.


(d)       The Day-Ahead Electricity Market

The day-ahead market is the best channel through which to study the role of congestion

in the Indian market as all bids are associated with a region of the grid and it is the only
  10
     By contrast, in the PJM (United States), NEM1 (Australia) and Spanish markets, 90 percent, 88 percent
and 91 percent of physical output has been covered by financial contracts by the time power is traded in the
spot market, meaning that the supplier offering power is not exposed to the spot market price (Allcott, 2012;
Wolak, 2007; Reguant, 2014).
  11
     During the period of study, for bilateral contracts, the selling party was responsible for a charge of USD
1.6/MWh for connecting to the national grid and an additional USD 1.6/MWh for each region through which
the power traded is to flow, up to USD 4.8/MWh (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, 2008a). On
the power exchange, transactions are subject to comparable transmission charges of USD 2/MWh separately
for the buyer and seller.

segment where market clearance directly prices the scarcity due to congestion. The market is

a double-sided auction conducted every day for each of 24 hourly blocks the following day.12

Bidders can submit both single bids, which are functions from price to quantity for a single

hour, and block bids, which specify the maximum willingness-to-pay of a buyer or minimum

willingness-to-accept of a seller on average over a continuous block of hours.

       As shown in Figure 1, Panel A, the power exchange designates bids as coming from one

of ten subregions. I group these ten subregions into the six regions for which transmission

constraints ever bind—North, East, Northeast, West, South 1 and South 2—shown in Figure 1,

Panel B.13 The physical grid is more complex than shown in Figure 1, Panel B, but this

structure represents the binding links in the system very well and is therefore used by the

system operator to designate available transmission capacity, check for binding transmission

constraints and report these constraints to the exchange. The West and East regions form a

central core. Exports from this core to the demand centers of the North and South 1 regions

are often constrained by transmission capacity. The South 2 region is further removed from

the core and only accessible via wheeling (i.e., transshipment) of power through South 1. The

Northeast region, a source of cheap hydropower, is linked to the core through the East.

       Institutional evidence suggests that market participants in the day-ahead market should

be treated as strategic profit-maximizers and not competitive price-takers. As described

above, many of the bidders are private, independent power producers. The Central Electricity

Regulatory Commission serves as a market monitor and is concerned about the exercise of

market power, to the degree that it imposed a binding price cap (of USD 160/MWh) in

parts of September and early October, 2009. I will also treat public-sector firms as profit-

maximizing. State firms may have other social objectives in selling power, such as keeping

the power within their state, or reaching low-income consumers. However, these objectives

are served by the supply of power on long-term contracts between state buyers and sellers.

State actors in the short-term markets tend to be utilities from power-surplus states that are

trying to profitably utilize excess capacity (Indian Energy Exchange, 2014).
  12
     The market is actually run on two separate power exchanges, the Indian Energy Exchange (IEX) and
Power Exchange India Limited (PXI). As IEX has over 90 percent market share, among the two exchanges, I
study bidding on this exchange alone throughout the paper. This focus will somewhat understate the costs of
congestion.
  13
     Two of these, South 1 and South 2, are technically subregions of the South but I will call them regions.




                                                     11
(e)        Market Clearance

Market clearance accounts for transmission congestion by splitting off areas that are con-

strained and clearing them separately.

         The first step is unconstrained clearance, assuming that transmission constraints do not

bind. This clearance is typical of a double-sided auction and is shown in Figure 2, Panel A

for an example hour (January 26th, 2010, 16:00-17:00). The clearing price is the least price

at which supply and demand intersect. The clearing volume is the lesser of the supply and

demand volume at the clearing price. In this hour and many others, demand is strikingly

elastic in the area around USD 80/MWh (INR 4000/MWh).14 The large, flat steps in the

demand curve are bids of electricity distribution companies, which, though not willing to

procure power above this price, may simultaneously be shedding load. The supply and demand

curves have been shifted out by the volume of cleared block bids.15

         If transmission constraints in fact bind, at the market-clearing solution that was assumed

to be unconstrained, the power exchanges proceed to “market-splitting,” an iterative algo-

rithm to separate areas with binding constraints and clear them separately at region-specific

prices.16 The idea is that prices in regions importing (exporting) at the unconstrained solution

are raised (lowered) until the equilibrium imports (exports) are no more than the available

transmission capacity. Appendix B describes the algorithm for iterating over constraints and

gives an example of how market-splitting works, for the hour for which Figure 2 illustrated

the unconstrained market clearance.



3         Data and Study Sample

The analysis uses confidential data on bids and transmission constraints from the Indian

Energy Exchange (IEX) and the system operator (NLDC), respectively.

         From the exchange, I use the bids and offers from participants in the day-ahead market.

Bids are step functions from price to quantity with up to 32 allowed steps from the price
    14
     All bids in the market are originally in Indian rupees (INR). The paper uses a round exchange rate of USD
1 per INR 50, which is slightly stronger than that which prevailed on average in the study period (USD 1 per
INR 46).
  15
     Block bids are cleared by an iterative algorithm described in the Appendix. Blocks are a relatively small
part of the Indian market and, while I incorporate blocks in the market clearance throughout, I will take them
as exogenous in the counterfactual simulations.
  16
     Market-splitting is a zonal pricing method similar to that used in ERCOT (Texas) until 2010 and still used
in the Nordpool market in Europe.

floor of USD 0/MWh to the ceiling of USD 400/MWh.17 From the system operator, I use

transmission constraints as supplied to the exchange on the afternoon of the day of bidding.

These constraints include, for every hourly block, both margin constraints on the maximum

exports and imports permissible for each regional node and path constraints on the maximum

flows over each inter-regional path in each direction.18 I limit the sample of hourly auctions to

the inclusive six-month period from November, 2009 through April, 2010 to study the bidding

response to congestion within a constant regulatory framework.19

       Table 1 presents summary statistics on bidding over the sample period that describe an

active and unconcentrated market. The average unconstrained clearing price across auctions

(Panel A) is USD 87.06/MWh, with a standard deviation of USD 48.52/MWh (Cf. the average

price in the PJM market of USD 66.72/MWh for 2010 (Monitoring Analytics, 2011)). Auctions

have wide participation, with an average of 19 buy bids and 25 sell bids in each auction (column

1), and as many as 48 and 54 bids in some auctions (column 5). Most bidders use few steps

(Panel B), with sellers offering a bid on average with only 1.84 steps and the modal offer

having a single step.20 Steps offer an average quantity of 34 MW at an average price of USD

67/MWh, but sellers offer steps of up to 1000 MW at prices of up to USD 300/MWh.


(a)      Prevalence of Congestion

During the sample period—indeed, during the life of the power exchanges to date—congestion

has been frequent and had a large impact on market prices. Table 2 summarizes the prevalence

of congestion during the sample period by comparing the prices for each pair of regions, which

differ only if the regions are separated by constrained links. Panel A shows the percentage

of the hours over the sample period during which the price in the row region is higher than
  17
     The Indian Energy Exchange allows piecewise-linear bids that are strict functions from price to quantity
between up to 64 points. In practice, bidders almost always use these functions to closely approximate step
functions (strictly correspondences) with constant quantities for a range of prices and then discrete increases
in quantity over a single price tick. The difference between step functions and the linear interpolation of the
exchange makes a trivial difference in clearing prices. I therefore assume bids have a step-function structure and
apply the share-auction framework for modeling bids in terms of incremental quantities at each step (Wilson,
1979) (see Appendix A for details).
  18
     During the study period, the system operator declared what the constraints were over the course of the
day only if congestion occurred in any hour of the day in the unconstrained solution. On seven of 181 days
in the sample, no congestion occurred, so the bootstrap simulations and counterfactual will assume that the
market was unconstrained on these seven days.
  19
     The price cap was lifted in October, 2009. Such a binding cap would invalidate the first-order approach
to bidding optimality used in the estimation below. In May, 2010, the schedule of administrative prices for
Unscheduled Interchange was revised. As the UI price schedule may influence the opportunity cost of buying
and selling power in the day-ahead market, I truncate the sample before this regulatory change.
  20
     This limited use of a complex strategy space occurs in other markets (Hortaçsu and Puller, 2008).


                                                       13
the price in the column region. The most common patterns of congestion are for the North

region or some combination of the South 1 and South 2 regions to be import constrained with

respect to the central core of the East and West regions. The North region is constrained away

from the Northeast, East and West regions over 18 percent of the time during this period.

The South 1 region is import constrained with respect to this core 23 percent of the time

and the South 2 region 26 percent of the time, as the link between the South 1 and South 2

regions also occasionally binds. Because constraints into the North and South tend to bind

at different times, overall some constraint binds in 46 percent of the hours in the data (not

shown in the table).

   These binding constraints create large differences in market prices across regions. Table 2,

Panel B shows the row region price less the column region price, conditional on the row region

price exceeding the column region price. The average price difference between the North and

East regions is USD 33.8/MWh, and between the South 1 and East regions USD 33.1/MWh,

each about 38 percent of the mean unconstrained market-clearing price of USD 87.1/MWh.

Appendix A (d) additionally shows that the amount of power flowing between regions is

negatively correlated with differences in regional prices. Overall, it is clear that transmission

congestion has very large effects on market prices in different regions of the grid.


(b)   Effect of Congestion on Market Concentration

The fact that transmission constraints open up large differences in regional prices is consistent

with either a competitive or an oligopolistic market. In a competitive market, or a power

system with central dispatch based only on cost, tighter transmission constraints increase price

differences by preventing least-cost dispatch across the whole grid, so that areas with high

costs see high prices. In a strategic or oligopolistic market, additionally, suppliers will change

their bids in response to tighter transmission constraints, which may exacerbate regional price

differences relative to differences in cost, for example if import-constrained areas have very

inelastic demand.

   This subsection presents some reduced-form evidence, from market concentration and

residual demand elasticities, that suppliers indeed face incentives to change their bidding

behavior when transmission constraints bind. Figure 3 shows how the distribution of the

Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of market concentration changes when transmission con-


                                               14
straints bind. The HHI is based on sellers’ offered volumes. The sample is restricted to hours

in which the North Region is constrained from the rest of the grid (Panels A and C), or

in which the South Region is constrained from the rest of the grid (Panels B and D). The

HHI is then computed, using the same offered volumes, either only in the constrained region

(North in Panel A, South in Panel B), or within the grid as a whole. Because this exercise

uses micro-data on bids and constraints, the comparison is not between hours when the grid

was constrained and hours when it was not, but between concentration when the grid was

constrained and what concentration would have been, in the same hours with the same bids,

had the grid not been constrained (i.e., if more transmission capacity was built).

      The figure shows large increases in market concentrations when constraints bind. In the

North Region, the modal HHI without constraints, in Panel A, is between 0.1 and 0.2, and

with constraints, in Panel C, is between 0.4 and 0.5. Thus binding constraints cut the number

of effective (equally-sized) firms from 5 to 10 to 2 to 3.21 There are a number of hours with

very high concentrations, above 0.5, which are never observed when transmission constraints

do not bind. The difference in concentration caused by transmission constraints in the South

Region, comparing Panels B and D, is even greater, because the supply side in the South is

very thin with relatively few participants.

      The effect of market concentration, alone, on the incentive to exercise market power is

ambiguous in this setting. In more concentrated markets, there are fewer bidders and there-

fore, at a given price, the slope of the residual demand curve of a supplier must be flatter.

This slope effect tends to decrease the elasticity of residual demand and increase the incentive

to raise prices. However, when the market is constrained, the residual demand curve shifts

inwards by the quantity of imports or outward by the quantity of exports. The local market

will clear at a different price point on the residual demand curve, at which quantity-price pair

the residual demand may have a higher or lower elasticity. Because congestion induces both

rotations and shifts of the residual demand curve, a seller in a constrained region does not

necessarily face a lower elasticity of residual demand for the same bid.

      Table 3 explores these effects for sellers in the North (Panel A) and South (Panel B)

Regions facing import constraints. The table compares the elasticity of residual demand faced

by the largest seller in each region, if they offered the same quantity (ninety percent of their

      Recall, an HHI of 1 indicates monopoly, 0.5 two equally sized firms, 0.20 five equal firms, etc.



                                                        15
capacity), with transmission constraints either not binding (column 1) or binding (column

2). As with Figure 3, the sample for each panel is limited to hours in which the constraint

actually did bind, so that the column 1 statistics are counterfactuals, without constraints,

holding bids fixed. Each panel reports the median of three statistics: the HHI discussed

above, the slope of the residual demand curve at the offered quantity, and the elasticity of

the residual demand curve at the offered quantity. As noted above, the HHI increases by

a factor of two or more when constraints bind, compared to the same hours unconstrained.

The slope of residual demand also falls in magnitude, for example from -22 MWh/USD to

-15 MWh/USD in the North. This change in slope, and the shifts in residual demand from

imports, combine to cut the residual demand elasticity from -8.60 to -3.15, roughly a third the

magnitude. Using a simple Lerner pricing rule, the mark-up over cost implied by an elasticity

of -9 is 12.5%, whereas that implied by an elasticity of -3 is 50%, suggesting that constraints

have a large effect on the incentive to exercise market power in the North Region.22 The

South Region also sees falls in the magnitude of the slope and elasticity of residual demand

when constraints bind. However, sellers in the South are small to begin with, with modest

inframarginal quantities, and residual demand remains relatively elastic for the largest South

seller even when the South Region is import constrained (εQ,P = −12).

      Comparing market structures and residual demand, it is therefore clear that at least some

sellers have much stronger incentives to exercise market power when transmission constraints

bind. These basic comparisons omit a couple important factors and on balance will probably

understate differences in sellers’ market power between a more- and less-constrained grid.

First, we have only looked at incentives in the two most often import-constrained regions,

when large sellers in export-constrained regions will also likely see lower residual demand

elasticities when the grid is constrained. Second, the ‘counterfactual’ of an unconstrained

grid does not allow bidders to change their behavior; in fact, the bids in constrained hours

were submitted with some expectation that the grid might be constrained in those hours.

If bidders had instead expected the grid to be unconstrained, they would have bid more

aggressively. Therefore, these comparisons do not account for behavioral changes by market

participants that would accentuate the mechanical differences in residual demand caused by

transmission constraints.

         In general, any reduced-form empirical approach will have difficulty estimating the effect of

transmission constraints on market outcomes in this setting. Constraints bind endogenously

in response to bids, and there is not a plausible instrument that exogenously shifts constraints

and not other market conditions. The empirical approach is therefore to model the electricity

market response to congestion under a variety of conduct assumptions, placing emphasis on

strategic conduct based on the institutional evidence discussed above.



4         Model of Supplier Bidding with Transmission Constraints

To measure how transmission constraints affect market outcomes, I estimate firm costs and

compute counterfactual market outcomes with different levels of transmission capacity. Un-

der strategic conduct, firm costs are estimated from supply bid functions using a first-order

approach accounting for the effect of transmission constraints on residual demand.23 The in-

novation in the methodology for cost estimation here is to account for the effect of transmission

constraints on optimal bids.


(a)        Model of Optimal Bidding

The model assumes that strategic firms submit supply functions to maximize expected profits.

Firms face uncertainty over the bids of other firms and demand and submit their bids to the

market one day ahead for each hour of the following day.

         The offered supply of firm i in region g and time period t in the day-ahead market is repre-

sented by a supply function qit (p).24 The firm submits a supply function to maximize profits

given the expected distribution of other firms’ bids and demand, accounting for transmission

constraints. The firm’s problem is:


                                maxbit ,qit Eσ−it [qit (p)p − Ci (qit (p))] ,


where the supply function qit (p) depends on the price bitk and incremental quantity qitk of
    23
      This estimation approach, pioneered by Guerre, Perrigne and Vuong (2000), was first adapted for electricity
markets by Wolak (2003) and has been used by Reguant (2014) to study complex bidding in the Spanish market
and Allcott (2012) to study real-time pricing in the PJM market.
   24
P This supply function is a continuous approximation to the step supply correspondence q̂it (p) =
   k qitk 1{bitk < p} + αqitj 1{bitj = p} for α ∈ [0, 1]. The firm supplies the incremental quantity qitk at
all prices strictly above bitk and may offer any part α of an incremental quantity when the market price exactly
equals the price of the bid tick, with the exact quantity supplied determined by market clearing.



                                                       17
each bid tick k and Ci (·) is i’s cost of production. Note that there is no forward contract

position in the profit expression, as there are no financial contracts tied to day-ahead market

prices. The market clearing condition is that quantity supplied equal residual demand at the
                                  rg                        rg
market-clearing price, qit (p) = Dit (p|σ−it , Lt ), where Dit (p|σ−it , Lt ) is the residual demand

facing firm i in region g, σ−it are the strategies of bidders other than i, including demand

bids and the competitive fringe, and Lt the set of transmission constraints.

   Taking the derivative with respect to each bid-tick price, a necessary first-order condition

for profit maximization is

                                          rg                                  

           Eσ−it                qit (p) +                     (p − Ci (qit (p)))                   = 0,   (1)
                       ∂bitk                     ∂p                                     p=bitk


after substituting using both the market-clearing condition and the implicit function theorem

(see Appendix B). This is equivalent to a Lerner pricing rule whereby the firm sets prices at

marginal cost plus a markup given by quantity over a weighted expectation of the slope of

residual demand. The weights ∂p/∂bitk are the slope of the market price in the bid tick price

and have an economic interpretation as the probability that a given bid tick sets the market

price, since with no smoothing this derivative is equal to one if a bid tick is marginal and zero
                                                rg
otherwise. A greater slope of residual demand ∂Dit /∂p reduces the optimal markup at each

quantity supplied.

   The residual demand faced by each firm will depend on both the bids of other firms and

the amount of transmission capacity. The residual demand facing firm i in region g is


                       Dirg (p|σ−it , Lt ) =
                                                      X
                                                                    qj (p, σj ) − F(Ag |p, Lt ).
                                                j6=i,j∈Ag (p|Lt )


The residual demand that a bidder faces in their own region consists of demand and competing

supply bids qj (p, σj ) within the same constrained area, which are sensitive to price, and the

fixed quantity that the region is importing, which is not sensitive to price at the margin,

conditional on the set of binding constraints. I designate by Ag (p|Lt ) the set of regions to

which region g is connected by unconstrained transmission lines at a price p and given line

capacities Lt , and call such a group of regions an area. These connections may be direct or

indirect, through another region; all regions connected by any unconstrained path form an

unconstrained area. As the price in g rises, the region will tend to import more (attract net

                                                        18
supply from other regions), which will induce transmission constraints to bind and tend to

isolate g in an area. (The area will also depend on the bids and prices in other regions, and

thereby the net demands of those regions; I suppress this dependence in the area notation).

This constrained area Ag (p|Lt ) is determined using the market-splitting algorithm described

in Section 2. Let F(Ag |p, Lt ) be the net constrained flows into area Ag at price p and line

capacities Lt . This function gives the net supply of other regions, truncated by the available

transmission capacity.

   The derivative of the residual demand for this firm with respect to price is

                              rg
                            ∂Dit (p)             X             ∂qjt (p, σj )
                                       =                                     ,
                              ∂p                                   ∂p
                                           j6=i,j∈Ag (p|Lt )


assuming that the constraints are not exactly binding, so that a small change in price does

not change Ag (p|Lt ). Using this area assumes that bidders solve forward the congested area

to which they will belong for possible realizations of other bids but do not change their

bids to manipulate this area. (The assumption that constraints do not exactly bind for a

given realization of demand and supply bids is innocuous, because the empirics will simulate

uncertainty over others’ bids so that all strategic bids are a best response to some probability

of constraints binding.) If the set of binding constraints does not change, then constrained

flows F(·) are also fixed, so the second term in residual demand has a derivative of zero. The

smaller is the constrained region Ag (p|Lt ), the weakly less negative is the residual demand

slope bidder i faces, as all bids outside of Ag contribute a fixed amount of imports or exports.

The slope of residual demand for each bidder, for a given realization of demand and other

supply bids, comes from only those bids with an open link to that bidder’s region.

   The overall effect of transmission constraints on supply bids will depend on the exact

shape of the residual demand curve. Although the residual demand slope at a given price

unambiguously falls when a region is constrained, the distribution of equilibrium prices in

a region will change as constraints bind more often. A bidder may therefore expect bid

ticks higher (lower) in the price distribution to be marginal if its region is import (export)

constrained and will set markups based on the slope of residual demand in that range of

prices, instead of in the range of prices anticipated without congestion. For example, a

supplier in an import-constrained region may face more elastic demand at the high area-



                                               19
clearing prices expected to be marginal when constrained, inducing an expansion of quantity

supplied. Conversely, a supplier in an import-constrained region gaining market share and

serving greater inframarginal quantity would tend to increase markups.


(b)    Cournot Counterfactual

In the counterfactual simulations I consider both competitive conduct, wherein bids are taken

as cost and held fixed, and a Cournot model, wherein strategic bidders offer fixed quan-

tities. The day-ahead market allows for bidding of price-quantity functions. Equilibria in

supply functions, even without transmission constraints, are typically numerous and unstable

(Holmberg, 2009; Baldick and Hogan, 2002), and there are additional computational diffi-

culties in a constrained network (Wilson, 2008). Klemperer and Meyer (1989) show that the

supply-function equilibria lie between competitive equilibrium and Cournot, wherein strategic

sellers offer fixed quantities (i.e. inelastic supply functions).

   Cournot models are widely used in empirical analysis of restructured electricity markets

(Ito and Reguant, 2016; Bushnell, Mansur and Saravia, 2008; Puller, 2007; Neuhoff et al., 2005;

Willems, 2002; Cardell, Hitt and Hogan, 1997). The Cournot model may be an especially good

fit to the Indian market for two reasons. First, since firms use a small part of the strategy

space in practice, with most bids having a single step, limiting firm strategies is preferable to

limiting the number of firms, as a way of simplifying the model solution. Second, a relatively

elastic demand side at the wholesale level leads to reliable price discovery in the model (as

opposed to the common case of both electricity demand and supply being nearly inelastic,

where the market price can vary wildly).

   In the simulations I take all sellers in the North and West regions with greater than a

one-percent share of total offered sell volume to be strategic and treat the other bidders as a

competitive fringe. The market is not very concentrated overall; this set of 13 strategic firms

covers 71 percent of all offered sell volume in the sample. I consider only strategic suppliers

in the North and West regions because these regions are important in themselves, as large

load and supply centers, respectively, and form relatively liquid markets when constrained,

enabling a smooth approximation to the residual demand curve in each region. Not allowing

other sellers, outside these thirteen, to adjust their bid functions will tend to understate the

effect of transmission congestion on conduct and market outcomes.


                                                 20
         A Cournot equlibrium is a set of quantities for strategic firms i such that they cannot

profitably change quantity given their marginal costs γi , capacity constraints q i and residual

demand, where residual demand is composed of demand bids less the supply bids of fringe

firms. Appendix B gives necessary and sufficient conditions for an equilibrium set of quantities

and describes the solution algorithm.

         An example of the solution to the model, unconstrained, is shown in Figure 2, Panel B,

which shows the Cournot model simulation for the same hour for which Panel A, previously

discussed, shows actual market clearance. In Panel B the increasing solid curve represents the

marginal cost curve for strategic suppliers (author’s estimates). The decreasing solid curve is

the residual demand curve, composed of demand bids and fringe supply bids, and the dashed-

and-dotted line is a smoothed representation of the inverse residual demand. The vertical

line is the equilibrium strategic quantity offered by the strategic suppliers, at which the

equilibrium conditions are satisfied with respect to the smoothed inverse residual demand,

as further expansion of quantity would steeply push down the market price. The market-

clearing price for the simulation is the intersection of the strategic quantity with the actual,

not smoothed, residual demand curve, and in this case matches exactly the actual clearing

price in Panel A.

         The above equilibrium applies to the realized residual demand curve faced by each seller

within their own constrained area. The solution algorithm mimics the market splitting algo-

rithm in order to determine what constrained area each seller is bidding within, first solving for

the unconstrained solution with endogenous bids and then breaking off constrained areas and

solving within each constrained area separately, shifting residual demand by the constrained

level of imports or exports.25



5         Estimation Strategy

I apply the generalized method of moments (GMM) to the first-order conditions for optimal

bids to estimate the marginal cost of electricity supply for firms over the quantity they offer
    25
     The equilibrium in this model is not necessarily unique in theory, due to transmission constraints and the
fact that I have not restricted the functional form of inverse residual demand to be concave. I explore this
concern in Appendix B and do not find multiple equilibria in practice. The main reason is that the pattern of
congestion for regions in the Indian grid is very one-sided: regions that are typically import constrained may
not have the supply capacity, let alone the incentive, to congest the line going outwards, which could allow a
different equilibrium.

in the day-ahead market.

       To approximate the uncertainty faced by suppliers I resample demand bids and the supply

functions offered by other firms. Bids from all other bidders are drawn in complete days at

the region-by-bidder-type level, where regions are the six regions in Figure 1, Panel B and the

bidder types are State Generating Companies, Private Generating Companies, Distribution

Companies and Industrial Firms.26 This resampling method is a block bootstrap which allows

for arbitrary correlation among bids within region-bidder-day blocks. When there is a single

bidder of a given type in a given region, this procedure maintains that bidder’s identity, while

when there are many bidders, such as industrial consumers on the demand side, it replicates

the uncertainty caused by such firms dropping in and out of the market.

       The estimation moments are the empirical analogue of the first-order condition (1):

                       S                                      rgs
                                                                                                          !
                                                                          s ,L )
                1    X X ∂ p̃s                            ∂ D̃it  (bitk |σ−i  t
mikh (γi ) =                               q̃it (bitk ) +                        (bitk − Ci0 (qi (bitk ))) ,
             |H(h)|S     ∂bitk                                      ∂p
                       t∈H(h) s=1


where s ∈ {1, . . . , S} are bootstrap iterations, H(h) is the set of times with hour equal to h,

and a tilde indicates a smoothed function. I take S = 100. Every bootstrap draw of bids
 s generates a residual demand curve that may differ both in its component parts and in
σ−i

the regions over which it is aggregated, depending on what transmission constraints the bids

drawn induce to bind. The moments reflect uncertainty over the composition of one’s own

constrained area as well as others’ bids. As bids are represented discretely, the derivative of

residual demand, a key determinant of mark-ups, equals zero at almost all prices. I therefore

smooth the residual demand function over prices with a normal kernel to approximate this

derivative and the probability that a bid tick sets the market price (see Appendix B).

       The parameters of interest are the marginal cost functions for each bidder. I specify

Ci (q) = γi0 + γi q so that marginal costs are constant at γi . Empirical papers on electricity

markets have used a range of specifications for marginal cost suited to the question at hand.27

The assumption is that marginal cost is constant over the quantity offered in the day-ahead

market. In support of this idea, the average sell bid described in Table 1 has less than two
  26
     Other bidder-days are drawn with weights in proportion to a triweight kernel in number of days from the
day for which uncertainty is being simulated, with a bandwidth of 14 days.
  27
     Papers on vertical integration and transmission have used constant or piecewise constant marginal costs
(Gans and Wolak, 2008; Neuhoff et al., 2005), whereas Reguant (2014) estimates linear marginal costs and
adjustment costs to capture dynamic firm decision-making important for the study of complex bids.



                                                    22
bid steps and only three strategic sellers average over three steps per offer. This means sellers

do not bid as if their marginal costs have much slope and, practically, means there is little

variation available in bids to estimate any changes in marginal cost with quantity.

   I also estimate a capacity constraint for each seller as the maximum quantity offered by

that seller in the market over the sample period. Sellers sometimes offering at their capacities

in quantity does not invalidate the first-order conditions used in estimation, as the first-order

conditions are with respect to price. All bid ticks are below the ceiling price, so bidders can

always raise the price of their last unit of quantity, even if they cannot offer more quantity.

The smoothing of residual demand using a normal kernel also ensures that all firms will have

some non-zero demand elasticity, and therefore informative first-order conditions.

   I estimate the marginal cost parameter γi for each strategic seller by summing moments
            P
miko (γi ) = h∈o miko (γi ) over four equal hourly blocks o and solving for the GMM estimator

that minimizes the inner product of these moments


                              γ̂i = arg min miko (γi )0 miko (γi ).
                                        γ


One concern with this estimation strategy is that the residual demand a bidder faces may be

endogenous with respect to econometric errors in their bid. For example, suppose a bidder

has a positive cost shock for a given hour and this forces an offer at a high price, making a

bidder marginal in a less elastic region of the demand curve. The estimation moment will

infer from the low elasticity of demand that the bidder has a high mark-up and thus low cost,

whereas the bidder actually was high cost because causality ran from bid to elasticity, and not

vice versa. I therefore use temperature at the region-by-hour level from the day of bidding to

instrument for the estimation moments in the main estimates.

   Standard errors are bootstrapped to account for both statistical and simulation error.

I bootstrap 100 samples, where each sample draws with replacement both days from the

observed sample and simulated market outcomes, for each sampled day, from a set of 100

simulations of daily market outcomes. Cost coefficients are estimated for each set of days and

market outcomes drawn.

6         Results

(a)        Estimated Marginal Costs

The characteristics and estimated marginal costs of strategic sellers are shown Table 4. There

are four strategic sellers in the North and nine in the West. They are a heterogeneous lot,

representing all of the four bidder types that bid on the exchange: state utilities, distribution

companies (discoms), private generating companies and industrial plants. Column 3 of the

table reports the market share of each strategic seller by their share of offered volume. The

largest two sellers, including the largest single seller by a wide margin, at 23 percent market

share, are state utilities in the Western region.28 Industrial plants have small shares of overall

market volume but offer significant volume of up to 250 MW in some hours.29 The largest

suppliers in the North region are distribution companies, which the Electricity Act of 2003

permitted to vertically integrate into generation (Thakur et al., 2005).

         The estimated marginal costs of these suppliers are presented in column 6. By seller

type, the mean cost estimates in ascending order are USD 40.1/MWh for private generating

companies, USD 61.5/MWh for industrial plants, USD 67.4/MWh for state utilities and USD

75.5/MWh for distribution companies. The range of cost estimates across sellers is broad.

The estimated costs for individual sellers range from a low of USD 14.3/MWh up to a high of

USD 121.1/MWh, with both extremes coming from industrial plants. The opportunity cost

of supply in the day-ahead market is likely to be different from the pure technological cost

of generation for industrial plants, which can alternately use the power themselves. Larger

discoms and state utilities have estimated marginal costs in the narrower USD 50/MWh to

USD 85/MWh range.30

         Column (5) shows the mean quantity-weighted tick price of bids offered by each bidder,

i.e. the average price at which a megawatt is offered. Comparing this column to the estimated

costs implies that the average quantity-weighted markup of offered sell ticks is USD 8.5/MWh

or 20 percent of marginal cost. Private generating companies have similar absolute markups
    28
     There are 151 sellers that offer some quantity during the sample period, and the Herfindahl index for
unconstrained offered volume by all sellers is 0.092.
  29
     Capacity of 200 MW or more is high, but not unheard of, for a captive generation facility: India had 19
captive plants with above 100 MW of capacity in 2004 (Central Electricity Authority, 2005).
  30
     Table B5 in Appendix B compares these estimates, which use lagged temperature as an instrument,
to estimates that use GMM without correcting for endogeneity. There are generally small differences in
estimated costs by methodology. The remainder of the paper, including all counterfactuals, uses these Table 4
instrumental variable estimates.


                                                     24
to other sellers, at USD 11/MWh, but lower costs and therefore larger markups in percentage

terms. The estimated marginal costs reflect variation in underlying bids more than in margins

(the correlation of estimated costs and weighted mean bid tick prices is 0.91).31

       These cost estimates are consistent with the available information on generating costs in

India. A limitation of the data is that the bidders are anonymous. The generation technology

used by each seller is thus unknown and a precise comparison of estimated costs to physical

costs is not possible. I therefore benchmark the cost estimates against public data on prices

paid for power in the state sector (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, 2011). The

mean energy charges, meant to capture marginal costs, paid to state generating stations under

long-term power purchase agreements in 2010, were USD 43.8/MWh for coal stations not at

the pit-head, USD 43.9/MWh for natural gas units and USD 93.4/MWh for liquefied natural

gas units. These are consistent with the costs I estimate, but for most fuels slightly lower,

as the average estimated marginal cost across sellers is USD 63.3/MWh. It makes sense that

marginal costs in the short-term market should be slightly higher than these benchmarks,

since the state sector costs are for contracts of much greater quantities and longer durations

and may rely on low-marginal-cost baseload plants.

       From the estimation of marginal costs, a very high cost structure does not appear necessary

to rationalize high market prices. Market prices have a mean of USD 87/MWh and a standard

deviation of 49/MWh, and transmission constraints routinely create regional differences in

price of USD 40/MWh or more. Yet these conditions do not imply, through the model

estimates, that costs of supply are unreasonably high overall or in the constrained regions in

particular. Cost estimates in this market are in line with energy charges paid to regulated

public-sector plants. This leaves market structure, in the form of transmission constraints

increasing market power, as a leading factor that may account for high prices in the short-

term market.
  31
     Note it is possible to estimate costs above weighted mean offered tick price. For example, an industrial
plant has bids averaging USD 37/MWh and costs of USD 45/MWh. This seller’s average offers are only about
half of the market-clearing price. The estimation weights ticks closer to the marginal price, which are more
likely to be marginal, more highly, and therefore this seller’s cost estimates are higher than its average bid,
because the seller’s higher bids are much more likely to be marginal.

(b)   Counterfactual Model Fit

Before turning to counterfactual outcomes it is important to understand the fit of the con-

strained Cournot model in the baseline case without any change in transmission capacity.

    Table 5, Panel A, compares unconstrained market clearance with the bids actually sub-

mitted, in columns 1 and 2, with outcomes for the unconstrained Cournot model, in columns

3 and 4. I present the unconstrained clearance of the submitted bids for reference, but con-

sider it an inappropriate benchmark for whether the model matches market conduct, because

it runs unconstrained clearance using bids offered in a constrained environment. The model

overpredicts unconstrained quantity, shown in Panel A, and therefore underpredicts uncon-

strained price by 13 percent (USD 11.5/MWh on a base of USD 87.1/MWh). In reality, when

firms bid, they know that they will face regional demand and be paid based on constrained,

regional prices. This implies that an ‘unconstrained’ market, calculated by turning off trans-

mission constraints but not changing bids, should have lower quantities than predicted by the

model, as is observed.

    Table 5, Panels B through D show that the model matches constrained market outcomes—

that is, true market outcomes—extremely well, especially considering the parsimonious spec-

ification of costs. The North region is import constrained with respect to the West region 17

percent of hours in the model, as against 18 percent of hours in reality. The price difference

between these regions conditional on the North price being greater is USD 28.2/MWh in the

model and USD 33.7/MWh in the actual market clearance. The North region and West re-

gion have similar average net demands in the model as in the actual clearance, and these net

demands are similarly variable. The fit in the South 1 region is also very good; for example,

the difference between South 1 and West prices conditional on congestion is USD 32.9/MWh

in fact and USD 39.5/MWh in the model.



7     Counterfactual Transmission Expansion

(a)   Simulated Benefits of Transmission Expansion

I consider counterfactuals that vary in their assumption on market conduct as transmission

capacity is built out. On the constraints themselves, I consider investments in new transmis-

sion capacity into the two most frequently constrained regions, the North and the South. The


                                             26
counterfactuals increase the transmission capacity from the East to the North and South 1

regions by increments up to 1200 MW.32

       Table 6 displays market outcomes with expanded transmission capacity. The panels of

the table represent different physical counterfactuals, and the columns different assumptions

on market conduct. Column 1 represents competitive market clearance with no transmission

expansion. Column 2 assumes that suppliers have bid their cost curves in the data, and these

cost curves are held fixed and a new market equilibrium found with a new level of transmission.

Column 3 represents Cournot market clearance with no transmission expansion. Column 4 is

Cournot conduct with fixed bids, where the quantities offered by strategic sellers in equilibrium

are found at the baseline level of transmission, then held fixed as transmission expands. This

scenario of sellers not responding to the grid is not meant to be realistic but to serve as

a benchmark for the Cournot model with endogenous bids, of Column 5, where sellers do

respond to new transmission and a new (constrained) market equilibrium is found at every

level of counterfactual capacity. Each panel of the table shows how market prices, quantities

and surplus change with the transmission expansion.

       Panel A shows the response of the entire market to a marginal (400 MW) transmission

expansion into the North region. This expansion reduces the share of constrained hours by

approximately half, from 18 percent of hours to 11 percent in competitive scenarios (columns

1 and 2) and 17 percent to 8 percent in strategic scenarios (columns 3 and 5). The fall in

congestion is smaller in the strategic scenario where sellers respond (column 5) than when

they do not (column 4), because strategic sellers in importing regions tend to decrease supply

as more imports are allowed. The difference in prices across regions conditional on congestion

also falls, and the North region increases its regional net demand by drawing more power from

the West.

       The last three rows of Table 6, Panel A shows market surplus, divided into buyer’s and

seller’s surplus. Note, regarding the baseline scenarios, that the surplus under competition

(column 1) is smaller than under strategic scenarios (column 3). That surplus is higher

under strategic behavior is counterintuitive and due to using different, model-consistent cost

estimates in each case: in the competitive model, costs are assumed equal to bids, whereas

in the strategic model, firms have mark-ups and so costs are estimated to be lower than
  32
    Given that the East-to-West link has a high capacity, it makes a negligible difference whether the expansion
into the constrained regions is from the East or the West.


                                                      27
in the competitive model for the same bids. It is these lower cost estimates that increase

the level of surplus in the strategic model, despite the exercise of market power. Moreover,

because demand is typically very elastic near the market-clearing price, so that many buyers

are roughly indifferent to buying, 66 percent of market surplus (column 3, = 40.61/61.94)

goes to the sell-side of the market. I take the baseline surplus under strategic conduct of

column 3 as a common baseline for scaling surplus gains.

   Under competition, surplus increases by a modest USD 1,070 per hour (column 2 less

column 1), or 1.7 percent of the baseline strategic surplus of USD 61,940 per hour. Under

strategic conduct with endogenous bids the gain in surplus is roughly twice as large for this

marginal expansion, at USD 1,980 per hour or 3.2 percent of baseline surplus. This contrasts

with basically no gain under a scenario that holds strategic bids fixed (column 4, USD 210 per

hour). When bids are fixed, theoretically total surplus may still increase significantly, because

power reaches higher-value buyers that were previously import-constrained, or is supplied by

lower-cost sellers amongst the competitive fringe; for example, smaller industrial plants in

the West can supply more power into the North region. In this scenario, however, buyer’s

surplus increases (column 4 less column 3) and seller’s surplus falls by a nearly equal amount.

Thus the effect of the transmission expansion, without changes in strategic supply, is to lower

prices in the import-constrained region, transferring surplus from one side of the market to

the other. The primary gains from this expansion, observed in the Cournot scenario with

endogenous bids, are thus due to a strategic increase of supply in response to the availability

of greater transmission capacity.

   The gains from expansions are greater and the differences between competitive and strate-

gic scenarios starker in the South region. Panels B and C consider marginal (400 MW) and

large (1200 MW) increases, respectively, of transmission capacity into the South 1 region.

The marginal increase cuts congestion from about 30 percent (columns 1 and 3) to about 10

percent (Panel B, columns 2 and 5) under all conduct assumptions, and the large increase in

transmission is enough to basically end congestion (Panel C, columns 2 and 5). Under the

competitive scenario, the large increase in capacity causes some increase in South region net

demand and West region net supply, and gains of up to 6.0 percent of baseline market surplus

(Panel C, column 2, = (40.88−37.16)/61.94), accruing to both sides of the market. Under the

strategic scenario, the gains for a large increase in capacity are more than twice as large, at


                                               28
13.3 percent (column 5, = (70.18 − 61.94)/61.94) of baseline surplus. The strategic expansion

of transmission capacity into the South 1 region increases net demand in that region by 100

MW per hour (column 5 less 3, Panel C), over all constrained and unconstrained hours, much

of which is due to increased net supply from the West region (Note in column 5 the South 1

region is importing more but just barely a net buyer, as it is the only region that can wheel

power into high-demand South 2). Surplus gains from South region expansion accrue more

to buyers than to sellers; the effect is of opening up an import-constrained region with high

demand but little indigenous supply. Note, by comparison with column 4, that the gains in

the strategic scenario are due to increases in supply and not just a reallocation of demand to

high-value South 1 buyers. The surplus gains in the column 4, fixed bid scenario are about

one-third as large.

   Figure 4 summarizes the surplus gains for these counterfactual increases of transmission

capacity. Panel A shows expansions of capacity into the North region and Panel B into the

South region. In each panel, the solid (black) line represents surplus holding strategic bids

fixed at the baseline level, the dashed (blue) line surplus with competitive bids and the dotted

(red) line surplus with endogenous strategic bids. Each surplus measure is scaled by subtract-

ing the baseline market surplus under that scenario and dividing by the baseline surplus under

strategic conduct. The Table 6 scenarios for the North and South are traced out for a range

of capacities. There are three conclusions from the figure. First, the surplus gains are largest

in strategic bid scenarios, topping out at 5.6 percent of surplus in the North, 13.3 percent in

the South and 18.9 percent in total. This is a substantial gain from relieving congestion, of

USD 11,720 per hour or USD 103 million per year (USD 31m in the North, USD 72m in the

South). The ratio of the aggregate welfare gain from both expansions (done independently)

with endogenous strategic bids to the gain with fixed bids is 4.5; i.e., the strategic response

to the expansions accounts for 81 percent of their welfare benefit. Second, marginal gross

returns to investment are diminishing, though much more so in the North, where gains level

off after the first 400 MW expansion, than the South, where there are significant gains up

through 1200 MW. Third, the relative gains from transmission expansion under competitive

market conduct depend on the expansion considered. For the North region, strategic counter-

factuals show greater gains in surplus, but competitive counterfactuals converge to show very

similar gains at higher levels of transmission expansion. By contrast, in the South, strategic


                                              29
counterfactuals dominate competitive ones with respect to surplus gains at all capacities.

   Who gains from these investments? Figure 5 divides the gains in surplus across importing

and exporting regions and the buy and sell sides of the market. Panel A shows surplus gains

from a 400 MW transmission expansion into the North region and Panel B a like expansion

into the South region. In each panel, the three bars grouped on the left represent changes in

surplus for buyers (grey), sellers (light grey) and both sides together (black) in the importing

region, while the three bars on the right represent changes for the exporting region. In the

North region, in Panel A, the losses to sellers (light grey, left group), who lose market power as

import capacity grows, outweigh the gains to buyers from lower prices (grey bar, left group),

so the net surplus change in the region is slightly negative. That is, the highly import-

constrained North region would in sum prefer that the constraint not be relaxed. This small

net loss in surplus is offset by large gains to sellers in the exporting regions, which benefit

from higher prices and quantity after they are integrated with the high-demand North (light

grey, right group). The pattern of gains for an import expansion into the South region, in

Panel B, is similar, though in this case the gains to buyers within the South (5.2 percent

of baseline surplus) outweigh the losses to sellers from being undercut (2.2 percent). Thus

most of the surplus gains from new transmission accrue in exporting regions, whose sellers are

able to supply more and at higher prices. Overall, importing regions have modest net gains

in surplus because undercutting sellers’ market power and hence surplus offsets gains to the

buy side from lower prices and greater quantity. The gains to transmission expansion accrue

mainly to lower-cost sellers that can serve new export markets.


(b)   Costs of Infrastructure for Transmission Expansion

The above estimate of social benefits, or increased surplus, from transmission expansion is

not comprehensive, as it does not account for the costs of building the needed infrastructure.

The socially optimal level of infrastructure investment will generally leave some congestion,

for if one built the transmission capacity needed to eliminate every last hour of congestion,

there would be no price differences across regions and the marginal benefit of transmission

capacity would be zero. To estimate the net change in surplus from transmission expansion I

therefore develop a measure of the costs of marginal transmission capacity to compare to the

above measure of benefits.


                                               30
       The method of estimating marginal expansion costs has three steps. First, I identify the

physical lines that form binding constraints on inter-regional flow during my study period.

Second, I use planning documents to ascertain what more would have had to be built to relieve

these constraints. Because elements of the grid such as transmission lines and substations are

interdependent, the marginal investment required to relieve constraints is above the replace-

ment cost of the constrained grid links. Third, I use regulatory rulings on the costs of existing

grid elements to estimate the cost of the marginal expansion proposed. The transmission

system is regulated under a cost-plus regulatory regime so the regulator commonly rules on

the cost of grid elements similar to those needed for the expansion in the determination of

transmission tariffs.33

       Table 7, using this method, summarizes the annualized costs and benefits of marginal (400

MW) expansions in transmission capacity on the East-to-North and East-to-South links.34

The table shows the annual cost of constructing the needed grid elements to expand trans-

mission capacity between regions and the ratio of the gains in market surplus to those costs.

I find that marginal transmission expansion on these links would have benefit-cost ratios of

1.65 and 3.24, respectively, both well above one, the ex post break-even level of social returns.

These proposed marginal investments have a much higher social return than the 16 percent

private return on equity, i.e. a benefit-cost ratio of 1.16, allowed by the regulator for invest-

ment in transmission capacity. Moreover, as the marginal benefits for transmission expansion

to the South region, shown in Figure 4, Panel B, flatten out only gradually, additional expan-

sion of this link would also yield benefits exceeding costs by a large amount. Further capacity

past 400 MW into the North region, by contrast, would add little to social surplus.35 With
  33
      The estimation of costs can be illustrated with the example of an expansion of the capacity from the
East Region to the North Region. The system operator stated, in monthly reports on available transmission
capacity, that a transmission link between Farakka and Malda was the constraint on congestion across these
regions (Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, 2009). The system operator has developed a plan to
circumvent this constraint by building an additional high-voltage line from Rajarhat, near Kolkata, to Purnea
along with associated infrastructure (National Load Dispatch Centre, 2012). I take the cost of the planned grid
elements from recent regulatory filings for comparable expansions and apply the costs of these elements to the
expansion plan (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, 2012a). Costs include depreciation, interest and
operations and maintenance expenses and are presented on an annual, amortized basis. I exclude the regulated
return on equity, which is not a social cost, from cost calculations.
   34
      Transmission capacity is typically measured in units of potential (kilovolts); I assume 1 kV of line can
transmit 1.25 MW of energy to express capacities in energy terms instead.
   35
      Holding the marginal cost of expansion constant from 400 MW to 1200 MW of capacity and using the
surplus generated by this larger expansion, the ratio of benefits to costs for investments in East-North and
East-South are 0.96 and 1.73, respectively. These estimates should be taken with caution, as the assumption
of constant marginal costs of transmission expansion on these links is likely to be poor. The marginal cost
curve for transmission investment slopes up as new lines have worse locations, longer runs and more complex
tie-ins with the existing grid. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (2012a) Petitions No. 12/2002 and


                                                      31
the same cost measure but using net gains under counterfactual competitive conduct, the

case for a 400 MW transmission investment is marginal. The ratios of benefits to costs under

competition for expansions into the North and South regions are 0.88 and 0.86, respectively.


(c)     Interpretation of Net Surplus Gains

The comparisons above rely on several broad assumptions that, on balance, probably under-

state the benefits of transmission investment.

      First, I do not model the contract market and omit any potential gains from trade in

that market from my counterfactuals. However, the contract market appears to be fairly well

linked to the day-ahead market, and in 22 percent of constrained hours into the South and

37 percent into the North, no transmission capacity (0 MW) is available for the day-ahead

market. When capacity runs out, this implies that all the capacity has been booked in the

earlier contract market, which would also have been constrained and may then have directly

benefited from transmission expansions. Moreover, if relaxing transmission constraints caused

buyers and sellers to shift trade out of the bilateral contract market, which is currently favored

in the transmission allocation process, and into the day-ahead market, there may be further

gains from increased market liquidity and efficiency (Mansur and White, 2012).

      Second, surplus is based on wholesale bids including bids from distribution companies.

These distribution companies are state agents bidding on behalf of retail customers, and I take

the valuations in their wholesale bids as the social value of that electricity. Given the distorted

state of retail supply in India, this assumption could either overstate or understate surplus

depending on what customers are being rationed at the margin and who might be supplied

the additional power procured. Urban consumers cut-off by discoms often run generators at

a marginal cost of supply 50 percent or 100 percent above the wholesale market price, yet

rural and agricultural consumers face marginal prices far below cost or no marginal price at

all. Thus, observing only the wholesale bidding data and not who receives the power, it is

not possible to say whether wholesale valuations are too high or too low, relative to retail

valuations. From ongoing research with distribution companies in several Indian states, I

consider it more likely that the marginal rationed consumer in most cases lives in a town or

urban area, so that wholesale valuations are too low; however, I am not aware of any research
141/2010 show how the costs per unit of capacity to address congestion on the East-to-North corridor have
escalated with each recent investment.


                                                   32
that estimates the effect of wholesale market outcomes on distribution-level rationing.

         Third, I treat only a subset of thirteen large sellers as strategic and hold the bids of all non-

strategic sellers fixed. This assumption tends to understate the changes in market outcomes

under transmission expansion, to the extent that fringe sellers would also have changed their

behavior in an unconstrained market. Against this force, in counterfactuals relying on the

Cournot model, strategic suppliers are assumed to bid inelastic supply functions, which tends

to produce greater changes in bids than if other strategic parties bid partly elastic supply

functions.

         Fourth, gains during the sample period and investment costs are annualized and assumed

constant over time. The benefits of capacity expansion assume no growth in the day-ahead

market and no long-term benefits from transmission expansion in terms of better locational

choices of new power plants, on the supply side, or industrial plants, on the demand side.

There may be substantial long-term benefits from transmission lowering generation costs if

it reduces the need for supply to co-locate with demand. Transmission also increases grid

reliability and redundancy, which offer economic benefits through physical insurance against

system outages.36



8         Conclusion

I study the potential benefits of greater integration in the Indian electricity market. The

main finding of the paper is that the surplus gains from building transmission to integrate

the country’s electricity market are large and mostly due to the competitive effects of such

transmission on the supply offered by strategic firms. Counterfactual increases of transmission

capacity into the most congested regions of the grid increase market surplus by 19 percent

and accrue mainly to sellers in exporting regions that can increase supply to high-demand
    36
     The largest blackout in history, which brought down the Northern Indian grid for two days in late July,
2012, cutting off power to states with a population of 670 million, was not due to excessive demand, as widely
reported in the press (Yardley and Harris, July 31, 2012), but a transmission problem. The period in July
when the blackout occurred had relatively low aggregate demand since the monsoon had begun, and the grid
frequency, a summary statistic for net demand on the grid, was very close to the nominal frequency of 50
Hz at the time, indicating that there was no net over-drawal on the grid. However, a large amount of power
was being exported from the West region to the North and the reliability margin on this line had been set
too low, given that a major transmission corridor was down for maintenance. Moreover, the balancing price
mechanism, based on the common frequency in all regions of the syncronized grid, gave a common price in
the North and West regions, and thus did not reflect this transmission constraint. This mis-pricing caused
real-time over-injections in the West region and over-drawals in the North region, producing power flows that
exceeded the line capacity and triggered a cascading series of failures in the entire Northern-Eastern-Western
grid (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, 2012b).


                                                      33
areas. I calculate, by comparison with counterfactuals where sellers cannot respond to the

new transmission lines, that 81 percent of this welfare gain is due to transmission mitigating

market power. The returns from investing in transmission infrastructure are positive if firms

are assumed to behave strategically, but near zero if firms are competitive and so do not

respond to the newly integrated grid.

   A natural question is why these lines, with positive social returns, have not already been

built. One answer is that, given the rapid change in the Indian electricity sector, it is hard

to anticipate the value of infrastructure in a new power market. In this view, the congestion

here is a costly but temporary disequilibrium to be remedied as the government continues to

expand transmission capacity (Central Electricity Authority, 2012a). This answer does not

seem entirely satisfying, since the patterns of transmission constraints studied here are fairly

long-lived; for example, the North Region import constraint is binding about as frequently,

and the South Region import constraint was binding even more frequently, in data from 2014,

than in the study sample four years earlier. Another answer is that transmission planners

are not accounting for the competitive effects of transmission. The returns to transmission

investment are set by cost-plus regulation, so merchant transmission projects earn a fixed

rate of return on investments deemed useful, which does not vary based on the potential gains

from trade or price differences across the regions a project will connect. They do not account,

in particular, for whether a line may be critical to inter-regional competition.

   To my knowledge this is the first econometric study of a wholesale power market in a

developing country. There is an extensive literature on deregulated electricity markets in

developed-country markets around the world, showing that the exercise of market power

affects productive efficiency, but not allocative efficiency (Joskow, 2008; Borenstein, Bushnell

and Wolak, 2002). When a generator withholds capacity that would be competitive to operate,

in order to raise prices, less efficient plants are called to make up the gap, and consumers are

served in any case. Market power is less studied but potentially more important for welfare in

developing countries. In India’s market, where the demand side is often rationing power at the

retail level, withholding power may instead increase demand not met, from any source. Scarce

and unreliable power supply reduces the productivity of firms (Allcott, Collard-Wexler and

O’Connell, 2014; Fisher-Vanden, Mansur and Wang, 2012) and surely harms consumers as

well. An important direction for research is therefore to better understand the pass-through


                                              34
of wholesale market outcomes to distribution-level power supply and power rationing.

The figure shows the unconstrained market clearance on the Indian Energy Exchange during January 26th,
2010, hour 17. Panel A shows the actual market-clearing price as determined by the intersection of the
downward-sloping demand curve and upward-sloping supply curve, where each curve has been shifted relative to
the vertical axis by the volume of cleared buy and sell block bids, respectively. Panel B shows the determination
of the simulated market-clearing price. The downward-sloping solid line is the residual demand curve consisting
of demand and fringe supply bids and the dashed-and-dotted line a kernel-smoothed representation of this curve.
The upward sloping solid line is the aggregate marginal cost curve of the strategic suppliers. The vertical line
is the aggregate quantity offered by the strategic suppliers in equilibrium. The equilibrium is determined by
the slope of the smoothed residual demand curve but the clearing price, which in this case is the same as the
actual clearing price, is determined by the intersection of the strategic quantity with the true residual demand
curve.

The figure shows the distribution of the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of market concentration when
transmission constraints do not bind (top row) and bind (bottom row). The HHI is based on sellers’ offered
volumes. The sample is restricted to hours in which the North Region is constrained from the rest of the grid
(Panels A and C), or in which the South Region is constrained from the rest of the grid (Panels B and D).
The HHI is then computed, using the same offered volumes, either only in the constrained region (North in
Panel A, South in Panel B), or within the grid as a whole (Panels C and D). The comparison is not between
hours when the grid was constrained and hours when it was not, but between concentration in hours when the
grid was constrained and concentration, in the same sample of hours and with the same bids, had the grid not
been constrained (i.e., if more transmission capacity was built).

The figure shows changes in surplus for counterfactual increases of transmission capacity. Panel A shows
expansions of capacity into the North region and Panel B into the South region. In each panel, the dashed
line represents surplus in counterfactuals under competitive market conduct and the dotted line surplus under
strategic Cournot conduct, where bids respond to the expansion of transmission. The solid line represents
strategic Cournot conduct with bids held fixed at their baseline levels with no additional transmission capacity.
Each surplus measure is scaled by subtracting the baseline surplus for each group and dividing by the total
surplus. Each 0.05 share of total surplus represents an annual change of USD 27 million (INR 1.36 billion).

The figure shows the division of changes in surplus for counterfactual increases of transmission capacity across
regions and sides of the market under strategic Cournot conduct, where bids respond to the expansion of
transmission. Panel A shows expansions of 400 MW capacity into the North region and Panel B into the
South region. In each panel, the three bars grouped on the left represent changes in surplus for buyers (blue),
sellers (red) and both sides together (black) in the importing region, while the three bars on the right represent
changes for the exporting region. Each surplus measure is scaled by subtracting the baseline surplus for each
group and dividing by the total surplus. Each 0.05 share of total surplus represents an annual change of USD
27 million (INR 1.36 billion).

The table shows summary statistics on market concentration by whether transmission
constraints bind, for the North Region (Panel A) and South Region (Panel B), respectively.
The sample for each panel consists of hours in which, at the actual market clearance, the
panel region was constrained from (i.e., had higher prices than) the rest of the grid. The
two columns of the table show statistics on market concentration calculated under these
constraints (column 2) and ignoring these constraints (column 1); column 1 is therefore
counterfactual in that constraints actually did bind in these hours. The three rows of each
panel each show the median of a statistic on market concentration. The first row shows the
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of offered sell volumes amongst all sellers in the grid
(column 1) or within the constrained region (column 2). The second row shows the slope
of residual demand faced by the largest seller in the region, evaluated at a fixed offered
quantity (ninety percent of that seller’s capacity) in both unconstrained and constrained
scenarios. The third row shows the corresponding elasticity of residual demand evaluated
at the same point. Block bids are cleared at either unconstrained or constrained market
prices, for each column, and the residual demand in the constrained scenario is shifted in
by the import capacity of the constrained region.

and estimated marginal costs. Region is the region in which the seller bids, type is the category of bidder to
which the seller belongs, share of total volume offered is the share of offered volume offered by each seller,
weighted mean tick price is the quantity-weighted average price of bid ticks offered by the seller, estimated
marginal costs are the costs recovered via the estimation described in Section 5, using lagged temperature
to instrument for the estimation moments. Standard errors are bootstrapped by resampling 100 bootstrap
iterations with replacement over both days in the sample and simulated market outcomes. Strategic sellers
are those sellers in the North and West region with at least one percent market share as determined by the
share of offered volume.

The table shows the fit of the Cournot model to market outcomes on the day-ahead market from November,
2009 through April, 2010. In each panel the first two columns show the mean and standard deviation of
each outcome for the actual market clearance, using the bids submitted to the exchange. Columns 3 and
4 show market outcomes under the Cournot model equilibrium. The Panels represent different treatments
of transmission constraints. In Panel A the clearance is conducted and the model is solved assuming no
transmission constraints exist. Note that the unconstrained clearance benchmark of Panel A, columns 1
and 2, commonly used by the exchange, is itself a naı̈ve counterfactual, conducted using bids submitted
under constrained conditions. In Panels B through D, market outcomes from constrained clearance are
shown using bids as submitted and as predicted by the model.

     The table presents a cost-benefit analysis of new transmission investment to relieve congestion from the East to the North Region and the East to the South
     Region. The grid elements to be constructed in order to relieve congestion are from National Load Dispatch Centre (2012) and Power Grid Corporation
     of India Limited (2009). The grid elements to relieve congestion into the North Region are part of an explicit plan from the system operator (NLDC)
     while the grid elements to relieve congestion into the South Region are inferred from the planning and transmission capacity documents. Cost estimates for
     each grid element are from granted petitions for cost reimbursement for comparable grid elements filed with the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission
     (CERC), available at www.cercind.gov.in/orders.html. Cost estimates are on an annual, amortized basis and include depreciation, interest and operations &
     maintenance costs but not return on equity. The length of the Talcher II-Rourkela link is from the petition cited in the table but the cost of building the line
     is computed at the higher rate given in Pet. No. 96/2008. All costs are scaled to represent a 400 MW capacity expansion. Annual surplus is the total gain in
     market surplus each year in the day-ahead market from a 400 MW transmission expansion into each region, calculated by assuming the gain in surplus over
     the sample period of November, 2009 through April, 2010, as in Table 6, would remain constant.

(a)   Real-time Balancing through Unscheduled Interchange

The prices for real-time balancing, called unscheduled interchange in the Indian market, de-

pend on the grid frequency, which in turn depends on the balance between demand and supply

on the grid. When demand exceeds supply, as is often the case, the grid frequency drops below

its nominal frequency of 50 Hz and sellers (buyers) are paid for injecting more (drawing less)

power than scheduled. This mechanism takes the place that real-time balancing markets with

advance bidding serve in other power systems.

    The balancing or UI price is a piecewise linear function of grid frequency. As part of a

general effort to prevent buyers and sellers from relying on UI and to improve the balance

of demand and supply, which affects grid stability, the relationship between the UI price and

the grid frequency has become steeper over time. On April 1st, 2009 the price schedule was

increased so that the UI price increased by USD 3.1/MWh (INR 155/MWh) for each 0.02

Hz change in grid frequency and on May 1st, 2010 increased again to USD 4.3/MWh (INR

215/MWh) for each 0.02 Hz change. The net effect of these changes has been to discourage

over-demand through UI and push buyers and sellers back into the scheduled markets.

    There are also regulatory limitations on the use of UI designed to prevent withholding from

the scheduled power markets. The UI charges paid to sellers are capped and the maximum

allowable deviation from schedule also capped (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission,

2009) The UI regulation also explicitly threatens sellers that persistently deviate from schedule

with regulatory action.


(b)    Arbitrage between short-term market segments

Appendix Table A1 shows the correlations between prices across the different short-term

market segments at hourly (Panel A) and weekly (Panel B) frequencies. The sample period

is 2009 and 2010. The prices are as follows. For the day-ahead market, the unconstrained

hourly clearing prices on the Indian Energy Exchange and the Power Exchange India, the two

exchanges that make up all trade. For the balancing market, the unscheduled interchange

price, calculated by applying the UI Regulations’ administered price schedule to the grid

frequency. We take the average of the UI price for the Northern-Eastern-Western (NEW)


                                               53
grid and the Southern grid. For contracts, we take the volume-weighted average price of

all single-day short-term contracts (signed between 365 and one day in advance of delivery),

across all regions of the grid. The timing of the prices is lined up across markets based on

the date of delivery of electricity; therefore, because contracts are signed at various times in

advance, the contracts may have been agreed up to one year prior to delivery (though most

are agreed within a month before delivery).

   The table shows correlations between market prices on various short-term Indian power markets at
   hourly (Panel A) and weekly (Panel B) frequencies. The prices are as follows. For the day-ahead
   market, the unconstrained hourly clearing prices on the Indian Energy Exchange and the Power
   Exchange India, the two exchanges that make up all trade. For the balancing market, the unscheduled
   interchange price, calculated by applying the UI Regulations’ administered price schedule to the grid
   frequency. The balancing or UI price is a piecewise linear function of grid frequency. We take the
   average of the UI price for the North, East and Western grids (NEW) and the Southern grid. For
   contracts, we take the volume-weighted average price of all single-day short-term contracts (signed
   between 365 and one day in advance of delivery), across all regions of the grid. The sample period is
   2009 and 2010. The symbol ∗ denotes p < 0.05, ∗∗ p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗ p < 0.001 for a test of the null
   that the correlation between the row and column price series is zero.




(c)   Transmission allocation

The transmission capacity limits determined by the NLDC are allocated among the different

segments of the power market in an administrative manner. Long-term customers, which are

charged for building and maintaining the transmission grid in proportion to their generation

capacity, are given first priority (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, 2008b). The

allocation of capacity to long-term trade is nearly constant over time. The margin left after

long-term use, due to design margins, short-term variation in power flows and spare trans-

mission capacity due to anticipated future load, is left to short-term trade including both

contracts and the day-ahead market (Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, 2008a).

                                                    54
   Short-term contractual buyers may book up the corridor that has been reserved for short-

term trade on a first-come, first-served basis before the power exchanges. This reservation of

the corridor continues until three days prior to the day of delivery, at which time bookings

are frozen and the remaining transmission capacity reserved for use by power exchanges. On

average, of the corridor that is available for short-term use, more than half is left over for use

by the power exchanges. However, in some hours short-term contracts use up all the corridor

for short-term trade, in which case power exchanges must solve for market clearance with zero

flows between the regions where corridor has been exhausted.


(d)   Inter-regional power flows and price differences

The above transmission allocation process means that, although the amount of physical trans-

mission line does not vary, the amount available for use by the day-ahead market does vary.

This variation in available capacity is not exogenous to market conditions, since it depends

on how much corridor has been booked up by contract market participants. We may still

be interested to see, on this intensive margin, how the severity of transmission constraints is

correlated with regional price differences.

The figure plots the price difference between two regions against the power flow between two regions for the
East to North and East to South corridors respectively, conditional on a transmission constraint between each
pair of regions binding, during the sample period of November, 2009 through April, 2010. The price difference
is the South or North price less the East price and the flow the net supply from the East region. A constraint
binding implies that the price difference is weakly positive.




                                                            56
    Figure A1 charts regional price differences against inter-regional power flows for the East

and North regions (Panel A) and the East and South 1 regions (Panel B). The horizontal axis

shows the flow between regions, with positive flow indicating the net supply from the East

region, and the vertical axis shows the difference between the North or South 1 price and the

East price. The panels show only hours when the flow between regions is constrained, causing

the constrained areas including each region to be cleared separately and the market-clearing

prices in the two regions to differ.37 As shown in Panel A, power flow being constrained at

low levels, below 200 MW, is associated with price differences of USD 100/MWh or above in

both regions. These price differences across regions are larger than the average unconstrained

clearing price. When more transmission capacity is available, the greater flow between regions

eliminates or reduces the price difference, creating the strong negative correlation between

price differences and constrained flow in the figure. A similar pattern of price differences

decreasing in constrained flow is seen between the South 1 region and the East (Panel B),

though a greater flow is needed to close the price gap for this pair.



B     Appendix: Market-clearing and Estimation (Not for Pub-

      lication)

(a)    Discretization of Single Bids

The Indian Energy Exchange allows bids to be piecewise-linear functions from price to quantity

defined by up to 64 price-quantity pairs. Most bidders use only a small fraction of the

available ticks and, moreover, submit bid functions that approximate step correspondences.

For example, using the original currency in which bids are submitted, a seller will submit a

bid that is equal to zero up to INR 2499/MWh, that discretely steps up over the minimum

allowable INR 1/MWh bidding increment to 50 MW at INR 2500/MWh, and remains constant

thereafter.

    Table B2 summarizes this behavior for sell bids during the study period of November,

2009 through April, 2010. The percentage of bid segments with any slope is 4.18 for fringe
  37
     Note that the constraints bind at different levels of flow. The available physical capacity of lines varies
a small amount from hour to hour, but there is greater variation in the capacity declared for the day-ahead
market due to the booking of corridor for the clearance of prior markets. If a line can support 3500 MW and
3000 MW is booked prior to the day-ahead market, then transmission capacity for the day-ahead market is
the residual 500 MW.

bids and 1.54 for strategic bids. Sloping bid segments do supply a greater quantity than flat

segments, at 5.14 and 15.73 percent, respectively, but the share of total quantity offered is

still low. Because of the limited use of sloping bid segments, single bids are best represented

as discrete step functions. For those bids that do have slope, I approximate sloping segments

with discrete steps spaced equally within the price range of the bid segment, at up to USD

5/MWh intervals, such that the average quantity supplied over the segment is the same as in

the original bid.

                    Table B2: Prevalence of Sloping Bid Segments in Sell Bids

                                                           Fringe     Strategic

                     Percentage of quantity with slope        5.14        15.73


   The limited use of bid slope observed may be because the losses to discrete bidding are

small and/or the fixed costs of optimal bidding are large (Kastl, 2012; Hortaçsu and Puller,

2008).


(b)      Treatment of Block Bids

Single bids are hourly functions from price to quantity that are submitted and cleared in-

depedently for each hour. Block bids specify the maximum willingness-to-pay of a buyer or

minimum willingness-to-accept of a seller on average over a continuous block of hours. Each

block is specified by a price and quantity pb , q b and a set of hours H b . Blocks allow bidders to

reflect cost complementarities in supplying power in contiguous hours, similarly to complex

bids (Reguant, 2014). Unlike complex bids, which impose a minimum revenue requirement

on the revenues earned by single bids, block bids do not constrain or change the clearance of

single bids, other than through their effect on the market-clearing price.

    A bidder offering both single and block bids would consider the effect of single bid tick

prices on block bid clearance and costs. Let p̂ = h∈H b ph /|H b | be the average hourly price
                                                 P

over a block and G(·|H b ) be the cumulative distribution function of this price and let δ b

indicate the event that the block is cleared. In terms of equation 1, the bidder’s first-order




                                                58
condition for a single bid tick when also bidding with blocks becomes:

The first two revenue terms are the same as in the original condition. The second line is a

weighted average of marginal costs over whether a block is included or not, as block clearance

shifts a firm along its cost curve. The third line is the change in revenue for the block due

to the bid tick changing the average price at which the block is cleared and the non-marginal

change in costs from the block being included or not.38

      Block bids, considered through this modified first-order condition, are not empirically

important to the single bids of strategic firms. In the above first-order condition, blocks will

matter if block inclusion has a large effect on marginal costs, if the single bid price is likely to

change the distribution of average prices faced by the block and if the block volume is large.

None of these conditions hold empirically. Given that marginal costs are assumed constant

in the estimation, block inclusion does not shift marginal costs and the second line of this

condition reduces to the product of residual demand slope and constant marginal cost. The

average block bid submitted by a strategic bidder applies to a block of |H b | = 11 hours, which

via line three makes it unlikely that a single bid tick from a single hour will have a noticeable

effect on the distribution of block prices. Strategic bidders, moreover, offer only 9.1 percent

of their total offered volume through blocks, summing block volume over all the hours to

which a block applies, meaning that the effect of block prices on revenue is then also small

as q b << qit (p). For these reasons I assume in the estimation that strategic bidders do not

account for the presence of block bids.

      Block bids are still a feature of the market environment and so I replicate the block clearing

of the exchange in order to match market outcomes. Auctions with blocks are combinatorial,

with the clearance of each block depending on the clearance of the others via market prices,

so there is not necessarily a unique set of cleared blocks or cleared market-clearing prices

over the day (Meeus, Verhaegen and Belmans, 2009). The set of blocks cleared will rather
 38
      I neglect any feedback of the block clearance onto single bids during other hours of the day.


                                                       59
depend on the algorithm for block clearance. The precise algorithm of the exchange is not

publicly available. I use a heuristic algorithm that iteratively drops blocks until a set of hourly

market-clearing prices is found:

  1. Assume all block bids are cleared.

  2. Clear the market for each constrained area in all 24 hours of the day.

  3. Calculate the difference between the block price pb and the average hourly price p̂ in

      the hours to which a block applies, ∆p = (1 − 2 · 1{BuyBlock})(pb − p̂).

         • If ∆p > 0 for any cleared block, designate block with the largest ∆p as not cleared

           and return to (1).

         • Otherwise exit.

I do not generally attempt to reinclude blocks that have been dropped at an earlier stage of

clearance but may be cleared at the market-clearing prices of later iterations. In step (3) if

any block is on the excess side of the market during an hour with an extremal (floor or ceiling)

price, that block is given preference to be dropped regardless of whether it has the largest ∆p

overall. Similarly if at exit the price is extremal in any hour and any blocks on the anti-excess

side of the market were not cleared I reinclude such blocks until they are exhausted or the

price is no longer extremal.


(c)   Market-splitting Algorithm

The exact algorithm used by the exchange is not published. I recreate the algorithm here and

show in the next section that my recreation matches published area-clearing prices very well.

The algorithm runs as follows:

  1. Clear the market in the constrained area Ag (p|L), beginning with the whole market.

  2. Calculate regional net demands at the market-clearing price within the constrained area.

  3. Calculate constraints from regional net demands

         • Calculate difference between regional net demand and import margin or export

           margin for each region within the constrained area.


                                                60
           • Calculate difference between implied interregional flows and total path constraints

             for each combination of regions within the constrained area.

   4. Check constraints

           • If any constraint violated:

               – Update the definition of Ag (p|L) by partioning the grid on binding constraints.

               – Attribute constrained flows into or out of Ag (p|L) to appropriate regions.

               – If constraint applies within a previously constrained area relax the outer con-

                  straint.

               – Return to (1.) for each constrained area separately.

           • Otherwise exit.

Interregional flows are calculated by minimizing the sum of squared flows subject to meeting

the regional net demands (i.e., to Kirchoff’s First Law) and respecting binding constraints.

       Figure B2 shows the application of the market-splitting algorithm in practice. The un-

constrained solution implied a flow to the North region of 571 MW, in excess of its import

capacity of 171 MW. The North region was therefore constrained apart from the rest of the

grid and these two areas cleared separately, as shown in Figure B2, Panels A and B, with

imports added to supply and exports to demand in each area. The importing North region

has a clearing price about USD 20/MWh above the other regions and no further constraints

bind once these areas are cleared separately. Bidders in each constrained area receive the

area-clearing price in that area.39

    The difference between selling prices in exporting regions and buying prices in importing regions is retained
by the system operator, under supervision of the regulator, in a Power System Development Fund. As of March
31, 2011 this fund held USD 91 million (INR 4.57 billion) in congestion revenues.

The figure shows the constrained market clearance on the Indian Energy Exchange during January 26th, 2010,
hour 17. The unconstrained market clearance shown in Figure 2, Panel A implied a flow of 571 MW to North
region when only 171 MW of import capacity was available. The market was therefore split into one import
constrained area consisting of the North region, shown in Panel A, and one export constrained area consisting
of all other regions, shown in Panel B. The imports and exports have been added to the supply and demand
curves in each respective panel.

(d)   Accuracy of Market Clearing

The replicated block-clearance and market-splitting algorithms are extremely accurate. I test

their accuracy by comparing market prices reported by the IEX to those calculated by clearing

the market with the bidding data.

   Table B3 reports the results of the market clearance for each quarter from the first quar-

ter of 2009 through the first quarter of 2011. The first four columns show the results for

unconstrained clearance in all hours, regardless of whether the hour was constrained or not,

as the exchange publishes prices for the unconstrained solution in all hours. The percentage

difference betwen exchange prices and calculated prices, all in USD/MWh, is never more than

0.19 percent of the market clearing price in any single quarter and is more often around 0.10

percent. Columns 5 - 8 show the differences between the mean regional price reported and

calculated during constraind hours. The errors are somewhat larger, with a maximum of 3.78

percent of the market clearing price across quarters, but still very small on average. The ad-

ditional error in the constrained relative to the unconstrained price does not necessarily imply

error in the market-splitting algorithm. Rather, on inspection, most of the hours when the

two prices differ appear to be an interaction of transmission constraints with small changes

in block clearance, which affect clearing prices more in relatively illiquid, constrained regions

than in the market as a whole.

(e)      Accuracy of Bootstrap Replications

The estimation depends on accurately replicating the uncertainty faced by sellers over market-

clearing prices and residual demand. This section briefly reports comparisons between the

distribution of actual prices and the distribution of prices under the bootstrap replications of

market outcomes for the single largest seller.

       Table B4 shows moments of the actual and simulated price distribution for the Uncon-

strained, North and West prices, respectively. The means and standard deviations of the

actual and simulated prices are very similar for each distribution. The simulated prices have

slightly fatter tails, with floor prices observed in practice, unlike in the actual prices, and

somewhat higher maximum prices. The bootstrap of bids at the daily level does not guaran-

tee there will be demand bids in any given hour, hence generating the floor prices. The other,

interior quantiles of the distribution match very closely. The right tails of the Unconstrained

distribution, which reflects demand in the South region and the North region, and in the

North region, are above the right tails in the West region from the median through the 75th

percentile. Comparisons for the uncertainty faced by other sellers and in individual hours of

the day also show similar distributions of actual and simulated clearing prices.


(f )     Smoothing of Residual Demand

Both the estimation and counterfactual simulations model the residual demand as a smooth

curve, rather than a step function. I approximate residual demand and its derivative with


                                                 64
kernel-smoothed functions in the manner of Wolak (2007). Let j index bids from both the

demand and supply sides, where qjk is the incremental increase in supply or decrease in

demand from firm j above price pjk . Let Dg (0, σ−it ) be the total demand in the area of region

g at a price of zero and Ag be short for Ag (p|L). Then residual demand and its derivative

The bandwidth w controls the degree of smoothing, with a larger bandwidth smoothing

the curve more. I set w = USD 10/MWh in the estimation, which is 11 percent of the

mean unconstrained market-clearing price and 0.21 standard deviations in this price. Own-

supply is smoothed in a similar manner. Following Wolak (2007), the derivatives of resid-
                                                                                         ∂p

∂qit (p)    ∂Dit (p)   ∂qit (p)
 ∂bitk   /    ∂p     −   ∂p       , by the implicit function theorem.

   In Table B5 I test the robustness of the cost estimates to different smoothing parameters

and to not instrumenting the moment conditions with lagged temperature.

   The main IV estimates of marginal cost are in column 6 and column 2 reports estimates

without instruments. The mean marginal cost estimates across all bidders is a modest 8

percent higher in the main IV estimates, reducing bidder margins, and the mean absolute

deviation between the baseline and IV estimates is also 8 percent. Endogeneity of bids driven

by cost shocks appears a mild concern in this market, perhaps because few supply shocks are

realized by the time offers are made, a day ahead of delivery.

   In column (4) I present estimates of marginal cost without IV using a smoothing parameter

50 percent larger than in the baseline case (i.e., w = USD 15/MWh instead of USD 10/MWh).

Because the smoothing parameter partly determines the elasticity of residual demand, it

changes the moment conditions, and one may be concerned that this parameter arbitrarily

influences the estimates of marginal cost. The estimates are practically unchanged, with the

mean cost estimate higher by 0.42 percent and the mean absolute deviation over all cost

estimates only 3.42 percent, relative to column (2). The estimated costs thus do not appear

The table shows robustness checks for the cost estimates of Table 4. The rows represent strategic sellers
ordered as in that table. Strategic sellers are those sellers in the North and West region with at least one
percent market share as determined by the share of offered volume. Columns 2 and 3 give the coefficients
and standard errors for the estimates without instrumental variables and with a bandwidth of USD 10/MWh
for smoothing residual demand. Columns 4 and 5 give estimates using a larger bandwidth of USD 15/MWh.
Columns 6 and 7 give the Table 4 estimates at the original bandwidth and using lagged temperature as an
instrument for the moment conditions, on the assumption that lagged temperature shifts expected demand
but does not affect supply shocks. Standard errors are bootstrapped by resampling 100 bootstrap iterations
with replacement from the set of moment conditions.


very sensitive to a marginal change in the degree of smoothing.


(g)   Cournot model equilibrium conditions and solution method

Consider a set of strategic firms i with marginal costs γi facing a residual demand curve

Dg (p|σ−it , Lt ) with a twice-continuously differentiable inverse residual demand curve

P̃ g (Qg |σ−it , Lt ), where Qg is aggregate strategic quantity offered in region g by all strategic

firms together. For now, take the division of the market into regions g as exogenously given;

I will discuss how the regions are determined below.

   The derivative of profit with respect to the seller’s offered quantity qit is:


                    fit (qit ) = P̃ g (Qg |σ−it , Lt ) + qit P̃ g0 (Qg |σ−it , Lt )) − γi .               (2)




                                                        66
Necessary and sufficient conditions for an equilibrium set of quantities are that for all strategic

sellers i:


                                  qit ∈ (0, q i ) ⊥ fit (qit ) 6= 0

                                       qit = 0 ⊥ fit (qit ) ≥ 0

                                      qit = q i ⊥ fit (qit ) ≤ 0.


Here q i is the maximum quantity that a strategic seller can offer, due to capacity constraints.

The form of this problem is a mixed-integer complementary problem, since the equilibrium

conditions are complementarity conditions between capacity constraints binding and the firm’s

first-order condition for an interior quantity. If the seller produces an interior quantity, be-

tween zero and their constraint, then it must be that the derivative of profits with respect to

quantity at that point is zero. Similarly, if the seller produces nothing this derivative must

be negative, else they would increase quantity, and if the seller produces at their quantity

constraint this derivative must be positive, else they would decrease quantity.

    The conditions for profit maximization depend on the first and second derivatives of inverse

residual demand with respect to quantity. I represent inverse residual demand function P̃ g as

a set of whole quantities and incremental prices and smooth over quantities, with the same

kernel-smoothing method described in , in order to approximate the derivative of inverse

residual demand. When smoothing over quantity I use a bandwidth wq equal to ten percent

of the range of quantities spanned by the residual demand curve.

    The problem is linear in qit if one neglects the effect of each seller’s quantity on the

aggregate Qg . Similarly to Bushnell, Mansur and Saravia (2008), I solve this problem with the

sequential linear complementarity problem approach of Kolstad and Mathiesen (1991) using

the PATH algorithm on each iteration (Dirkse and Ferris, 1995). This algorithm solves a linear

complementarity problem for a vector of qit on each iteration and then sequentially updates

Qg to formulate another linear problem, repeating the process until convergence. Sufficient

conditions for the uniqueness of Cournot equilibria generally require pseudoconcavity of profit

functions (Kolstad and Mathiesen, 1987). Given constant marginal costs, the profit functions

must inherit this property from the demand function.

    The regions g into which the grid is divided are determined by nesting the Cournot prob-


                                                 67
lem within the market-splitting algorithm, described in Appendix B (c), which deals with

constraints in practice. The treatment of congestion in the counterfactuals is therefore the

same as in estimation. That is, the Cournot model is first solved on the unconstrained grid,

and the equilibrium prices, quantities and inter-regional flows are calculated. If these flows

and the implied regional imports and exports violate any transmission constraints, then those

constraints are assumed binding, and a new Cournot equilibrium is solved on the constrained

grid divided by these constraints. Iterations continue until an equilibrium is found and no

additional constraints bind, as described in the market-splitting algorithm.

   The implication of this algorithm for the model is that strategic sellers behave with cer-

tainty that the grid constraints will bind as they do in equilibrium, and that strategic sellers

account for the effects of inelastic equilibrium imports and exports in their bids. The first-

order conditions of strategic sellers are confined to their constrained regions, and will be

altered by both the slope and the level effects described in Section 2 (b). Strategic sellers do

not, however, ‘see through’ the iterations of the market-splitting constraint to account for the

endogeneity of the constraints with respect to their bids. This assumption strongly simplifies

the problem and is realistic given the relative non-concentration of the unconstrained grid.


(h)   Uniqueness of counterfactual Cournot equilibrium

The Cournot model used does not theoretically guarantee a unique equilibrium here, for two

reasons. The first reason the equilibrium may not be unique is the presence of transmission

constraints. Transmission constraints can produce multiple equilibria, with lines congested in

different directions, or leave no pure-strategy equilibria at all. In markets with asymmetric

firms and demand across regions, a pure-strategy equilibrium of the Cournot model will

virtually always exist: the condition necessary for two regions is only that the two regions

have different monopoly prices (Borenstein, Bushnell and Stoft, 2000). The asymmetry in the

Indian day-ahead market between a relatively low-priced central core, of the West and North

region, and a high-priced periphery, of the North and South, suggests there will be a single

pure-strategy equilibrium, as it will not be worthwhile, or even possible, for the suppliers in

power-scarce regions to congest the line outwards in order to gain market share from relatively

abundant regions.

   The second reason that the equilibrium may not be unique is that the residual demand


                                              68
curve here is not always pseudoconcave. Because I smooth inverse residual demand but do not

otherwise restrict its shape, it can alternate between concave and convex regions at different

quantities, which may, but will not necessarily, admit multiple equilibria at different clearing

volumes.

   Empirically, I search for multiple equilibria, by starting the equilibrium search at different

quantities, but generally find a unique equilibrium for every hour. In the baseline simulation

I initialize the search for an equilibrium at the point where all strategic sellers have equal

quantities and supply 75 percent of the maximum residual demand. This could in principle

lead to selection of local equilibria further out on the demand curve than the actual equilibria

selected by firms, in accord with the discussion of Section 4 (b). I test for the importance of

equilibrium selection by instead allocating strategic sellers 25 percent of the maximum residual

demand to start. This produces an average unconstrained market price of USD 73.78/MWh

over the sample period, indistinguishable from the price of USD 73.74/MWh in the baseline

simulation, indicating that a different equilibrium has been found in at most a handful of

hours. The two simulations also match exactly on other dimensions of congestion and market

volume.

   Therefore, though I cannot rule out multiple equilibria, multiplicity does not appear to be

important in practice. I speculate that this is due to the typical shape of the demand curve.

In many hours, the demand curve is inelastic at low and high prices and elastic at moderate

prices, as in Figure B2, Panel B.40 In principle, this can create distinct concave portions of

residual demand where equilibria might be found. In practice, though, the potential equilib-

rium higher up the residual demand curve are at very low or even negative quantities, and

sellers can increase profits in this part of the curve by selling more, even if it brings prices

down.

     The extreme elasticity at moderate prices comes mainly from industrial consumers that have outside
options of purchasing from unscheduled interchange or from state suppliers at prices in this range.
