Growth Slowdowns Redux: New Evidence on the Middle-Income Trap
Barry Eichengreen, Donghyun Park, and Kwanho Shin
NBER Working Paper No. 18673
January 2013
JEL No. E0,F0,N1

                                              ABSTRACT

We analyze the incidence and correlates of growth slowdowns in fast-growing middle-income countries,
extending the analysis of an earlier paper (Eichengreen, Park and Shin 2012). We continue to find
dispersion in the per capita income at which slowdowns occur. But in contrast to our earlier analysis
which pointed to the existence of a single mode at which slowdowns occur in the neighborhood of
$15,000-$16,000 2005 purchasing power parity dollars, new data point to two modes, one in the $10,000-$11,000
range and another at $15,000-$16,0000. A number of countries appear to have experienced two slowdowns,
consistent with the existence of multiple modes. We conclude that high growth in middle-income
countries may decelerate in steps rather than at a single point in time. This implies that a larger group
of countries is at risk of a growth slowdown and that middle-income countries may find themselves
slowing down at lower income levels than implied by our earlier estimates. We also find that slowdowns
are less likely in countries where the population has a relatively high level of secondary and tertiary
education and where high-technology products account for a relatively large share of exports, consistent
with our earlier emphasis of the importance of moving up the technology ladder in order to avoid the
middle-income trap.

    1 Introduction

        The rapid economic growth of so-called emerging markets is one of the leading
storylines of our age and arguably the most important economic development affecting the
world’s population in the first decade of the 21st century. It has lifted millions of households
out of poverty. It has accounted for the vast majority of global growth in a period when the
advanced countries have been economically challenged and financially troubled.

        For some time now the question on everyone’s mind has been how long this rapid
growth can continue, in emerging markets in general and the group’s largest and most
economically dynamic member, China, in particular. Attempts to answer that question have
given rise to a literature on what is referred to, alternatively, as “growth slowdowns” and “the
middle-income trap.” At the time of writing, Google identifies more than 7,000 page
references to the first term and nearly 400,000 to the second.

        In an earlier paper (Eichengreen, Park and Shin 2012), we analyzed historical
experience with growth slowdowns as a way of shedding light on future prospects. We
considered post-1956 cases of fast-growing countries (where GDP per capita had been
growing for seven or more years at an average annual rate of 3.5 per cent) where growth then
slowed significantly (where the growth rate of GDP per capita stepped down by at least two
percentage points between successive seven year periods).1 We found that while there was
considerable dispersion in the per capita income at which slowdowns occurred, the mean
GDP per capita was $16,540 in 2005 constant U.S. dollars at purchasing power parity, the
median $15,085. At this point the growth of per capita income slowed on average from 5.6 to
2.1 per cent per annum. By comparison, China’s per capita GDP in constant 2005
purchasing-power-parity dollars was $8,511 in 2007, when the data in our source, Penn
World Tables 6.3, ended.

        In analyzing the correlates of growth slowdowns, we found that slowdowns were
positively associated with high growth in the earlier period (suggestive of mean reversion),
with unfavorable demographics (high old-age dependency ratios in particular), with very high
investment ratios (as if growth fueled by brute-force capital formation eventually becomes
unsustainable), and with an undervalued exchange rate (as if countries with undervalued
currencies have less incentive to move up the technological ladder out of unskilled-labor-
intensive, low-value-added sectors and thus find it more difficult to sustain rapid growth).
These results were suggestive, and they were suggestive for China in particular.

        In this paper we revisit these questions, updating and extending our previous results.
There are several reasons for doing so. Concern about slowdowns and therefore the literature
on this subject have continued to grow. China’s growth rate has meanwhile decelerated from
more than 10 per cent in 2010 to less than 8 per cent in 2012, meeting our slowdown
threshold, although how much of this change is cyclical and how much is secular remains to
be seen. Recall that our criterion for a growth slowdown is that the reduction in the growth
rate must be sustained for seven years. For what it is worth, the International Monetary
Fund’s forecasts for the rate of growth of gross domestic product at constant prices have

1
 We excluded low income countries – those with a per capita GDP of less than $10,000 US at purchasing power
parity – on the grounds that their experience was not really salient to the question at hand. In most of our
analysis we also excluded countries that rely for export revenues primarily on petroleum products on the
grounds that their experience, for obvious reasons, is special.
Chinese growth accelerating to more than 8.2 per cent in 2013 and remaining above 8.5 for a
string of subsequent years. Others (e.g. Pettis 2012), in contrast, suggest that the current
deceleration in China is likely to be permanent and that, if anything, more is coming.

        In addition, we now have more and better data on slowdown cases. Our earlier data
ended in 2007, the last year covered by the then most recent release of the Penn World
Tables. Now, courtesy of Penn World Tables 7.1 we have data through 2010. This allows us
to identify a number of growth slowdowns after the turn of the century that did not show up
in our earlier data set because we could not yet determine whether the deceleration was
durable. The new release also revises earlier estimates of per capita GDP for a number of
countries – not least for China, whose 2010 per capita GDP at 2005 PPP prices is now
estimated to have been only $7,129. In some cases where previously erratic series on the
growth of GDP per capita have been smoothed, what appeared to be slowdowns no longer
qualify. In other cases where once smooth series are now more volatile, episodes not
previously identified as slowdowns can now be added to the list.

        Finally, discussions of our previous paper pointed to a number of further potential
determinants of growth slowdowns whose importance might be analyzed. These include the
level and structure of human capital formation, the level and structure of exports (specifically
the importance of low-and high-tech exports), financial and political stability, and external
shocks.

        Our new results are broadly consistent with what we found before, albeit with
important differences. While we still find that slowdowns are still most likely when per
capita GDP in year-2005 constant dollars reaches the $15,000 range, the distribution of
slowdowns is no longer as obviously uni-modal. In fact, the new data point to the existence
of two modes, one around $15,000 and another around $11,000.

        We find that increasing the share of the population with at least a secondary level of
education (secondary, university and higher) reduces the probability of a slowdown, other
things equal. But holding constant the share of graduates of secondary schools and
universities, we do not find the same thing for education in general. “High quality” human
capital matters more than “low quality” human capital for avoiding growth slowdowns, or so
it would appear.

       In addition, we now find some evidence that financial crises and changes in political
regime raise the likelihood of growth slowdowns, although we are reluctant to push this
evidence too far. What is less intuitive is that “positive” regime changes – from autocracy to
democracy – increase the likelihood of slowdowns. We use case-study evidence to develop
some intuition for what might be driving this result.

        Section 2 reviews our data and methods. In Section 3 we present our new list of
growth slowdowns and compare it with its predecessor. Section 4 then replicates our earlier
regression analysis and complements it with new findings. Section 5, in concluding, draws
out the implications for emerging markets and China in particular.
       2 Data and Methods

        Our analysis of growth slowdowns follows Eichengreen, Park and Shin (2012), which
in turn builds on a symmetrical analysis of growth accelerations by Hausmann, Pritchett and
Rodrik (2005). We identify an episode as a growth slowdown if the rate of GDP growth
satisfies three conditions:


                                                                                    (1)

                                                                                    (2)

                                                                                    (3)

where is per capita GDP in 2005 constant international purchasing power parity (PPP)
prices, and       and       are the average growth rate between year t and t+n and the
average growth rate between t-n and t, respectively. Following Hausmann, Pritchett and
Rodrik (2005), we set n=7. Data on per capital incomes are from Penn World Tables (PWT)
Version 7.1 which covers the period 1957-2010. Sources for the other variables are described
in the data appendix.

        Equation (1) requires that the seven-year average growth rate of per capita GDP is 3.5
percent or greater prior to the slowdown (earlier growth was fast). Equation (2) identifies a
growth slowdown as a decline in the seven-year average growth rate of per capital GDP by at
least by 2 percentage points (the slowdown is non-negligible). The third condition limits
slowdowns to cases in which per capita GDP is greater than $10,000 in 2005 constant
international PPP prices. In other words, we exclude very low income countries experiencing
increasingly serious economic difficulties, our focus being on the so-called middle-income
trap.

        Table 1 lists all the slowdowns identified by this approach. The first column shows
the slowdown episodes selected only by our earlier paper (Eichengreen, Park and Shin 2012).
The second column then presents additional slowdown episodes identified as a result of
switching to Penn World Table 7.1. The slowdown episodes in the third column, finally, are
those found in both data sets.

        In some cases, as before, our methodology identifies a string of consecutive years as
growth slowdowns. For example, for Israel all years between 1970 and 1976 are identified as
a slowdown. One way of dealing with this is to employ a Chow test for structural breaks to
select one year out of the consecutive years identified (the year when the data point to the
greatest likelihood of a structural break). For Israel, for example, we identify 1976 as the year
of growth slowdown because the Chow test is most significant for that year. In Table 1, the
years chosen by the Chow test are denoted in bold.

        With this break point in hand, we assign a value of 1 to the three years centered on the
year of the growth slowdown, i.e. the dummy equals 1 for                            and zero
otherwise.2 This is done to allow for the possibility of some imprecision in identifying

    Again, this directly follows Hausmann, Pritchett and Rodrik (2005).
slowdown years. The comparison group then consists of all countries that did not experience
a growth slowdown in that same year. The sample for the regression includes all countries for
which the relevant data are available including both slowdown countries and others that have
never experienced a slowdown. We drop all data pertaining to years                   of the
growth slowdown as a way of removing the transition period to which either a 0 or 1 cannot
not be clearly assigned.3

        In addition to focusing on the dates identified above, we also report the results when
we do not employ the Chow test and leave the consecutive years as they are, i.e. the dummy
indicating a slowdown is set equal to one for the entire run of consecutive years. Finally,
since oil-exporting countries exhibit volatile behavior and show growth slowdowns at per
capita incomes differently than other countries, we also report the results when oil countries
are removed. (In Table 1, oil exporters are shaded.) Throughout, we report cluster-robust
standard errors that account for the panel structure of the data set.

     3 Slowdowns

       A number of the slowdown cases in column 2 of Table 1 are new. Austria and Mexico
were not included previously because their per capita incomes were less than $10,000 in 1960
and 1980, respectively, according to PWT6.3; their per capita incomes were just above that
threshold according to the more recent release. Where the new tables indicate sharper
downshifts in growth than their predecessors, our methodology picks out additional
slowdowns at higher per capita incomes, in Sweden in the mid-1960s, Hong Kong in 1981-2,
and Oman in the mid-1980s

        In other cases, the new version of the Penn World Tables has smoothed previously
erratic growth rates so that what were identified as slowdowns no longer qualify. These cases
include Argentina both in 1970 and at the end of the 1990s, Chile in the mid-1990s, Israel in
1996, Lebanon in 1985, Libya in the late 1970s (according to the more recent release, that
country’s slowdown instead occurred in the mid-1990s), Malaysia in the mid-1990s,
Mauritius in 1992, Portugal in 2000, Spain in 1990, and Uruguay in the second half of the
1990s.

        Extending the data for three additional years through 2010 allows us to analyze a
number of recent slowdowns that previously went undetected (due to our successive-seven-
year-period criteria). These include Estonia in 2002-3, Greece in 2003, Hungary in 2003,
Spain in 2001 and the UK in 2002-3. That these are all European countries is revealing in
light of recent events.

       In all but one case where the methodology picked out a string of successive slowdown
years and these now remain the same, the Chow Test continues to identify the same unique
break point as before. The one exception is South Korea. While our methodology identifies
the same string of years from 1989 through 1997 when Korean growth was at least two
percentage points slower in the second of two successive seven year periods, the Chow Test
previously identified 1997 as the single most significant slowdown year; now, in contrast, it
picks out 1989. Other work (Eichengreen, Perkins and Shin 2012) has documented how the
Korean economy slowed down in two stages, one at the end of the 1980s and one around the

    This is also the approach taken by Hausmann, Pritchett and Rodrik (2005).
time of the financial crisis of 1997-8 and argued that 1989 was the more economically
significant structural break in the growth process. The current dating is more consistent with
that view.

       Slowdowns, when they occur, are large. In the new data set the per capita growth rate
slows by 3.6 percentage points between successive seven year periods (oil exporters
excluded). This is slightly larger than the average slowdown in the earlier data set.

        Figure 1 shows the per capita incomes at which growth rates slowed according to the
Chow-Test break points. Now, in contrast to before, there appear to be two modes in the
distribution of slowdown cases, one at a per capita GDP of approximately $11,000 and
another at a per capita GDP of approximately $15,000.

        The mode around $15,000 is familiar; cases clustered there include New Zealand in
1960, Greece in 1972, Spain in 1975, Ireland in 1978, and Portugal in 1990 but also Cyprus
in 1989, Gabon in 1974, Israel in 1976, Oman in 1986, and Singapore in 1980. Countries
experiencing slowdown at the modal per capita income we identified previously are, clearly,
a heterogeneous lot.

          In contrast, the mode at $11,000 is new. In part, it reflects the new dating for Korea,
with the country’s growth slowdown estimated to have occurred in 1989 (at a per capita
income of $10,570) rather than in 1997 (at a per capita income of $17,843), as noted above.
In part it reflects the fact, also already noted, that Austria in 1960 and Mexico in 1980 were
not considered previously because their per capita incomes were below the $10,000 cutoff
according to PWT 6.3 but are now slightly above according to the subsequent revision. A
number of other cases at what is now this second mode, Hungary in 1978-9 and Puerto Rico
in 1969 for example, were picked up previously, as were two oil exporters, Venezuela in
(1974 and Iran in 1977. The countries clustered at this second mode are, again, quite
heterogeneous.

        While growth in some of the countries in our sample appears, according to these
figures, to slow down at a unique point in time, quite a few experience multiple slowdowns.
Examples of the latter include Austria (1960 and 1974), Hungary (1977 and 2003), Greece
(the 1970s and 2003), Japan (the early 1970s and early 1990s), New Zealand (1960 and 1965-
6), Norway (1976 and 1997-8), Portugal (1973-4 and 1990-2), Puerto Rico (1970-2, 1988-91
and 2000-3), Singapore (post 1978 and post-1993), Spain (mid-1970s and 2001), and the UK
(1988-9 and 2002-3). This substantial list suggests that two-step slowdowns are not
uncommon.

  4 Correlates

        Table 2 summarizes the behavior of the independent variables in the full sample and
the slowdown cases. At the time of their growth slowdowns, “slowdown countries” have a
higher than average GDP per capita. Their per capita incomes average two thirds those of the
lead country (for most of the sample period the United States), compared to only one third for
the control group of non-slowdown cases. They are growing faster than average, suggesting
that growth slowdowns may have an element of mean reversion.
        In addition, while the country-year observations qualifying as slowdown cases are
more open to trade than average, it does not appear that they are subject to larger or more
variable terms-of-trade shocks. Slowdown countries are less likely than average to
experience political changes, both positive (from autocracy to democracy) and negative (from
democracy to autocracy). Our slowdown cases seem to have moved further up the
technological ladder into the production and export of high tech products compared to the
control group of countries.

        Consistent with this, our slowdown cases have higher average levels of education,
both overall and in terms of average years completed of secondary and tertiary schooling. In
contrast, there is not much of a difference in the simple incidence of financial crises between
slowdown cases and the control group, although the frequency of financial crises either in the
first year of the slowdown or one of the two years preceding is slightly higher in slowdown
cases.

    5 Determinants

         Throughout, we report regression results both identifying strings of consecutive
slowdown years and individual Chow-Test dates. We also report regressions including both
the level of per capita GDP and its ratio relative to the United States (some people preferring
the latter). While oil exporters are excluded in what follows, most of the results are, in fact,
robust to their inclusion.4

        Baseline Results

        Table 3 replicates our earlier baseline regressions of the occurrence of a slowdown on
per capita GDP and its square, expressed in levels and alternatively as a ratio to U.S. GDP per
capita on the pre-slowdown growth rate in percentage points and additional control. These
are probit regressions, where in Table 3.1 all slowdown years identified by our criteria are
coded as one, while in Table 3.2 we so code only the break point identified by the Chow Test.

        As before, both per capita GDP and its square enter with coefficients significantly
different from zero at the 1 per cent level, the level positively, the square negatively. When
we include only the level and square of per capita GDP (column 1), the likelihood of a
slowdown peaks at $17,900 US dollars (year 2005), a higher level than in the raw data and
higher than we found in our previous work. When we include other control variables, the
peak is even higher, just over $20,000.

        In addition, the probability of a slowdown is significantly greater the higher pre-
slowdown growth. Expressed in ratio form, the probability of a slowdown peaks when per
capita GDP is roughly three-quarters that in the lead country (column 2).

        As before, we still find that a high investment ratio increases the likelihood of a
slowdown over the relevant range. This relationship is even stronger when we include just
the linear term in the investment ratio. In the raw data there is a tendency for the investment

 The result that is most notably altered by their inclusion is the effect of political regime change, which
becomes even more significantly positive. This difference will appear even more plausible following the Arab
Spring and associated economic difficulties (not included in our data). See the appendix for details.
ratio to rise further from relatively high levels in the lead-up to slowdowns and to decline
thereafter.5

         Similarly, we again find that slowdowns are more likely in countries with
undervalued exchange rates, other things equal (here, as before, undervaluation is calculated
by regressing the real exchange rate on per capita GDP to account for Balassa-Samuelson
effects, and taking the residual). A high old-age dependency ratio similarly increases the
likelihood of a slowdown, although this result is no long statistically significant at
conventional confidence levels (it was only marginally significant in our earlier paper).
Again as before, we find that slowdowns are less likely in more open economies over the
relevant range, where this effect now registers at a higher level of statistical significance than
previously, especially when we code as one the entire sequence of consecutive slowdown
years. That this last effect is not consistent across alternative coding schemes will lead us to
revisit its significance below.

           Human Capital

        Next, we consider the association of slowdowns with years of schooling. We use data
from Barro and Lee (2011), who calculate average number of years of schooling for the
population aged 15 and above. As shown in Table 4, years of schooling in total displays no
evident association with slowdowns. But when we include both total years of schooling and
years of schooling at the secondary level and higher as separate variables, the latter is
strongly negative: the more university attendees and graduates, on average, the less the
likelihood of a slowdown.

         That the number of graduates of secondary schools and universities exerts this
negative effect is intuitive: more advanced education may be especially valuable for middle-
income countries seeking to avoid a slowdown by moving into more the production of more
technologically sophisticated goods and services. But why total years of schooling is
positively (and in most cases significantly) associated with the probability of a slowdown
after controlling separately for higher education is less intuitive. A conjecture would be that
countries with some educational attainment that falls short of secondary are better able to
move into relatively low-value added industries and activities (assembly operations and the
like), leading to an acceleration of growth, but then find it harder to move up market when
challenged from below by other late-industrializing, low-labor cost countries. This renders
them vulnerable to the so-called middle-income trap.

              Political Regime Changes

          In Tables 5 and 6 we consider the effect of political regime changes. We
distinguish countries with positive political changes (movements away from autocracy and
toward democracy) and negative political changes (movements away from democracy and
toward autocracy). Our data on political regimes are drawing from the Polity IV data set,
which codes countries on a one-to-ten scale (full autocracy to full democracy).

         In Table 5 we list slowdown cases where there was a political regime change in the
preceding five years. We see a large predominance of positive regime change cases,

    These results are not reported but available upon request.
reflecting the secular move in the direction of democratization in the final decades of the 20th
century. Among our slowdown cases, only Bahrain, Greece and Israel go the other way.6
          Table 6 shows the associated regressions. Political change overall (both positive
and negative) has no significant association with the probability of a slowdown. But when
we distinguish positive and negative changes, positive changes significantly increase the
likelihood of a slowdown in one of our two specifications.

          Movements in the direction of democracy are sometimes associated increases in
labor action and production costs – in Korea following democratization in 1987 and around
the time of the country’s 1989 slowdown, for example. Park (2007) shows in the Korean
case that nominal wage rates, having tracked nominal labor productivity closely before 1987,
diverged sharply in that country in the aftermath of democratization. Sharp increases in labor
costs as previously successful efforts by authoritarian governments to suppress labor
demands come to an end with the transition to political democratization, as in Korea, may
more generally explain the association between positive political change and the increased
likelihood of a slowdown. As explained in section 2, for Korea our methodology identifies a
growth slowdown in 1989.

           External Factors

          Table 7 looks more broadly at the role of external factors in precipitating growth
slowdowns, distinguishing trade openness from terms-of-trade shocks and global GDP
growth. We enter both variables in levels and interacted with trade openness on the grounds
that external shocks might have a more powerful impact on the probability of a slowdown in
more open economies.

          As noted above, the effect of trade openness is not consistent across specifications.
For what they are worth, the specifications yielding the most precisely estimated coefficients
suggest that the likelihood of a slowdown is minimized at a trade (export plus import)-to-
GDP ratio of approximately 1.3.

          We define the terms of trade shock as a dummy variable that takes on a value of one
if the growth rate of the terms of trade from t-1 to t is in the lowest 10 per cent of the sample
distribution. The coefficient on this variable varies in sign and is generally insignificant. The
coefficient on global GDP growth also differs insignificantly from zero in most
specifications, but where it is significant it is always negative, consistent with intuition. Note
also that when we control for terms of trade and global growth shocks the impact of openness
is now spottier than before. But if levels of statistical significance on this variable differ by
column, we continue to find that the likelihood of a slowdown is minimized at a trade
(import-plus-export) to GDP ratio of approximately 1.3.

          This more careful look at external factors thus confirms that these matter for growth
slowdowns in the expected way, although precise effects are sensitive to sample and
specification.

 We are not sure why Polity down-codes Israel from 10 (the highest level of democracy) to 9 in 1967. This
period saw the prime minister strengthen his authority over the entire range of cabinet activity (Asher, Nachmias
and Amir 2002, pp.52, 55-6), which Polity may interpret as a modest decline in checks on the executive..
           Technology Content of Exports

         An important challenge for middle-income countries seeking to maintain their
customary high growth rates is to move up the technological ladder into the production of
more technologically sophisticated goods, in part in order to get out of the way of lower-cost
developing countries beginning to penetrate global markets for low-tech products (assembly
operations and the like).

          In Tables 8.1 and 8.2 we therefore report regressions that include the share of high
tech exports as a share of total manufactured exports. In Table 8.2, where we use the Chow-
Test approach to identify unique slowdown years, the results suggest that middle-income
countries with a relatively large share of high-tech exports are less susceptible to slowdowns.
The results in Table 8.1, where we code as slowdowns the entire sequence of slowdown years,
are less supportive of the hypothesis. But even there the interaction of the share of high-tech
exports with global growth is negative, suggesting that middle income countries that have
moved out of assembly operations are less vulnerable to global demand shocks.

           Financial Instability

         Tables 9 and 10 consider the association of crises with slowdown risk. We create a
dummy variable that equals one for all years in which Reinhart and Rogoff (2010) identify a
banking crisis, a currency crisis, a domestic default, an external default, an inflationary crisis,
a stock market crash, or several of the above.

          Table 9 shows the distribution of crises around our Chow Test slowdown dates.
Most types of crises – currency crises, banking crises, debt crises, inflation crises –
accompany only a relatively small minority of our slowdown cases. Stock market crises or
crashes are clearly different; there is a relatively high incidence of these both before and after
our slowdown episodes. It makes sense that stock markets should react negatively to
slowdowns and that, to the extent that they look forward, they should react negatively in
advance of slowdowns. Whether this negative association deserves a causal interpretation is
an open question.

          Table 10 reports the associated regression results. The crisis dummy lagged one
year is positive and consistently significant at a relatively high level of confidence when we
consider the entire sequence of slowdown years. The other results reported previously
remain intact. In Table 11 we exclude stock market crises-cum-crises. The significant
positive association of crises lagged one year with slowdowns remains in Table 11.1.7

          To shed some light on the channels through which crises may lead to slowdowns,
we added the investment ratio both before and after the year of the observation to this
specification. Specifically, we added two variables, one the average investment-to-GDP ratio
over the preceding seven years, the other the average investment-to-GDP ratio over the
subsequent seven years. In this augmented specification, the investment ratio tends to enter
positively before the slowdown (as before) but negatively thereafter; both measures are
generally statistically significant at the ten per cent confidence level or better.8 Importantly,

  In the final column, however, there is also a peculiar negative and significant coefficient on crises lagged two
years, which renders us cautious about pushing this finding too far.

the crisis variable no longer differs from zero at conventional confidence levels. This
suggests that crises may lead to slowdowns by depressing investment for an extended period.
This pattern is well known from, inter alia, the Asian crisis. These results suggest that the
mechanism may be more general.

     6 Conclusion and Additional Thoughts

           Rapid growth in emerging markets is perhaps the single most important economic
development affecting the world’s population in the last quarter century. An important
question is therefore “How long will it last?” Interest in this question has intensified with the
deterioration in the global outlook following the onset of the global financial crisis. Even
China, the largest and most dynamic emerging market, has seen slower growth since the
crisis, although opinion is divided over what this implies for the future.

          Much of the literature on this topic flies under the heading of “the middle income
trap.” A number of emerging markets have grown rapidly at low income levels but were
ultimately unable to move beyond middle income status. The troubled global outlook now
poses a risk that even dynamic middle income economies like China that are unable to adapt
may similarly find themselves trapped, as it were.9

          In this paper we have again considered what history has to say about this question,
revisiting the incidence and correlates of growth slowdowns. We continue to find
considerable dispersion in the per capita incomes at which slowdowns occur. But, in contrast
to our earlier results, which pointed to the existence of a single mode around $15,000-
$16,000 purchasing power parity 2005 dollars at which slowdowns typically occur, our new
analysis points to the existence of two modes, one in the $10,000-$11,000 range and another
around $15,000-$16,0000. A substantial number of countries in our sample appear to
experience two slowdowns, consistent with the existence of multiple modes. This is
suggestive of the idea that growth in middle-income countries slows in several steps. It
implies that a larger group of middle-income countries may be at risk of slowdowns than
suggested by our earlier estimates and that middle-income countries may find their growth
slowing at lower levels of income.

          The new analysis again confirms that slowdowns are more likely in economies with
high old age dependency ratios, high investment rates that may translate into low future
returns on capital, and undervalued real exchange rates that provide a disincentive to move up
the technology ladder. These patterns will presumably remind readers of current conditions
and recent policies in China, the case motivating much of the slowdown literature.

          In addition, we find that slowdowns are less likely in countries with high levels of
secondary and tertiary education and where high-tech products account for a large share of
exports, consistent with our earlier emphasis of the importance of moving up the technology
ladder in order to avoid the middle income trap.

          What do these new results imply for China? China has slightly higher average
years of schooling at the secondary level than the median for our slowdown cases (3.17 years
in China versus 2.72 years in our slowdown cases). It has a higher share of high-tech goods in

9
    See, for example, ADB (2012a).
exports (27.5 per cent in China versus 24.1 in our slowdown cases). In this sense China
appears to be doing slightly better than average in moving up the technology ladder in order
to avoid the middle-income trap.

          Our finding that high quality human capital reduces the probability of a slowdown
seems intuitive. Skilled workers are needed to move up the value chain from low value-added
industries and activities. High quality human capital is especially important for modern high
value-added activities like business services. ADB (2012b) finds that the underdevelopment
of the service sector in China and other Asian emerging markets is attributable partly to the
dominance of traditional low value-added services. It identifies shortages of appropriate
human capital as an important explanation for the weakness of modern high value-added
services.

          Even emerging markets that have achieved rapid improvement in overall education
attainment can suffer from shortages of specific kinds of skilled workers. ADB (2008) warns
that such shortages are sufficiently prevalent to pose a risk to growth in China and other parts
of emerging Asia. Surveys of employers in China and emerging Asia regularly identify
shortages of qualified staff as a top business concern. For example, lack of high quality
human capital helps to explain why Malaysia and Thailand have become synonymous with
the middle income trap. In contrast, the rapid expansion of secondary and then tertiary
education helps to explain Korea’s successful transition from middle to high income status.
Whether China can avoid the middle income trap will presumably depend, in part, on whether
it develops an education system that successfully produces graduates with skills that
employers require.

          That a large share of high-tech exports is negatively associated with the likelihood
of a slowdown points to the same conclusion. Intuitively, the inherited stock of human capital
shapes a country’s ability to move up the technology ladder and its capacity export products
embodying advanced technology. As they reach middle income status, emerging markets
typically import advanced technology from more advanced countries. Taking the next step,
which involves adapting imported technology to local conditions and embodying it in exports
with high local content, requires a pool of highly skilled workers.

           Other variables, from political regime changes and financial instability to trade
openness and terms-of-trade shocks, also show some association with growth slowdowns.
But compared to educational attainment and the structure of exports, they are less robustly
related. The insignificance of global growth offers some hope that China and other emerging
markets can continue to grow at healthy rates despite an unfavorable global environment.
Finally, the apparent correlation between political regime change and growth slowdowns may
in fact reflect the influence of common underlying drivers of both political change and
growth slowdowns. Social factors like those responsible for the Arab Spring may bring about
both economic and political changes, in other words.

          At some point, high growth in middle-income countries will come to an end. The
low hanging fruit will have been picked, and high-return investments will have been
completed. Underemployed labor will have been transferred from rural to urban sectors,
while the demographic dividend will become a demographic drag. But this does not mean
that a slowdown at a specific income level is inevitable. Not all countries are equally
susceptible. Countries accumulating high quality human capital and moving into the
production of higher tech exports stand a better chance of avoiding the middle income trap.

Note: The per capita GDP data are collected from Penn World Table 6.3 (old episodes) and 7.1 (new episodes).
Both refers to the cases where the slowdown episodes are identified by both Penn World Table 6.3 and 7.1. We
limit slowdowns to cases in which per capita GDPis greater than US$ 10,000 in 2005 constant international PPP
prices to rule outgrowth crises in not yet successfully developing economies.Slowdown years marked by * in
old episodes indicate that they are excluded in new episodes because per capita GDP is not over US$10,000 is
Penn World Table 7.1. Shaded countries are oil exporters. When we identify a stringof consecutive years as
growth slowdowns, we employ a Chow test for structural breaks to select only one year that is most
significant.The selected years by the Chow test are denoted in bold.

Note: Bahrain, Gabon, and Kuwait (shaded) are classified as oil exporting countries. The slowdown points identified by
Chow test points are denoted in bold. Positive regime change” takes a value of 1 if a regime change increases the polity
score (meaning more democracy) during the past 5 year period when a slowdown occurs. “Negative regime change” is
defined analogously for a decrease in the polity score during the same time period.

Note: The sample excludes oil exporting countries. If a string of consecutive years are identified as growth
slowdowns, we employ a Chow test for structural breaks to select only one for which the Chow test is most
significant. “Terms of trade shock” is a dummy variable that takes a value of 1 if the growth rate of terms of
trade from t-1 to t is in the lower 10%. Numbers in parentheses are standard errors. *Statistically significant at
the 5 percent level. **Statistically significant at the 1 percent level.

Note: The six crises are those identified by Reinhart and Rogoff (2010). “t” refers to the slowdown years. If we
exclude oil exporting countries, total of 146 and 32 slowdown episodes are identified in consecutive and Chow-test
points respectively. If we exclude the episodes with missing data for crises, total of 115 and 27 episodes remained
for consecutive and Chow-test points respectively. The last column in each panel counts slowdown episodes that did
not experience the crisis denoted in the first column.

Note: The sample excludes oil exporting countries. If a string of consecutive years are identified as growth slowdowns, we employ a Chowtest for structural
breaks to select only one for which the Chow test is most significant. The dummy for crises takes a value of 1if any of six crises identified by Reinhart and
Rogoff (2010) occurs. Numbers in parentheses are standard errors. * Statistically significant at the 5 percent level. ** Statistically significant at the 1 percent
level.
