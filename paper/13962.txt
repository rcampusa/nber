                                             ABSTRACT

The establishment recently of risk management vehicles for home prices is described. The potential
value of such vehicles, once they become established, is seen in consideration of the inefficiency of
the market for single family homes. Institutional changes that might derive from the establishment
of these new markets are described. An important reason for these beginnings of real estate derivative
markets is the advance in home price index construction methods, notably the repeat sales method,
that have appeared over the last twenty years. Psychological barriers to the full success of such markets
are discussed.

                       Derivatives Markets for Home Prices


       The near absence of derivatives markets for real estate, particularly single family

homes, is a striking anomaly that cries out for explanation and for actions to change the

situation. In the U.S. alone, the value of real estate held by households is about $20

trillion, which rivals the stock market. And yet the kinds of derivative instruments

available for real estate are miniscule compared to those of stocks.

       The proper hedging of real estate risks is of the utmost importance. Risk

management theory never said that only stock and bond risks should be managed. All

economic risks should be managed. There are many kinds of economic risks that are not

managed, and real estate risk is high on the list. The recent “subprime crisis” might be

described as the result of failure to mange risks properly. Recent research by Karl Case

and John Quigley [2007] shows that repercussions of recent and projected home price

falls through the financial markets are far more important than the direct wealth effects

on the economy. If any factor will push the U.S. economy into recession in 2008, it will

be the financial repercussions of the housing decline. The repercussions of major changes

in real estate prices go far beyond the risk of recession, since they impinge on the well

being of hundreds of millions of people who are often locked into highly-mortgage-

leveraged positions in their individual homes.

Beginnings of Derivative Markets

       Case and I have been working and thinking about real estate risk and how it might

better managed for nearly twenty years. We effectively began our public advocacy for

real estate futures markets in our 1989 paper on the efficiency of the market for single

family homes. In that paper, we showed that well-constructed repeat-sales home price

can accurately capture trends in the real estate market (more on this in the next section).

The paper also found that these repeat-sales indices, which are not subject to the noise

caused by change in mix of sales that previous indices were, are very autocorrelated and

forecastable, with a forecast R-squared at a one-year horizon of about a half. We

attributed this forecastability to the profound illiquidity of the market. Much subsequent

research, for example Glaeser and Gyourko [2006], or Gyourko Mayer and Sinai [2006],

confirms the inefficiency of the market for homes.

       Professional investors find it very costly to trade in this market, and very costly to

maintain an inventory of homes as investments. Thus, they cannot take advantage of the

forecastability of home prices and cannot take actions that would enforce the efficiency

of the market. The problem has been the total absence of derivative markets for real

estate prices. Mortgages have extensive derivative markets, but there have been, until

very recently, no derivative markets at all tied to real estate prices. If such markets could

be created, they might ultimately lead towards more liquidity in the cash markets. Thus

began our mission to create just such markets.

       We thought that if a liquid futures market (or another kind of derivative market)

could be established for single family homes, it might provide the financial infrastructure

to bring forth a number of new financial instruments. I later described some of these in




                                              4
my 1993 book Macro Markets: home equity insurance, down payment insurance on

home mortgages, or price warranties on new homes, and it might allow the rationalization

of a number of businesses. Some of these institutions have since been put in place (see

for example William Goetzmann et al. 2007), but their success has been limited by the

absence of hedging markets

       Karl Case, Allan Weiss and I began our campaign to launch futures markets on

single family homes in 1990. We named ourselves the “Index Research Group,” but by

June we were “Case Shiller Weiss Research Group.” We presented our idea at the Coffee

Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (which had previously launched the innovative, but

ultimately unsuccessful consumer price index futures market) in August 1990, the

Chicago Board of Trade in November 1990. In November 1991, we, along with partner

Charles Longfield, created Case Shiller Weiss, Inc, a firm whose sole purpose then was

to produce home price indices designed expressly to settle financial contracts. The

discussions with the Chicago Board of Trade led to an alliance of our firm with the

Chicago Board of Trade to study the possibility of launching home price futures.

       The Board did a telephone survey in 1993 of potential traders. They concluded

that they found people willing to sell real estate futures, but no one willing to buy. So,

they became reluctant to try to launch the products then. We tried to argue with them that

it is probably easier to discover short interest than long interest in a prospective new

market, for the short interest are those people who own real estate and have a hedging

need, while for the long interest it is those people who want merely to add real estate to

their investment portfolios, and they cannot feel any particular interest in investing in the

contracts until they know what the price is and how it relates to other investment returns.




                                              5
However, despite our arguments, ultimately the Board decided not to try launching the

market.

       The London Futures and Options Exchange, London Fox, beat us to the market,

though not as competitors since they launched in a different country. They launched their

property futures market in 1991. They attempted to create futures markets for both single-

family homes and also commercial real estate. However, in the few months over which

these markets were open, there was little trade. The rapid demise of these markets was

not due directly to the low volume, but to efforts to pad the volume. Traders were doing

wash trades to pad the volume numbers, and when this fact was discovered, the markets

were shut down in a scandal. People I spoke to in London in 1991 expressed

disappointment that this wash trading scandal had shut down the market before it had

been open long enough to be given a real test. Indeed, the failure of this market did not

prove anything about the ultimate viability of such markets, though it created a bad

precedent, and slowed down the launch of our own markets by many years.

       The beginnings of a worldwide boom in home prices in the late 1990s led to

renewed interest in markets for home values. In the U.K., City Index launched a spread

betting market in single family homes in 2001, and this was quickly followed by another

spread betting market launched by IG Index in 2002. However, both these markets were

shut down by 2004. Attempts have been made to reopen property spread betting markets

in the United Kingdom. Cantor Index has launched spread betting on U.K. home prices

(www.spreadfair.com).

       Goldman Sachs opened a market in 2003 for covered warrants on UK home price

indices on the London Stock Exchange that were settled in terms of the Halifax home




                                             6
price indices. However, as of 2004, the open interest was very small, roughly the amount

that one would expect if only 100 houses were hedged. It has seemed hard to get hedging

markets started for real estate.

       Hedgestreet.com created markets for single family homes, among other markets,

in 2004, on a dedicated web site aimed at consumers. The site allowed trading in

“hedgelets” which were in effect $10 bets on the direction of home prices, bets which

could be used (if very many such bets were made by one homeowner) to hedge

movements in home prices. It was thought by the founder, John Nafeh, that people would

use these hedgelets to help insulate them from economic risks. However, the site was not

a success, and trading has been shut down and replaced with mock trading only.

       In May 2006 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (now the CME Group, after the

2007 merger with the Chicago Board of Trade), in collaboration with the firm

MacroMarkets LLC that Allan Weiss, Sam Mauscci and I founded, launched futures and

options markets on the home price indices that Case and I pioneered, now called the

Standard and Poor’s/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices. These indices are produced by

Fiserv, Inc., the company that purchased Case Shiller Weiss, Inc. in 2002 and continues

to produce the thousands of Case-Shiller home price indices by county, zip code, and

price tier. Futures contracts, with a February quarterly cycle of expiration dates and

settled at $250 times the index were launched for ten U.S. cities and an aggregate index.

This market has been much more successful and credible than its predecessors. The total

notional value of futures and options traded since inception is $612 million through

November 21, 2007. There continue to be substantial trades, for example, in the week

November 5-9, 2007, a notional value of $2,782,600 was traded. However, the futures




                                             7
open interest in the ten contracts together, which peaked at $109 million in February

2007, has fallen with each contract expiration, and stood at $49 million as of November

21, 2007. Between contract expirations the open interest has been growing at a good rate:

open interest grew at a steady rate, cumulating to a 39% increase in the three months

since the August 31 2007 expiration, so there are some signs of hope for growth of these

contracts. The longer maturities (from one year to five years) that were added in

September 2007 may enhance the product’s utility.

        There have also been new markets for commercial real estate. In London, the

Investment Property Databank (IPD) has begun to be used for derivative products, for

which the global notional outstanding value of property derivatives trades has reached

£11.5 billion. 2 A swaps market for real estate has begun to develop in the United States.

A company called Radar Logic in the United States has found some success in creating

home price derivatives for single family homes with its RPX index, based on the median

of a maximum likelihood estimate of the distribution of all home prices sold in the time

period per square foot of floor space, existing, new, condominium.

        On November 2, 2007 the Chicago Mercantile Exchange announced that it was

expanding its suite of real estate indices to include the S&P/GRA Commercial Real

Estate Indices, which are a joint venture of Standard & Poor’s and Global Real

Analytics/Charles Schwab Investment Management, the indices spearheaded by Robert

Edelstein. The S&P/GRA index is not a repeat sales index, since the authors conclude

that there are too few sales of commercial real estate for such a method. 3 Their method

 However, David Geltner and Henry Pollakowski of MIT and the company REAL have recently partnered

major U. S. regions: Northeast, Mid-Atlantic South, Midwest, Desert Mountain and

Pacific West and four property sectors, apartments, office, retail and warehouse. Listings

for futures contracts for all nine of these contracts and for horizons out as far as five years

were posted on October 29, 2007, but trade of these indices has not yet begun.



Repeat Sales Indices

       The most important innovation to make real estate derivatives markets possible

has been advances in index technology, notably the advance of electronic technology for

recording home sales prices and the invention and development of repeat sales home

price indices. The repeat sales indices are the natural extension of existing stock price

indices, like the S&P 500. The changes through time in the S&P 500 index are based on

changes in the price of individual stocks. If individual stock prices don’t change, then the

index does not change.

       The S&P500 index level does not go up if there is a higher volume of sales in

higher-priced stocks, it is expressly designed so that volume of sales of the individual

stocks does not affect the index, only the changes in their prices do. However, for real

estate, the nontrading problem (the problem that a property of share is not traded at all for

some time) is much more severe, and requires explicit attention.

       Karl Case had an important insight in his 1986 paper: the repeat sales method

allows us to construct home price indices that controlled for quality change in an

objective and systematic way. He independently rediscovered the repeat sales (or

repeated measures) price index method, which was previously described by Wyngarten




                                              9
[1927], Wenzlick [1952], and Bailey Muth and Nourse [1963]. The repeat sales method

was not received with any enthusiasm when proposed by these authors. As far as we

know, no ongoing effort to produce repeat sales home price effort was ever launched

before we did that. But Case convinced me that the repeat sales method was essential,

and thus the natural method for index number construction, as we I will expand on here.

       The repeat sales method was criticized by Mark and Goldberg [1984] as throwing

away too much data, since only homes for which sales prices at two different dates can be

used. With hedonic methods, in contrast, every single sales observation can be used as an

input to the index. It may sound from this that hedonic methods have an advantage, but,

with the exception of cases where data are very sparse or there is a reason to think that

repeat sales are highly unrepresentative, that is not the case.

       I remember Case convincing me that for the purpose of creating indexes for

settlement of financial contracts, the repeat sales method is the only way to go. He

maintained that he could make a price index do anything you might want by choosing

hedonic variables to that end. The problem is that there are too many possible hedonic

variables that might be included, and if there are n possible hedonic variables, then there

are n-factorial possible lists of independent variables in a hedonic regression, often a very

large number. One could strategically vary the list of included variables until one found

the results one wanted. Looking at different hedonic indices for the same city, I

remember seeing substantial differences, which must be due to choices the constructors

made. Thus, the indices have the appearance of hypotheses rather than objective facts.

One is reminded of Ed Leamer’s paper, “Let’s Take the Con out of Econometrics,” when




                                              10
he remarked on the multitude of tricks that econometricians use to get the results they

want, and what they sometimes seem to want is just to come up with a different result. .

       Hedonic variables can come into significance in a regression for spurious reasons.

For example, it has been reported that a dummy for air conditioning in hedonic

regressions explaining home prices sometimes has the wrong sign, allegedly in at least

one instance because houses on the shore where there are cool breezes were less likely to

have air conditioning, and also be more valuable since they are on the shore. Thus, if air

conditioning becomes more common over the years, a price index based on hedonic

regression that includes the air conditioning dummy but excludes a variable representing

proximity to shore could show a spurious downtrend in price. If an econometrician

wanted to score points by contradicting earlier indices, a search over the set of all

possible hedonic regressors for the right combination of regressors might well achieve

this. This can leave the public confidence in the indices in disarray, by creating an

impression that no one knows what home prices are doing.

       As I argued in my book Macro Markets [1993], one may think of the repeat sales

home price index method as a hedonic regression where there is one dummy hedonic

variable for each house, and no other hedonic variables. That is, we can think of the

repeat sales regression method as taking each sales price as an observation for the

dependent variable (so that the number of observations equals the number of all single

sales, whether in pairs or not) and using as independent variables as complete set of time

dummies (one for each time period) and a complete set of house dummies (one for each

house, the ith dummy being 1 only if the sale represents the ith house). Any house that is

sold only once is in effect “dummied out” in such a regression and has no effect on the




                                             11
results. In that sense, we are not throwing away data by using repeat sales methods; we

are using all the data with a very complete set of hedonic variables that is defined in a

systematic way that eliminates all possible discretion in choosing hedonic variables.

       Square foot of property is just an example of one hedonic variable, and taking

some as an index some indicator of price per square foot is in effect running a hedonic

regression and constraining the coefficient of this variable to be one and the constant term

to be zero, so that no regression need be calculated at all. There are so many other

hedonic variables, including for example square foot of lot, quality of neighborhood, etc.,

that the price per square foot alone is only one of very many quality measures. The

constant term in a hedonic regression of price on square feet of floor space will certainly

have a nonzero constant term, which differs across neighborhoods and property types.

       It is very important to get the index number construction method right when one

starts trading real estate derivatives. One anomalous reading from an index that has

inadequate controls for quality mix could cost traders millions of dollars and could create

bad feeling for the entire concept of real estate derivatives.

       As an exercise, to add some perspective on the potential importance of repeat

sales, I computed a monthly volume-weighted median price of the 500 stocks that

comprise the S&P 500 index, January 2003 to December 2007. I used twelve-month

average volume of sales for each stock as the weight of its price in calculating the

median. This is doing something analogous to what the National Association of Realtors

does when it computes the median price of existing homes. In contrast, S&P takes careful

account of the changing number of shares outstanding for each stock, and, when stocks

are added or removed from the index, the divisor is adjusted appropriately so that there is




                                              12
no sudden spurious jump in the index. But for this exercise, I dispensed with a divisor

altogether, and let the sales volume for each stock determine the weight it got in the

index. The National Association of Realtors of course has no divisor since it takes no

account of changes in the mix of homes, and makes no other adjustments for possible

jumps in the index caused by sudden changes in the mix of sales. The resultant stock

price index that I got looks quite different from the S&P 500. The correlation coefficient

between the monthly changes in the volume-weighted median and the change in the S&P

500 was only 0.38. Moreover, the standard deviation of the monthly percentage change in

the volume-weighted median was over twice as high as that of the S&P 500.

          This exercise with the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index has, to my knowledge, not

been tried before. Apparently no one would choose a volume-weighted stock price index

if they had their a choice, so no one does it, and all stock price indices are repeat-sales

indices. (Volume weighted indices have been used for special purposes, for example, in

constructing measures of the mispricing of options, volume-weighting has been used so

that mispricing of insignificantly-traded options does not overly affect the measure of

mispricing. The volume-weighted stock price has also been used in studies of transaction

costs.)

          Repeat sales methods thus do not use new home prices. This is a potentially

important advantage when compared with other indices that incorporate both new and

existing home prices. A problem with including new home prices could at some times be

severe: the median price of a new home in nature of the supply of new homes on the

market changes through time, as market conditions change. If high quality houses in

wealthy neighborhoods and with lots of land are selling well in good school districts at




                                              13
some times, then new home prices will at those times be higher than usual, even if there

is no change at all in the price of individual homes.

       Between May 2006 and December 2007, the monthly ratio of new sales to

existing sales (the former from U.S. Census, the latter from the National Association of

Realtors) ranged between 10.4% to 18.2%, a significant variation. But, the fraction of

sales constituting new sales is relatively low, and the difference in price (the median new

home sales price only 10.5% higher on average) so that the weighting anomalies have not

been large. The presence of new sales along with existing sales could, however, become

an important problem in the future, if either the fraction of sales or the relative price of

new homes varies a lot.

       The problem with raw new home sales prices is that they are a virtually

meaningless series, for they represent a price of a constantly changing thing. New homes

are built in times and places where the market is strong, and hence are highly

unrepresentative of home prices, even of newer home prices. Certainly, new homes will

not be built at all in areas where home prices have declined far enough that price is below

construction cost. Looking at median new home prices as an indicator of the market is

like looking at the median price of a piece of fruit sold as an indicator of the fruit market,

without regard for the fact that the varieties of fruit sold changes over time.

       We can see other important changes in the mix of homes sold. According to the

Massachusetts Association of Realtors, the fraction of Boston-area home sales that were

condos rose from 26.3% in 1998 to 49.5% in 2005, a near-doubling of the fraction

condos. Condos are very different from single-family homes, and if price is corrected for




                                              14
square feet of floor space, may have a very different relation to square feet than do

single-family homes, for, indeed, the latter has substantial land as well.

       We of course do not have data on all dimensions of change in mix. But the data

we do have suggests that change in mix can be very important, and should be dealt with

carefully. The best method we have today to take account of change in mix is to use

repeat sales indices, and we have also been producing repeat sales method separately for

price tier (low, medium or high-priced homes) and property type (single-family or condo)

and anyone who wants a specific mix of these types had best use a weighted average of

such repeat-sales indices.



Other Indices

       Because of these problems, the Census Department has produced since 1964 a

“Constant Quality (LaSpeyres) Price Index of New One-Family Homes Under

Construction.” The correlation between the monthly change in their median new home

price and the monthly change in their Constant Quality Index May 2006-December 2007

has been only 0.11. This figure is surprisingly low, and indicates the sharp changes in

mix that occur month to month. It is remarkable that the news media seem to accept the

latest median new home price number, and largely ignore the Constant Quality Index,

when the former is so heavily driven by what must be just noise.

       In the current (2005) incarnation of the Constant Quality index, Census uses, in

addition to the average square feet of floor area of the house, also the log of square feet,

and 49 other variables that indicate quality and geographical location. They use census

region, construction method, exterior wall material, heating system and air conditioning




                                             15
form, parking facilities, finished basement, number of bathrooms, number of fireplaces,

etc. It is unlikely, however, that even with all these variables, that they can really get a

price of a constant quality new house, because change is the essence of new houses, as

they are built in the precise micro-geographical- area and with precise features that

represent current buyer interests.

        A repeat-sales index such as the Case-Shiller index solves all these problems by

following individual homes through time. We could also add to a repeat sales regression

additional hedonic variables, so long as these variables change over time for individual

houses, otherwise there would be multicollinearity. I called such a regression a hedonic-

repeated-measures regression, 1993. 4 However, any such method is inherently tied to

taking account of important hedonic variables that change through time for an individual

house, and we do not have good candidates for such variables at the present time.

        There are other directions toward which repeat sales indices could be improved.

Childs, Ott and Riddiough [2002] have shown a method that deals with noise in asset

prices that creates a time-filtered value that takes account of autocorrelation. Genesove

and Mayer have shown a regression method that corrects equilibrium home prices for

bias from homeowners holding out for a better price. Bradford Case and John Quigley

[1991] have shown a different way of combining hedonic and repeat sales methodology.

The index methodology is something that may be changed somewhat in the future to

reflect better methodology, though we need to be conservative in our adjustment of

methods if we are to maintain trust of the market, and wary of any methods that might

involvement judgment or the possibility of manipulation.

       Of course we have to throw away data if we want to measure some theoretical

quantity accurately. That is what futures markets in fact systematically do when they

narrowly define the kind of commodity that may be delivered in fulfillment of a futures

contract. In wheat futures, for example, one may be required to deliver hard winter wheat,

of a certain kind and quality, and cannot substitute soft summer wheat for delivery. The

futures exchanges make these rules for they know that if they did otherwise the price of

the wheat delivered would be erratic, for at some times one kind of wheat would be

delivered and at other times another grade would be.



A Regret Theory Approach to Understanding Obstacles to Hedging Real Estate Prices

       The UK spread betting markets were shut down just at the time that home prices

in the United Kingdom had begun to fall in 2004 after a huge boom. In December 2004 I

talked to John Austin, who was manager of the property spread betting at IG Index, and

inquired why they had shut down the market. He said “We’re only getting one-way

sentiment.” He said that the volume of trade was rapidly falling off, and that it was as if

everyone had the same opinion about the UK housing market, that it would decline, and

hence there was no basis for trade. This view would be rather ironic, for in fact the UK

property market had a remarkable turn of fortune and prices began to increase rapidly

again starting in 2005.

       But it seems that Austin was trying to say to me that people who might have

traded were of two views, there were people who hoped to take short positions in a non-

backwardated market, and people who hoped to take long positions in a backwardated

market. But there were few crossings of orders, so little trade.




                                             17
        I also asked him why he thought there was relatively little volume in these bets

even before the drop in home prices, for, when they launched these contracts, the market

in the U.K. was rising. Wouldn’t one think that in a time of such attention to housing

market conditions that a substantial number of people would want to hedge their homes?

He said that they had never promoted spread betting as a hedging device, and that

virtually all of their customers were in it for sport or amusement, not hedging.

        Note that the theory he presented for the relatively low volume of the IG Index

property spread betting market is analogous to that which is often used to describe the

tendency of volume of sales on the housing market itself to decline in times of falling

prices. The oft-cited theory is that home owners are reluctant to realize a loss on their

house, and so hold out trying to wait until the market provides them with the profit that

they want. They simply regret having bought at a high price, and wish to avoid the pain

of regret by avoiding selling. Regret theory [Loomis and Sugden, 1982] can model this

behavior, and the Prospect Theory of Kahneman and Tversky [1979] yields similar

implications.

        Genesove and Mayer showed, with data on Boston condominium sales, that

indeed those home owners who bought when home prices were higher than currently held

out longer than did home owners who bought when prices were lower. It appears that

there is a pain of regret at selling at a loss, and so people take steps to avoid this pain

even if it means not selling the property for a long time. Psychologists have documented

that pain of regret is actively avoided, even if the means to do so represent deliberate self

deception.




                                              18
       Case and I have been doing surveys of recent home buyers and sellers and asked

those who had had trouble selling their house, why they did not lower their price:

23n. If your property did not sell, presumably it might have if you had
lowered the asking price more. If you considered doing so but decided
not to, can you say why?
1. My house is worth more than people seem to be willing to pay right
now
2. I can't afford to sell at a lower price
3. By holding out, I will be able to get more later
4. I didn’t want to pay off my low rate mortgage
5. Other:________________________________________________

In our 2007 survey, only 27 of our 300 respondents reported having had trouble selling

their prior house and chose to answer this question. But, for what this is worth, a third of

them picked 1, and a third of them picked 2, 11% picked 3, 0% picked 4 and 22% picked

5. Two thirds of them picked 1 and 2, answers which would appear to be consistent with

the regret theory, and only 11% picked three, which would be a purely rational economic

motivation.

       Psychologists say that the pain of regret is something that people like to avoid. If

they have made a mistake that has lost them money, they don’t want to think about it.

       In a down market, such as in London in 2004, it is now clear that owners of real

estate are going to lose substantially, because of the inertial nature of housing markets.

One has already lost the expected amount of the loss, in effect, if one is not going to sell

the property, and it will be painful to watch. Therefore, the natural hedgers would like to

tune out and just forget about it.

       Suppose the London market is expected to lose 10% over the next year. That is

already a given. A hedger, however, is supposed to be wanting to hedge against the risk

that it will go down 20%. So, the hedger sells a futures contract. If the price of the house

goes down 20%, he is rewarded by the futures contract, so that his total loss (on his




                                             19
house) is only 10%. But, on the other side, if home prices don’t go down at all, then he

still loses 10%.

        Maybe that is what John Austin was discovering. If he lowers the price so far that

it would mean that a hedger would lose if prices drop only 5%, they just don’t want to

think about that.

        Kahneman and Tversky, the authors of prospect theory, say that people are risk

lovers for losses, that they willing to take big risks to try to get off scot-free, with no loss.

If you take a short futures contract on real estate in a down market, you eliminate the

possibility of getting off scot-free. So, perhaps that is why people don’t want to do it.

They don’t want to face up to the fact that they have lost money.

        The reason property is so different from other markets is that it must sometimes

take deep discounts because there are expectations of big price change. Other markets for

liquid assets are nearly random walks. Oil is an example of an existing futures market

that may more closely resemble the futures market for housing. The Nymex futures

market for light sweet crude oil has been in backwardation about half the time.



A Lack of Hedging Demand Theory for the Slowness of Real Estate Derivatives to

Develop

        Another theory has been proposed to explain the relative lack of success of

hedging markets for real estate: that owner occupants, if not other investors, are self

hedged, and hence do not need to hedge their risks. In its simplest form, the argument is

that people generally expect to live in a house forever, and so if they will never sell their

property, the price it attains in the market is irrelevant to them. If that is the case, then




                                               20
hedging their home price risks might actually create problems, rather than solve them, for

should home prices rise, then a homeowner who had shorted the market would have to

come up with money to pay on the risk-management contract.

       Sinai and Souleles argued that for owner occupants, purchasing a home may be a

way of hedging volatility of rent risk. They showed evidence that in cities with more

volatile rent, homeownership rates are slightly higher. It is indeed plausible that one

motive for owning a home could be to hedge rent risk.

       Even if there is a self-hedging aspect to holding real estate, it is certainly not the

case that every owner occupant is at the optimal exposure to real estate risk. There are

lots of special situations. Some people are nearing retirement and planning to leave the

housing market, and may be worried about the amount of resources that will be available

to them in retirement. Some are counting on reverse mortgages to sustain them in

retirement, and are worried about the amount that they can get. Some people are living in

a volatile geographic area and contemplating moving to another area. Some are

contemplating moving to a volatile area. Some are renting and hoping to buy soon. Some

are owning and planning to trade up soon. Some are owning second or third homes that

they are fixing up, and they are wishing to use their skills in fixing up homes, not their

skills in predicting the real estate market. Some work in the construction industry, and see

their exposure to the housing market increased beyond that of the exposure through their

home. Some are concerned about a possible fall in the real estate market wiping out their

home equity and making it impossible for them to sell and move, and making it

impossible to borrow against their home.




                                             21
        And, of course, owner occupants are hardly the only players in the single-family

home market. There are professionals in real estate: builders, electricians, plumbers,

whose fortunes depend on real estate. And there are the portfolio managers, including

hedge funds, who have in effect leveraged positions in housing because of their strategy

in the market for RMBS or CDOs. And there are the mortgage insurers and the GSEs

who guarantee mortgages, who are vulnerable to changes in home prices. Defaults on

mortgages may be thought of as exercises on options, and these options become in the

money when home prices fall. Home prices thus explain a substantial portion of mortgage

defaults (Deng, Quigley and Van Order 2000, Case and Shiller 1996].



The Prospects for Real Estate Derivatives

        I do not believe that either of these theories, the regret theory or the lack of

hedging need theory, are the primary reason for the slowness of growth of the derivative

markets for real estate.

        The regret theory just does not seem powerful enough to be a long-term obstacle

to hedging of housing market risk. In a time of a housing downturn, the decline in volume

of sales in the cash market for homes is typically no more than 40%. If we applied that

ratio to the volume of trade in single-family home derivatives in the present market, it

would suggest that there still should be a huge market.

        Moreover, the lack of hedging need theory also does not seem powerful enough.

Given all the special reasons discussed in the preceding section that different people have

different feelings that they are over- or under-exposed to real estate risk, it is

inconceivable that there would be no interest in hedging real estate risk. This is especially




                                              22
so at the present time, when talk about the real estate market is everywhere, when a

“subprime crisis” related fundamentally to the real estate market is described as the

biggest risk facing the national economy. I think that the problem is rather more the

problems that are inherent in getting any new markets started, problems that are

heightened when the new market is very unusual.

       The principal problem, as I see it, in the CME futures market is that it just does

not have enough liquidity. I spoke to institutional investors who considered placing

substantial orders on our CME futures contracts. But, these people reported to me that

they saw relatively large bid-asked spreads and only small positions offered. One of them

told me that, upon looking at the book, he decided to wait a year and look again. The

greatest problem here is the dearth of market makers committed to the CME futures, and

capital market hiccups this year have not been exactly conducive to institutions assuming

and trading new exposures.

       Starting a new market is like opening a nightclub. Lots of people will want to

come if lots of people are there. But, if few people are there, few people want to come.

Somehow, nightclubs do get started. So too, do real estate futures markets, but it will take

time. The liquidity of the futures and options markets may be enhanced as other

derivatives, such as index-linked notes, forwards and swaps take hold.

       Given the current lack of liquidity in the backwardated futures markets, the regret

theory explanation of low volume of trade effect may be amplified at the present time.

With little liquidity, the prices in these markets are not regarded as authoritative; they do

not form a standard of value that is widely cited. Hence, people do not see the loss

predicted in these market as a sunk cost, they do not view these as givens. They may




                                             23
think at the present time that they can avoid the pain of regret by choosing to ignore

them.

        The lack of liquidity in the current markets may also amplify the willingness of

people to neglect their hedging demands, and to imagine that they are doing enough to

hedge their real estate risks. If one can do nothing to hedge one’s real estate risks, then

one spends very little time developing one’s thinking about these risks. After the risks

become hedgeable, only then will thinking about the need for hedging develop, and only

then will expertise on how to hedge these risks be promulgated.

        Once liquidity develops further in the real estate hedging markets, we might

expect to see less of a problem from regret, and more of a willingness of investors to

think hard about how they should be hedging their real estate risks. At that point, we may

hope to see derivative markets for real estate to come into their full flower.
