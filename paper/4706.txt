       This paper investigates the theoretical and empirical properties of & model of aggregate

supply behavior that was introduced in the 1970s but has received inadequate attention. The

model postulates that price changes occur so as to gradually eliminate discrepancies between

actual and market-clearing values and to reflect expected changes in market-clearing values. Its

implications are more "classical' than most alternative formulations that reflect gradual price

adjustment Empirical results, which utilize a proxy for market-clearing output that is a function

of fixed capital and the real price of oil, are modemtely encouraging but not entirely supportive.

I.      rntroductlon

        The purpose of this paper is to investigate the theoretical and

empirical properties of one particular model of aggregate supply behavior

that has not, in my opinion, attracted the attention that it deserves. The

model in question features price level stickiness——i.e., gradual adjustment

itt     response   to   shocks——but   nevertheless     has   several   "classical"

characteristics. Its specification was first proposed by Grossman (1974) but

was more prominently introduced by Barro and Grossman (1976).              Shortly

thereafter it was independently conceived and more formally justified by

Mussa (1977, 1981a, 1981b, 1982), and was used as the centerpiece of a number

of papers by myself.t This model——which I will call the P—bar model—-has

never been the subject of extensive empirical study, however, and has almost

disappeared from the literature in recent years.

        In the following sections it will be suggested that recent neglect of

the P—bar model Is unwarranted.         In particular, I will argue that its

theoretical properties are more satisfactory than those of some leading

operational models of aggregate supply——here attention will be focused

especially on the formulations of Taylor (1979, 1980, 1993) and Fuhrer and

Moore (1993a. 1993b)——and that its empirical performance is reasonably

satisfactory.      There is a problem relating to the implied time series

properties of capacity output, but essentially the same flaw pertains to the

other models under discussion, as well.        Throughout, the perspective of the

analysis will be that of a macroeconomic researcher whose concern is the

development of a compact quarterly econometric model that has reasonable

theoretical properties and is empirically consistent with the postwar U.S.

data,

        The outline of the paper is a follows.       The P—bar model is introduced

and briefly discussed in Section II.         Then its basic theoretical properties



                                         I
are considered in Section III, after which some discussion of alternative

models is presented, with Section IV being devoted primarily to the model of

Fuhrer and Moore. Empirical analysis with quarterly U. S. data for 1954—1990

is developed in Section V.                A few- theoretical issues are then discussed in

Section VI and a brief conclusion follows.

II. Basic Description of the P—Bar Model

         The   F—bar model of aggregate supply shares the assumption of most
econometric models that prices adjust to shocks incompletely,                    within each

period, with output being determined by the quantity demanded at the

resulting price level. This particular model's distinguishing characteristic

is that the determination of each period's price level depends upon movements

of the hypothetical price level that would, given prevailing conditions, make

output equal to its capacity value. Let Pt and y denote logarithms of the

price level and output,                   respectively,          in the aggregate or for a
representative producer.              Also, let           denote the 'capacity" or "natural

rate" level of y, the value that the latter would assume if prices were

perfectly flexible. Then                  is defined as the "market clearing" value of Pt

that would induce Yt to equal , given current conditLons.                        In terms of

these variables, the P—bar price adjustment equation can be written as

(1)            Pt —   Pt-i = 7(Pt-i   —   Pt-i)   +   Eti(   —

with i     >     > 0.      Here Et(') represents             the expectation of the indicated

variable       conditional upon information available at time t,                   with this
information     henceforth assumed to include all relevant variables realized in
t   or   in previous     periods. Thus price adjustments are specified to occur in

proportion       to the previous period's discrepancy between Pt and its
market—clearing        value, provided that no changes in the market clearing value

itself are expected, But if they are, then the expected change in                     is also

a component of the realized change in Pt'



                                                      2
       An alternative        formulation, employed in my papers and by Obstfeld and

Rogoff    (1984). reflects the fact that Pt —              t will   by Construction be   related
to Yt —        t.      Indeed,    if the model        is   linear, these variables will be

proportional——with a negative coefficient, of course——and equation (1) can

equivalently be        written   as

(2)            Pt —   Pt-i   ri(yt—i —   c_1) +   E_1(pt —

with   y,>O.        The constant of proportionality relating Ti and ; will depend,

obviously, on the properties of the model's aggregate demand relations.

       Which of these two formulations, (1) or (2), should be considered more

nearly structural?           The answer to that question depends upon the analysis

used to justify the implied type of price setting behavior. Mussa (198ib)

bases his argument on profit maximization calculations made in the face of

lump—sum price adjustment costs with averaging across individual firms, an

approach which gives rise to (1).2 My own preferred rationale presumes that

prices must be set at the start of the period in which they will apply and

that production will equal whatever quantity is demanded.3                         One basic

assumption is that it is costly, in terms of real resources, for producers to

make between—period changes in output relative to capacity.4 But it is also

costly, of course, for output to differ from its capacity level.                         Thus if

these two cost components are quadratic, the producer will set a price that

is expected to yield a magnitude of demand (and output) that is dependent

both on         and n-i -        c-1. the   extent of dependence on the latter being

higher for higher adjustment costs. From the perspective of this approach.

formulation (2) is the more basic and more nearly structural.5

       In terms of its superficial appearance, the adjustment specification (2)

looks much like a typical expectational Phillips relation of the i9lOs.

There are two significant differences, however, that should be noted. First,

the "expected inflation" term pertains to changes in the market—clearing



                                                  3
 price Pt.     to changes in Pt itself. Second, the output gap term pertains
             not
 to the previous period's discrepancy between Yt and , not the value for the
 current period. As a consequence, the mode of behavior represented by (2)
 makes Pt an entirely predetermined variable.             That raises some issues that

will be addressed momentarily, but first it should be noted that the

 interaction of these two unusual features is itself quite significant.

Specifically, a version of (2) in which the third term is the expectation of

Apt, rather than Ap, makes no sense if expectations are rational.               To see

that, replace E_1A in (2) with                            and apply the conditional
expectation operator to the equation. The resulting expression is

(3)          0 =   y,(y,-i   —

which implies that y, =            S for   all t, i.e., that output is always equal to

its capacity value.              But that means that the specification with E_,Ap

cannot be used, given the assumption of rational expectations, to yield a

model in which output fluctuates relative to capacity.6

       What about the property of Pt being entirely predetermined?                  In

practice, one would presumably want to add a stochastic disturbance term to

(2). to reflect the effects of the many small influences that are omitted in

any   tractable model.           But that would not alter the important properties of
the   specification to any appreciable extent. A more significant modification
would,   however, be possible. Specifically, one could regard the magnitude of

Pt determined by (2) as a planned value, which might be altered within period

t in response to the occurrence of conditions significantly different than

those previously expected.              Indeed, one might interpret the non—dynamic

TMprice stickiness" models of Hankiw (1985) or Ball and Romer (1990) as

pertaining   to this latter form of adjustment. Recognizing such adjustments

would, interestingly, make the model one with a reduced degree of price

stickiness relative to the P—bar formulation (2). Since a major theme of our



                                               4
discussion will be the rather "classical' nature of the P—bar model——i.e.,

its similarity in several respects to models with perfectly flexible

prices——it will strengthen the argument7 to exclude within—period adjustments

of the Hankiw—Ball—Romer type. Accordingly, all of the discussion below will

be based on equation (2) rather than an extended model that includes such

adjustments.

      A closely related issue involves the role of inventories, briefly

mentioned in In. 4.         A producer that holds a stock of finished goods has

available a third way of responding to shocks, in addition to output and

price adjustments.         Incorporating inventory holdings into our model would

therefore serve to make it more flexible. But since we are emphasizing the

classical properties of systems including (a), our argument will again be

strengthened by abstracting from these extra features.8

      From its definition, it is clear that one can obtain an explicit

expression for the market clearing price                      only after adoption of a

specification regarding aggregate demand.                In my previous work, the demand

specification typically used was9

(4)         yt = Pa +    fli(mt — Pt)    + P2Et_dpt., —   Pt) + 3y1 t Vt.
where mt is the log of the money stock and Vt is a stochastic disturbance

term, which we shall here take to be a random walk (so that                 = Vt — vt..1 is

white noise). This expression can be obtained by writing IS and LII functions

of the form

(5)         yt    bo +   burt   —   E_i(p,1   —   p)1   + b2y—1 +   Vit
and

(6)         mt — Pt      c0 +   ciyt   + cart + Vat,

and solving out the endogenous variable rt)° There are two problems with

this specification, however, even if one accepts the general spirit of an

IS—UI type of model. One concerns the expectation operator in (5); it would



                                                  5
seem more appropriate 1               specified as                    And the second pertains to the

real interest rate appearing in the IS function; many analysts would think

that a long—term real rate such as                           — Et(pt+N — Pt). with N an integer

greater       than 1. should appear rather than the one—period real rate. ii                       Thus

(4) can be           used only as a source of examples, not general conclusions
regarding                or the properties of a model that                   incorporates the P—bar

relation      (2).
III. Properties of             the P—Bar Model

        The       just—mentioned problems are quite important with respect to
arguments          concerning the famous or infamous "policy ineffectiveness

proposition"         that played a prominent role in my 1979 and 1980 papers.                     It is

not difficult to show 12 that if (4) represents aggregate demand, then the

time series process for Yt —               t will       be given as

(7)                  —        = $l(mt — E_,m)       +   I1-'z($   +   fi2)](y-1   —

                  + (v    —
                              E_1v)   —
                                          (yt   —

so that it is only the surprise component of monetary policy that affects Yt
—           for    any policy feedback rule that bases the systematic part of mt

entirely on variables from period t—1 and before.                                       Thus the policy

ineffectiveness proposition will hold in this case. But it will not hold if

the demand schedule includes Ep.1 or any other variable Zt for which the

behavior of Zt —           E_,z    is affected by the policy rule.13 So this proposition

should not be regarded as a general implication of the P—bar model.

        For       illustrative purposes,                however——and possibly as a useful

approximation——let us provisionally adopt (4) as an AD specification.14 Then

we    can   write

(8)               Pt =          [fib + fi1m + fi2E..1p1 + fi3yt-i + vt —              yI,
which implies that

(9)               Pt =          [fig + fim + $E_1p+1 + 83Yt-i            + vt —       çj.

                                                         6
 From these two expressions we see that
 (10)             Pt —                              t$i('n,. —      E_1m) + v — E_1v   —
                                                                                           (yt   —
                                          P1P2
 and that
                               —
                                             (—1)          —
                                                                —
 (11)             Pt—i — Pt—i —                     En—i        n—d.
                                         P1 P2
Substitution of these into the P—bar equation (2), followed by Borne

rearrangement, yields

 (12)             Yt   —
                           y       = Th(mt —     E_1m)      +    I1—v($ + $)J (n—i     — yt—,) + Ct — Ut

where            and Ut    Z t —                    are the (exogenous) unexpected components of Vt

and .
            In   (12). we see that Yt —                 t       is explained by its own lagged value and

three surprise terms.                          Consequently, with (4) taken to represent AD, the

policy ineffectiveness property holds, as stated previously, and the model

implies that Yt —                   j is        generated by a first—order autoregressive process

(denoted AR (1)1 with coefficient 1 —                                   (fi + Ba).15 The compatibility of
that implication with the U.S. quarterly data will be considered below in

Section V.

            Continuing with the analysis of the model (2) (4), we wish next to

obtain a solution expression for Ape, the inflation rate. A crucial step is

to evaluate E,(p —                       t-).       which we do by differencing (9) and applying

E_1 (   .




(13)              E_1L =                        ($jEt..iAmt + P2(Et..ipt.. — E_3pt) + RaAyt_,
                                     B i "Pa
                  —

Thus we see that to determine the time series properties of Apt, it will be

necessary to adopt some assumption about the processes generating Am and Yt.

Anticipating evidence discussed in Section V, let us take Lint to obey an

AR(1) process and aç a MACi) process:16

(14)                   = Mo + M'TMt-t + Ct

(is)                   = Ut        + eut_i                                      6>0.




                                                                    7
And for     the sake of discussion, let us suppose that it is permissible to

neglect the term in (13) involving E_p+ —                                             Then we have

(16)                     =                   (Ri (Mo + PiAin_,) + $ahYt_I — Out_il
                                $i'ft2
so that inflation is given by

(17)         APt =     l(yl              —                +            IPiCpo +   Am_i) + 3Ay1 — Out_i).

The latter expression would be operational——i.e., subject to estimation——if

      were observable. Possible proxies will be considered in Section V.

        Also of considerable interest is the corresponding univariate expression

that we can obtain when                           =    0 by writing (12) as

(18)         y — yt         =   #(yt_i        —       yt_i)    +

where * = Riet          +            —       u,       implying yt — S't = (1 —        QL)1*t.   Then defining

Mi'    = M,/($i + ) and 0' s                      o/($         + Ba). we have

(19)         APt       11(1       — øL)1t_i                   + Mi'   (1—iziL)e_i +
where the constant term is suppressed. or

(20)         (1—L)(1—gzjL)Ap                          vi(1—gs1L)_1 +

             +   9'   (1—as1L)(1—#L)u_3.

Granger's Lemma shows the right hand side of (20) to be a HA(2) process, so

we have found the Inflation rate to be an AB}tA(2.2) process from the

univariate perspective.                       Clearly, therefore, there are many parameter values

for 0 and gi, that will imply a great deal of inflation persistence.

        Next it will be appropriate to demonstrate explicitly that——as mentioned

above——the policy ineffectiveness proposition does not apply when Ep
appears in the AD function, For this demonstration let us write the system

as

(Zia)        Pt — Pt-i = ziCyt-,                      —
                                                          _i) +        E_ ( — p-1)
(21b)        y, — Pi(mt          —
                                     Pt) + p2E(p+, — Pt) +
(21c)                             (Bim +              BzEtpt+, + vt        —



(21d)        mt = Mimt_, +



                                                                       8
In this case, expressions analogous to (10) and (11) above are

where we have used (24) to eliminate Yt —                                                Then tedious algebra

reveals that the composite parameters of the latter involve the policy

parameter
                   17
                           Thus the unconditional variance of Yt —                           t will    depend upon

       which implies failure of the ineffectiveness proposition.

        By contrast,                 the natural rate hypothesis-—as defined by Lucas

(1972)——does hold in the P-bar model. The unconditional mean                                      of    the output

gap E(y —         yt) cannot, that               is, be affected by any aspect of the monetary

policy rule. Proof of this proposition is readily obtained by application of

the unconditional expectation operator E(') to (24), which yields

(27)         E(y —            yt)      (1 —             + Pz)) E(y_1 —           n-i).
But the latter implies that E(y —                               y)   is a stable process that converges

toward zero. And the steps in the derivation of (27) have made no reference
                                                                                                                18
to the process generatin mt, so the foregoing conclusion is quite general.



                                                                9
       This property, of conformance to the natural rate hypothesis. is (I

would contend) extremely attractive.                          For it seems implausible, as Lucas

said, that output could be kept Dermanently high (relative to its natural

rate or capacity value) by any pattern of behavior of the monetary
authorities. And yet it is the case that almost all empirical models of

aggregate supply——i.e., wage—price specifications in econometric models——fail

to satisfy the natural rate hypothesis. That this is true for specifications

involving the concept of a NAIRU (non—accelerating inflation rate of

unemployment) can be seen immediately: -the existence of a stable relationship

between unemployment and the acceleration magnitude19 implies that the

unemployment      rate can         be permanently lowered by permanently generating a

higher    acceleration          magnitude.          In addition, a similar result pertains to a

specification        of the form
(28)          Pt —   Pt-i       6( — pt-i)                            i>o>o,

which is basically the same as the price—adjustment equation of the MI'S
         20
model.        To see this, write (28) as

(29)          Pt —   Pt-i   =   6Pt   —   Pt)   +   6(p   —   Pt-i)
and note that with a sustained inflation, such that hp =                       Ap-1. a high value
of Apt will keep Pt —            Pt and——therefore Yt — y——high permanently.
       Of more interest, perhaps, is the situation with regard to the

wage—price specification, involving overlapping nominal contracts, of John

Taylor ((1979, 1980, i993).                 This specification is well—known not only from

Taylor's own work, but also from its use in econometric models developed and

utilized by other researchers (including Gagnon and Tryon (1993) and Hasson,

Symansky, and Meredith (1990) in the MX3 and Multimod models).                         In fact, I

think it is fair to say that it is currently the leading model of aggregate

supply among researchers using estimated econometric models.

       A two—period version of Taylor's setup can be used to develop the points



                                                        10
at issue. Let Pt be the aggregate price (or wage) index——in log terms——which

is an average of the (log) contract prices negotiated in the current and most

recent periods, x, and xt,:

(30)       Pt     0.5 (xt +

Contract prices are set by half of the sellers in period t to keep in step

with prices pertaining to the other half of the sellers, with an adjustment

added to reflect the effects of excess demand (current and expected):

(31)       x, =   0.5 (Pt + Ep+1) + 0.S6E( +
where           —   Yt•    Together, (30) and (31) imply that

(32)       x 0.5 (xti + Ex+1) + 6E(            +

and thus that

(33)       0      0.5 (Eax+1 — Axe)   + 8E(    +

But from the latter we can see that a policy that keeps àx greater than

ax,. will keep Yt —     Yt below zero, on average, if expectations are rational.
Thus the Taylor model does not have the natural rate property. It predicts.

however, that an accelerating inflation will keep output low——not high, as

with the NAIRIJ model.

       Quite recently, Fuhrer and Moore (1993a, i993b) have developed an

aggregate supply specification that can be viewed as a revised version of the

Taylor model.         Their work suggests that this specification has both

theoretical and empirical properties that make it preferable to its

predecessor.        The Fuhrer—Hoore analysis of aggregate supply is developed.
however, in the context of a small econometric model whose framework differs
from the one presented above, and which does so in an interesting way. Their

papers also present the empirical properties of their model in an unorthodox

yet interesting fashion.        Accordingly, it will be desirable to devote an

entire section to the discussion of the Fuhrer—Moore analysis.              This

constitutes something of a digression, but is useful in preparing the scene



                                          ii
for our empirical analysis of the P—bar model by emphasizing the importance

of inflation—rate persistence and the use of autocorrelation functions to

summarize a model's empirical performance. Readers who dislike digressions

could, nevertheless, skip directly to Section V.

IV. The Fubrer         and Moore Model
        A   slightly    simplified version of the Fuhrer—Moore (F8e4) macroeconomet.ric

model can be written as follows:

(34)          Pt   — d(Etpt+i — Pt) = rt —

(35)               = bo + b1 Pt-i + b2       Yt-t +   Ct

(36a)         Pt =     O.5(x +
(36b)         t    =   O.5(x — Pt)     +   0.5(x_i — pt-i)
(36c)              —
                       Pt =  0.5(i' + Ev+1) + O.5&E(y          +   y.i)
(37)           r=      rt.i + pz,Ap_, +    + et.
Here (34) is a term structure equation                     that    relates the long—term      real
interest rate Pt              to   the one—period real rate, d>0 being a "duration"

parameter (such as 40 for a ia—year real rate in a quarterly model).

Equation (35)          is   F&M's IS specification, with a second lagged y, term here

deleted for clarity.               Equation (37) is the model's monetary policy rule, in

which it is presumed that the short—term interest rate is used as the policy

instrument.

        And, finally, equations (36) describe the aggregate supply sector that

constitutes a variation on Taylor.22 The authors' apparent rationale is that

Taylor's formula (31) describing contract price determination is replaced

with one in which the nominal price of each sector's output is set so as to

equate its relative price, Xt — Pt'                    to the average of the other sector's

expected relative prices over the life of the contract, with an adjustment

(as in Taylor) for current and expected values of .                       In   Taylor's setup, by

contrast, it is nominal sectoral prices that                 are   related in this fashion,



                                                      12
       There is some hint in their exposition that this modification would make

better sense theoretically, but the principal advantage claimed by F&M is

that it makes the inflation rate, rather than the price level, sticky. One

way to see that       is     to note that in my simplified version

                —        =
(38)                Pt
from   (36a), so that v,        = 0.25   (xt + àx..i). Putting these in (36c) gives

(39)                = 0.5 &t_l + 0.5 E8x+i +          26E( +
which shows that contract price inflation is an average of its own past and
expected future values, plus a cyclical adjustment term that will be small

empirically, and is therefore sticky.                 In Taylor's setup, by contrast, we

have a similar expression but with contract prices (xt) in place of inflation

rates (Ax). Furthermore, with sticky inflation, the F&H model can be shown

to match some important features of the U.S. data with much greater accuracy,

as we shall see shortly.

       Ky first impression was that the F&H specification also had the

advantage   of conforming to the natural rate hypothesis. And it is true that
   cannot be kept permanently away from zero by a constant acceleration, as
in the Taylor case           discussed above. This can be seen    by Inspection of (39).
But that relation can be rearranged as follows, with E(•) operators deleted:

(40)        0       0.5 (b4x+1 —     Mx)    +   2&( +   t.i).

From the latter it is clear that an ever—increasing acceleration of

inflation, with Mx growing over time, will keep the average value of

permanently low. So my first impression was incorrect; the F&I4 specification

actually does not satisfy the strict, Lucas (1972) version of the natural

rate hypothesis——and this remains true in the slightly more complicated

version that is actually used in their papers.

       Nevertheless, I find the F&il specification quite interesting and worthy

of additional consideration.              The same might be said, moreover, for their



                                                 13
empirical analysis and other aspects of their model.                 Let us continue,

accordingly, with our discussion of system (34) —          (37).
     It is striking that this model has no monetary sector, i.e., no money

demand function and no mention of a money stock variable.                  Given that

feature, the way that monetary policy works is as follows.                The monetary

authority's actions in (37) are changes in short—term interest rates.24 These

affect the long—term real rate via (34) and its value feeds into the

determination of real aggregate demand in (35).                    Then demand—induced

movements in output affect price determination in the block (36a) —              (36c).
That description is overly simplified, because it exaggerates the model's

recursiveness, but is not seriously misleading. A crucial point is that the

system hangs together and permits monetary policy actions to affect              and Pt

only if the parameter 6 in (36c) is non—zero.             If S equaled zero, then the

three equations (36) would form a self—contained system in the variables Pt,

xt, and Vt.   In other words, prices would be exogenous.              In light of that

property of the model, it is rather disturbing that the estimated value of 6

in P8.11 (1993b) Is only 0.007 with a standard error of 0.004.

     Be that as it may, let us consider the fact that no money demand

equation is included. Of course one——similar to our (4), for example——could

be added to the model, in which case it would determine the quantity of money

that the monetary authority has to (elastically) supply to conduct its

interest—rate—centered policy.        But the properties of that money demand

function would have no consequences for the behavior of any of the basic

variables     Pt.   rt, Pt,   x,, or v,.   P8.14   seem to view this property of their

setup as a virtue, since it is widely believed that money demand behavior has

featured considerable "instability" in recent years.               But is this feature

theoretically plausible? Strictly speaking, It is not n                 IL one   accepts

the IS—UI framework for aggregate demand analysis, for properly specified IS



                                           14
functions include wealth terms and real money balances are a component of
          25
wealth.          Thus a term involving m —        Pt Ot    mti - Pt properly belongs in
equation (35), which alters this special property of the P814 model.                Their
response, presumably, would be that               real     balance terms are of minor
importance quantitatively.          But I am not certain that         this argument is

correct,       in the context of their model. For even if the coefficient on m —
Pt in (34)      is   small in comparison with the coefficient     on Pt-s. it may be the

case that Pt reacts weakly to policy changes in rt.26 And if variations in rt

have appreciable effects on at, via the money demand function, then the

impact on aggregate demand via the real balance variable could be of the same

order of magnitude as the impact by way of the long term real rate of

interest.

       The most impressive part of the P814 analysis is the extent to which the

pattern of autocorrelations (own and across variables) implied by their

estimated model matches those of the U.S. data (or, to be more precise, those

of an unconstrained vector autoregression system).                These autocorrelation

functions are plotted for the three main variables (tp. rt, and                        in
Figures i and 2.          There it can be seen that the general qualitative

description of the model's implied autocorrelation functions matches those of

the unconstrained VAR with impressive accuracy.27 For the sake of comparison,

analogous functions implied by the same framework, except with Taylor—style

nominal contracts in place of (36), is shown in Figure 3,28

       There are a few aspects of the Fail empirical analysis, nevertheless,

that   are somewhat troubling. One,      already mentioned, is the magnitude of the

crucial    5 parameter in (36c).      Another concerns their choice of variables to
be treated as stationary in their VAR            system.    The results described above
are based on a system in which APt, r, and S are viewed                  as   stationary,
although their Dickey—Fuller and Johansen tests for unit roots are somewhat

inconsistent with that specification.           I am sympathetic to Cochrane's

(1991) argument——that a priori reasoning and general knowledge are more

useful than formal tests (or unit roots——however, and would accordingly

support the FIJI   stationarity   assumption.      But I am bothered by their

specification of the "normal output" measure——analogous to ——used in

constructing .     In   particular, their implied 5i    is   simply a deterministic

trend fitted to the Yt data for 1959—1990, i.e.,             is the deviation from

this trend.    But any reasonable concept of "normal," or "capacity," or

"natural rate" values of Yt would have to recognize that their evolution over

time is a consequence of capital accumulation, population growth, and

technological progress. All of these processes are ones, however, for which

a sizable "permanent" component would be expected, a priori, which would

suggest a process for y that contains a unit root component.            This issue

will receive additional attention in the next section. where we turn to the

empirical properties of the P—bar model.29

V. EmDirical Analysis

     We now turn to an attempt to evaluate the empirical support, or lack of

support, for the P—bar model.     An outstanding source of difficulty in this

regard is the fact that two crucial variables,          and . are     unobservable.

Of course they are related to each other by equation (9), or its counterpart,

so that in principal there is only one variable missing.            But that is of

little consolation to the researcher,             especially since the proper
specification of (9) is debatable and its estimation difficult,             Another

important difficulty is that accurate implementation requires accurate

specification of aggregate demand behavior.

     The absence of observations on y, or an alternative capacity variable.

is also a serious problem for the models of Taylor, FIJI, and most others in

which price adjustments are sluggish.        The problem can typically be glossed



                                        19
over in presentations, because y does not figure as prominently in the

discussion as Pt and Yt do in ours.                    But these other models could be quite

different empirically if the implicit definition of y were changed——from a

deterministic trend to some unit root specification, for example.

       An implication of the F—bar model, or at least the version emphasized in

Section II, is that          =   y—y         is a stationary first—order AR process. Let

us now consider whether it is possible to reconcile that implication with the

presumption——stated above——that y is generated by a unit root process and

also the observed time—series properties of Yt' With the latter represented

by (the log of) U.S. quarterly data on real GNP, seasonally adjusted, we know

that the process is close to

(41)        (1—0.3L)Ay = const +

or the nearly—identical trend—stationary model

(42)        (1—0.35L + 0.30L2)y =            trend +
where w denotes a white—noise variate. Actual estimates for 1954.1 — 1990.4

and 1965.1 — 1990.4 are given in Table 1.

       Now suppose that the process for t is a = (1 + O.65L)u and that yt

  0.95 + .             Then for y we would have

(43)          =    y   + (1 —    0.95LY'ut     =   C
                                                       1+O65L) +        0.95L'
Multiplying by (1 —      L)(l    —   0.3L)   we obtain
                                                                         (1 —            —
(44)        (1 —   O.3L)(1   —
                                 L)y   = (1 —      0.3LHi   + 0.6SL)u            OL,IL
But if we drop all terms in L of higher than first order, the right hand side
of the latter becomes

(45)        (1 + 0.35L)u + (1 —         0.35L)*.
Thus if Ut and         were uncorrelated and had the same variance, (44) would be

of the same form as (41).            This will not be exactly the case, of course——it

cannot be since u. is a component of Øtbut it would seem plausible that the

specification under discussion would provide a reasonably satisfactory

rationalization of the conditions mentioned at the start of this paragraph.

       In an attempt to construct an empirical counterpart of the capacity

variable. y,,       I have obtained a quarterly time series for net private

nonresidential fixed capital.                An annual series on that variable has been

published by Musgrave (i992); our quarterly version was constructed by

allocating each year's growth in capital to its four quarters in proportion

to that quarter's share of the year's gross private nonresidential investment

(1987 prices).       Values are reported in Appendix A.                     Let the log of that

variable be denoted 1c. Then one possible measure of                         would be the fitted

value given by the following regression relating Yt to lct:30

(46)       Yt = 1.539 + 0.800k1                                    SE =    0.037i
                (.060) (.0076)

(Here, as in all that follows, the sample period is 1954. —                         1990.4.)    The

time series properties of the implied                    measure are not, however, consistent

with the specification used in the previous paragraphs; instead, an AE(2) in

Ay is indicated.

       A second attempt included POt, the real price of imported                               as a

second explanatory variable.32 The estimated relation is

(47)       yt       1.012   +   O.860k_1 — O.OSSpot_i                  SE 0.0282
                    (.068) (.0081)                (.0054)

In this case, the implied yt               has   an ABMA process that may be represented as

follows:

(48)        Ay = 0.0072     +     ut   +   0.607u_1
                     (.00040)              (.074)

            it2 =   0.242         SE a 0. 0049           Dl.!   1.87

Thus it transpires that a t4A(i) process with MA coefficient of 0.607 fits the

data quite well. And this provides a good match to the specification assumed

in the construction of equations (43) — (45),                            The implied Yt measure,

labelled YGAPKO, is plotted in Figure 4 (together with the measure YGAPS4




                                                    22
 implied by a linear deterministic trend for y,j.

       Does   the YGAPKO measure of y — Yt — Yt                  have reasonable properties for

use with our P—bar model?                       One positive characteristic is that the

Dickey—Fuller test statistic (constant, no trend, 2 lags) is 3.39, easily

adequate to reject a unit—root null hypothesis at the 0.05 significance
level.    (The MacKinnon critical value is —2.88.) A 0.05 rejection can barely

be obtained for the measure implied by (45), whose t—value is —2.92, and the

   measure implied by a fitted deterministic trend for y does not permit

rejection (t value = —2.38) at all. On the other hand, the implied AMA

process for ?GAPKO is not an                    AR(i). Instead, the following is implied:

(49)          yt       0.00012   +    l.245y_1 —   O.350
                       (.0008)        (.078)        (.078)

                   =   0.870         SE = 0.010         DW     2.01
Thus the YGAPICO specification is not fully consistent with the P—bar model.

Whether that is because the capacity measure is unsatisfactory or because the

model is flawed cannot be determined from this one mismatch.                     In any event,
the mismatch is not extremely severe.                        In what follows, accordingly, the

YGAPKO measure of t              will    be utilized, for a lack of anything better,
wherever such a measure is required.

       Next we turn our attention to the aggregate demand portion of the model.

Estimates for a few alternative specifications in first—differenced form are

presented in Table 2.                In all of these, the (St. Louis. adjusted) monetary

base is used as the money stock variable.                      Both 01$ and TSLS estimates are

presented, the instruments for the latter including two lagged values of

6in, and Ap For some reason, the parameter estimates for both Pi and P2

are larger when the TSLS procedure is used, and most t statistics are

increased even though overall explanatory power is (as it must be) lower.

The various estimates of P are all close to 0.3 and those of Pi are all in

the general range of 0.25 -             0.55.    The magnitude of P2 is not pinned down at

(4)—(6) imply that fl         —aic2/(a1ci +   c2) and ft — a1/(a1c1 + c2).           Therefore

         —ca, where c2 is the semi—elasticity of money demand with respect to

the short—term rate of interest.               Let us then estimate a money—demand

function,    taking care     to express rt in units comparable to Alogp——i. e., as

annualized   percentage points divided by 400. The result is as follows:
(50)            —
                    Ap      0.00052 + 0.1i9Ay      —
                                                        0.564r1 + 0.547(Am_1     —
                            (.0007)   (.0591)           (.269)         (.071)

                    0.351      SE = 0.0064         N = 2.25


Thus   the suggested value for $2/el is         about 0.564.           If mt is measured by Mi

rather   than the monetary base, however,          the estimated value of 83/P1 jumps       to
1.007.    So, this approach suggests that p is of                the   same order of magnitude
as 81——say, about 0.3 — 0.4——but probably somewhat smaller.

       It would be entirely reasonable to wonder about the neglect of fiscal

policy variables in the aggregate demand relation (4).                     Indeed, the rate of

government purchases would be expected to enter in the IS relation (5) and

therefore in (4) even if the economy were one in which Ricardian equivalence

prevailed.      Accordingly, estimates were obtained for versions of the

relations appearing in columns one and three of Table 2 but with Ag and

tg_1 also included, g being the log of state, local, and federal government

purchases.     In column one, the estimated parameter values (standard errors)

are 0.094 (.054) and —0,097(.055) and for column three the corresponding

figures are almost exactly the same.           In both cases, the hypothesis that the

tg terms jointly provide no explanatory power cannot be rejected at the 0.05

significance level. Consequently, it seems unlikely tht our omission of the

government spending variables, which was adopted in Section II to keep the

model clean and simple, is a significant flaw.


                                              26
         Another behavioral relation that is needed to assemble a quantitative

 version of the P—bar model is a policy rule for the generation of £m. For

 our sample period, the following AR(3) model matches the data rather well:

 (51)         6.m     0.00214 +       Q.562n,      i   O.0009àm.2 + 0.29Thm3
                       (.008)         (.079)            (.092)              (.079)

                     0.633        SE = 0.0047             DW     2.00
Moreover, lagged values of ap and                      provide no explanatory power and do not

upset the estimates in - (51).                 From this equation, accordingly, we can
calculate the expected value E_,&n.

         It is now finally time to turn to the price adjustment equation that is

our principle object of concern. For empirical purposes we shall focus on a

version, analogous to equation (17). which may be written as follows:
                    = ZiYt-i +
(52)
                                 Si     $2
                                             ($iEt_ihmt +      P3Syt_t —   E_iAyJ.
In estimating (52), we use predicted values from (51) and (48) to represent

the indicated expectations. Results are as follows:

(53)        tp 0.0080 +          0.0505..      +   0.SS6E_1àm — O.148y_1 —             0.500Et_4
                     (.0016) (.016)                 (.074)                 (.046)        (.162)
                 = 0.368         SE      0.0053          DW      0.87

In terms of support provided for the P—bar model, these figures must be

regarded as mixed. Unsatisfactory elements are the residual autocorrelation

indicated by OW and the wrong—signed coefficient on                                  Quite favorable.

however, are the magnitudes of the coefficients attached to the key
variables.            and E_1Am. With regard to the former, the implication is

that departures of y from yt lead to price level adjustments that come about

slowly but surely; the parameter estimate is over three times the size of its

standard    error. And       regarding Et_i&i. the estimated parameter value agrees

nicely    with   the magnitude implied by our estimated value of P2/Ph: with the

latter ranging from 0.56 to 1.0, the implied value for Pi/(fii + P2) ranges

from 0.64 to 0.50.




                                                   27
        Simply for the sake of comparison, consider also a version of (53)

estimated with yt-i defined relative to a deterministic trend.       In this case,

the coefficient on that variable rises to 0.066 (.012) and the one attached

to E..1Ain falls to 0.456 (.074).       In addition, when an equation explaining

hp with four lagged values of itself and our preferred measure of y..1 is

estimated, the coefficient on the latter remains significantly positive and

residual autocorrelation is eliminated.M

        In principle, it would be interesting to use the estimated model to

explore the system's autocorrelation structure in the manner of Fuhrer and

Moore.     A direct comparison with the F&H results would not be appropriate,

however, because of three differences between their estimated system and

ours.     These are: (1) Different monetary policy instruments are used. (ii)

The F&tl policy rule, unlike ours, features policy responses designed to

stabilize output and inflation——to keep        and Isp1 reasonably close to target

values.      (iii) The F&M aggregate demand sector, unlike ours, is specified in

terms of y, rather than Yt•      That seems inappropriate theoretically and makes

it easier to generate autocorrelation functions relating to y.. that are close

to those present in the actual data.

        Nevertheless, one simulation was conducted using a system composed of

equation (52) and column I of Table 2.           With m1 and      given by their

historical values, this system was simulated, starting with actual values for

1954.1, to generate time paths for Pt and y.           From the artificial data

thusly obtained,      it is possible to calculate implied autocorrelation
functions.     The most interesting ones, given the three properties (i) (ii)

(iii) listed above, pertain to autocorrelations of Ap (inflation) with past

values of       and of itself.    The resulting patterns are shown in Figure 5.

From the latter it may be seen that the inflation rate's correlations with

yt-j have much the same general pattern as in Figure 2.        except that the

correlations with     past   values of itself die out more slowly than    in   Figure 2.

Our   estimated    system exhibits, then, even more inflation persistence than

that of F&M.

VI. Theoretical Issues

          Before concluding, we need to briefly consider a few theoretical issues

concerning the specification of the P—bar model. The first of these pertains

to an apparent distinction between the Barro—Grossman (1976) and Mussa

(i981a, 1981b) versions of the P—bar variable——a distinction that is the

principal topic of a paper by Obstfeld and Rogoff (1984). Using                to denote

the Barro-'Grossman concept, Obstfeld and Rogoff state that "The difference

between p and        deserves emphasis. p is the output price that would prevail

in a hypothetical Walrasian general equilibrium with fully flexible prices

Iwhereasl p is the output price that would clear the goods market given

current levels of the sticky—price system's endogenous variables" (1984. p.

164).       By contrast, McCallum (1979, p.     1; 1980, p. 733) evidently sees no

important difference in the two specifications.                 His reasoning is,

presumably, as follows.

          In a typical application, the only feature of the model that keeps it

from being one of the Wairasian type, with fully flexible prices, is the

sticky—price adjustment mechanism under consideration.                   The system's

endogenous variables will differ from their Walrasian equilibrium values.

then, only to the extent that the prevailing price level Pt differs from Pt'

In a linear system, furthermore, the difference Zt —                      between the

prevailing arid Walrasian values of any variable z will be proportionate to Pt

—
    Pt'     But Pt — Pt will therefore be some linear combination of variables

each of which is proportional to Pt — Pt'             5° Pt —   t   will itself be

proportional      to Pt — Pt'      In this sense, then, there is no significant



                                           30
operational distinction between Pt and                    if the model being utilized is

linear.

        The foregoing line of reasoning is consistent, it should be noted, with

the main result derived by Obstfeld and Rogoff (i984), who utilize a linear

system.        Specifically, the Obstfeld—Rogoff theorem involving their equation

(13) asserts that the Barro—Grossman and Hussa schemes "yield structurally

equivalent.. .      models" when the slope in the Barro—Grossman adjustment rule is

not too large (1984, p. i65).                  But, furthermore, when the Barro—Grossman

price adjustment mechanism is interpreted properly," that slope condition

always holds and the "apparent convergence problem disappears" (1984. p.

166).

        The second theoretical issue to be considered pertains to the

specification of Pt Hussa (1981a, 198ib) and Obstfeld—Rogoff (1984) both

work In continuous—time settings, and the latter authors use35 a definition of

Pt that would, in our (a)(4) setup of Section II, imply that

(54)           Pt    —       IBo + Pimt +   fi2E_1(p,, — Pt) + BaYt-i + Vt — yti
rather than (9).                 Here the expectation of• Pt+i — Pt         appears on the

right—hand side (rhs), instead of the expectation of Pt+i, and the rhs

denominator is correspondingly affected.                 The idea, evidently, is that the

inflation rate is a variable that is independent of the current price level.

But while the price level and the inflation rate are certainly conceptually

distinct, it is not clear that they should be treated as statistically

independent.           The issue seems to be whether or not E_1(pt+1 — Pt)              is

affected by shocks that affect Pt (In the present model, these shocks are
dated t—1 but that is beside the point.) And while there are models in which
E_1     Pt.i   moves    in      tandem with              they are rather special models.
Consequently,       in the present paper (9) has been used rather than (54) in the

discussion of Section II.



                                                  3i
        It may be useful, in this regard, to note that with definition (54) for

.      and under the special assumptions used to develop (16), we would have

(55)         E_,Apt      Mo + Thti + (9/Pi)ut_i

and inflation would be given as

(56)         Apt =   vi(yt-i   —   n-i)   + Mo + MiMti + $Ay-1 + (9/fit) ut_i.

The main point of interest, in a comparison between (56) and (17). is that

the coefficient attached to £flt_i may be considerably smaller in the latter.

depending on     the relative magnitudes of fi, and              fi.     In particular, E_1a
does    not enter with a unit        coefficient      when the   Pt    definition of Section II
is utilized.
        A   third issue concerns the fact that monetary                    policy is actually
implemented,     in the U.S. and elsewhere, by manipulation of a short-term

interest rate such as rt in equations (5) and (6). rather than some monetary

aggregate such as rat.              The question, then, is whether this fact makes

expressions such as (4), (7), (8), (9), and especially (12) inappropriate.

For the macroeconomic model discussed above can be thought of as including

(2fl4)(6)(9) and a policy rule for rt instead of (2)(4H5)(9) and a policy

rule for rat.        But either way, the system determines values for Yt. Pt. Pt.

rt. and mt—-and it can be seen that the private sector behavioral equations

are equivalent in these two cases.               Furthermore, derivation of the solution

equation (12) for Yt does not depend on the specification of the policy

process for rat in the analysis of Section II.                   Thus the only difference is

that it cannot be assumed            that at — E1m        is independent of private sector

disturbances when rt is the instrument; instead, mt                                will reflect

such    disturbances as well as the unexpected            component     of the policy rule that
in   that case pertains to rt.

VI. Conclusions

        In the foregoing sections we have explored the P—bar model of                     price


                                                 32
 level adjustment, which postulates that price changes occur so as to (I)

 gradually eliminate discrepancies between actual and market—clearing values

 and to (ii) reflect expected changes in market—clearing values themselves.

This model has implications that are more "classical" than most alternative

formulations that reflect gradual price adjustment; in particular,              it

satisfies the natural rate hypothesis. With some informational structures it

will also satisfy the policy ineffectiveness proposition, but such a result

does not hold in general and can not be presumed.

     Empirical implementation is hampered by the absence of any reliable

measure of the economy's market clearing or natural—rate value of output.

Also, accurate implementation requires accurate specification and estimation

of the economy's aggregate demand behavior. A set of results is developed,

nevertheless, utilizing a proxy for market—clearing output that is a
log—linear function of a measure of fixed capital and the real price of oil.

The results are moderately encouraging but not entirely supportive.           Two

highly positive aspects of the results are that they Ci) indicate a plausible

rate of price level adjustment in response to recent output levels and Cii)

imply an effect of expected money growth that is consistent with the model.

     The   P—bar model's properties are compared with those of a specification
recently proposed by Fuhrer and Moore (i993a, i993b).     The latter does not
satisfy the natural rate hypothesis but appears to perform very well
empirically.     That last conclusion rests, however, on analysis that
questionably treats the market—clearing output rate as a deterministic trend.

tThese include McCallum (1979a,         1980, 1982) and others. The 1980 j piece
includes     a derivation/justification that is quite different from Hussa's.     It

will   be   briefly described below.


2The logic of Hussa's formulation has been sharply questioned by Rotemberg

(1982).


3The presence of inventory holdings would lead to a relaxation of this

assumption, which would become that demand is fully satisfied b production

or inventory draw—down.         That modification would complicate the analysis

without altering its essential features. For a theoretical study that uses a

special version of the P—bar model with explicit recognition of inventories.

see Flood and Hodrick (1986).


4Adjustment costs are taken to depend on output relative to capacity, rather

than output alone, to reflect the presumption that such costs would not be

incurred in response to technological improvements that increase output

attainable with given quantities of labor.


5For an explicit algebraic treatment of this argument, see HcCallum (1980,

pp. 773-4).      A useful special case obtains when between—priced charges are

not costly. Then y         0 and Pt n            i.e., prices are set at levels that

are expected to be market—clearing. This case has been used by Flood (1981)

and HcCallujn (1989, Ch. 10).


6The unsatisfactory feature of this specification would not be eliminated,

moreover, by the addition of a stochastic disturbance term to the adjustment

equation.


    considering a case that works against the conclusions being reached.




                                            38
8Allan Meltzer has suggested that        non—recognition   of inventory fluctuations

might    be    significantly detrimental to the model's empirical performance.

That is certainly possible but there is no apparent reason why it should be

more relevant for this model of price adjustment than for any other.


9Actually, a slightly more restrictive case with b2 =            — 0 was used in my

previous papers.


101t would be theoretically appropriate to include a government spending

variable      in (5), which would then also show up in (4).    This   possibility will

be investigated empirically in Section V.

It is also the case that additional terms, such as at — Pt in (5) or its

lagged value in (6), might be expected to appear.           But they would not have

major effects on the properties of the model.

12See the next paragraph.


t3This will be demonstrated momentarily, in equations (Zi)—(29).

Thus we are implicitly omitting any "real—balance" term from the IS function

for simplicity. It will, however, be argued below in Section IV that such an

omission is theoretically inappropriate.

15The second property will not obtain,         however, if monetary policy shocks

include both permanent and transitory components, which private agents are

unable   to observe separately.          This point was emphasized by Brunner,
Cukierman, and tleltzer      (1983).


t6Here MACi) means first—order moving average.              Note that    the   implied
assumption     is not that      can be expressed as the sum of two components, one

purely permanent (a random walk) and one purely transitory (white noise), for

this requires that 8<0.          The reason for specifying 0)0 is the empirical

evidence to be discussed in Section V.




                                          39
t7Even in the simplest conceivable case, with              j and Vt =         = Ut = 0. we
find   that Ep+, — E—ip+           etflu(Mi($i +   8a) —   (i—7I($,+82)) $i(i+2fl/(Bi
+   82)(Pt +p2(1—u1fl.

181t would not be negated by changes in the specification of aggregate demand

behavior or the stochastic properties of shocks.


'91n other words, the change in the inflation rate.             The present point was

argued in )4cCallum (1982).


20The difference is that the MPS model uses a variable hereby denoted p in

place of , with p given by a markup over unit production cost at "normal"
capacity levels. For more information, see McCallum (1979b).

21From here on, the tilde symbol will be used with this meaning, not the one

mentioned in the first paragraph of this section.


22Here I have simplified F&J4's specification by using two—period (rather than

four—period)   contracts and by setting the weights on Xt and          Xt_t    in   (39a) at

0.5,   rather than   estimating such weights empirically.

23That   is, x — Pt a 0.5     (0.5(x — Pt +   x_   —   Pt-,) + 0.5   (xt+i —   Pt.i +      —



p)I    implies 0.5 (x — Pt) = 0.25 (xt_, — Pt-i) + 0.25 (xt.i — pt+i).

24The term "interest rates" will refer to nominal rates wiless the word "real"

is also included.


251n a Sidrauski—style model with explicit optimization on the part of

infinite—lived households, a household's choices in t depend upon its asset

holdings at the end of t-i.


26The F&H specification implies that the long—term nominal rate R is related

to the short—term nominal rate by fl —        (i+d)1     rt +   (1+dY' ER+1, where d
is a number such as 40.




                                         40
 271t should perhaps be noted explicitly that the autocorrelation functions

 emphasized by fl.M are conceptually quite different from VAR-based impulse

 response functions, such as those featured by Cochrane (1994) and many
 others.


28 may be the case that Taylor's own version of his model provides a much

better match.      In any event, this discussion should not be interpreted as

disrespective of Taylor's work, which has been extremely valuable.

290ne more item needs to be mentioned before continuing.             That is the
empirical relationship between the short—term nominal rate of interest and

the long—term        rate of interest that is the central topic in Fubrer and

Moore (1993b).      What they find is that these two variables have moved

together quite closely over the 1965—1990 time period, a correlation that

they note is in theory dependent upon the manner in which policy is
conducted.      The relationship reported is Pt   = 0.006   +   O.23r.   This is

evidently an OLS regression estimate.        No standard error, DW, or
statistics are reported, but the plot of Pt and its fitted value suggest that

   would be quite high and DW very low.

30Test results are consistent with this being a cointegrating relationship.


31For observations since 1966, the nominal price is obtained as the ratio of

nominal to real imports of petroleum products as reported in the National

Income and Product Accounts. For 1954—1966, the Producer Price Index (i.e..

WPI) series for crude petroleum was spliced on. Then quarterly averages of

monthly observations were calculated.      The complete series was finally
divided by the GNP deflator (1982 — 100).          All series are seasonally

adjusted.




                                      41
32The basic idea, of course, is that with the United States being a net

importer of oil, total output (net of goods traded to obtain oil used as an

input) will be smaller the higher is the real price of oil.


OLS estimation will not provide consistent estimates of ,                even   in

principle.

34At the   time of the conference, Jeff Fuhrer pointed out that     the estimated

version (54) of the P—bar price adjustment equation does not satisfy the NW!.

That is true, as can be seen by setting Ay..i —      0 and à a. 0   in (54), but

only because the estimated equation (17) omits the term 82 (E_1 Pt+' —

Et_2pt) that Is part of the model.      The reason for this omission is that

identification of the term seems almost hopeless, given the different

Information sets relevant to the two expectations. Thus the omission must be

judged a weakness of the paper's empirical work, but does not reflect any

discredit on the P—bar theory.


35See equation (12) of Obstfeld and Rogoff (1984).

361t   is unclear to me which of these definitions Mussa intends to adopt.
