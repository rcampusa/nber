        Sources of Output and Variability in a Macroeconometrjc Model



                                  ABSTRACT

      There has been much recent discussion about the ultimate sources of

macroeconomic variability. A number of authors attribute most of this

variability to only a few sources, sometimes only one. Although there may

be only a few important sources, this is far from obvious, since economies

seem complicated. The purpose of this paper is to provide quantitative

estimates of various sources of variability using my U.S. econometric model.

Stochastic simulation is used to estimate how much the overall variances of

real GNP and the GNP deflator are reduced when various shocks are surpressed

in the model.

     The results show two main things. The first is that the contribution

of a given shock to the variance can vary considerably as the length ahead

of the prediction varies. What is important for the one-quarter-ahead

prediction may not be important for the eight-quarter-ahead prediction, and

vice versa. The second is that the results imply that there are many

important sources of variability for real GNP. It is not the case that one

or two sources dominate. This is less true for the GNP deflator, however,

where there are two very important sources, shocks to the price and wage

equations and shocks to the price of imports, and one moderately important

one, shocks to the government exogenous variables.

   SOURCES OF OUTPUT AND PRICE VARIABILITY IN A MACROECONOMETRIC MODEL1

                                 by

I. Introduction

     There has been much recent discussion about the ultimate sources of

macroeconomic variability. Shiller (1987) surveys this work, where he

points out that a number of authors attribute most of output or unemployment

variability to only a few sources, sometimes only one. The sources vary

from technology shocks for Kydland and Prescott (1982), to unanticipated

changes in the money stock for Barro (1977), to "unusual structural shifts,'

such as changes in the demand for produced goods relative to services, for

Lilien (1982), to oil price shocks for Hamiltion (1983), to changes in

desired consumption for Hall (1986). (See Shiller (1987) for more

references.) Although it may be that there are only a few important sources

of macroeconomic variability, this is far from obvious. Economies seem

complicated, and it may be that there are many important sources. The

purpose of this paper is to estimate the quantitative importance of various

sources of variability using a macroeconometric model.

     Macroeconometric models provide an obvious vehicle for estimating the

sources of variability of endogenous variables. There are two types of

shocks that one needs to consider: shocks to the stochastic equations and

shocks to the exogenous variables. Shocks to the stochastic equations are

easy to handle. They are simply draws from the postulated distribution


     1This paper grew out of discussions with Robert Shiller, to whom I am
indebted for many helpful suggestions and comments. Some of the results in
this paper are cited in Shiller (1987). The research described in this
paper was financed by a grant from the National Science Foundation.
                                       2

(usually normal) of the structural error terms, the distribution upon which

the estimation of the model is based. Shocks to the exogenous variables are

less straightforward to handle. Since by definition exogenous variables are

not modeled, it is not unambiguous what one means by an exogenous-variable

shock. One possibility is to postulate, say, an autoregressive equation for

each exogenous variable and take the error term from this equation as

measuring the exogenous-variable shock. Another possibility is to postulate

that exogenous-variable shocks are the errors that forecasting services make

in   their forecasts of the exogenous variables.

       The sources of output and price variability are examined in this paper

using my U.S. model (Fair (l984)).2 The procedure that was followed, which

is discussed in detail in the next section, is briefly as follows.

Autoregressive equations were estimated for 23 exogenous variables in the

model. These variables make up all the important exogenous variables in the

model (in my view).3 These equations were then added to the model. There

are 30 structural stochastic equations in the model, and so the expanded

model includes 53 stochastic equations. The 53 x 53 covariance matrix of

the error terms was then estimated. In estimating this matrix the error

terms in the structural equations were assumed to be uncorrelated with the

error terms in the exogenous-variable equations, which means that the matrix

was taken to be block diagonal (with a 30 x 30 block and a 23 x 23 block).

This procedure is consistent with the assumption upon which the estimation


     2Although the variability of only two endogenous variables, the level
of output and the price level, is considered in this paper, the variability
of any other endogenous variable in the model can be considered in the same
way.
       3The 23 exogenous variables are listed in the Appendix.
                                       3

 of the model is based, namely that the exogenous variables are not

 correlated with the error terms in the structural equations.

      Consider now real GNP, which is one of the endogenous variables in the

model. Given the estimated covariance matrix of the error terms, one can

estimate the variance of GNP by means of stochastic simulation. The

variance of GNP can be estimated for the one-quarter-ahead prediction, the

two-quarter-ahead prediction, and so on. Let      denote the estimated

variance of real GNP for some given quarter and length ahead of the

prediction. This estimated variance is based on draws of all 53 error terms

in the model. Now consider fixing one of the error terms at its expected

value (usually zero) and computing the variance of GNP again. In this case

the stochastic simulation is based on draws of 52 error terms rather than

53. Let &2(k) denote the estimated variance of real GNP based on fixing the

error term in equation k at its expected value.

     The difference between    and &2(k) is an estimate of how much the

error term in equation k contributes to the variance of GNP. One can thus

examine the contribution of any of the 53 error terms to the variance of

GNP. Also, k need not refer to just one equation. One can fix the error

terms in a subset k of the equations at their expected values and draw from

the remaining equations. In this way one can examine the contribution that

various sectors make to the variance of GNP. In general, of course, the

error terms across equations are correlated, and so it is not generally the

case, for example, that fixing two error terms one at a time and then

summing the two differences is the same as fixing the two error terms at the

same time and computing the one difference. In most cases, however, one can

get a fairly good idea of the contribution of each error term. The
                                        4

correlations of the error terms across equations are not so large as to make

the present procedure a fruitless exercise. More will be said about this in
               4
Section III.

     There are two main features of the empirical results. The first is

that the difference between      and 2(k) for a given k varies considerably

across the forecast horizon. For some choices of k the differences are

large for the first few quarters ahead and then die out fairly quickly,

while for other choices the differences start out small and build up

considerably over the horizon. The second feature is that the results imply

that there are many important sources of variability for real GNP. It is

not the case that one or two sources dominate. This is less true for the

CNP deflator, however, where there are two very important sources -- shocks

to the price and wage equations and shocks to import prices - -   one

moderately important one -   - shocks to the government exogenous variables - -

and the remaining sources of fairly minor importance.
     It is important to realize what is and what is not being estimated in

this paper. Consider an exogenous-variable shock. What is being estimated

is the contribution of the error term in the exogenous-variable equation to

the variance of GNP. This contribution is not the same as the multiplier

effect of the exogenous variable on GNP. Two exogenous variables can have



     4Robert Shiller has informed me that I have been scooped by Pigou. In
the second edition of Industrial Fluctuations, Pigou (1929), after grouping
sources of fluctuations into three basic categories, gave his estimate of
how much the removal of each source would reduce the amplitude (i.e. the
standard deviation) of industrial fluctuations. He thought that the removal
of "autonomous monetary causes" would reduce the amplitude by about half.
Likewise, the removal of "psychological causes" would reduce the amplitude
by about half, Removal of "real causes," such as harvest variations, would
reduce the amplitude by about a quarter. See Shiller (1987) for more
disucssion of this.
                                       5

 the same multiplier effects and yet make quite different contributions to

 the variance of GNP. If one exogenous variable fits its
                                                            autoregressive
equation better than does another (in the sense that its equation has a

smaller estimated variance), then, other things being equal, it will

contribute less to the variance of CNP. It is, of course, possible to use

measures of exogenous-variable shocks other than error terms from

autoregressive equations, and in future work this may be of interest to do,

but whatever measure is used, it is not likely to be the same as the size of

the multiplier.

     The results of this study do, of course, depend on the properties of my

model. If the model is a reasonably good approximation of the
                                                                   macroeconomy,
then some weight can be placed on the conclusions. If the model is a poor

approximation, then the results cannot be trusted. I have done many tests

with the model, some of which are discussed in Fair (1984), and it seems to

me to be a reasonable approximation. In a recent test - -   Fair   (1986) -.   I
have compared the traditional expectations hypothesis used in the model with

the rational expectations (RE) hypothesis. There is limited evidence for

the RE hypothesis, and even when the RE hypothesis is given the benefit of

the doubt in the estimation of the model, the properties of this version of

the model are quite similar to the properties of the regular version of the

model. This is not, however, the appropriate place to defend the model.

Suffice it to say that the validity of the conclusions of this paper is

based on the premise that the model is a good approximation of reality.

II.   Methodology
The General Procedure

      Stochastic simulation can be used to estimate variances in nonlinear

models. Write the model as


(1) f.(y x, a.)           u..    ,
                                     i      l,...,n   ,
                                                          t   —   l,...,T
where y is an n-dimensional vector of endogenous variables, x is a vector

of predetermined variables, a. is a vector of unknown coefficients, and u.it
                             1
is an error term. The first m equations are assumed to be stochastic, with

the remaining u.. (i       m+l,. .   .,n)   identically zero for all t. It is assumed

that u (u1t, ... , umt) is independently and identically distributed as
multivariate normal N(O,E).5 It is also assumed that consistent estimates

of a. denoted a., are available for all i. Given these estimates,
      1             1

consistent estimates of u., denoted                   can be computed as f1(y x,

The covariance matrix E can then be estimated as (l/T)UU', where U is the m

x T matrix of values of .       it
          Let u denote a particular draw of the m error terms for period t from

 the N(O,E) distribution. Given u and given â for all i, one can solve the

model for period t. This is merely a deterministic simulation for the given

values of the error terms and coefficients. Call this simulation a "trial."

 Another trial can be made by drawing a new set of values of u and solving

 again. This can be done as many times as desired. From each trial one

 obtains a prediction of each endogenous variable. Let y denote the value

 on the jth trial of variable i for period t. For J trials, the stochastic


      5Although the normality assumption is used throughout this paper, other
 assumptions could be used. This would simply change the way the error terms
 are drawn.
                                           7

simulation estimate of the expected value of variable i for period t,

denoted          is


(2)              (l/J)E
                       j=1


The stochastic simulation estimate of the variance of variable i for period

t denoted &.
                it
                      is

        -2
        °it      (l/J) E      -
                                  it
                                  -    2


where         is determined in (2).

        In many applications one is interested in predicted values more than

one period ahead, i.e. in predicted values from dynamic simulations. The

above discussion is easily modified to incorporate this case. One simply

draws values for u for each period of the simulation. Each trial is one

dynamic simulation over the period of interest. If, for example, the period

is eight quarters, one obtains eight predicted values of variable i from one

trial. Given then J values of the p-quarter-ahead forecast of variable i,

one can compute the mean and variance of this forecast using (2) and (3).

      It is also possible to draw coefficients for the trials. Given an

estimate of the distribution of the coefficient estimates, which one has

from the estimation of the model, coefficient values can be drawn. In this

case each trial consists of draws of both error terms and coefficients.

This paper, however, is not concerned with uncertainty from the coefficient

estimates, and only draws of the error terms are made. The coefficients are

the same from trial to trial.

      The next issue to consider is the treatment of the exogenous variables.

If the exogenous-variable values are the same from trial to trial, then the
                                        8

estimated variances are conditional on fixed values of the exogenous

variables. It is also possible, however, to take into account exogenous-

variable uncertainty in computing the estimated variances. As noted in the

Introduction, there are a number of ways in which this can be done. One

straightforward way, which is done here, is to add equations explaining the

exogenous variables to the model. For purposes of this paper, an eighth

order autoregressive equation (with a constant term and time trend included)

was estimated for each exogenous variable of interest and these equations

were added to the model. Stochastic simulation can then be done for this

expanded version of the model. By drawing error terms from the equations

explaining the exogenous variables, exogenous-variable uncertainty is taken

into account.

     Assume that there are q exogenous-variable equations added to the

model. This means that the covariance matrix E is now (m + q) x (m +     q).
In estimating this matrix one may want to take E to be block diagonal, where

the first block is the original m x m matrix and the second block is the

q x q estimated covariance matrix of the error terms in the exogenous-

variable equations. As noted in the Introduction, this procedure is

consistent with the assumption upon which the estimation of the model is

based.

     The notation        will be used to denote the estimated variance based on

draws of all m + q error terms. The notation t(k) will be used to denote

the estimated variance when the error terms in subset k of the equations are

fixed at their expected values, where subset k can simply be one equation.

Let .(k) be the difference between the two estimated variances:


(4) (k) =            -
                                          9



In the next section, values of '.(k) are computed for the one- through

eight-quarter-ahead predictions of real CNP and the GNP deflator for a

number of different choices of k.

     Because of the correlation of the error terms across equations, it can

turn out that (k) is negative for some choices of k. Also, as noted in

the Introduction, it is not in general the case that t(k) for, say, k

equal to the first and second equations is the same as                for k equal to

the first equation plus t(1) for k equal to the second equation.



Computational Issues

     For a number of reasons the stochastic-simulation estimates of the

variances are not exact. First, they are based on the use of estimated

coefficients rather than the true values. Second, they are based on the use

of an estimated covariance matrix of the error terms rather than the actual

matrix. Third, they are based on a finite number of trials.           Ignoring the

first two reasons, it is possible to estimate the precision of the

stochastic-simulation estimates for a given number of trials. In other

words, it   is   possible to estimate the variances of
                                                         -2      -2
                                                              and a.(k). What is
of more concern here, however, is the variance of               and this can also

be estimated. The estimation of these variances is explained in the

Appendix.

     Stochastic-simulation error turned out to be a bigger problem than I

originally thought it would be. One thousand trials was enough to make the

variances of         and (k) acceptably small, but without any tricks, it was

not enough to make the variance of .(k) anywhere close to being acceptably

small. Fortunately, there is an easy trick available. The variance of
                                       10

        is equal to the variance of     plus the variance of &(k) minus

twice the covariance. The trick is to make the covariance high, which can

be done by using the same draws of the error terms for the computation of

both      and (k). Any one equation of the model, for example, requires

8000 draws of its error term for 1000 trials for a forecast horizon of 8

quarters. If these same 8000 nuuiber are used to compute both       and

          the covariance between them will be increased. When this trick is

used, as shown in the Appendix, 1000 trials leads to variances of

that are acceptably small.



III. The Results

       My model is described in detail in Fair (1984), and it will not be

discussed here. The model has been estimated through 1986 II for this

study. The beginning quarter is 1954 I, and so there are 130 sample

observations. There are 30 structural stochastic equations and 98

identities. There are 23 autoregressive equations for the exogenous

variables. The structural equations have been estimated by two stage least

squares and the autoregressive equations by ordinary least squares. The

eight-quarter prediction period for the simulations was 1981 III - 1983 II.

       The stochastic-simulation work was done in two steps. For the first

step 54 stochastic simulations were performed of 100 trials each. For the

first simulation none of the equations' error terms was fixed, and for each

of the remaining 53 simulations one equation's error term per simulation was

fixed. The variance of .(k) depends of the size of              and for

choices of k where the size is quite small, sufficient accuracy can be

obtained with 100 trials. The first step thus allowed one to determine
                                       11

 those equations whose error terms contribute very little to the overall

 variance. There were 11 such equations.6 This left 43 equations to

 consider further.

      For the second step 32 simulations were run of 1000 trials each. The

 first simulation was again where none of the equations' error terms was

 fixed. Each of the other 31 simulations consisted of fixing one or more of

 the remaining 43 equations' error terms.7 The results from these

 simulations will now be presented.

      The results for real GNP will be discussed first.    For ease of

interpretation, the differences will be presented as a percent of the

overall variance in percentage points. In other words, the values presented

in what follows are 1O0[.(k)/&J.

     The first stochastic simulation that was performed after the base

simulation (where all 53 errors were drawn) was one in which the error terms

in the 23 exogenous-variable equations were fixed at their expected values.

This allows one to see how much of the variance of real GNP is due to the

combined exogenous-variable shocks. The results are:
                                          Quarters Ahead
                            1     2     3      4     5       6     7     8

All exogenous equations    25.5 28.3 31.8 34.7 37.7 40.0 43.0 43.6

     6The variables explained by the 11 equations are 1) labor force
participation of men 25-54, 2) labor force participation of women 25-54, 3)
labor force participation of all others 16 and over, 4) number of people
holding two jobs, 5) dividend payments of the firm sector, 6) interest
payments of the firm sector, 7) inventory valuation adjustment, 8) capital
consumption of the firm sector, 9) member bank borrowing from the Federal
Reserve, 10) unemployment insurance benefits, 11) interest payments of the
Federal government.

     7Each (eight quarter) simulation of 1000 trials takes about 5 hours of
CPU time on a VAX 730. The 32 simulations thus took about a week of CPU
time. Counting initial experimentation time, various false starts, and some
errors, the computer work for this paper took about a month of CPU time.

For the one-quarter-ahead prediction 25.5 percent of the variance of real

GNP is due to the exogenous-variable shocks. This figure rises to 43.6

percent for the eight-quarter-ahead prediction.8 The exogenous-variable

shocks thus contribute a considerable amount to the variance.

     The next stochastic simulations were designed to examine the

contribution of household-sector shocks to the overall variance. The main

equations of the household sector in the model are three consumption

equations and a housing investment equation.9 The error terms in these

equations were fixed one at a time and then altogether. The results are:
                                           Quarters Ahead

Consumption of services     9.0   9.3        9.1   9.2   9.5   9.8   8.8   8.7

Consumption of nondurables 5.2    7.0        6.3   4.6   5.7   4.2   3.2   2.3

Consumption of durables    18.8 15.9 12.9 10.1           8.5   6.3   6.8   5.0

Housing investment         11.1 12.2         9.4 15.4 14.6 12.9 10.8       8.2

ALL FOUR TOGETHER          33.7 32.8 32.1 29.3 28.7 24.2 21.9 17.7

     8These figures are an underestimate of the contribution of all the
exogenous variables in the model to the variance of GNP because equations
for only 23 exogenous variables have been estimated. There are 88 exogenous
variables in the model for which equations could be estimated. The 65
variables for which equations were not estimated are, however, of fairly
minor importance in the model, many of them having to do with the linking of
the National Income Accounts with the Flow of Funds Accounts, and it is
unlikely that they would contribute much to the variance. It would have
taken much more computer time to deal with 88 exogenous-variable equations
rather than 23.
     Note also that what is referred to here as the overall variance of GNP
(or the GNP deflator below) is the variance taking into account only the 23
exogenous-variable shocks, not 88 shocks.

     9There are also four labor supply equations of the household sector,
three labor force participation equations and an equation explaining the
number of people holding two jobs. The error terms in these equations
contributed a very small amount to the variance of GNP, and the results for
these equations are not worth reporting.
                                          13

 The shocks to the equations for the household sector contribute a

 considerable amount to the variance of GNP, from 33.7 percent for the one-

 quarter ahead prediction to 17.7 percent for the eight-quarter-ahead.

 Shocks to the consumption of durables and housing investment equations

 contribute the most in the beginning. Shocks
                                                       to the consumption of services
 equation have a fairly stead influence across the horizon.               In terms of the
 effects of the correlation of the error terms across equations, the sum of

 the four individual percents for a given quarter ahead is about a third

 bigger than the percent for all four taken together. This is not a trivial

 difference, but it seems unlikely to affect the basic conclusions that are

 drawn from the individual results.

     The next simulations examined the contribution of firm-sector shocks.

Four simulations were run - -   one fixing the error term in the inventory

investment equation; one fixing the error term in the plant and equipment

investment equation; one fixing the error terms in the equations for the

demand for workers, the demand for hours per worker, and the demand for

overtime hours; and one fixing the error terms in all five equations.
                                                                                    (The
firm sector also sets prices and wages, but these equations are examined

separately below.) The results are:


                                                   Quarters Ahead
                                1     2        3       4     5       6        7     8

ALL FIVE TOGETHER          33.4 20.7 13.1             9.0   8.1     4.3     7.6    5.6
                                       14


Shocks to the inventory investment equations contribute a lot in the

beginning, but their contribution dies out fairly quickly. The contribution

of shocks to the plant and equipment investment equation is at best only

moderate. The figures for the demand for workers, hours, and overtime hours

are negative, which means that the variance of GNP is larger when the error

terms in these equations are fixed. In other words, the correlation of the

error terms in the model is such that the error terms in these equations

contribute negatively to the overall variance. The figures are, however,

quite small, and so there is little contribution of any sort from this

source. Note finally that the sum of the three individual percents for a

given quarter ahead is quite close to the percent for all the equations

taken together.

     There is one price equation and one wage equation in the model, and for

the next simulation the error terms in these two equations were fixed. The

results are:


                                        Quarters Ahead
                             1     2       3     4     5       6    7     8

Price and wage equations    0.2   3.3       4.8   5.7   7.1   8.0   8.3 10.5


The price and wage shocks have little effect in the beginning, but the

contribution builds up to 10.5 percent by eight quarters.

     The financial part of the model was examined next. Four simulations

were run.   1) The error terms in the three money demand equations were

fixed. 2) The error term in the interest rate reaction function of the

Federal Reserve, which determines the three-month Treasury bill rate, was

fixed. 3) The error terms in the two term structure of interest rate
                                           15

 equations, which determine the corporate bond rate and the mortgage rate

 respectively, were fixed. 4) The error term in the stock price equation
 was fixed. The results are:


                                                     Quarters Ahead
                               1      2          3        4     5      6        7           8

 The contributions are fairly small except for the stock price equation after

about four quarters. It is interesting to note that the shocks to the

Federal Reserve's interest rate reaction function do not contribute very

much. It is important to realize, however, that this does not mean that the

Fed itself is ineffective and that
                                     monetary policy is not important in the
model. (Monetary policy is in fact quite important in the model - -                  see,       for
example, the results in Chapter 9 in Fair (1984).) It simply means that the

effects of the shocks to the reaction function
                                                         are fairly small.
     When the interest rate reaction function is included in the model, as

it is for all the simulations in this
                                           study, monetary policy is endogenous.
This means that the demand for money equations affect the short term

interest rate only because the lagged growth of the money stock is an

explanatory variable in the interest rate reaction function.                It is not the

case, for example, that the money supply is fixed and that shocks to the

money demand equations directly affect the interest rate. It is thus not

surprising that the shocks to the money demand equations
                                                                    contribute very
                                         16

little to the variance of GNP.

       There is a demand for imports equation in the model, and the error term

in this equation was fixed next:


                                                  Quarters Ahead
                               1     2        3        4     5       6     7     8

Import equation              -14.7 -9.6 -4.3 -1.2 -1.2              3.0   5.1   6.7


The correlations of the error term in the import equation with the error

terms in the other structural equations are such as to lead to a fairly

large negative contribution in the first few quarters. In other words,

shocks to the import equation are initially somewhat stabilizing.

       This completes the simulations for the structural stochastic equations.

The shocks to the exogenous-variable equations will now be discussed. Nine

stochastic simulations were performed regarding the exogenous variables in

the government sector. The results are (F stands for federal government and

S stands for state and local government):


                                                   Quarters Ahead
                                1    2         3        4     5      6     7     8

ALL VARIABLES TOGETHER     10.2   8.5 10.5 11.4 13.8 16.7 19.5 20.5

These results are fairly self explanatory. The shocks to the exogenous

variables in the government sector (federal plus state and local) contribute

20.5 percent of the variance of GNP eight quarters out. There are 18

exogenous-variable equations involved for the above results: 10 tax rate

equations, 2 goods purchases equations, 4 labor purchase equations, and 2

transfer payments equations. The five tax rates for each government are 1)

a personal income tax parameter, 2) the corporate tax rate, 3) the indirect

business tax rate, 4) the employer social security tax rate, and 5) the

employee social security tax rate. The four labor purchase variables are

federal civilian employment, federal military employment, federal hours paid

per civilian worker, and state and local employment.

     The two key exogenous variables with respect to the foreign sector are

the real value of exports and the price of imports. The results of the

simulations with the error term in each of these equations fixed are:


                                                 Quarters Ahead
                             1     2         3        4     5     6     7     8

Exports                    13.9 15.0 16.0 19.7 21.6 21.0 20.9 18.6
Price of imports           -0.4 -0.7 -1.1 -1.8 -2.7 -3.1 -3.4 -3.4

Export shocks are obviously a large source of the variance of GNP. These

percents are, for example, much larger than the above percents for federal

purchases of goods, even though exports and federal purchases of goods have

similar multiplier effects. Part of this difference may be due to different
                                        18

correlations of the error terms across the exogenous-variable equations for

exports than for government purchases of goods, but most of it is probably

due to the fact that the export equation has a larger estimated variance

than does the government purchases of goods equation. Shocks to the price

of imports equation make a negative but fairly small (in absolute value)

contribution to the variance of GNP.

     There are three population variables in the model: the population of

men 25-54, women 25-54, and all others 16 and over. When the error terms in

the three equations explaining these variables are fixed, the results are:


                                                  Quarters Ahead
                             1     2          3        4     5      6     7     8

Three population variables 0.4    0.3        0.9      0.8   0.6    0.4   0.2   0.4


It is obvious that shocks to population do not amount to very much.

     This completes the results for real CNP. The results show that the

contributions from the various sources vary across the length ahead of the

prediction. They also show for any given length that no one or two sources

dominate. For the eight-quarter-ahead prediction, the contributions in

order of importance are 20.5 percent for the government sector, 18.6 percent

for exports, 17.7 percent for the household sector, 10.5 percent for prices

and wages, 6.7 percent for imports, 6.1 percent for stock prices, 5.6

percent for the firm sector, 3.9 percent for the term structure equations,

3.1 percent for the interest rate reaction function, and 0.4 percent for

population. The negative contributors are -3.4 percent for the price of

imports and -1.5 percent for the money demand equations.

     The results for the GNP deflator are easier to present because fewer

shocks matter. Consider first the simulation in which the error terms in
                                        19

all the exogenous-variable equations are fixed:


                                                  Quarters Ahead
                             1     2          3        4     5     6     7         8

All exogenous equations     8.8 15.8 24.9 33.2 43.3 53.1 60.7 67.9

As was the case for real GNP, the contribution of the exogenous-variable

shocks increases over the horizon, although for the GNP deflator the rise is

more pronounced.

     Shocks to the household sector and firm sector equations have only a

small impact on the variance of the GNP deflator:


                                                  Quarters Ahead
                             1     2          3        4     5      6     7        8

ALL FOUR HOUSEHOLD
  EQUATIONS                 0.3   0.8        0.8     0.4    0.8    1.3   1.7   1.5

ALL FIVE FIRM EQUATIONS     0.4   0.9        2.1      1.5   0.4    0.8   0.5   0.5


     Shocks to the two price and wage equations have a very large impact:


                                                  Quarters Ahead
                             1     2          3        4     5      6     7    8

Price and wage equations   88.2 82.2 72.7 62.4 50.5 39.5 30.1 24.0

Most of the variance of the GNP deflator for the first few quarters ahead is

due to the shocks to the price and wage equations. The contribution of

these shocks does, however, decrease fairly rapidly after the first year.

     The only other equation in which the shocks mattered very much was the

import equation. These results are:

                                                 Quarters Ahead
                             1     2         3        4     5      6     7         8

Import equation             3.8   1.7        0.3 -0.6 -1.1 -1.3 -1.5 -1.3
                                        20


The contribution is at first positive and then turns negative, although even

here the effects are not very large.

     The results when the error terms in all the government exogenous-

variable equations are fixed are:


                                                 Quarters Ahead
                             1      2        3        4     5      6     7     8

ALL GOVERNMENT VARIABLES    8.1 10.4 11.1 11.4 11.6 11.1                9.2   8.7


The shocks to the government variables contribute about 10 percent to the

variance of the GNP deflator. The results for exports and the price of

imports are:


                                                 Quarters Ahead
                             1      2        3        4     5      6     7     8

Exports                    -0.7 -0.6 -0.1           0.8   1.4     2.3   3.2   3.6

Price of imports            0.8     4.8 13.1 21.2 31.3 41.0 50.3 58.3

Shocks to exports do not amount to very much, but shocks to the price of

imports obviously do. By eight quarters out shocks to the price of imports

account for 58.3 percent of the variance of the GNP deflator.

     It is clear from the results for the GNP deflator that there are two

main sources of variability, shocks to the price and wage equations and

shocks to the price of imports. Most of the variability for the first few

quarters is due to shocks to the price and wage equations, but after six

quarters shocks to the price of imports become more important. Eight

quarters out, shocks to exports and the government exogenous variables

contribute a little over 10 percent to the variance. The contributions from

the other shocks, which are not reported here, were all minor.

IV. Conclusion

     The methodology of this study allows one to get a good idea of the

quantitative contribution of various shocks to the variance of endogenous

variables like real GNP and the GNP deflator. For the variance of the GNP

deflator there are two main sources of variability: shocks to the price and

wage equations and shocks to the price of imports. Of the other sources,

shocks to the government exogenous variables contribute about 10 percent to

the variance of the GNP deflator. For the variance of real GNP there are

many important shocks; it is clearly not the case that one or two shocks

dominate. In short, there are no simple stories to be told about the

sources of output variability, at least not within the context of a

macroeconolnetrjc model like mine.

                                         APPENDIX

       The calculation of the simulation-error variances is discussed in this

appendix, and some examples are presented. In the text          denotes the

predicted value of variable i for period t on the jth trial. For purposes

of this appendix, the it subscript will be dropped. The following

discussion always pertains to variable i for period t. The stochastic-

simulation estimate of the expected value of variable i for period t is

given by equation (2) in the text, which is repeated here in the current

notation:

                             J
(Al)          =   (l/J)      Ey1
                            j=l

Let


(A2)
         2j       =   (.J    -




The stochastic-simulation estimate of the variance of variable i for period

t, which is given by equation (3) in the text, is then:

         2                          2'
(A3) &                (l/J)a3
                             j =1

An estimate of the variance of &2 denoted var(2), is


(A4) var(&2)                 (l/J)2    (2J -   2)2
                                   j=l


(Note also that an estimate of the variance of        is &2/J, although this

estimate is not needed for the present analysis.)

       As in the text, the notation (k) will be used to denote a stochastic

simulation where the error terms in subset k of the equations are fixed at

their expected values. Let
                                                          23

                                      a2(k)

The estimated mean of d(k), denoted (k), is

                                     3
(A6) (k)              (1/3) E d(k)
                                 j.4

Equation (A6) is the same as equation (4) in the text. (k) is the

difference between the two estimated variances. The estimated variance of

       The following results give one an idea of the precision of the

estimates based on 1000 trials. These are the results used in the paper for

real GNP. The units are in billions of 1982 dollars.

The first row presents the estimates of the variance of real GNP, and the

second row presents the estimated standard errors of the variance estimates.

The variance estimates are fairly precise, with estimated standard errors

less than 5 percent of the variance estimates. The next two rows pertain to

the stochastic simulation in which the error terms in all the exogenous-

variable equations were fixed. The values of the difference are presented

in the first of the two rows, and the estimated standard errors of the

difference values are presented in the second of the two rows. The standard

errors are generally less than 10 percent of the difference values, and so

the precision is reasonably good. The same two rows are presented for the

simulation in which the error term in the export equation was fixed and for

the simulation in which the error term in the stock price equation was

fixed. In these two cases the precision is somewhat less; the standard

errors are around 15 percent of the difference values.

      For all the stochastic simulations the standard errors of the

difference values seemed small enough to allow meaningful comparisons to be

made, although they are still fairly far from zero. Remember that these

estimates are based on the trick of using the same draws for both

simulations. Without this trick, the standard errors are much too large for

anything meaningful to be done with the difference values.

      Finally, the 23 exogenous variables for which autoregressive equations

were estimated are the following:

 1.   Federal purchases of goods.
 2.   Federal personal income tax parameter.
 3.   Federal corporate tax rate.
 4.   Federal indirect business tax rate.
 5.   Federal employer social security tax rate.
 6.    Federal employee social security tax rate.
 7.    Federal transfer payments to households.

 8. Federal civilian employment.
 9.
     Federal military employment.
10. Federal hours paid per worker.
11. State and local purchases of goods.
12. State and local personal income tax parameter.
13. State and local corporate tax rate.
14. State and local indirect business tax rate.
15. State and local employer social security tax rate.
16. State and local employee social security tax rate.
17. State and local transfer payments to households.
18. State and local employment.
19. Exports.
20. Price of imports.
21. Population of men 25-54.
22. Population of women 25-54.
23. Population of all others 16 and over.
