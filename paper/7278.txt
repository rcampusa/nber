Tradable Deficit Permits:
Efficient Implementation of the Stability
Pact in the European Monetary Union

NBER Working Paper No. 7278
August 1999
                                            ABSTRACT

       Borrowing from the experience of environmental markets, this paper proposes a system of
tradable deficit permits as an efficient mechanism for implementing fiscal constraints in the European
Monetary Union: having chosen an aggregate target for the Union and an initial distribution of
permits, EMU countries could be allowed to trade rights to deficit creation. The scheme exploits
countries’ incentives to minimize their costs, is transparent, flexible in accommodating idiosyncratic
shocks and allows for adjustments in case of Europe-wide recessions. In addition, it need not treat
all countries identically and can be designed to penalize countries with higher debt to GDP ratios.
Finally, the scheme rewards countries for reducing their deficit below the initial allowance, lending
credibility to the Stability Pact’s goal of a balanced budget in the medium run.

                                          1. Introduction.


  The current provisions of the Pact for Stability and Growth advocate balanced budgets in the

longer term and specify a ceiling for deficit spending of 3 per cent of GDP for each member of the

European Monetary Union. A violation of the ceiling will trigger warnings and eventually

penalties (unless exceptional circumstances can be invoked).1 In this form, the Pact suffers from

several shortcomings that will limit its effectiveness and impose exceptional costs on at least some

of the member countries.

  This paper will discuss a scheme for achieving the objective of overall fiscal moderation

embodied in the Stability Pact at lower costs to countries' growth. It will not question whether

the Stability Pact is itself needed, but, taking the intent to regulate the fiscal position of member

countries as established, present an efficient mechanism for the implementation of this regulation.

In the last two years the political climate in the European Union has changed, while

unemployment is still too high. The political will to maintain fiscal discipline will weaken if the

costs are too large. If balancing the fiscal accounts is considered a worthwhile goal, reaching it

may well depend on our ability to design a better mechanism.

  The weaknesses of the Stability Pact have been widely discussed:

   - The imposition of the same criterion for each country leaves no room for differences, either

in countries' initial fiscal positions (which may intended) or in countries' cyclical phase. For some

economies at least the room for maneuver required for the functioning of the automatic stabilizers

during the cycle is almost certainly missing.

   - The arbitrariness left in the criteria creates uncertainty about the application of the penalties
                                                                                                      2

and is sure to generate difficult negotiations with individual countries. Compliance will be

affected. Especially when times are hard (but not hard enough to qualify for exceptions

automatically), the incentive to violate the deficit limit and then negotiate will be high.

   - There is no reward for virtue. While an exposed fiscal position by any one country is

considered a weakness for the whole system, a particularly solid position must be its own reward:

"The problem with the Pact as presently framed is that it is all stick and no carrot: rewarding good

fiscal behavior in booms .. in addition to punishing bad behavior in slumps would surely make

better sense" (Bean, 1998, p.106 ).

    - Politically the Pact seems designed to be unpopular. Combining a draconian criterion with

discretion in the application of the penalties, it emphasizes the countries' loss of sovereignty. It is

likely to be an obstacle if and when the UK decides to join the monetary union.

   The thesis of this paper is that all these limitations can be overcome if we combine the overall

objective of fiscal discipline with sufficient flexibility for individual countries. Borrowing from

the experience of environmental markets, we could design a system of tradable deficit permits:

having set an overall ceiling and an initial distribution of permits, EMU countries could be allowed

to trade rights to deficit creation. The scheme need not treat all countries identically and could be

designed to penalize countries with higher debt to GDP ratios. Its fundamental virtue is that it

exploits countries’ incentives to minimize their costs to insure that the final goal is achieved as

efficiently as possible. The next section clarifies the logic behind the proposal; section 3 describes

the US market for sulfur dioxide emissions, and section 4 discusses options and obstacles in

adapting the simplest design to the fiscal concerns of the Monetary Union.
                                                                                                       3

                                         2. The Basic Idea.


  The starting point of the Stability Pact must be the belief that markets alone are unable to

impose sufficient discipline on the fiscal position of individual EMU members. Regardless of

official statements to the contrary, it could be that both markets and governments expect that a

profligate country will be bailed out eventually by the rest of the system. This may occur because

either budget constraints operating through the banking system or psychological effects tie the

robustness of the whole monetary union to that of its weakest member. Or, without getting to the

extremes of a crisis, because fiscal exposure translates into inflationary pressure on the European

Central Bank (ECB), itself a form of bail-out. In any case, the markets' inability (or

unwillingness) to differentiate sufficiently among different countries' debts could lead to excessive

spending. All of these motivations have been analyzed elsewhere (for example, Beetsma and

Uhlig (1998), Chari and Kehoe (1998), Eichengreen and Wyplosz (1998), Flandreau et al.

(1998)), and it is not the purpose of this paper to discuss them further.2 Regardless of

economists' opinions about the seriousness of these fears, the existence of the Stability Pact makes

clear that the problems are seen as important by policy makers. If we accept the will to impose

fiscal discipline on the EMU countries as established, we need to ask how the objective can be

achieved at the lowest cost to countries’ growth.

  The different mechanisms described above all amount to stating that high deficit spending by

any one country has costs for the other members that the country itself fails to internalize: a high

deficit in Italy affects negatively Germany, France and the other members of the Union. We can

then think of deficits as a form of pollution, originating in one country's activity, but having
                                                                                                          4

repercussions for all. Once the problem is stated in these terms, we see that the arguments that

have been developed for environmental regulations can be adapted to our purposes.

  In a world where a benevolent and perfectly informed central planner existed, a centralized

solution would be possible. All decisions would be deferred to the center: in the same way as

countries have relinquished their monetary policy, they would also lend their fiscal powers to a

European-wide body. At least in the short run, neither the institutions nor the political will are in

place to make such a scenario feasible or in fact desirable. Alternatively, countries running fiscal

deficits could be charged a tax per unit of new debt equivalent to the social cost of their issues, a

direct parallel to the Pigouvian tax advocated for environmental problems. But the information

required to calculate the tax correctly is very difficult to obtain: a tax scheme imposes a daunting

task on the regulator, with the likely result that the realized deficits could be seriously different

from the desired objectives. In the presence of uncertainty, fixing the aggregate ceiling to fiscal

expansion limits this risk, but must be complemented by an allocation mechanism that distributes

the responsibility for fiscal austerity in the most efficient manner. Analogously to pollution

permits, a system of tradable deficit permits sets a total limit to fiscal deficits but uses the market

to allocate them across the different countries at minimum cost. This is the scheme discussed in

this paper.3

  Most traditional forms of pollution control take the form of quantitative limits on pollution

sources, typically imposing the same limit on all sources. But because different sources utilize

different production technologies, have different access to cleaner inputs and different scope for

capital investment in pollution reduction, the same pollution limit imposes widely diverging costs.

In a market for pollution permits, instead, while the regulatory authority sets the overall pollution
                                                                                                        5

limit - the total stock of permits available on the market - it is the market itself that ensures that all

pollution sources will act to equalize their marginal costs of pollution reduction, achieving the

target decrease in pollution at minimum total cost.

   The parallel with our fiscal problem is immediate: the scheme currently envisioned by the

Stability Pact consists of uniform quantitative constraints on each country's deficit (not more than

3 per cent of GDP, barring a serious recession), and the observance of this limit is likely to be

associated with very different costs, depending on the country's structure, debt overhang and

cyclical phase. The dispersion in costs is a sign of the scheme’s inefficiency: a system of tradable

deficit permits would allocate deficits there where their value is higher, making it possible to

implement the desired fiscal discipline much more efficiently.

Box on tradable pollution permits.

  The idea that externalities could be solved efficiently thought the creation of property rights

and voluntary trading originates with Coase (1960). If there were no obstacles to information and

to contracting, voluntary exchanges would result both in the correct level of total activity and in

the optimal allocation among agents. In the presence of real world imperfections, however, the

achievement of the first best through private bargaining is unlikely, and advocates of market

instruments in environmental regulation make the more modest but more realistic claim of

implementing a predetermined target at minimum costs. Accepting the principle that both the

total allowed level of pollution and the distribution of the burden necessary to bring it about are

chosen politically, they show that a market for pollution permits achieves the target reduction in

pollution at lowest total costs. The creation of a market for pollution permits was first proposed
                                                                                                      6

by Dales (1968) and Crocker (1966). The literature is now very large, but a good introduction is

provided by the following sources: Montgomery (1972) for a formal treatment; Tietenberg (1985)

for a survey of the issues involved; Baumol and Oates (1988) for a thoughtful discussion of the

approach’s promises and limits.

   The mechanism through which the market delivers minimum total costs is shown very clearly

in the following example constructed by Tietenberg (1985, ch. 2) and illustrated in Figure 1

(Figure 1 in Tietenberg, 1985, p.20). Consider two sources of pollution, each of which would

produce 15 units of pollution if unconstrained. Suppose that the goal is to reduce total pollution

by half, i.e. to 15 units in total. The horizontal axis in the diagram measures the reduction in

emissions for the two sources, and should be read from left to right for source 1 and from right to

left for source 2. The vertical axis measures the marginal costs of pollution reduction for the two

sources (thus both curves are zero when pollution is unconstrained). For each source, the total

cost of achieving a specified level of pollution control is the area below the marginal cost curve,

up to the specified point. Notice that any point on the horizontal axis achieves the desired level of

pollution control, and thus the corresponding areas under the marginal costs curves yield the total

costs associated with each allocation of pollution reduction between the two sources. There is a

unique allocation such that the marginal costs are equal, and that is the unique allocation that

minimizes total costs (it is easy to read from the figure that the sum of the two sources’ total costs

is higher at any other point). This is the first result: the aggregate cost of compliance is minimized

when marginal costs are equal across sources. It is also easy to see that a market for pollution

permits would take the two sources to the efficient point. Suppose that the initial distribution of

permits required source 1 to cut emissions by 7 units and source 2 by 8. As long as the price of a
                                                                                                       7

permit were smaller than G, source 2 would want to buy permits, and as long as it were higher

than E source 1 would want to sell. When the price equals P the two sources trade exactly the

required number of permits to bring them to the efficient point. But the price cannot be different

from P, because at any lower price demand exceeds supply, and at any higher price supply

exceeds demand. Notice that any initial distribution of permits leads to the same equilibrium,

although to a different distribution of the total costs.

  There are of course a number of potential difficulties with applying a system of tradable permits

to fiscal discipline, and they are discussed below in Section 4.. For the moment, let us consider

how the scheme would work in its simplest realization. Each year each country is allocated a

number of deficit permits, equivalent, for example, to 3 per cent of its GDP. In practice, these

permits could simply be entries in special accounts maintained by each country at the ECB or at

the European Commission. The permits are denominated in Euros and freely tradable. At the

time final fiscal statistics are made public, for example by the end of April of the following year,

each country must have in its account a sufficient number of permits to cover the year's deficit,

and these permits are withdrawn from the system.4 If a country is found not in compliance, it

faces a steep fee for each of the missing permits and must relinquish a corresponding number of

permits from the following year's allocation. Following the example of existing environmental

markets, it seems advisable to let countries bank permits for future use while not allowing them to

borrow from future allocations. This leaves some room for intertemporal planning and smoothing

of anticipated shocks, but limits temptations for governments with too short horizons. In
                                                                                                       8

practice, this means that deficits can be offset by permits carrying a date contemporaneous or

preceding the year of the deficit.

  An unusual feature of the scheme is its finances. Buying the permit is buying the right to issue

a unit of debt; but since the permit must be paid, part of the new debt is in fact devoted to the

purchase of the permit itself. If p is the price of the right to issue 1 Euro of debt, a government

can devote only a share 1-p of the value of each permit to the purchase of new resources; in other

words, the right to borrow 1 Euro of new resources for national expenditure requires the

purchase of 1/(1-p) Euros of permits, i.e. costs the government p/(1-p). This multiplicative factor

implies that the price of the right to issue 1 Euro of debt must always be smaller than 1 (as

intuition suggests), and creates a wedge between total new debt and those borrowed resources

that can be devoted to national expenditure, but has no other implications, and in particular does

not affect the theoretical optimality of the scheme. The point is analyzed more formally in the

Appendix.5

  It is true of course that each government would be faced with an extra expense - the purchase

of the permits - exactly when it is already surpassing its 3 percent deficit allocation. But this

occurs in the current system too, if the penalties are applied. The important difference is that in

the scheme suggested here the fee is not fixed arbitrarily, but determined by the market. In

particular, consider a country affected by an asymmetric negative shock, the type of idiosyncratic

shock that would put the existing system under stress. If the other countries do not anticipate a

need for fiscal expansion, the price of the permits will be low (the price is positive only if the total

unconstrained deficit of the EMU countries is larger than 3 per cent of their total GDP), and the

shock can be countered by fiscal policy at low cost. More generally, the cost of going above the
                                                                                                        9

3 per cent limit at any given time is the market valuation of a fiscal expansion at that time, taking

into account the overall ceiling and, possibly, the option of banking permits for the future. If the

ceiling has been chosen correctly, this is exactly what the cost should be.

   Thus the first important advantage of the scheme is the flexibility it provides to individual

countries - the performance of all countries need not be the same, nor needs the performance of

each country at different times. Notice, and this is a second benefit, that the increased flexibility

works both through imposing the correct costs to fiscal expansion and through creating the

correct rewards for fiscal cuts. A country choosing to sell some of its permits collects resources,

again according to the value of those permits in their best alternative use. Contrary to the current

writing of the Stability Pact, good behavior is rewarded. Finally, flexibility means that a country

can intervene before experiencing a severe contraction - as opposed to the present plan where

exceptions to the fiscal constraint are only triggered when a very serious recession has been

experienced, and thus when, by definition, stabilization policy has already failed.

   As all regulatory mechanisms, this too will function well if the aggregate ceiling is appropriate.

In the case of an unexpected Europe-wide negative shock, the supply of permits may need to be

increased to prevent an undesirable and contractionary increase in their price. More generally, the

supply of permits could be adjusted to take into account the state of the European economy. This

allows the system to overcome two further limitations of the Stability Pact. First, in the case of a

symmetric negative shock, the quantitative constraints on fiscal deficits at present leave all

responsibility for stabilization policy with the Central Bank. At least until deficits remain close to

their upper limits there can be no meaningful discussion of an optimal policy mix. Second, while

the Stability Pact advocates the medium term objective of a balanced budget, there is no
                                                                                                      10

mechanism that encourages countries to bring it about. Individual countries are given no

inducement to reduce deficits below the limit, and imposing a lower limit would be extremely

difficult in the absence of any room for individual deviations. A system of tradable permits, on the

contrary, allows enough flexibility to accommodate anticipated declines in supply. Indeed this is

one of the reasons that have made the system acceptable to environmental groups in the US.

  If changes in permits supply are planned, however, it is important to make them as predictable

and as transparent as possible: the scheme functions if the market functions, and the market

requires predictability. Thus there is a trade-off between the possibility of fine-tuning the supply

of permits and the need to minimize interference with the market. Again as in the case of the

environmental markets, there could be an automatic rule that specifies how supply is determined

over time - a rule as simple as possible, focusing on indicators that countries’ policies cannot

manipulate.

  One of the fundamental advantages of a system of tradable permits over the current Pact is its

transparency, and it should not be compromised. It would be a system regulated by rules as

opposed to a system open to political exceptions, and as such much easier to understand, predict

and enforce. A standard finding in the literature on environmental regulation is the decline in

litigation following the substitution of a system of tradable permits for quantitative constraints.

The lack of flexibility that defines the latter makes it necessary to allow for exceptions, and the

presence of exceptions makes it often desirable for a firm to violate the constraint first, and

litigate later. A significant part of the increase in compliance predicted (and observed) with

tradable permits comes from decline in violations whose legitimacy could conceivably be defended

in a murkier system (Tietenberg (1985), Stavins (1998)).
                                                                                                        11

  Finally, the theoretical superiority of the scheme discussed here is also its main practical

advantage: at equal enforcement, it is guaranteed to cost less. No matter how desirable fiscal

discipline may appear ideally, it will not be pursued if its costs are too high. This is particularly

true at the present moment when other painful reforms must be tackled - to labor markets, to

pension systems, to social benefits in general - and people's impatience with further fiscal austerity

has been expressed at the polls and is shared by many of their representatives. If a scheme of

fiscal discipline is to be imposed at all, then its only chance of implementation comes from being

as efficient as possible.

  The example of environmental regulation has been mentioned frequently because it is the main

field where alternative schemes for controlling externalities were devised, studied and compared.

Beyond the theoretical work, what is really exceptional about environmental regulation is that

economists' schemes were in fact put into practice as policies. Thus not only the theoretical

studies but the practical experience of existing permits markets can be used as benchmark for

quite different applications.6



                     3. The Experience of Sulfur Dioxide Emission Trading.


   In 1990, Title IV of the Amendments to the Clean Air Act introduced in the US the first

national program of environmental regulation based on a system of marketable permits. Smaller

local markets for pollution permits had been tried in the past and some are in existence at present,

but this program is unique in its scale, its geographical extension, and its unfettered reliance on

private markets.7 I summarize its main features below; more exhaustive analyses can be found in

Ellerman et al. (1996) and (1997), Joskow et al. (1998), Schmalensee et al. (1998), Stavins
                                                                                                      12

(1998), and in the remarkable Web page of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at

www.epa.gov/acidrain.

   The goal of Title IV is to reduce permanently yearly sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions to

approximately 50 per cent of their 1980 levels, i.e. to about 9 million tons. SO2 is the main

precursor of acid rain, and is mostly emitted by coal-fired electric utilities.8 The program is to be

enacted in two phases: the first, from 1995 to 1999, targets the largest and dirtiest generating

units, and requires them to cut their aggregate yearly SO2 emissions by about 40 per cent; phase

2, from 2000 onward, submits effectively all electric-generating units in the US to the aggregate

ceiling of 9 million tons of emissions per year. Each unit is required to install and maintain a

continuous emissions monitoring system approved by the EPA.9

  The aggregate targets are implemented through a system of fully tradable allowances. The

total amount of emissions allowed for a given year translates into a total number of allowances

carrying that year's date, and distributed to all affected units approximately in proportion to their

average 1985-87 heat input. An allowance is the right to emit a ton of SO2 and exists as a record

in the accounts system maintained by the EPA (the Allowance Tracking System). Within 30 days

of the year's end, each unit must withdraw from its account and deliver to the EPA a number of

allowances equal to its SO2 emissions during the year and carrying either that year's or an earlier

date. Thus each unit needs to buy allowances if it emits more than its initial allocation, but can

either sell or bank allowances, if it emits less. If a unit is found not in compliance, it must pay

$2,000 for each ton of emissions not accounted for (10 times the current price of an allowance)

and withdraw a corresponding number of allowances from its next year allocation.

  The most remarkable feature of the program is the lack of government intervention in
                                                                                                     13

influencing how compliance can be achieved. The only intervention in the market is the auction

held by the EPA in March of each year, where approximately 3 per cent of allowances are sold,

and whose purpose, especially at the beginning of the program, was to generate price data that

may help the market identify an equilibrium price (revenues are redistributed to the utilities).

Otherwise, the market is open and unregulated. Anybody can enter the market and trade, be it

utilities, brokers, businesses, environmental groups, or individuals; traders who are not electric

utilities can but are not required to have an account at the EPA; partners can trade in any manner

they choose and are free to record or not their transaction with the EPA; new instruments - for

example, swaps of current for future date allowances - or new goods - for example bundles of

coal deliveries and matching emission allowances - can be (and were) freely created by the

market.

   The openness of the market is matched by its transparency: the balances of the EPA accounts

are public information, available on the EPA Web page, and so are all bids in the EPA auctions.

Information on current prices is easily obtained from either Fieldston Publications' market survey

or from Cantor Fitzgerald, the largest brokerage firm active in environmental markets; for

example, Cantor Fitzgerald’s Web page (www.cantor.com/ebs/) reports that the price of one SO2

allowance for current use was $212.17 on May 25. Placing an order is equally easy: through

Cantor Fitzgerald it can be done by calling toll free (800) 228-2955, ext.5 from a US or Canada

phone.10 Quite naturally, the two brokers act also as consultants, and have played an important

role in devising new instruments; as the example of the swaps makes clear, an active market in

derivatives is growing.

   So far the program has been unanimously judged a success. The first and main concern was
                                                                                                     14

that the market would not develop, but all evidence to date is to the contrary. As described in

detail in Joskow et al. (1998), by mid 1994 a single market price had emerged.11 Starting at

around that time, the market price indexes reported by all market observers are indistinguishable,

and match the prices realized at the EPA auctions. The volume of market transactions has also

increased dramatically, from 900,000 allowances transferred between organizations in 1994 to 9.5

millions in 1998, with the percentage of activity generated by the EPA auction falling from 20 per

cent in 1994 to 3 per cent in 1998 (EPA, Web page). (See Figure 2). The environmental

objectives were easily achieved and in fact surpassed: in 1995 and 1996, years for which final data

are available, SO2 emissions by regulated sources were respectively 39 and 33 per cent below

allowed aggregate levels. This very substantial overcompliance took place at allowance prices

that were far below what had been anticipated: predicted prices were in the range of $250-$350,

whereas for all of 1995 prices were below $130 and for all of 1996 below $100. The aggregate

performance masks large differences in individual responses, exactly as the theory suggests should

occur - in both years, approximately one quarter of all affected units had emissions exceeding

their allocation of allowances (Schmalensee et al. (1998)).

  Whether or not the market that has evolved is efficient is a more difficult question. On one

hand, neither concerns with the design of the EPA auction (Cason (1993) and (1995)), nor fears

of interference from state regulatory commissions (Fullerton et al. (1996)) have proven justified

(Joskow et al. (1998), Bailey (1996)). On the other, the steep initial decline in the market price

suggests that utilities were surprised by the low cost of compliance and had overinvested in

capital improvements, reducing the demand for allowances below what would have been optimal

(Ellerman et al. (1997), Schmalensee et al. (1998)).
                                                                                                     15

  A less ambitious but more direct test of the success of the program is provided by an estimate

of the savings incurred. How much more would it have costed to achieve the same pollution

reduction through an alternative, less flexible regulation? Of course the answer depends on the

counterfactual chosen as comparison. For 1995 and 1996, Ellerman et al. (1997) find that the

average cost of cutting one ton of pollution was around $200 (including annualized capital

expenses), or about one quarter to one third below the cost that utilities would have incurred if

they had been prohibited from trading allowances (and transferring them among units of the same

company) at the same initial distribution of rights to pollute. This amounts to total savings of the

order of $300 million per year.

                                          4. Discussion.


   The basic system of tradable deficit permits can be amended to capture more faithfully the

concerns of European policy markers and insure that it can be implemented. The purpose of this

section is to show that potential problems can be faced, not to claim definitive answers. Most of

the points raised here would eventually require more detailed analyses.



  4.1. Deficits and Debts.


  A serious concern at the start of the sulfur dioxide program was the possibility that trade would

lead to "hot spots", geographical concentrations of pollutant in specific areas. Theoretically, a

system of emission permits is optimal only when it concerns an "assimilative pollutant", that is a

substance that mixes perfectly in the atmosphere and whose precise geographical origin is

therefore irrelevant. Only in this case are emissions from all sources perfect substitutes and thus
                                                                                                         16

justified to trade at one price. "Hot spots" could develop in the case of sulfur dioxide, but

apparently have not, at least to any important extent (Ellerman et al. (1997)).

   A very similar problem exists for a system of deficit permits. The system described in section

II is the efficient way to implement an aggregate constraint on EMU countries deficits, as

percentage of EMU GDP. But it assumes that the distribution of deficits among the different

countries is irrelevant, because all individual deficits are perfect substitutes. If the source of the

fiscal externality is interest rate spill-overs when the market considers all countries' debts perfect

substitutes, then the design of the system is appropriate. But if on the contrary the fear is that a

country's excessive exposure can trigger a crisis for the Union as a whole, then Italy's new debt

issues, for example, are not perfect substitutes for Germany's, because their outstanding debt

volumes are different. Since heavier debt service means higher costs of deficit reduction,

purchases of permits could be concentrated among countries with larger stocks of debt, creating

"hot spots" of new debt creation exactly where deficits are more costly for the Monetary Union.

The distribution of deficits matters.

  What is the appropriate design in such a case? Once again the intuition becomes particularly

clear when we phrase the problem in terms of pollution. Consider two sources of pollution

located at different distances from a town. The policy target is air quality in the town, and air

quality is affected by emissions from the two sources in inverse proportion to distance. A system

of emission permits is not well suited to the problem because it values emissions from the two

sources at the same price, whereas the two sources' impact on the target is different. The correct

system should be instead one of pollution permits, as distinct from emission permits, where the

two sources are allocated and trade permits to create pollution as measured at the receptor point,
                                                                                                       17

i.e. in the town (an “ambient permits system”). If one source is twice as distant from the town as

the other, then two units of its emissions will have the same effect on air quality as one from the

second source. Hence pollution permits trading at 1 to 1 translate into emissions permits trading

at 2 to 1: the same level of emissions must cost the source closer to town twice as much. The

solution, proposed and studied formally by Montgomery (1972), is simple and elegant: property

rights should be created for the targeted externality and not for its origin, because the latter is

one-step removed from the policy problem.

   In the case of environmental regulation, the simplicity of the theoretical solution translates into

an impossibly difficult problem of implementation. Even if the impact of each source of emissions

at a target point could be estimated accurately, each source affects environmental quality at a

number of target points, and affects each of them differently. Thus each point should correspond

to a different market, and each source should be active on all of them. But in fact if a source

emits several pollutants, as typically the case, then it should be active on a different set of markets

for each pollutant, and all these trades should happen contemporaneously and be interdependent.

It seems highly implausible that firms could navigate such a system in practice.

   For the purposes of our problem however, the essential intuition can be applied much more

simply. The policy objective is to control the impact of each country's fiscal choices on the

financial stability of the Monetary Union. This latter variable is equivalent to town air quality in

the simple example discussed above; because it is the only relevant objective, a single market will

be sufficient to achieve it, and it should be a market in “permits to increase the financial fragility of

the Union”. Thus what we need is an index of financial fragility and a measure of the impact that

different countries' deficits have on such an index.
                                                                                                     18

   Consider the following plausible implementation. The proxy for aggregate financial fragility is

given by the average squared deviation of Union countries’ debt to GDP ratios from a fixed

reference level; the policy objective is maintaining the rate of growth of that index below a

specified target. As shown in the Appendix, under reasonable assumptions this amounts to

holding the weighted sum of all countries’ deficits below the target, using as weight each

country's debt to GDP ratio.12 The Appendix also demonstrates how such a policy can be

efficiently implemented through a system of marketable permits: at the end of the year, each

country must hold an amount of permits proportional to the year's deficit, using the country's debt

to GDP ratio as factor of proportionality. Exactly as in the case of the two sources of pollution at

different distances from town, if country A's debt to GDP ratio is double that of country B, then

country A will have to hold twice as many permits to issue the same amount of new debt, or

equivalently will pay twice the price for each Euro of deficit. And this is just as it should be, since

the marginal impact of country A's deficit on the Union's financial fragility is twice as large that of

country B's.

   The simple example comes close to real policy concerns. But of course different indexes of

financial fragility could be constructed, taking other variables into account. As shown by

Montgomery (1972) the only important constraint is that the policy target be expressed as a linear

function of each country's deficit. Any such policy, choosing freely the factor of proportionality,

can be implemented at minimum cost through a system of permits.

   Environmental economists, on the other hand, have been forced to consider different

approximations to the optimal system, given its forbidding complexity in the applications that are

relevant to their concerns (see for example, Krupnick, Oates and Van De Verg (1983), and the
                                                                                                        19

discussion in chapter 4 of Tietenberg (1985)). When undesirable geographical concentrations of

pollutants are a possibility, a natural option to consider is that of "zonal permits" where free

trading of emission permits is allowed within each zone, but not across zone borders. Such a

system guarantees that pollution levels in each zone do not exceed target levels, but does so by

raising aggregate costs, because it interferes with the equalization of marginal compliance costs

produced by free trade. For our purposes, an analogous system would divide the member

countries into different groups, according to their likelihood of triggering a fiscal crisis, fix a

maximum deficit to GDP ratio for each group and a corresponding distribution of permits among

all countries in the group, and allow trading only within the group. Given the small number of

countries, the partition should probably not be finer than two groups, and again a plausible

criterion for selecting group members could be debt to GDP ratios.13 Individual countries would

move between the two groups as their debt to GDP ratios change. To the extent that similar debt

to GDP positions do not imply perfect correlation of shocks, some individual disturbances could

still be smoothed through trading. It is clear however that the main purpose of a "zonal" system is

to reduce trade, and thus the system will be inefficient, unless the ceilings have been chosen

exactly right. In addition, the scheme could be politically very unpopular, because it would

subject different countries to different constraints, with permits trading at different prices within

each group. We have discussed above how a better scheme can be designed for our problem with

relative ease; thus the only reason to consider a "zonal" system at all is its simplicity. It would be

very transparent, easy to explain to the public, and a possible compromise between the current

regime and a more desirable, fully flexible scheme.

  It may be important to clarify at this point that our entire discussion follows from the
                                                                                                      20

maintained assumption that the fiscal externality takes the form of global, not local effects. The

geographical analogy that allows us to borrow directly from the environmental literature should

not be misleading. In our analysis, each country cares only about an overall measure of the

Union's fiscal health, be it a straightforward aggregate variable - for example the Union’s

aggregate deficit to GDP ratio - or a more complex function of member countries' policies - the

probability that a financial crisis be triggered, or that the ECB be pressured into an inflationary

path. We are not considering the alternative case where each country has preferences over the

precise distribution of fiscal spending, independently of any aggregate measure of fiscal stability

(as would happen, for example, if a country were affected exclusively by the fiscal stance of its

main trading partners, or its geographical neighbors). The logic of our approach generalizes to

this scenario, but the appropriate trading mechanism could not be a simple market for permits.

With a unique market price and anonymous trading, a country has no instrument with which to

impose differential discipline on other member countries. We would need to devise more complex

exchange mechanisms where countries could bid over specific distributions of fiscal spending

across Union members, a “menu auction” à la Bernheim and Whinston (1986). I am confident

that the correct scheme could be designed, at least in theory, but neither the current formulation

of the Stability Pact nor the discussions that have accompanied it suggest that local effects are a

central concern (see for example, Eichengreen and Wyplosz (1998), and the discussion that

follows the paper). All attention is focused on the possible influence of individual countries' fiscal

mismanagement on Union-wide indicators: interest rates, inflation, the Euro exchange rate. Thus

studying a simple mechanism that can provide a solution to these global effects seems to be of

particular importance and is the only issue addressed in this paper. Even in this case the
                                                                                                      21

institution through which countries exchange permits requires some attention, and we turn to it

now.



   4.2. How could trade be organized?


   If the theoretical answer is the creation of a competitive market, how do we make sure that

transactions between the governments of 11 countries will indeed be competitive? There are two

main difficulties. First, 11 is a small number, and since countries have very different sizes, the

impact on the market of a large transaction by one of the big countries could a priori be

important. Hahn (1982) has shown that the active presence of a monopsonist in the permits

market distorts the equilibrium price and leads to higher compliance costs than in the competitive

case. Hahn’s result does not apply directly to our case because we have several large countries

who are likely to find themselves on opposite sides of the market, not a single monopsonist, and a

small number of players is not a guarantee of anticompetitive behavior (think for example of

Bertrand's model of price competition in a duopoly). Nevertheless, trusting that a deficit permits

market in general will be competitive requires considerable faith.

   One particular reason for concern, the second difficulty mentioned above, is that EMU

countries' governments interact continuously on a large set of issues, and there would be scope

for bundling purchases of permits with other bilateral transactions. Again, bilateral bargaining

need not be inefficient in principle, but the terms of trade are bound to reflect the two parties’

relative strength. Direct negotiations between any two countries cannot be prevented, but the

deviation from competition will be minimized if we can design a parallel market where a country

can always buy or sell permits at the competitive price. Is it possible to design realistic trading
                                                                                                       22

rules that would fulfill this function?

   Once more, it seems reasonable to begin by studying the environmental markets. As described

earlier, the market for sulfur dioxide emission permits was purposely left as unregulated as

possible - the EPA does not concern itself with the manner in which a transaction has taken place,

and the yearly EPA auction is both very small and increasingly irrelevant in signaling the market

clearing price. In practice, in 1997 more than 80 per cent of all trades between organizations

involved brokers (EPA, web page), and the latter were overwhelmingly represented by a handful

of companies. According to Cantor Fitzgerald's web page, an increasing share of its

environmental trades takes place through electronic trading, and more precisely through a

proprietary electronic platform that the brokerage house developed for its trades of US

government securities (the Cantor Exchange - CX). The technology amounts to a continuous

double auction, where the current highest bid and lowest ask prices, and corresponding quantities,

are posted on all terminals of connected agents (and with some delay on the Internet).

   A continuous double auction (often oral, with increasing frequency computerized) is the

trading mechanism followed by most organized exchanges around the world and governing

transactions of stocks, bonds, metals, commodities and derivative securities. Because of its

practical importance, its intuitive resemblance to the abstract idea of "the market", and the

extreme difficulty of characterizing its properties theoretically, it has been the object of a large

volume of experimental work. In laboratory experiments, double auctions quickly converge to

competitive outcomes with full efficiency even when the number of participants is as small as

three players on each side of the market. The conclusion is surprising and very robust, insensitive

to the exact details of the mechanism. Box 2 below discusses the experimental literature on
                                                                                                    23

double auctions in more detail.

   In experiments, double auctions consistently outperform other exchange mechanisms in

thwarting the exercise of market power (Smith et al. (1982), Clauser and Plott (1993)), and yield

competitive outcomes even when one side of the market, sellers for example, are given the

opportunity to coordinate actions in pre-play communication (Isaac and Plott (1981), Clauser and

Plott (1993)). According to these works, participants quickly recognize their common interest,

"conspiracies" form and informal agreements to impose cartel prices are easily reached. However,

the agreements unravel just as quickly during the play of the game. Clauser and Plott conjecture

that two features of double auctions may be responsible: first, the continuous nature of the

auction implies that the temptation to defect is continuous too, as opposed to the single act of

quoting the cartel price once in a static auction (for example in a sealed bid or posted offer

auction). Second, any access to the market requires a seller to underbid the current ask price;

thus, unless the cartel has also agreed to a credible ex post partition of the profits, the agreement

will not be sustainable14.

______________________

Box on double auctions

  A double auction is a market mechanism through which multiple buyers and multiple sellers

exchange goods. Both bids and asks are permitted and exchange can happen at any time during

the trading period; thus trades take place at different prices and net trades are the result of many

bilateral transactions. Both in real markets and in experimental settings, double auctions began as

oral auctions and have increasingly become computerized. The description below follows the

survey by Friedman (1993).
                                                                                                    24

  Comparing the double auction to other institutions may help to make its functioning clearer. It

differs from one-sided auctions because, in addition to competition among buyers, it allows active

competition among sellers through the announcement of ask prices. It is a continuous auction

because prices can be quoted and goods exchanged continuously, in contrast to static

discrete-time auctions where all bids and asks are collected during the period, but all trades

happen at the end, at the single market clearing price (“clearing houses”).

  Many variants of double auctions exist in real markets and many have been studied in

experiments: all bids and asks may be public (as in an oral auction) or only a subset, possibly only

the highest bid and the lowest ask; the good may be divisible or indivisible; it may be an asset,

living over time and paying dividends, or it may not; traders may be specialized in buyers and

sellers, or be allowed to be both, etc. Real world markets provide the richest data, but as always

are difficult to interpret; experiments in laboratories, although inevitably too simple, can be

controlled and replicated and have provided a wealth of results.

  By far the most important and the most common of these is that experimental double auctions

are very efficient market mechanisms, independently of their specific details and, remarkably, of

the number of players. Three or four buyers and three or four sellers are sufficient to induce

prices and allocations that closely approximate the competitive equilibrium (see for example Smith

(1982), Friedman and Ostroy (1995)). In markets with one-period goods or with short-lived

assets, the conclusion is so robust that it has led researchers to hypothesize that something in the

rules of the exchange is powerful enough to overcome both limits in the players' rationality and

opportunities for monopoly profits. The puzzle is compounded by theory's inability to

characterize the equilibrium of a double auction convincingly. A continuous double auction is a
                                                                                                      25

very complex game of incomplete information, where not only all price quotes, but also their

specific sequence and their time, relative to the end of the period, transmit information and must

be chosen and interpreted strategically. When the strategic interactions are studied explicitly (as

in Wilson (1987), the problem is so difficult that it seems implausible that real world subjects

would be solving it.

  Friedman (1984) and Friedman and Ostroy (1995) have conjectured that double auctions

induce competitive behavior even in the presence of few large players through a form of Bertrand

competition. With the rich exchange of information of a double auction, the argument is

intuitively convincing, but the formal result requires that players have knowledge of the market

clearing price. In most experiments, players acquire experience with the rules of the game

through stationary repetitions of periods of exchange, and thus can use the previous period final

price as a good guess of the equilibrium price. The view that these experiments come to

approximate games of complete information seems plausible, but raises the obvious concern that

the experiments may then not be faithful to the experience of real world markets.

  The concern is particularly relevant for asset markets, where assets live for multiple

non-stationary periods, information arrives continuously and dividends are state-contingent. In

asset markets experiments, the asset yields a random dividend at the end of each period, and the

complexity of the real world problem may be captured by letting the asset have a very long life

(for example 15 or 30 periods in Smith et al. (1988); or by assigning it a specified probability of

"death" each period, with no fixed end (Camerer and Weigelt (1993); or by designing messages

that reach the different traders at different times and may convey different information (Copeland

and Friedman (1987)). As expected, the increased richness of the environment leads to slower
                                                                                                     26

and more erratic convergence to the efficient rational expectations equilibrium, and bubbles and

crashes may appear. However, convergence to the "correct" price is observed in almost the

totality of experiments - a result that seems in itself quite striking - and the speed of convergence

increases with the experience of the participants, or in the presence of future markets.

_________________

   For our purposes, these observations suggest that a continuous double auction may be the

appropriate trading mechanism for a market in deficit permits. In line with developments in all

financial markets, the continuous double auction should be computerized, a feature that reduces

transaction costs and to some extent protects anonymity. Thus exchanges would then take place

through a two-tier system: direct bilateral negotiations between countries, and a simultaneous

electronic and anonymous double auction. A similar dual structure exists in most financial

markets: for example the "upstairs" and "downstairs" market of the New York Stock Exchange.

The downstairs market is the main market, organized as a (partially) computerized double

auction; the upstairs market is reserved for very large trades that could not be concluded without

delay through the main market, but are closed through the dealers’ personal negotiations. If the

downstairs market is sufficiently liquid, it can exercise the necessary disciplinary effect on the

upstairs market.15

   To maximize the liquidity of the continuous double auction, we need to consider which role, if

any, could be played in it by market makers, and who these market makers might be. Although in

theory the auction could function without intermediaries,16 the presence of market makers actively

speculating on their own accounts, and thus acting to maximize the volume of trades, provides

liquidity. This is particularly important in a new market, and certainly would be in a market where
                                                                                                       27

the number of traders is expected to be small. In addition, transactions in deficit permits could

well be lumpy, with countries entering the market only to purchase or sell relatively large volumes

of permits. The continuous nature of the auction, together with the year long horizon over which

countries can plan for necessary acquisitions of permits, are meant to alleviate the problem, but

we cannot exclude that the market may be required to accommodate large trades, or risk losing all

relevance. A hybrid system, where the auction's order book is supplemented by a dealer ready to

close large transactions at price quotes that cannot be more favorable to traders than the current

best prices in the order book, is a possible solution.

   If the market maker comes to play a large role in the market, it is tempting to think that the

role could be played by one of the European Union's institutions. If acting directly though, the

institution should be constrained so as to refrain from any intervention aimed at affecting the

market price of the permits, or the decentralization of the permits scheme loses meaning and

credibility. If the function is subcontracted to a private financial intermediary, the choice of the

agent and the extent and transparency of the guarantees he would enjoy become critical.

   Alternatively, in line with existing securities markets, the market maker’s function could be left

to the private sector, tapping existing know-how and eliminating concerns about regulatory

intervention. An intermediary able to provide the necessary liquidity and absorb potentially very

large positions would probably need to be a consortium of existing banks and securities firms.

But would banks and securities firms, and private agents in general, be allowed to trade on the

deficit permits market?



    4.3. Who Could Trade?
                                                                                                      28

  We need to face explicitly an issue we have avoided so far: who could be allowed to trade on

the permits market? There are two parts to the question: First, could trading be open to all, or

should it be restricted to the agents required to hold permits? Second, even if we decide for the

latter, should these agents be exclusively the central governments of the member countries, or

could we extend the program to state, provincial and local governments? Neither answer is

obvious.

   In environmental permits markets, anybody can trade. Two arguments support this design:

first, the larger the number of traders, the more likely that the outcome of the market will be

competitive; second, participation in the market by consumers and environmental groups can lead

to a better approximation of the socially desirable total pollution ceiling. In reality the presence of

consumers in the permits market remains very limited, but the first argument has proven

important: the market would not have developed as it has without the presence of brokers who

have acted as market-makers and engineered new contracts.

   In the case of fiscal permits, the logic is unchanged. The more dispersed the ownership and

trading of the permits, the more likely that the market will be thick and efficient. A fully

developed market for deficit permits should not be any more fragile or manipulable than a market

for, say, government bonds. If anything, the yearly allocation of permits to the member countries

should offer a partial buffer from market instability.17 In the government bonds market, the

presence of large financial intermediaries, private agents, Central Banks and foreign governments

is not seen as a threat but as an important contribution to the volume, liquidity and efficiency of

the markets.

  The problem however is that the market would not be born fully developed. Given the political
                                                                                                       29

sensitivity of the assets traded, opening a thin tentative market to all - and particularly to large

foreign players - would probably rely too much on the competitive features of the double auction

and would certainly be very controversial. Even within Europe, allowing the ECB to be an active

trader would raise the concern that the Bank could control both monetary and fiscal policies for

the Union.18 A more realistic alternative is to begin by restricting entry to the players directly

bound by the program and to regulated brokers. Private intermediaries would be monitored, but

should be allowed to trade because their objectives are more closely aligned with profit

maximization than governments', and thus their presence will improve the functioning of the

market. Opening the market further could be considered at a later stage.

   Which agents then should be bound by the program? The discussion so far has assumed that

only national governments would be required to hold permits. But the Stability Pact specifies

ceilings for general government deficit, thus including deficits incurred by state, provincial and

local governments. The extent to which compliance with the Pact should be shared among the

different levels of government is hotly debated: in Germany, the states have questioned whether

the Pact, adhered to by the central government, can constrain their behavior; in Italy, as in other

unitary countries, the legislature has issued laws on an "Internal Stability Pact" (see Law no.448,

December 23rd, 1998 and the following interpretative directive).

  The point is important. In all member countries a sizable share of general government

expenditure is channeled through state and local governments (the average share was 24 percent

in 1995). If we look at the four largest economies alone - accounting for more than 80 per cent

of the Union's GDP in 1997 - not only this remains true, but, what is most significant, state and

local governments have consistently borrowed directly on financial markets ( Table 1).19

  The most likely outcome at present is an arbitrary partition of the total allowed deficit between

central and local governments. But the deficit permits scheme suggests a superior alternative: if

local governments are allowed to borrow, they should also be required to hold permits. After

having received its initial allocation of permits, a national government could distribute it among its

different jurisdictions. All jurisdictions would then be allowed to intervene in the permits market,

so that the final allocation of permits, and the pattern of borrowing, would reflect the different

costs of fiscal austerity. Efficiency would be enhanced through two channels: first, with a

competitive permits market, the marginal costs of the borrowing constraint would be equalized

not only across countries, but also within each country, among its local governments. Second,

and equally important, the increase in the number of players and the reduction in the size of each

player would improve the functioning of the market and increase the chance that its outcome

would indeed be competitive.

   Because the initial allocation of permits does not impinge on efficiency, each country would be

free to decide on the appropriate distribution across states or regions. Thus without preventing
                                                                                                      31

redistributive schemes within a country, the program could further a policy of fiscal federalism, in

line with the often enunciated principle of subsidiarity. Notice however that simply requiring local

governments to hold permits would not per se impose a federalist structure on a country: the

central government could remain the single decision-maker behind the local governments' trades.

The existence of a permits price would make misallocations of spending patterns among local

governments more transparent, and thus easier to correct, but the distribution of effective powers

is a political decision that the program leaves, as it must, to each country.

   If local governments are allowed to trade independently, the market for permits will have its

desired effects only if compliance with the program is expected and enforced at the local level. If

a local government missing the required permits is able to either acquire them at no cost from the

central government or to shift the penalties to the national level, then the program is irrelevant.

Indeed, enforcing compliance with permits requirements is not sufficient to ensure that the market

will work as desired: it is also necessary that debt bail-outs from the central governments be ruled

out. If local governments do not expect to be held responsible for repaying any debt they incur,

then they will simply borrow more, so as to buy the permits necessary to support their deficits. Of

course, the possibility of debt bail-outs should distort local governments' borrowing behavior

independently of whether or not a market for permits is in place. Since local governments already

have direct access to financial markets, this cause of distortion presumably is not too severe.

    In the end, whether or not local governments can count on bail-outs by central governments

must depend on how constrained the latter are. Both at the local level and at the national level, it

is clear that the deficit permits program cannot be effective unless the correct enforcement is

provided. Some additional observations on the relative ease of enforcement of a market for
                                                                                                      32

permits versus the current quantitative limits of the Stability Pact are in order, and we turn to

them now.



   4.4. Enforcement and Political Economy.


   In the current version of the Stability Pact, penalties for countries violating their deficit ceiling

are not automatic, and it is hard to escape the impression that compliance with the Pact may not

be enforced. In a market for deficit permits, enforcement will still be at the arbitrium of the

collective will of the Union members, but there are some additional elements that should make

enforcement easier. First, as emphasized earlier, the costs of compliance would be lower, and

extenuating circumstances meriting exceptions would be harder to claim. In addition, suppose a

country is found in violation of the scheme. If penalties are not enacted, the price of the permits

immediately falls to zero; if the trading price was positive, any country who has saved permits for

future use, or who has emitted debt to finance permits purchases suffers a capital loss. Thus not

only is the Union affected by the negative externality attached to excessive deficit spending, as in

the case of violation of quantitative limits in the Stability Pact, but the market imposes a direct

financial penalty on those countries who played by the rules.

   As in the previous discussion of local governments, even if penalties are imposed and

collected, under both schemes countries will constrain their behavior only if they indeed bear the

final responsibility for such penalties. If countries expect that their obligations will eventually be

shared among Union members (directly or through inflationary pressures on the ECB), then

enactment of the penalties is irrelevant. Although the possible expectation of a debt bail-out is

one of the original motivations for the Stability Pact, the Pact does not address the problem
                                                                                                      33

directly, beside taking the important step of making a country's fiscal imbalances very visible.

Again, the same general reasoning holds in the case of a market for permits. As in the case of

enforcement of penalties for non-compliance, here too the only real differences are the added

flexibility enjoyed by all countries and the additional capital loss that a fiscal bail-out imposes on

the other Union members.

  Within any one country, taking full advantage of the flexibility allowed by the program should

mean being able to trade permits freely across time. Rational players choosing their series of

deficits over an infinite horizon should be allowed not only to save permits, but also to borrow

them so as to smooth the costs of fiscal contraction over time.20 On the other hand, in a world of

democratic governments with short horizons and strong electoral pressures, allowing a

government to spend with no effective restrictions, while imposing constraints on (remote)

successors seems rather unwise. The more pragmatic approach suggested in this paper, such that

governments would be allowed to save but not to borrow permits from their future allocations, is

still consistent with some intertemporal trade. As discussed in the case of environmental markets,

swaps of current permits in exchange for future ones among market participants may still emerge.

They are a form of intertemporal borrowing with two main advantages: first, the desired

aggregate fiscal ceiling is satisfied each period; second, the terms of the contract are decided by

the market, and thus no contract will emerge if future repayments are not credible. If the

alternation of different, competing governments makes past obligations unlikely to be honored,

then no borrowing will occur. The market would be so new that it is impossible to tell now

whether the permits will acquire the status of "standard' financial assets, mostly insensitive to

government changes, or not. Thus leaving this matter open for market participants to resolve
                                                                                                       34

seems correct. In addition, preventing governments from borrowing directly from their own

future permits limits the mistakes that initial inexperience with the program is sure to produce, an

important benefit in its own right.21



                                           5. Conclusions.


   This paper has discussed the creation of a market for tradable deficit permits as an efficient

mechanism for the implementation of fiscal constraints in the European Monetary Union. When

compared to the current provisions of the Stability Pact, a system of deficit permits would have a

number of advantages. First of all, it would be much more flexible - individual countries could

decide to incur larger deficits by purchasing permits on the market. Thus for example a negative

idiosyncratic shock could be overcome at low cost, since the market price of the permits would

reflect low demand by the other Union members. At the aggregate level, supply could be adjusted

in case of Europe-wide recessions.

   Second, because of its flexibility a system of tradable permits minimizes the aggregate costs of

compliance with the fiscal target. Given the high rates of unemployment in the four largest

countries of the Union, insuring that the costs of fiscal discipline are as low as possible is

particularly important. And, if such discipline is indeed desired, the probability of enforcing it

should be higher the lower the cost of doing so.

   Third, by allowing countries to save or sell their unused permits, the present scheme gives

them the incentive to reduce their deficit below the fixed 3 per cent ceiling of the Stability Pact.

The Pact’s recommendation of a balanced budget in the medium run becomes much more likely to

be implemented if it is accompanied by appropriate rewards for doing so.
                                                                                                      35

   Finally, given the general idea of a system of tradable permits, the design of the market can

vary to reflect the specific policy concerns that have inspired the call for fiscal discipline. For

example, countries with different debt positions can be treated differently, mirroring the fear that

deficits from economies with larger outstanding debts may be particularly destabilizing for the

Union as a whole.

    Will countries accept a deficit permits market, as alternative to the current provisions of the

Stability Pact? In the aggregate the costs of compliance would be lower; individually, countries

that remain below the bound of the 3 percent deficit to GDP ratio and have an equivalent initial

allocation of permits would gain, by being able to sell their unused permits. Countries that go

above their initial allotment would have to purchase permits on the market; we expect that the

cost of doing so would be lower than the very high penalties foreseen by the Stability Pact, if the

purchase is not too large, but a more precise answer to this question must wait for a quantitative

estimate of the permits market equilibrium price.

     The real difficulty in comparing the costs that countries would sustain under the two

schemes is assessing the probability that the Stability Pact will indeed be enforced. It is quite

possible that when the Stability Pact was agreed upon, policy-makers believed that political

considerations, more than economic ones, would finally determine whether or not fiscal discipline

would be imposed on Union members. The fixed quantitative targets, together with the possible

exceptions, create strong temptations for political settlements concluded outside the public view.

In an enlightening discussion of political obstacles to environmental regulation, Robert Stavins

describes how difficult it was to go beyond fixed ceilings for individual sources of pollution

(Stavins, 1998). “Old style” ceilings were popular with the public, because they sounded severe
                                                                                                     36

and unforgiving; they were popular with polluting firms, because firms knew that exceptions

could and would be negotiated out of the limelight; they were popular with politicians because

politicians maintained final control and benefitted from the exceptions they were able to grant.22

But international capital markets are not very forgiving of ambiguities. At the time of this writing,

five months after the introduction of the Euro, the markets appear to demand compliance with the

fiscal targets, demonstrating a loss of confidence in the European currency in response to any

indication of a softening fiscal stance. Enacting a market in deficit permits, with its predictability,

its transparency and its realistic requirements, could be an important step towards gaining the

international role for the Euro that we all expect.

1. The Pact, finalized at the June 1997 meeting of the Council of Ministers, specifies the details

of the Excessive Deficit Procedure of the Maastricht Treaty. An annual fall in real GDP of 2 per

cent or more is considered an “exceptionally” severe downturn, and the deficit to GDP ratio can

be above the 3 per cent limit as long as a recession of this magnitude persists (although it must

remain “close” to the reference value). If the decline in real GDP is between 0.75 and 2 per cent,

an exception can also be invoked if the Council of Ministers concurs.

2. The expectation that a country will not be allowed to default on its debt implies that all debts

are seen by the market are perfect substitutes, and thus are equally priced. The resulting interest

rate spillovers are a form of pecuniary externality that causes no distortion if each country is too

small to affect the equilibrium interest rate, but leads to suboptimally large debts if, acting

individually, countries can affect the market and manipulate it strategically. Pressures on the

Central Bank to inflate away excessive debts are, as stated in the text, a form of bail-out and thus

also create a fiscal externality. The literature has identified a third possible reason for intervention

in the theoretical possibility of indeterminacy of the price level (Leeper (1991), Woodford (1996),
                                                                                                     43

Canzoneri, Cumby and Diba (1998), Sims (1998)).

3. It is possible to derive rigorous conditions that determine whether a tax or a quantity ceiling is

the superior policy in the presence of uncertainty (Weitzman (1974)). Weitzman concludes

generally in favor of quantity constraints, because he believes that small deviations from the

optimal quantity are associated with steep reductions in benefits. For a very balanced discussion,

see Baumol and Oates (1988), ch.5.

4. As remarked by Peter Birch Sørensen, both the Stability Pact and a system of tradable deficit

permits induce countries to underreport their deficits. In the case of tradable permits, the

incentive to underreport exists even when a country is below the 3 percent limit, because it

benefits from selling or banking its permits. But it seems unlikely that countries could indefinitely

resort to accounting legerdemain, or that over time the difference in undereporting between the

two schemes would be of significant magnitude.

5. Because the market price p is always smaller than 1, setting the penalty for non-compliance at

or above 1 for each missing permit guarantees that the fee is higher than the market price.

Alternatively, the fee can be set equal to a stated multiple of the price, again exploiting the ceiling

at 1 to ensure that the market price never follows an explosive path.

6. A different proposal for a permits market targeted, like the one discussed in this paper, to

macroeconomic policy, was never enacted but is too interesting not to be mentioned. Concern

with inflation in the 70's triggered the idea that individual nominal price increases caused an

externality through their impact on inflation. Hence they could be curbed through appropriate

taxes: TIPS (tax-based income policy schemes) would use penalties or subsidies to induce firms to

refrain from granting wage increases and raising prices (Wallich and Weintraub (1971), Seidman

(1976), Okun (1977)). The customary difficulties of a tax scheme led to the suggestion of a

market for licenses to increase prices (Lerner (1977), Lerner and Colander (1980), Vickrey

(1986)). A special issue of the Brooking Papers on Economic Activity (1978:2) was devoted to

the mechanisms, and Vickrey was sufficiently intrigued by the idea to return to it in his

presidential address to the American Economic Association (Vickrey (1993)). In principle, the

scheme was meant to apply to all firms and makes the proposal in this paper appear very

moderate.

Hahn (1989).

8. When sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides react in the atmosphere, they generate sulfuric and

nitric acids that fall back on earth in the form of acid rain. Electric utilities were responsible for 70

per cent of U.S. SO2 emissions in 1985, with the remainder 30 per cent contributed by a wide

variety of much smaller sources, from diesel fuel for transportation to residential and industrial

boilers. Including these smaller sources into the program was quickly judged unfeasible (Joskow

and Schmalensee (1998)).

6. A "unit" is an individual source of emissions; the 263 units whose participation in phase 1 was

mandated belong to 110 separate plants in 22 states, managed by 61 operating companies (some

of which may be subsidiaries of the same parent company). An additional 182 units were

voluntarily brought under the program in phase 1 through incentives created by special provisions.

10. However, if you are thinking of purchasing very small quantities - a birthday present for your

environmentalist niece? - you may need to bid at the annual EPA auction, because the brokers will

not accept too small orders.

11. This was more than a year and a half before utilities had to demonstrate compliance for the

first time.

12. For comparison, the simple case discussed in Section 2 is equivalent to holding the

unweighted sum of the Union's countries deficits below a target level.

13. For example, using as threshold a ratio of debt to GDP of 65 percent, the two groups would

be: Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, as high debt countries; and Austria, Finland,

France, Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and Portugal, as low debt countries.

14. Clauser and Plott find that experiments designed to eliminate this second source of

competition still resulted in competitive prices, suggesting that the first feature may be more

important.

15. In most European exchanges, this dual structure takes the form of a computerized continuous

auction for trades of smaller size, and a quote-driven dealers' market for large trades (Pagano

(1998)). A trading system that protects a trader’s identity is useful because lack of anonymity in

the permits market could create two problems. First, competing countries could collude and

artificially raise (or lower) the price at which transactions take place. At least partly, this difficulty

is mitigated by those features of a double auction that appear to curb collusion. Second, although

governments’ baseline demand for permits will be written in the budget plans, and thus be public

information, revisions during the fiscal year will become known abroad only with a lag. Thus

knowing where sales or purchases of permits originate would transmit information about future

demand and could result in large bid-ask spreads for large players, perceived as insiders.

16. Some existing proprietary trading systems for example provide institutional investors with

direct access to the order book (see Tradepoint in the London market).

17. It may seem at first that the market could be more volatile than the market for bonds, possibly
                                                                                                   46

subject to bubbles and crashes: contrary to bonds, the permits would not have an expiration date

with a fixed redemption value. However the market price of the permits can never exceed 1, and

this is sufficient to rule out the possibility of bubbles.

18. An intriguing question is whether agents - political parties for example - could try to influence

election outcomes by trading in the permits market. Here too, if the market were thick and

competitive there would be no reason why private players should not be allowed to withdraw

permits and establish a record as fiscal hawks, exactly as environmental groups can withdraw

emission permits. More troublesome however would be the possibility that a group may interfere

with a government's fiscal policy by manipulating the price at which the government can trade

permits. Once again the problem exists if the market is thin and manipulable.

19. In the smaller countries, local governments appear almost always as net lenders. All data are

from the OECD National Accounts statistics; the average of expenditure shares is unweighted; the

GDP numbers are at current prices and current exchange rates.

20. The correct dynamic plan depends on whether the target aggregate ceiling for the regulator

includes only deficits, or only debts or both. The Appendix discusses in detail the static case only,

but the optimal dynamic plan could also be characterized (although it could be quite complex

when both deficits and debts are included).

21. Of course, a government can still shift the costs of its fiscal spending on the future

administration by not complying with the program. Two factors though may limit this temptation:

first, the government must be sure to lose the elections, in which case the political gains from

excessive spending would be few; second, the violation would be very visible.

22. The difficulty seems common to all new market-based regulations: Riker and Sened (1991)

discuss identical problems in introducing tradable rights to airport time slots. As in the

environmental case, the final adoption of marketable permits occurred only when the inefficiencies

of the previous system became too large to bear.

A.1. The Basic Case.

  The environmental economic literature claims that an important step forward was made, in

terms of policy influence, when economists accepted that the pollution target would be set

politically, and reduced their ambitions to achieving the best implementation of the political goal.

In other words, attention shifted to the partial equilibrium problem, taking the target as given: the

question then becomes how to allocate the constraint optimally among heterogenous agents. If

every agent is affected negatively by the total level of the externality (be it pollution or

government deficits or an aggregate measure of fiscal instability in EMU), and this total level has

been fixed, the externality effectively becomes a given parameter in the optimization problem.

This is the approach we follow here.

  We begin by considering the simple case where deficits are perceived by the regulator as perfect

substitutes and the policy constraint is a ceiling on total EMU deficit. Call di the government

deficit in country i, evaluated in Euro’s, and D the ceiling on total deficits, also in monetary terms.

The function Ci(di, D) measures the cost to country i of being constrained to a deficit di when the

total deficit is bound by D. Ci(di, D) is a monetary cost, for example the value of foregone

output, or the value of the extra consumption that would make the country welfare-indifferent;

the function differs among countries but is always convex, with a unique minimum at zero at the

unconstrained deficit level di*, implicitly defined by the condition Ci’(di*, D) = 0, where the prime

sign indicates the first derivative.

  Consider first the central planner’s problem. Given the aggregate constraint D the question is

how to allocate it optimally among the various countries, i.e.:
                                                                                                         ii

                           min ∑ Ci (di , D) subject to             ∑d   i   ≤ D
                            {di }
                                    i                               i




which leads to:

                                         − Ci ' ( di CP , D) = λ

                                         ∑d
                                                       cp
                                                   i        ≤ D
                                           i                                                        (A1)

                                         λ ( ∑ di − D ) = 0
                                                            cp

                                               i



where the superscript cp indicates the central planner’s solution and 8 is the Lagrange multiplier

associated with the constraint, or the shadow value of an extra unit of total deficit. The optimal

allocation equalizes the marginal cost of fiscal retrenchment across all countries. If 8 equals zero,

the constraint is not binding, and each country achieves its unconstrained deficit level (dicp = di* œ

i; 3 di* #D); if 8 is positive, each country is bound to a smaller deficit than it would otherwise

choose (dicp < di* œ i;3 dicp =D) and experiences a positive cost.

  Consider now how a market in permits would operate. Each country i is allocated an initial

stock of permits l0i sufficient to cover a deficit level d0 i, and such that the sum of all allotments

equals the aggregate ceiling: 3 d0 i =D. Permits can be bought and sold at price p per unit, and at

the end of the year each country must have sufficient permits to cover its total deficit for the year.

  If di is the final total deficit, not all of this borrowing amounts to resources newly available for

fiscal expenditure: part must cover the cost of acquiring the permits p(di-d0 i). Thus we need to

make a distinction between total borrowing di, and the borrowing of new resources that can be

devoted to the government’s objectives di - p(di-d0 i). We call the latter *i:

                                        δ i ≡ di − p( di − d 0i )                                   (A2)
                                                                                                       iii

  Two observations. First, notice that since 3 d0 i =3 di =D, it follows that 3 *i =3 di =D. All

expenditures in permits purchases are revenues from permits sales, and the aggregate constraint

functions exactly as intended. Second, the final deficit di can be lower than the initial allocation

d0i , implying that some of the permits have been sold and, if the price p is positive, the resources

available for public expenditure in country i have increased by more than di, or *i > di. If no

constraint is set on *i, we allow countries to hold negative stocks of permits (i.e. to create new

permits) in exchange for running a surplus. Because this would not violate the regulator’s ceiling

(all negative holdings of permits must be countered by corresponding fiscal surpluses), there

seems to be no reason to rule the possibility out and (slightly) complicate the analysis.

  The function Ci captures the cost of being constrained in borrowing resources for fiscal

expenditure. Thus Ci is a function of *i: Ci(*i, D). But now the total cost of the program for

country i must include the expenditure in permits, i.e. the extent of new debt incurred in addition

to the amount corresponding directly to new resources. The country’s problem is then:

                  min Ci (δ i , D) + p( di − d 0i ) subject to di = δ i + p(di − d 0i )
                    di



The solution is given by:

                                                      i



       As in the central planner’s case, if 3 di* #D - if the aggregate constraint is not binding - then

p=0, and dim=*im=di*, and no country is constrained. If instead 3 di* >D, then p 0(0,1), and all

countries are constrained: *im<di*, and *im…dim ] dim…d0i. (But recall 3 *im =3 dim =D). As

expected, the price can never equal 1.

  Because all countries face price p for each additional permit, they choose their level of

borrowing so as to equalize their marginal costs of further fiscal contraction. (Notice, for clarity,

       ∂ Ci (δ i , D) ∂ Ci (δ i , D)
that                 =               (1 − p) .) Thus the solution replicates the central planner’s
            ∂ di           ∂δ i


allocation if and only if p/(1-p) = 8. Could p/(1-p) have any other value? Suppose first 8>0,

p/(1-p) > 8. Then *im < dicp œi, and thus 3 *im < 3 dicp =D. Hence

3 *im =3 dim < D. But then p (3 dim -D) < 0, and p cannot be an equilibrium. Suppose then

8>0, p/(1-p) 0 [0, 8). Following the same reasoning, this implies 3 dim > 3 dicp =D, or 3 dim >D

which again violates the equilibrium conditions. Finally suppose 8=0, p > 0. Then 3 dim < 3 dicp

=3 di* # D, or p (3 dim -D) < 0, once more a violation of equilibrium.

  In conclusion, we have established that the market solution is unique and replicates the central

planner’s allocation. Notice that such an allocation is independent of the initial distribution of
                                                                                                           v

permits, an important property in this context: the regulator is not required to have knowledge of

the countries’ cost functions in deciding the initial allotments, and arbitrariness and political

struggles over these allotments do not detract from the efficiency of the final outcome. Not

surprisingly, the assumption of a competitive market is important for these conclusions.



A.2. Debts and Deficits.

   Until now, we have considered all deficits as perfect substitutes. In fact, a regulator may be

more concerned with deficits from countries with higher debt to GDP ratios because they may

trigger a higher probability of default. We extend the analysis to this case.

   If high debt to GDP ratios are sources of potential instability, a plausible loss function for the

regulator is:




                            yi ( hi − h$) 2
                 L=   ∑ i   Y       2
                                                        ∀ i such that hi > h$                       (A5)


where yi is country i’s GDP, Y is the Union’s GDP, hi is the debt to GDP ratio in country i and h

is a specified target. In other words, L is the weighted sum of squared deviations of debt to GDP

ratios from a target, where the weights are the countries’ shares of EMU-wide GDP (to represent

the more serious threat to the system from fiscal insolvency by larger countries).

   Setting h$ =0 for simplicity (with no important implications), the change in this loss function

over a time period is given by:
                                                                                                       vi

                                     ∑hd ∑h      i i
                                                                 2
                                                                i i y
                                                                         ∆ yi ∆ Y                (A6)
                           ∆L =          i
                                                       −   i
                                                                             +    
                                             Y                 2Y        yi    Y 


where, as before, di is country i’s deficit over that time period, and all variables that are not in

increments are dated at the beginning of the period..

    A reasonable objective for the regulator would be to minimize the aggregate cost of fiscal

contraction subject to the constraint that the change in the loss function be smaller than a fixed

threshold, for example that it be non positive, or that it decline over time at a specified pace. The

problem is then:

                             min ∑ Ci (di , Q) subject to ∑ hidi ≤ Q
                             {di }   i                                        i



  Notice that in general the rate of income growth, in any one country and in the Union as a

whole, depends on fiscal policy, and thus Q should be a function of the whole series of deficits: Q

= Q({di}). This complicates matters substantially because it requires a careful estimate of such a

relation. However, if lags are important and the influence of current fiscal deficits on current

income growth is small, we can ignore the dependence of Q on the countries’ deficits and

consider an exogenous ceiling a plausible rule of thumb. The choice of fixed criteria in the

Maastricht Treaty, still viewed as appropriate reference points, suggests that the short-cut may be

a reasonable description of real-world policy objectives. ( It is possible to think of loss functions

that would generate an exogenous ceiling, while still capturing concerns about debt level. For

example, if in (A5) hi were debt per capita, and yi and Y populations in country i and in the Union

respectively, then the corresponding Q would depend on population growth and be unaffected by
                                                                                                         vii

fiscal policy. But such a loss function is of interest only if population is a reasonable proxy for

income, and the approximation chosen above is then more transparent about its possible

limitations).

  The problem becomes minimizing the total costs of fiscal austerity subject to a fixed ceiling on

a weighted sum of public deficits, with the weights given by each country’s debt to GDP ratio.

The solution is:



                                     Ci ' ( di cp , Q) + µ hi = 0
                                     µ (Q −      ∑ hd i

where µ is the Lagrange multiplier corresponding to the constraint. As in the previous analysis,

we can define di** as the unconstrained deficit level in country i, i.e. such that Ci’(di**, Q) = 0. If

Q $3hidi**, then dicp = di** œ i and µ=0. Otherwise, Q =3hidicp, dicp < di** œ i and µ > 0.

   Consider now how the policy can be implemented through a permits market. Each country

receives initial licenses l0i and chooses its deficit under the constraint that final license holdings

must be proportional to the deficit, weighted by its debt to GDP ratio. Once again we need to

distinguish between the net resources that the country borrows, and the part of the deficit that

only amounts to resources used to pay for new licenses. The problem then is:

                           min Ci (δ i , Q) + p(li − l 0i )
                            di
                                      subject to: di = δ i + p(li − l 0i )

  The solution is given by:


                                  Ci ' (δ i m , Q) + µ iβ ihi = 0
                                  p − µ i + µ i βi p = 0
                                  di m = δ i m + p(lim − l0i )                                         (A8)

                                  µ i (li m − β ihidi m ) = 0
                                  li m ≥ β ihidi m ; µ i ≥ 0
where µ i is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the licenses constraint, and the licenses price

  The first two conditions in (A8) imply:

                                                 1 − βi hi p


It is easy to verify that if the factor of proportionality $i is chosen correctly, there is a unique

market equilibrium where p equals µ, the shadow value of the aggregate constraint in the central

planner’s problem, and the allocation exactly replicates the central planner’s allocation. In

particular, we need:
                                                                                                     ix

                                                   1
                                         βi ≡                                                    (A11)
                                                1 + hi p



The purpose of the mechanism is to make countries face different prices for an extra unit of

deficit, depending on their debt to GDP ratios: country i faces the effective price hi p. However,

because part of borrowed resources goes towards payment of the permits, we know that the

number of purchased permits is a multiple of the net resources newly available to the country.

How large a multiple depends in general on the price p, but in this set-up depends on the effective

price hi p. Thus a country with a high debt to GDP ratio is penalized twice, through the higher

effective price for an extra unit of borrowed resources, as it should be, and through a higher

multiplier, requiring larger total borrowing for given net borrowing. This second channel must be

neutralized if we want to replicate the central planner’s allocation - we can achieve this through a

linear parameter, and that is the function of $i.
