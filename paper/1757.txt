        The IIract   of   Induced   Abortion on Birth Outcortes in the   U.S.




                                        ABSTRP2



        This paper   examines the impact of induced abortion on birth out-

cones by treating abortion as an endogenous input into the production of

infant health. To gauge the direct and indirect effect of abortion,

three    measures of infant health are considered simultaneously: the
neonatal sortality rate, the percentage of low-birth weight births, and

the percentage of pretera births. All three are race—specific and all

pertain to large counties in the U.S. in 1977. Because the utilization

of health inputs nay be conditioned on the expected birth outcome,

estimates obtained by two—stage least squares are emphasized. The

results sake clear that abortion is an important determinant of infant

health. This suggests that by reducing the number of unwanted births,

abortion enhances the healthiness of newborns of a given weight and

gestational age, as well as improving the distribution of births among

high—risk groups. Moreover, these direct and indirect effects differ by

race.

       The Impact of Induced Abortion on Birth Outcomes in the U.S.

                              Theodore Joyce*



      Induced abortion has been frequently mentioned as a potential

causal factor in the accelerated decline in neonatal mortality over the

past decade (Eisner et al 1978; Kleinsan et al 1979; David and Seigal

1983). Initial research generally supported the link between increased

use of abortion and improved birth outcomes (Lanan, Kohl, and Bedell

1974; Glass et al 1974; QuIck 1978). However, not untIl Grossman and

Jacobowitz (1981) and Corsan and Grossman (1985) was the impact of

abortion services quantified in a multivariate context. These two

studies   ,   however,   employed a reduced form model and therefore could

only speculate as to the mechanisms through which abortion operated on

infant health.

      The purpose of this paper is to outline the pathways through which

abortion1 impacts on birth outcomes. In particular, to what extent has

the process of fetal selection, made possible by abortion, resulted in

healthier infants of a given birth weight; and to what extent has abor—

 tion iiproved the distribution of of births among high—risk groups and

thereby lowered the Incidence of prematurity?

     In order to address this question, abortion is treated as an en-

dogenous input in a structural model of infant health. Production func-

tions are estimated for three birth outcomes: the race— and county—

specific neonatal mortaitly rate, the percentage of low—birth weight

births, and the percentage of pretera births. Attempts are Made to

control for other determinants of infant health such as prenatal and

neonatal care. The latter has been repeatedly cited as a primary factor

in the increased survivability of premature babies (Paneth et al. 1982;

McCormick 1985). Moreover, recent insights by Roaenzweig and Schultz

(1982,1983a,1983b) with respect to health heterogeneity will also be

incorporated.



                        II. Analytical Framework



     Economic Models of the family developed by Becker and Lewis (1973)

and Willis (1973) have been used by numerous authors to study theoreti-

cally and empirically the determinants of birth outcomes. (Grossman and

Jacobowltz 1981; Rosenzweig and Schultz 1982,1983a,1983b; Lewit 1983;

Corman and Grossman 1985) Accordingly, I assume that the parents'

utility function depends on their own consumption, the number of births

and the health of each child at birth. Moveover, the infant health

production function depends on the quality and quantity of Medical care,

the own time of the mother, nutritional intake, and the Mother's

reproductive efficiency. The latter factor includes an unobserved

genetic component which affects an infant's health and survivability at

birth as well as other aspects of a Mother's efficiency in household


                                   2
 production.

       Naxisization of the utility function subject to the production and

 resource constraints generates a desand function for infant health. The

 interaction between the desand and production of infant health spawns

 the derived desanda for aedical care and the other inputs.

       To clarify the preceeding ideas and to lay the foundation for the

eapirical isplesentation, the basic sodel can be written as follows:

                d=f1 (n,aa,c,b,z,e)           (1)

                                              (2)


               gf3(a,a,c,s,r,z,e)             (3)


               r=f4(a,c,x,ze)                 (4)

               fl,a,a,c,s=f(p,yx,ze)          (5)—(9)


      The probability that an infant's health deteriorates to the point

that he/she does not survive the first aonth of life is represented by

equation (1). Equations (2) and (3) give the likelihood that a newborn

is of low weight (less than 2,500 grass or 5.5 pounds) or pretera (less

than 37 weeks gestation) respectively. The basic set of inputs used in

the production of infant health are neonatal intensive care (n),   prena-

tal care (a), abortion (a), organized fasily planning use (C), and

asoking (a). 2 is a seasure of environsental conditions and e is an

unobserved genetic coaponent specific to each faaily and which is hence-

forth refered to as an infant's endowed health. Equation (4) shows the

deterninants of the endogenous risk factor which in this sodel is the

probability that a baby is born to a wonan less than 20 or older than 39




 2
     Other endogenous risk factors include the spacing between births,
     narita]. status, parity, and education attainsent. The rationale for
     choosing age as opposed to the others is given in Section III.

years of age.2 X is a desographic measure that deteraines the age of a

iother at the tise of   birth.
     Equations (1)-(4) are the production functions and they constitute

the structural equations of the sodel. Equations (5)-(9) are the input

desand functions for they relate the use of an input to its price and

availability (p), incose and resource constraints (y), and the other

exogenous deterainants aentioned previously.

    The eapirical focus is on equations (1)—(3) which give the direct

or risk—specific effect of an input on a particular birth outcose. To

assess the indirect effect of an input on a specific aspect of infant

health the right—hand-side birth outcose in each structural equation is

replaced by its endogenous deterainants.3 Specifically, substituting

equation (4) into (3), equations (3) and (4) into equation (2), and

equations (2), (3), and (4) into equation (1) yields what will be

refered to in this paper as the quasi—structural equations:


                                                 (10)
             d=f10(n,a,c,a,s,x,z,e)

             b=f11 (a,c,a,s,x,z,e)               (11)

                                                 (12)


    Although the sodel baa aeaningful interpretations at the fasily




   To clarify the notion of a direct and indirect effect consider the
   following sodel

   where b is birth weight, g is gestational age and X is an input such
   as prenatal care. The direct effect of prenatal care on birth weight
   is a1. The indirect effect, c1a2, is obtained by substituting for g
   in the birth weight equation.

level, the espirica]. analysis pertains to county-level data. The only

variables whose roles are expected to be altered by aggregation are

abortion and fasily planning. The difference arises because the ispact

of abortion and fasily planning cannot be directly incorporated into a

production function of   infant   health based on a sasple of individual

births.

      Conceptually, the expanded use of abortion and fasily planning have

enabled individuals to sore effectively plan the nusber and tising of

their offapr1ng The choice of whether to give bIrth or not has created

a potentially significant self—selection probles. The issue is analogous

to the sore cossonly cited exasplea of self—selection found in the

literature (Haddala, 1977). Specifically, the neonatal sortality rate

based on a sasple of wosen who choose to give birth say understate the

neonatal sortality rate that would prevail if all pregnant wosen tried

to carry to ters.4

      To adiuat for selectivity bias at the individual level,5 Hecksan's

two-stage procedure could be applied to a chort of wosen observed fros

     The fact that in 1977 the abortion rate for whites and non—whites
     was 20 and 59 respectively, and the abortion ratio was 333 and 679
     respectively suggest that the sagnitude of the self—selectivity bias
     say be substantial. The abortion rate is the nusber of abortions per
     wosen ages 15—44 while the abortion ratio is the nusber of abortions
     per thousand live births (Statistical Abstract of the United !!'
     1984).

     The selectivity effect described in this exasple refers to the bias
     caused by abortion. To correct for the potential self—selection due
     to contraception, It would be necessary to have data on a cohort of
     sexually active women observed over their reproductive cycle——a far
     sore demanding data requirement than is needed to measure the self—
     selection generated by aboriton.
 6
     This geographical restriction     insures   that   the   price   and
     availability of abortion is relatively equal for most women.

conception arid living in the aae county or metropolitan area.6 A saMple

selection criterion could be established predicting the probability of

not obtaining an abortion. Given all the necessary assuaptions, the

appropriate adjustaent factor (the inverse of the fill's ratio) could be

eatiated and entered into the structural equation as a right—hand—side

variable.7

     At the aggregate level, the selectivity effect of abortion can be

controlled for directly in the production function. Since the abortion

rate aeaaures the probability that a wosan between the ages of 15 and 44

will voluntarily terainate a pregnancy, it can be viewed as an indicator

of the extent to which unwanted births have been averted. Counties in

states which offer relatively greater financing and accessibility to

abortion should have a higher abortion rate and thus, fewer unwanted

births than counties in which abortion is less readily available. All

else equal, this should iMprove the distribution of births aaong high-

risk groups (Sklar and Berkov 1973; Shelton 1977; Brann 1979) and lower

the incidence of preaaturity and neonatal aortality.

     In addition, the use of abortion and contraception aay be as-

sociated with the frequently cited iaproveient in birth weight—specific

*ortality (Kleiaan et a]. 1979; Lee et a]. 1980; Williaits and Chen 1983).

As noted above, advances in perinatal and neonatal care have undoubtedly

played a aaor role in the delcine of birth weight—specific neonatal



   Besides coputationa1 ease, the advantage of }Iechman's procedure
   over direct naxiization of the appropriate liklihood function is
   the useful interpretation of the ad)uat*ent factor. Given that the
   inverse of the fill's ratio is a "monotone decreasing function of
   the probability that an observation is selected into the sample"
   (Heckian p. 156), it could be interpreted as the probability of not
   obtaining an abortion, and as such, could be considered a aeasure of
   the "wantedneas" of a birth (Joyce 1985).

 sortality. However, newborns of a given weight say also be healthier

 because less healthy fetuses are aborted and because births that are

 better planned say be sore wanted (Tietze 1984; NCHS 1985).



                         III. Espirical Isplesentation



A. Data and Measuresent of Variables


       Race—specific data on births by weight, gestational age and

sother's age froa 1976 through 1978 are fros the National Center for

Health Statistics (NCHS) Natality Tape. Neonatal deaths over the sase

period are Eros the NCHS Mortality Tape. Socioeconosic characteristics

are taken fros the Census of Population, and eatisates on asoking are

fros Eugene Lewit       of   the National Bureau of Econosic Research.     Data   on

neonatal intensive care      are fros   the Aserican Hospital Association and

fros    Roan Planning    Association of Rosa Labratories (1982). Inforsation

relating to Lasily planning and abortion are Eros the Alan Guttsacher

Institute. Finally, seasures pertaining           to   the services and   prograas
used   in the reduced fors input desand       equations are    I roa Corsan and
Groassan    (1985).
       Counties are used as the unit of observation instead of states or
SNSA'a because they are sore hosogenous with respect to socioeconosic
characteristics and sedica]. resources. However,         asall counties present

two potential probleas: first, people say travel outside the county for
sedical services and second, sparsely populated counties with few births
say    show large fluctuations in birth outcoses due to randos sovesents.

To sinisize these difficulties, only counties with a 1970 population of

50,000 or   sore in   states that reported gestational age on birth certif i—



                                          7
catea are included in the sample. For the black sample there is an

additional criterion of at least 5,000 blacks in the county. There are

632 counties in the white regressions and 327 counties in the black

regressions. Both samples account for approximately 72 percent of the

total U.S. white and black populations.

       Three measures of infant health are analyzed: the neonatal mor-

tality rate, the percentage of low—birth weight births, and the percent-

age of births for which geatational age is less than 37 weeks. All are

race—specific and all are three—year averages centered on 1977.8 The

interrelationships among the three birth outcomes are well—documented.9

For instance, light births are 40 times more likely to die in the first

month of life than normal weight infants and approximately 50 percent of

low-birth weight births are preteri.

       Table 1 contains a description of the dependent and independent

varibles used in the estimation of the three structural and three quasi—

structural birth outcome production functions. Table 2 displays their

means and standard deviations. The availablity and resource measures

used in the reduced for, input demand equations are described in the

Appendix. Except for the abortion rate, neonatal intensive care, and per

capita smoking, all variables in the structural model are race- and

county—specific.

       The five basic inputs used in the production of infant health are

neonatal intensive use, prenatal care use, the abortion rate, the use of

      counties with few infant deaths.

fasily planning clinics by teenagers, and adult per capita smoking.

Except for smoking, all the inputs should be negatively related to the

measures of infant health descirbed above.

       This   study   focuses on teenage family planning use as opposed to the

utilization of family planning clinics by all women of childbearing age

for several reasons)° First, only the former measure is race—specific.

Second, teenagers are disproportionate users of family planning clinics

(Torrea and Forrest 1983). Third, adolescent births and births to un—

married       teenagers    have   well—documented, above average risks of

prematurity and neonatal mortality (Taffel 1980; Elater 1984). Moreover,

Forrest (1981) reports that for every ten adolescents enrolled in family

planning clinics in 1975, three pregnancies were averted the following

year. Consequently, measures of infant health say be sore sensitive to

orgnaized teenage family planning use than to variations in use by all
         11
women.

       The smoking variable is taken from Lewit (1982) who estimated it

from a micro—level study of the demand for cigarettes (Lewit and Coate

1982). Lewit applied the coefficients of the fitted demand functions to

state means of the independent variables to arrive at the figures used



 10
      The Alan Guttmacher Institute provided the data on teenage family
      planning use. Their estimates were adjusted to compensate for cross—
      county utilization. However, in 26 counties measuring nonwhite use
      and in 2 counties measuring white use the figures appeared abnor-
      mally high (above 50 percent or greater than 2.5 standard deviations
      from the mean ad)usted for the outliers). In these cases the state
      mean was substituted.

      Work by Conan, Joyce and Grossman (1985) found that when organized
      family planning use by teenagers, and orgnaized family planning use
      by all women ages 15 to 44 were entered as separate variables in a
      regression predicting neonatal mortality, the measure of adolescents
      use always had the correct sign and consistently dominated the
      broader indicator of organized family planning use.



                                         12
 here. The advantage of Lewit's variable over the readily-available tax-

 paid sales per state is that his measure ad3uats for the substantial

 "bootlegging of cigarettes at both the individual and group level.

 Because of this smuggling, data from tax—paid sales underestimate con-

 sumption in high—tax states and overestimate it in low—tax states.

      The endogenous risk factor (r) present in the gestations]. age

 production function (equation 3) is represented by the three—year

average of births to women less than 20 or greater than 39 years of age.

The risk of prematurity among women at both ends of the age spectrum are

well—documented (Institute of fledicine, 1985). Furthermore, births to

women in these age groups are correlated with other risk factors such as

out—of—wedlock births, births to women with low levels of education and

births of high parity. For instance, 28 percent of white teenagers and

83 percent of black teenagers who gave birth in 1977 were unmarried

(Ventura, 1984).

     Two points concerning the use of this risk factor deserve mention.

First, using age alone, instead of including the other risk factors

cited above, is preferable for several reasons. There is a substantial

overlap between age and the other socio—demographic characteristics and

therefore, the multicollinearity generated by endogenizing such highly

correlated risk factors is likely to be substantial. Furthermore, by

1978, eight states including New York, California and Texas did not

report marital status on birth certificates. Consequently, inclusion of

that variable would have reduced the sample size substantially.

     Second, the model assumes   that    the percentage of births to women in

these age groups impacts on birth weight and neonatal mortality only

indirectly. This is necessary in order to identify the system of atruc—

tural equations (1)—(3). This restriction does not affect the estimated


                                        13
total effect of an input on inf ant health. However, to the extent that

this and other risk factors iipact on sortality and low birth weight

independent of the relevant interaediate birth outcose, the direct

effect of an input aay be overstated.

      The natural logariths of the population density and the ratio of

wosen ages 15 to 19 and 40 to 44 over the total nuaber of wosen 15 to 44

constitute the environaental (z) and the exogenous risk (x) coaponenta

respectively. The foraer aay pick—up the possible iapact of pollution or

stress fros overcrowdlng on Infant health (Lava and Seakln 1973; Bak-

keteig et al 1984) . The ratio of young and old woaen to total woaen of

childbearing ages should vary directly with the percentage of births in

these high-risk age groups and hence, vary inversely with infant health.


B. Estiaation


      Following Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982,1983a,1983b), it is an-

ticipated that the residuals in the structural equations will be corre—
                                12
lated with the health inputs.        This expectation is based on the assuMp-

tion that individuals have aoae inforaation concerning their genetic

health endowaent which is unknown to the researcher but which causes the

parents to alter their behavior with respect to their use of inputs. For

exaaple, ultrasound and aaniocenteais are very direct aethoda of obtain-

ing inforaation concerning the health of the fetus. Responses to such

inforiation range froa abortion to aore intensified prenatal and perina—



12
     The notion that an unobserved input asy cause the coefficients of an
     estiaated production function to be biased and inconsistent has long
     been a part of the literature on the eatiaation of production func—
     tiona (Mundlak and Hoch 1965). In his aeainal work on health produc-
     tion functions, Groaaaan (1972) also noted the danger of assuming
     the inputs to be uncorrelated with error term.



                                       14
tal care. Such resedial behavior say create a correlation between the

use of the health inputs and the unobserved endownent tern inbedded in

the residuals. In short, the use of health inputs say not only affect

the birth outcose, but the anticipated birth outcone say also affect

utilization. Because of the potential reverse causality, ordinary least

squares say yield biased and inconsistent eatinatea.

       To test whether a significant correlation between the production

function residuals and the health inputs does exist, Wu's T2 statistic

(Wu 1973) as described by Nakanura and Nakasura (1981) will be applied.

If the null hypothesis of zero correlation between the error tern and

the regressors is re)ected, then two—stage least squares (TSLS) will be

used to eatisate the birth outcone production functions. In the first

stage, fanily planning, abortion, neonatal intensive care and prenatal

care will be regressed on the set of reduced form determinants described

in the kppendix.3 They include      seanures   of fesale schooling, female

poverty levels, the proportion of high-risk women, l4edicaid and AFDC

benefits, population density, as       well as availability neasurea for
neonatal and prenatal care, abortion and organized Lanily planning. The

underlying assumption of this two—stage procedure is that the resource

and   availability   neasurea vary independently of the health endowment.

       It is anticipated, however, that the correlation between the

residuals and the health inputs will be reduced by holding constant the




 13
      Cigarette smoking is also endogenous but it excluded from the first
      stage becuase the measure used is already a predicted value gener-
      ated from a micro reduced form demand function for cigarettes.
      Technically, this procedure amounts to assuming that the quantity of
      cigarettes conauned depends only on the predictors employed by Lewit
      (income, price, education, age, sex and race) and not on the
      availability measures of the other inputs.



                                      15
percentage of low-birth weight births, preters births, and births to

young and old woien In the estimation of equations (1)—(3). This should

occur because each of these variables *ay be an effective proxy for the

health endowsent. £xaiination of the Wu statistic should offer evidence

to this effect. For instance, if the percentage of low—birth weight

births adequately controls for the health endowaent in the neonatal

aortality equation, then barring other loris of iiaspecification, the Wu

statistic should indicate no significant correlation between the error

ters and the rlgh—hand-alde health Inputs.

     Finally, the infant health production functions are assuied to be

linear. All regressions are weighted by the race—specific nuaber of

births between 1976 and 1978. Work by Joyce (1985) with aiiilar data

found that a Cobb—Douglas and logistic functional fori generated results

that differed little qualitatively.

clinics, abortion providers and hospitals with neonatal intensive care

unite are strongly associated with increased faaily planning use by

teenagers, the abortion rate and the nuaber of days in a neonatal inten-

sive care unit per birth respectively. In short, the own shadow price

effects are as hypothesized. This is a noteworthy result for it rein-

forces the notion that accessibility to cedical services, the fees for

which are often covered by insurance, plays a iaor role in the utiliza-

tion of these resources.

     Turning to the estisated production functions, the total effect of

abortion on race—specific birth outcosea in the quasi—structural regres-

sions is negative and significant in every case, regardless of whether

the estisates were obtained by OLS or TSLS. However, since the null

hypothesis of zero correlation between the inputs and the error tera is

never accepted, this   discussion   will concentrate on the TSLS results.

The differences between the OLS and TSLS estisates are considered below.

     In general, the coefficient of abortion is approxisately two tisea

greater for blacks than it is for whites. This underscores the ispor—

tance of eatisating race—specific infant health production functions

whenever possible. Moreover, these results support the conclusions

reached by Corean and Grossean (1985) fros their reduced fore eatisates

as to the significance of abortion for neonatal aortality.

     A coaparison of the estisated structural and quasi—structural

equations (Tables 3 and 4) sets forths the direct and indirect effect of

abortion on infant health. For exasple, coaparing regressions 3—2 and 3—

8 with 4—2 and 4—8 reveals that the abortion coefficient falls by 63

percent in the case of whites and 48 in case of blacks when the percent-

age of low-birth weight births is held constant in the neonatal sor—

tality equation. Nevertheless, for both races the risk—specific effect


                                      19
of abortion rewains significant at the .05 level for a one-tailed test.

This suggests that the process of fetal selection encouraged by abortion

way serve to isprove the survivability of risk-specific births as well

as reducing the incidence of presaturity.

       A notable result is that the direct effect of abortion on black

neonatal wortality (—.081) is greater than its indirect effect through

prewaturity (_.068).14 Furtherwore, the direct effect is obtained frow a

specification that controls for the percentage of low-birth weight

births, the aoat iwportant predictor of newborn survivability (Institute

of Medicine 1985). One possible explanation is that perinatal and neona-

tal care are incospletely weasured. As Corsan and Grosswan (1985) point

out, the increased availability of abortion lowers the coat of fertility

control, increases the relative cost of a birth and enhances the

resources devoted to each birth. Given the link between increased use

and availability (see Appendix), the utilization of abortion way be

correlated not only to the quantity, but also the quality of perinatal

and neonatal care. Measures for the latter are lacking. A wore specula-

tive explanation for the sizeable direct effect of abortion is that

better planned births way be wore wanted." Data showing that black

births have experienced the greatest increase in "wantedness" is coinci-

dent with this result (NCHS 1985).

       The iwpact of abortion on low—weight and pretera births also dif-

fers by race. In the case of whites, the abortion coefficient in the

low—birth weight equation falls but rewains significant at the .01 level

      The direct effect ia weasured by the coefficient of abortion in
      regression 3—2; the total effect is frow the abortion coefficient in
      regression 4—2; the indirect effect is obtained frow subtracting the
      forwer frow the latter.



                                     20
 when the percentage of preterm births is held constant (regression 3—4

 versus 4—4). However, controlling for the percentage of births to young

 and old women completely eliminates the effect of abortion on preterm

births (regressions 3—6 versus 4—6). Clearly, then, one means by which

abortions improves infant health is by shifting the age distribution of

births.

     The results are reversed with respect to blacks. It is evident from

comparing regressions 3—10 and 4—10 that abortion has no effect on low

birth weight holding the percentage of preterm births constant; yet,

unlike in the white preterm regressions, the effect of abortion falls by

only twenty—aix percent and remains significant at the .01 level when

the percentage of births to women in high—risk age categories is in-

cluded (regressions 3—12 versus 4—12). Put differently, abortion use by

whites lowers the percentage of full—term light births, while abortion

use by blacks lowers the percentage of premature light births. Full—term

light infants, it should be noted, are likely to have congenital defects

and life—long health problems (Beck and van der Berg 1975). Thus, these

results imply that white women have a greater propensity to identify and

abort defective fetuses than black women. Blacks on the other hand, may

use abortion primarily as a substitute for other forms of contraception

thus lessening the link between abortion and fetal selection. Further

evidence for this explanation is the fact that the black abortion rate

that Is almost triple the white rate.

    Organized teenage family planning use operates inconsistently. For

both blacks and whites its effect on neonatal mortality increases in

absolute value and becomes significant when the percentage of low-birth

weight births is held constant. Its coefficient is insignificant and

often positive in the other birth outcome equations. One explanation is


                                  21
that a high percentage of teenage users nay be indicative of a rela-

tively high proportion of sexually active adolescents. Even if fanily

planning use is effective in preventing pregnancies anong users, the

proportion of teens who give birth nay still be greater than in counties

where both adolescent sexual activity and orgnaized fanily planning use

are relatively less. A better neasure night be the ratio of teenage

users to the nunber of sexually active teens. Unfortunately, such data

is unavailable.

teenage fanily planning use nay reflect the fact that high—use counties
nay be indicative of users that have been integrated into a network of

prenatal and perinatal care. For exanple, Chaine et al (1982) note that

clinics in counties that serve a relatively large proportion of teens at

risk of beconing pregnant tend to provide additional services such aa

prenatal care. In short, although births to these young wonen are nore

likely to be problenatic, they nay also receive better care, and thus

their offspring nay have a higher probability of survival.

     Estinatea iron the quasi—structural regressions leave little doubt

as to the positive correlation between early initiation of                                  prenatal         care

and infant health. Whether this reflects the importance of nedical

intervention or is due to the unobservable set of characteristics as-

sociated with a self—selected group of wonen for whom early prenatal

care is but one expression of healthy behavior cannot be deternined from

the data. The results do indicate that for blacks, the direct effect of

prenatal care on the prevention of low birth weight is statistically

zero (regression 3—10) and that the improvement in infant health as-

sociated with early care is derived from prolonged gestation (regression

3—12). This is consistent with Harris' (1982) findings based on a sample


                                                    22
 of black births in flaaaacusetts between 1975 and 1976. For whites, the

 coefficient of prenatal care in the estisated structural equation of low

 birth weight is significant at the .01 level (regression 3—4). A sig-

 nificant direct effect of prenatal care on birth weight is frequently

cited in the literature (Rosenzweig and Schultz 1983b; Lewit 1983;

Showstack et al 1984).

     The relationship between neonatal intensive care and an increased

likelihood of survival is confined by the data (regressions 3—2, and 3—

8). Since neonatal intensive care use is deterained by birth weight, the

results fros the structural equations are esphaaized. Stated dif-

ferently, the indirect effect of neonatal intensive care is zero.

However, replacing low birth weight with its endogenous detersinants,

and using instrusenta]. variable techniques to correct for the correla-

tion between neonatal intensive use and the disturbance tern should

yield a coefficient that is equivalent to the one obtained by the

specification including birth weight. As a seans of gauging the statis-

tical difference between the neonatal intensive coefficients fros the

two specifications, it was assused the coefficients fros the regreasiona

including birth weight (regressions 3—2 and 3-8) were the true popula-

tion paraseters. Thus, it was tested whether the neonatal intensive care

coefficients fros the equations excluding birth weight (regressions 4—2

and 4—8) differed significantly fros these "true" estisatea. The null

hypothesis of no difference was easily accepted. The t—statiatics were

1.06 and .30 for whites and blacks respectively.

     As aniticipated, asoking is inversely related to infant health. The

results for whites are congruent with the frequently reported finding

(Meyer et al 1976; Institute of Medicine 1985) of a significant

deleterious effect of saterna]. sioking on birth weight (regresaiona 4—


                                  23
4). Even when the percentage of preterm birth is held constant in the

equation predicting low birth weight, the coefficient of smoking remains

significant at the .01 level (regression 3—4). In the case of blacks,

the results are less convincing. Only once does the smoking coefficient

in a birth outcome equation have a t—ratio greater than two (regression

3—12). The lack of a consistently significant effect between smoking and

black infant health may result from the fact that the smoking measure is

neither race— nor sex-specific.

     As mentioned in the introduction, the decline ifl the U.S. neonatal

mortality rate over the past decade has been largely attributed to

advances in the management of newborn care (Kleiman et al 1979; Lee et

al 1980; David and Siegal 1983) . However, in all these studies the
relative contribution of abortion to the increased healthiness of new-

borns has not been calculated. Therefore, to compare the importance of

abortion and neonatal intensive care use on early infant deaths, the

percentage change in the neonatal mortality rate given a one percent

increase in each of these inputs was computed.15

     Because the decline in neonatal mortality has been primarily an

improvement in birth—weight specific survivability, coefficients from

the structural equations (regressions 3—2 and 3—8) were used to calcu-

late the elasticities. For both races, reductions in the neonatal mor-

tality rate are more responsive to changes in neonatal intensive care



    A potential problem with such an exercise is that an increase in
    abortion use resulting from a change in the availability of abortion
    may, for example, cause the use of family planning clinics to fall.
    In short, these computations do not provide reduced form effects
    that are required to evaluate the potential impact of alternative
    policies to lower neonatal mortality rates. Despite these shortcom-
    ings, they do reflect the benefits of expanding the use of one input
    while holding the others constant, and thus, offer insights as to
    relative effects.


                                  24
use. The   elasticity   is -.095 for whites and —.170 for blacks. The cor-

responding sagnitudea for a one percent change in the abortion rate are

—.066 and —.012 respectively. The finding that abortion has two—thirds

the iapact of neonatal intensive care on infant deaths is qualified by

the effect of abortion on preaaturity. Specifically, including the

reduction in low—weight and pretera births brought about by a one per-

cent increase in the abortion rate raises the abortion elasticity to

—.181 and —.228 for whites and blacks respectively. Both are larger than

the corresponding neonatal intensive care elasticities.

     These results should be interpreted with sose caution. First, the

nuaber of inpatient days in a Level II or Level III neonatal intensive

care hospital is one seasure of the sanagesent of high—risk births. The

increase in cesarean sections, for exaiple, has been associated with

significant gains in perinatal survivability aaong infants weighing 2000

graas of less (Williaaa and Chen 1983). Second, the indirect effect of

abortion on sortality via presaturity iay be overstated due to the

restriction that such risk factors as age, aarital status, and parity

i*pact on birth weight only through gestation.

     Nevertheless, the relative sagnitude of the risk—specific response

of neonatal aortality to changes in the abortion rate is an laportant

finding. What cannot be overeaphasized is that this result is obtained

while holding constant the percentage of low-birth weight births. As

aentioned above, there is overwhelaing evidence that low birth weight is

the soat isportant predictor of neonatal sortality. Moreover, these

results are very ai*ilar to the rankings obtained froa Cor.an and

Grosaaan'a (1985) reduced fora eatiaates.

8. Health Endowaent Effects on Input Utilization



     As discussed previously OLS aay produce biased and inconsistent

eatiates if the correlation between the health inputs and the residuals

is not corrected. Coaparison of the quasi—structural eatiaatea (Table 4)

obtained by OLS as opposed to TSLS supports this hypothesis. For in-

stance, the TSLS prenatal care coefficient in Table 4 is at least two

tiaes greater than it OLS counterpart for both races in all three birth

outcoaes. The 1pact of neonatal IntensIve care on neonatal aortallty

increased by a factor of four when estiaated by TSLS. Although this

difference is not as great with respect to the abortion coefficient, OLS

consistently yields a saslier effect of abortion on inf ant health.

     Making the aae coparIaons with the structural equations (Table 3)

shows a aore inconsistent pattern. This is in line with the contention

of Coraan, Joyce and GrossMan (1985) that controlling for the relevant

birth outcoaes and endogenous risk factors aay be an effective proxy for

the endowient ten. Although the Wu test indicates that a correlation

between the health inputs and the residuals persists in the structural

equations, this could be caused by any bra of aisapecification such as

an incorrect functional fora or soae other oaaitted variable. Moreover,

the Wu statistic in the structural equations is half the aagnitude of

its quasi—structural counterpart in five of six instances. This suggest

that when controlling for the appropriate interaediate birth outcoae,

the tradeoff between efficiency and consistency becoaes aore difficult

to evaluate.

     As further evidence that the use of health inputs is conditioned in

part, on the unobserved health endowaent iabedded in the error tera,

Roaenzweig and Schultz (1983b) regressed each input on the residuals


                                   26
fros the equation predicting birth weight. Their results were consistent

with the interpretation that wosen desand aore prenatal care, for cx—

asple, based on the expectation of   a    potentially adverse birth outcose.

     A sisilar procedure was followed here. However, instead of using

the residuals froa one equation, each health input was regressed on the

first principal coaponent extracted froa the three sets of residuals

obtained frog the structural equations of aortality, birth weight, and

gestation. The sase regressions were then reestisated, but the first

principal coaponent extracted fros the residuals of the the quasi—

structural equations was used instead.

     The ob)ective was two-fold: first, to see whether the results

obtained by Rosenzweig and Schultz could be duplicated at the county—

level; and second, to coapare the regression results using the principal

coaponent fros the structural equation residuals as the explanatory

variable with the results fros using the principal coaponent obtained

Ira. the quasi—structural residuals. If the percentage of low—birth

weight births in the .ortality equation, the percentage of pretera

births in the birth weight equation, and the percentage of births to

high—risk woaen in the gestation equation are effecitve proxies for the

health endowsent, then one should see little evidence of resedial be-

havior when the health inputs are regressed on the principal coaponent

extracted fro. the residuals of the structural equations.

    Principal coaponenta seesed an i.proveaent over using the residuals

fro. one equation. If the three equations are reasonably well—specified,

then the eleaent that explains the greatest portion of the variance in

the all three residual series should be the health endow.ent.16 Further—

aore, since only the sign and statistical significance of the relation-

ship between the principal coaponent and the health inputs is relevant,


                                     27
the fact that the residuals are in different units is not a problem.

      The results are presented in Table 5. Use of the endowment measure

estimated from the quasi—structural residuals supports the conclusions

reach by Roaenzweig and Schultz (1983b). In particular, counties in

which the probability of an adverse outcome is higher than predicted

evidence greater utilization of prenatal and neonatal care. This holds

for whites and blacks. The same is true for abortion but only in the

case of blacks is the effect significant. The result that organized

teenage family planning use iS lower when the probability of an adverse

outcome is higher than expected may be due to the same factors outlined

previously for its inconsistent impact on infant health.

      There is little evidence of remedial behavior on the part of preg-

nant women when the same inputs are regressed on the endowment measure

constructed from the residuals of the structural equations. This is

interpreted as support for the use of the relevant intermediate birth

outcome as a proxy for the aggregate health endowment. Moreover, the

percentage of variance accounted for by the first principal component

falls substantially when the residuals from the structural equations are

used. This is also consistent with the interpretation that the endowment

is effectively controled for in the structural equations.




16
     If the residual from only one series were used, like those from the
     mortality equation, there is a greater liklihood that an omitted
     variable, such as the quality of care at delivery, may dominate the
     effect of the endowment. However, since the quality of care at
     delivery is not a determinant of birth weight, or gestational age,
     there will be less of a likelihood that a potential omitted variable
     common to all three birth outcomes will dominate the variation in
     the health endowment.

     The results fros this study underscore the need to incorporate the

effect of induced abortion in exasining the detersinants of birth out—

cases. Although the reported association between abortion and Infant

health needs to be exasined at the Individual level, this study becoses

part of a growing body of literature confining this association in both

a reduced fors (Grosasan and Jacobowitz 1981; Conan and Groassan 1985)

as well structural sodel of infant health. Furthersore, a blueprint now

exist for pursuing this research with individual births.

     There is growing speculation that the benefits of neonatal technol-

ogy say be reaching the point of disinishing returns (McCorsick 1985).

Consequently, if the U.S. is to sustain the rate of decline in early

infant deaths that It has enjoyed over the past twenty years, greater

esphasis will have to placed on lowering the incidence of prematurity.

The findings from this study support the contention that by preventing

unwanted births, abortion reduces the percentage of preters and low—

weight infants. Few would argue that averting unintended pregnancies is

the most preferable strategy for reducing unwanted births. However, the

dramatic rise in deliveries to unmarried teenagers over the past decade

must be addressed if substantial gains are to be made in lowering the

incidence of prematurity. Unless dramatic changes occur in teenage

sexual activity, or contraceptive use among adolescents increases sig-

nificantly, abortion will remain an important option for many pregnant

women. According to the estimates from this study, legislative attempts

to ban abortion would have a negative impact of birth outcomes.

    Finally, the results from the quasi—structural regressions also

support the proposition of Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982, 1983b) that the


                                   30
correlation between the health inputs and the unobserved endowsent tern

tends to iaak the effect of the behavioral inputs on infant health. This

source of bias say becose increasing sore laportant with respect to

abortion as rapidly advancing techniques of prenatal diagnosis, such as

asniocentesia, enjoy sore widespread utilization. Such procedures dras—

tically enhance the inforsation known to parents concerning the health

of the fetus. Decisions to abort, based on this knowledge, augient the

process of fetal selection and increase the correlation between the use

of abortion and the endowsent tera

                          Notes to Table A—i



aAfl asterisk (*) next to a variable means that it is race—specific. All
variables are calculated for counties unless otherwise specified.

bVariable is available for nonblacks and blacks as opposed to whites and
blacks

CVariable is available for whites and nonwhites as opposed to whites and
blacks

dince the numerator of this variable is not race—specific, the denominator also
is not race—specific. The denominator is obtained by applying the race—specific
percentage of women aged 15—44 with family income less than 200 percent of the
poverty level in 1980 to the race—specific number of all women aged 15—44 in 1975.
