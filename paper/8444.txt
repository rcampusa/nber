       A key question for understanding the long-run impact of welfare reform policies is

whether welfare leavers can anticipate rapid wage growth, or whether their labor market

opportunities will improve only modestly over time (see, e.g., the review by Gottschalk, 2000.)

This concern is especially relevant for reforms targeted at long-term recipients, who often lack

the skills to obtain higher-wage jobs when they first re-enter the labor market. The Self

Sufficiency Program (SSP), an experimental welfare reform begun in the mid-1990s in two

Canadian provinces, offers a striking illustration of the issues. SSP provides an earnings subsidy

for up to three years to long-term recipients who leave welfare and enter full-time work. The

subsidy reduces welfare participation and raises employment: within15 months, the employment

rate of single mothers who are offered the supplement is 10-15 percentage points higher than the

rate of a randomly-assigned control group (Lin et al, 1998). Nevertheless, the wages associated

with these jobs are low. Two-thirds of those who entered work because of the SSP supplement

were earning within $1 of the minimum wage. In the absence of significant wage growth, many

of those who were induced to work by SSP may return to welfare when their supplement

payments end.

       In this paper we present estimates of the rate of wage growth experienced by former

welfare recipients who were induced to work by SSP. A key feature of SSP is that it is being

evaluated by a randomized design: one half of a sample of long-term welfare recipients (the

treatment group) was offered the earnings supplement while the other half was not. Despite the

presence of a true control group, a serious methodological issue arises because wages are only

observed for those who work. Thus, it is impossible to compare average wage growth for
                                                   2

everyone in the SSP treatment group to average wage growth for everyone in the control group.1

Moreover, since SSP leads some people to find jobs who would not be working in the absence of

the program, workers in the treatment group are more disadvantaged than workers in the control

group. Because of these issues, we narrow our focus to the problem of estimating wage growth

conditional on having been induced to enter work. Even this measure of wage growth is only

partially observed since some of those who enter work in response to the program incentive do

not continue working.

        In Section I we propose a simple procedure for estimating the rate of wage growth for

members of the SSP treatment group who were induced to enter work by the financial incentives

of the program. Under a restrictive but testable assumption -- namely, that the program has no

effect on wage growth for those who would have been working in its absence -- we show that we

can in principle measure the rate of wage growth for the induced treatment group. If the program

affects wage growth of people who would have been working in its absence, the relative growth

rate of wages for the induced group can still be identified provided that there is a subgroup of the

experimental population whose employment rates are unaffected by the program. A final

problem is potential selectivity bias arising from the fact that wage growth can only be measured

for those who are working at some initial point and at some later date. We show how standard

econometric methods can be used to reduce or eliminate this bias.

        In Section II we analyze wage growth among welfare leavers in the SSP demonstration.

Comparisons of the those who were induced to start working by SSP versus others who would

    A similar problem arising in analyzing the effect of training programs on the duration of employment
or unemployment, even when training is randomly assigned. See Ham and Lalonde (1996).

have been working in the absence of the program show that the induced workers are less-

educated, have less work experience, and have more young children. Induced workers also earn

significantly lower wages than those who would have been working without the earnings

supplement. Despite these differences, the two groups have similar wage growth. Results from

several different approaches suggest that our estimates of wage growth are not substantially

affected by selectivity biases, although our most general selectivity models are not very

informative. After accounting for inflation, we conclude that individuals who were induced by

the SSP program to enter work in the 12-14th month of the experiment had real wage growth of

about 2.5-3.1 percent per year over the next 21 months. Although modest, this rate is

comparable to predictions based on the cross-sectional association between wages and labor

market experience in the SSP population, and with other research on the wage growth of low-

skilled workers.



I. Measures of Wage Growth

a. Wage Growth of the Induced Program Group

       Suppose that an incentive program is offered to a group of welfare participants (the

treatment or program group, identified by Pi=1) beginning at date t=0. Define an initial reference

date s 0 and consider the subset of individuals in the group who are working at s. Conceptually,

this subset can be divided into two groups: those who would have been working in period s even

in the absence of the program, and those who would not. We refer to the latter as the induced

program group, and denote membership in this group by an indicator IPi=1. We refer to the

former as the non-induced program group, and denote membership in this group by NPi=1. Note
                                                  4

that the distinction between the two groups is made with respect to a particular time period and a

particular measure of work activity. In the case of SSP, one might argue that the induced

program group should only include people who are working full time, since SSP earnings

subsidies are only available to full time workers. Some of those who are responding to the

program incentive may begin working part-time as a stepping stone to full time work, however,

and we believe it is important to include them in the induced group. Thus, throughout this paper

we define the induced program group to include all those who were working at the initial

reference date and would not have done so in the absence of the program incentive.

       Measurement of wage growth requires the specification of a time interval over which to

observe changes in wages. Let f denote the ending date for the observation window (f > s), let wit

denote the log wage of individual i in period t, and let Dit be an indicator variable equal to 1 for

those who are working in period t. Then the (average) growth rate of wages for the induced

program group is:

(1)    g = E[ wi | Dis=1, IPi=1 ] ,

where wi = wifwis. We take g to be the primary object of interest. Note that by definition

everyone in the induced program group is working in period s and (in principle) has a wage rate.

However, part of the group may not be working at f. Thus, wi is only partially observed. The

average growth rate for the induced program group can also be defined conditional on a vector of

observed characteristics xi: g(xi) = E[ wi | xi, Dis=1, IPi=1 ] .

       Even ignoring the partial observability of end-period wages, a problem arises for the

estimation of (1) because we cannot distinguish individuals who were induced to work in period

s from others who would have been working in the absence of the incentive. If a valid control
                                                    5

group is available, however, then it is straightforward to identify the size and characteristics of

the induced program group by comparing workers in the program and control groups.2

Specifically, the difference in employment rates in period s between the treatment (Pi=1) and

control (Pi=0) groups is an estimate of the fraction of the program group that is induced to work.

The relative fraction of induced versus non-induced workers is

         1 = { E[ Dis | Pi=1 ]  E[ Dis | Pi=0 ] } / E[ Dis | Pi=1 ] ,

which is simply the “treatment effect” of the incentive program on the employment rate in period

s, divided by the overall employment rate of the program group in s.

         Average wage growth for members of the program group who were working in period s is

a weighted average of the growth rates for the induced and non-induced subgroups:

(2) E[ wi | Dis=1, Pi=1] = 1 E[ wi | Dis=1, IPi=1] + (11) E[ wi | Dis=1, NPi=1].

In general neither expectation on the right-hand side of equation (2) is observable. If the program

incentive has no effect on wage growth of the non-induced group, however, then the expected

wage growth of the non-induced group can be inferred from the wage growth of the control

group:

(3)      E[ wi | Dis=1, NPi=1 ] = E[ wi | Dis=1, Pi = 0 ].

Under this assumption, the expected growth rate of wages for the induced program group is equal

to the growth rate for members of the control group, plus a differential :

(4)      g = E[ wi | Dis=1, Pi=0]      +     ,

where



   2
   A randomized control group is not strictly necessary to implement the methods we describe. A non-
experimental comparison group (arising, for example, from a quasi-experiment) will work too.
                                                    6

          = { E[ wi | Dis=1, Pi=1 ]  E[ wi | Dis=1, Pi=0 ] } / 1 ,

is the difference in the growth rates of wages for the program and control groups, divided by the

fraction of the program group that was induced to work by the program incentive. Wage growth

for the induced program group can be estimated consistently provided that we can estimate the

growth rate of wages for people in the control group who were working at s, and the difference in

growth rates between people in the treatment and control groups who were working in s.

        The key assumption underlying equation (4) -- that the incentive program has no effect on

wage growth of its “windfall beneficiaries” -- may fail if the program causes people who would

have worked anyway to choose different jobs or change their behavior in other ways. In this case

it is still possible to estimate the growth rate of wages for the induced program group, provided

that there is an identifiable subgroup for which the program has no employment effect, and

provided that the program has the same effect on wage growth for all windfall beneficiaries.

Specifically, for a subgroup that has the same employment rate in the treatment and control

groups, the employed program group consists entirely of non-induced workers. A comparison of

wage growth between program and control group members of this subgroup therefore provides

an estimate of the effect of the program on the wage growth of non-induced workers. If there is

evidence of differential wage growth between the treatment and control groups for this subgroup,

the implied estimate of the effect of the program on non-induced workers can be used to

appropriately modify equation (4).3




   3
     Suppose that the difference in growth rates of wages between treatments and controls in the subgroup
is h, and assume that the effect of the program on all non-induced workers is the same. Then the
appropriate modification of (4) is: g = E[ wi | Dis=1, Pi=0] +        h(11)/1 .
                                                    7

b. Selection Biases in Observed Wage Growth

        If a wage in the final period f were observed for all those who were working in the initial

period s, equation (4) would be directly estimable. In general, however, all that is observable is

the mean change in wages for those who were employed in both s and f. Let a(xi) and b(xi)

denote the expected rates of wage growth for members of the control group and the program

group with characteristics xi who were working in the starting period:

        a(xi) = E[ wi | xi, Dis=1, Pi=0]

        b(xi) = E[ wi | xi, Dis=1, Pi=1] .

Using equation (4), wage growth for the induced program group is g(xi) = a(xi) +

(b(xi)a(xi))/1(xi). To estimate g(xi) we therefore need to estimate both the difference in wage

growth between the treatment and control groups (b(xi)a(xi)), and the growth rate of wages for

the control group, a(xi).

        Let S0 and S1 denote the selectivity biases in the observed wage changes of the control

and treatment groups between periods s and f, relative to the true changes for all those who are

working in s:

(5a)    S0(xi) = E[ wi | xi, Dis=1, Dif=1, Pi=0 ]  E[ wi | xi, Dis=1, Pi=0 ] ,

(5b)    S1(xi) = E[ wi | xi, Dis=1, Dif=1, Pi=1 ]  E[ wi | xi, Dis=1, Pi=1 ] .

If people with faster wage growth are more likely to remain employed, then both S0(xi) and S1(xi)

will be positive. The relative magnitude of these two terms, however, is less clear.4 Observed



   4
    Program group members in SSP are eligible for an earnings subsidy, which might lead one to expect
a higher employment rate at later dates, conditional on work at the initial date, and a smaller selection
bias in their observed wage changes. As we show below, however, the later employment rates of people
in the program and control groups who were working at the initial date are very similar.
                                                   8

wage growth for those who are working in both s and f, conditional on treatment group status and

the covariates, is:

(6)     E[ wi| xi, Dis=1, Dif=1, Pi] = a(xi) + S0(xi) + Pi ( b(xi)a(xi) + (S1(xi)S0(xi) ) .

This equation shows that a regression of observed wage growth on individual characteristics and

their interactions with a treatment group indicator will recover a combination of the true expected

wage growth terms and the selection biases. Any selection bias in the wage growth of control

group members who are employed at the end period relative to the population that was employed

at the initial period will confound the estimation of a(xi). Any differences in selection bias

between the program and control groups will confound the estimation of b(xi)a(xi).

        One approach to the estimation of equation (6) is to assume that the selection biases are

negligible conditional on a sufficiently rich specification of the control variables (i.e., S0(xi) =

S1(xi) = 0 for all xi ). This is similar in spirit to the assumption underlying the propensity score

method developed by Rosenbaum and Rubin (1983) for the program evaluation problem.5 Under

this assumption, consistent estimates of a(xi) and b(xi) can be obtained by regressing observed

wage growth on a flexible function of the covariates, interacted with a program group indicator.

More generally, if the selection biases in observed wage growth for members of the program and

control groups are equal, equation (6) shows that it is still possible to consistently estimate the

difference in wage growth b(xi)a(xi), and thus the difference in wage growth between the

induced program group and the non-induced group.




   5
    This is sometimes referred to as the assumption of "selection on the observables". See Heckman,
Ichimura, Smith, and Todd (1998) for further discussion.
                                                     9

        An alternative approach is to specify a model of wage growth and employment status that

leads to specific functional forms for the selection bias terms. To proceed along these lines,

assume that an individual who is employed in s with characteristics xi has potential wage growth:

(7)       wi = (1-Pi) a(xi) + Pi b(xi) + i ,

where i is an unobserved component that is independent of xi (conditional on working in period

s). In this model the selection bias terms are just the conditional expectations of i, given that

an individual is re-employed at the end date f: Next, assume that the probability that an

individual is employed at the end date, conditional on working at the initial data, is given by a

latent index model:

(8a)     Prob(Dif=1| xi, Dis=1, Pi=0) = Prob( r0(xi,%0)  0i > 0),

(8b)     Prob(Dif=1| xi, Dis=1, Pi=1) = Prob( r1(xi,%1)  1i > 0),

where rp(xi, %p) for P=0 or 1 is a scalar index that depends on the parameters %p (e.g., rp(xi, %p) =

xi%p), and 0i and 1i are continuous random variables that incorporate unobserved taste and labor

market opportunity factors.6 Equations (7) and (8) imply that the selection biases take the form:

        S0(xi) = E[ i| 0i < r0(xi,%0) ] = C0 ( r0(xi,%0); 0)

        S1(xi) = E[ i| 1i < r1(xi,%1) ]   = C1 ( r1(xi,%1); 1) ,




   6
    A simple labor supply model might give rise to these equations. For example, suppose that available
wage opportunities are given by wi = xi + ui, and that in the absence of the program an individual works
if wi  ci, where ci = xi + vi represents a reservation wage that depends on child care costs, preferences,
etc. In this case the probability of work for members of the control group is P( xi()  (viui )  0).
Suppose that the program provides a proportional wage subsidy of S, but requires individuals to work full
time, leading to a reservation wage ki = xi + ei. Then the probability of work for members of the
program group is P( xi((1+S) )  (ei  (1+S)ui)  0).
                                                       10

where C0 and C1 are control functions (Heckman and Robb, 1985) that depend only on the

indexes rp(xi,%p) and on the unknown parameters 0 and 1 that depend on the joint distribution

of i, 0i, and 1i.

           In the benchmark case in which i, 0i, and 1i are normally distributed (Heckman, 1979),

the control functions are:

(9a)       C0( r0(xi,%0); 0) = 0 n(r0(xi,%0))/N(r0(xi,%0)) = 0 (r0(xi,%0) )

(9b)       C1( r1(xi,%1); 1) = 1 n(r1(xi,%1))/N(r1(xi,%1)) = 1 (r1(xi,%1) ),

where 0 = '0), 1 = '1), ) is the standard deviation of the unobserved wage growth

component, 'p is the correlation between i and pi for the control group (p=0) or program group

(p=1), and n(#) and N(·) are the normal density and cumulative distribution function,

respectively.7 In this case the unconditional wage growth functions a(xi) and b(xi) can be

estimated by Heckman’s (1979) two-step procedure. In the first step a probit model is fit to data

on individuals who were working in period s for the event that they are employed in f. This

provides estimates of the index functions r0(xi,%             ^

a second stage model for wage growth between periods s and f for those who are observed

working in the later period:

                                                              ^ )) + P  (r (x ,%

where !i = wi  E[ wi | xi, Dif=1, Pi]. Equation (10) can be estimated by ordinary least squares,

yielding consistent estimates of conditional mean functions a(xi) and b(xi).

           The recent econometrics literature has proposed a series of semi-parametric

generalizations of the two-step estimation technique which relax the assumption that the joint


   7
       In general i can have a different variance in the program and control groups.
                                                  11

distribution of i, 0i, and 1i is known (e.g. Powell, 1987, Robinson, 1988, Ahn and Powell,

1993, Newey, 1997). Under the assumptions that the control functions for the program group

and the control group are the same, and that there is at least one covariate that affects the

probability of employment but does not directly affect wage growth, these methods can be

applied to equation (10) to yield selection-corrected estimates of the difference in wage growth

between program and control group members at each xi. Identification of a(xi), however,

requires identification of the intercept in the control function, which in turn requires that we

observe mean wage growth for a group of individuals whose probability of employment is "close

to 1" (Heckman, 1990). If the control functions are not the same, then even the estimation of the

expected difference in wage growth between the program and control groups requires estimation

of the intercepts of the control functions. In view of this fact, and the relatively small sample

sizes available to study wage growth in the SSP sample, we do not try to implement semi-

parametric control function methods in this paper.



II. Measuring Wage Growth in the SSP Experiment

       In this section we use the methods described in Section I to estimate the wage growth of

the induced program group in the SSP experiment. We begin with some background

information on the Canadian income assistance program for low-income families and a brief

overview of SSP. We then turn to a detailed examination of the labor market outcomes of

individuals in the control and program groups of the experiment who were working during the

12th to 14th month of the program. Finally, we turn to the problem of measuring the rate of
                                                    12

wage growth for the induced program group over the period from the 12th to the 35th month of

the SSP experiment.



a. Income Assistance Programs and the SSP Experiment

        During the 1970s and 1980s, Canada, like many other countries, experienced large

increases in spending on income support programs for low-income families (Courchene, 1994).

Faced with rising welfare caseloads and changing attitudes toward work, Canadian policy makers

have begun to search for innovations in the structure of income support programs that can reduce

welfare dependency. One concern is that the Income Assistance (IA) program -- the main

welfare program for non-disabled non-elderly adults and their families -- provides limited

incentives for work.8 As in U.S. under the old AFDC program, Income Assistance benefits are

reduced dollar-for-dollar by the amount of any earnings above a modest disregard level.9 The

implicit 100 percent tax rate on earnings, coupled with the availability of other program benefits

such as dental services and prescription drugs, reduce the incentives for people who have entered

IA to work more than a few hours per week.

        The Self Sufficiency Project was designed as a rigorous test of the effect of enhanced

work incentives on the behavior of long-term IA recipients.10 Under SSP, an individual who


   8
    See Human Resources and Development Canada (1993) for a detailed inventory and description of
income support programs in Canada.
   9
    Income assistance programs are operated at the provincial level, but share several important features
across most provinces, including a dollar-for-dollar benefit reduction rate.
   10
    SSP was conceived and funded by Human Resources and Development Canada. See Lin et al
(1998) for a comprehensive description of the program and results from the first 18 months of the
experiment. Blank, Card, and Robins (2000) provide a survey of other recent financial incentive
programs for welfare participants in the U.S.
                                                 13

leaves IA and finds a full time job (or combination of jobs) receives a supplement equal to one-

half of the difference between his or her actual earnings and a target level set well above the level

of IA benefits available to most families. The supplement raises the financial reward for leaving

welfare and entering work. Moreover, since supplement payments are reduced by only 50 cents

per dollar of additional earnings, SSP provides a stronger marginal incentive for work than

conventional IA.

       The SSP evaluation is based on a randomized design: one half of a group of long-term

single parent IA recipients from two sites (in British Columbia and New Brunswick) were

offered the SSP supplement, the other half were assigned to a control group. The demonstration

follows both groups for five years, and uses administrative records and specialized surveys to

measure the effects of the program.

       Table 1 presents a brief summary of the SSP experiment, including sample eligibility

requirements and key features of the supplement program. Relative to other financial incentive

reforms (such as those tested by different U.S. states in the early 1990s), SSP is quite generous.

For example, a single mother in New Brunswick with one child received a maximum monthly IA

grant of $712 in 1994. Her gross income if she were to leave IA and enter full time work at the

minimum wage would be $867 per month -- a gain of only $155 per month for working 40 hours

per week. Under SSP, however, she would receive an additional supplement payment of $817

per month, raising the financial advantage of work versus IA to $972 per month. The reward to

work is smaller when taxes and transfers are taken into account, but is still relatively large (see

Lin et al, 1998, Table G.1).
                                                  14

        An important feature of SSP is its time-limited eligibility. Individuals who initiate

supplement payments within the first year after random assignment can receive supplements for

up to three years in any month that they are working full time and off IA. Program group

members who fail to initiate an SSP payment within the first year lose all future eligibility. This

feature has some implications for the incentive effects of the program. Most importantly,

program group members have a strong incentive to start work within a year of being offered the

program. Any work incentives in later years of the program are presumably confined to people

who successfully gained eligibility within the first year.



b. Program Impacts and Characteristics of Workers in Months 12-14

        Consistent with its generous financial incentives, SSP has significant behavioral effects

on employment and welfare outcomes. A brief summary of these impacts is provided in Figure

1, which shows average monthly employment, earnings, and welfare participation rates for

members of the treatment and control groups in the first 36 months of the experiment.11 A

prominent feature of the graphs is the tendency for steady improvement in the outcomes of the

control group. Even in the absence of SSP long-term welfare recipients gradually move off

welfare and into work. Relative to this underlying trend, members of the program group have

accelerated rates of leaving IA and entering employment. As expected given the time-limited

nature of SSP eligibility, the divergence in outcomes of the program and control groups peaks at

12-14 months after random assignment. After the first year the employment rate of the program



   11
    Outcomes for the month just prior to random assignment are plotted as month -1 in the figures. See
Lin et al (1998) for more information on the program impacts.
                                                   15

group is roughly constant, while the rate of the control group continues to rise. A similar pattern

appears in earnings and IA participation, although for these outcomes the program group

continues to experience modest changes after months 12-14.

        In view of SSP's eligibility rules, we decided to measure the effects of SSP on relative

wage growth of people who were induced to enter work in months 12-14 of the experiment. The

end period of our observation interval is months 33-35, which are the latest months for which

labor market data are currently available.

        Table 2 shows a variety of characteristics of individuals in different subsamples of the

SSP experiment. For reference, the first column reports the characteristics of the entire

experimental population.12 The group is over 95 percent single mothers, with an average age of

30. About one half have a child under 5. Nearly all sample members report prior work

experience: indeed, the average is 7.4 years. Nevertheless, 73 percent did no work in the year

prior to random assignment, and only 20 percent were working at the baseline.

        Columns 2 and 3 show the characteristics of people who were working in months 12-14.

In order to focus on people with a reasonably strong labor market attachment by one year after

random assignment, we only count as “workers” people who reported positive hours of work in

at least two of the three months between the 12th and 14th month. Among the control group, a

total of 691 individuals, or 28.1 percent, reported positive hours in at least 2 months. Among the

program group the corresponding number was 1,015 individuals, or 40.6 percent. Using the



   12
     Due to data requirements, the data in Table 2 and the rest of the paper pertain to the subsample of
individuals in the SSP recipient demonstration who completed both the baseline and 36 month interview.
This represents 87.2 percent of the original sample, equally balanced between the program and control
groups.
                                                   16

control group to estimate the behavior of the program group in the absence of SSP, these

numbers imply that 68 percent of program group members who were working in months 12-14

would have been working in the absence of the program, while 32 percent were induced to work

by the program incentives.

        Relative to the overall experimental population, people who worked in months 12-14 are

better-educated, have more work experience, are less likely to have preschool-age children, have

more positive attitudes toward work, and were more likely to be working at the baseline

interview. Interestingly, the differences between workers and the overall population is smaller

for the program group than the controls. This is consistent with the observation that SSP induces

some people to work who would not have done so in the absence of the subsidy. Formally, the

average characteristics of workers in the program group are a weighted average of characteristics

for the induced and non-induced program groups. Assuming that the mean characteristics of the

non-induced group are the same as those of control group members who were working in months

12-14, the characteristics of the induced program group can be estimated using a formula similar

to equation (4).13

        The mean characteristics of the induced program group are shown in column 4 of Table

2. We also show the differences in characteristics between the induced and non-induced program

groups in column 5. People in the induced program group are younger, less likely to hold a high

school diploma, have less positive attitudes toward work, and are more likely to have young

children than people who would have been working regardless of SSP. Perhaps the most striking


   13
     The assumption that the non-induced program group have the same characteristics as the worker in
the control group will hold under random assignment, since all of the characteristics under consideration
in Table 2 are pre-program characteristics collected in the baseline interview.
                                                   17

difference is the gap in employment rates prior to random assignment. The estimated baseline

employment rate for the induced program group is 1.7 percent, compared to 52 percent for the

non-induced group.

        The method used in Table 2 to compare the pre-program characteristics of induced and

non-induced workers can also be used to compare post-random assignment outcomes. Of

particular interest are the characteristics of the jobs obtained by the induced program group.

Table 3 presents data on the wages and hours outcomes of the program and control groups in

months 12-14, along with estimates of the distributions of these outcomes among the induced

program group.14 An important caveat is that the interpretation of the estimates in column 3 as

characteristics of the induced program group is only valid under the assumption that SSP has no

effect on the non-induced workers in the program group.

        Comparisons of the wage outcomes between workers in the program and control group

suggest that the jobs obtained by the induced program group pay relatively low wages. For

example, 14.4 percent of the program group report wages within 5 cents of the minimum wage,

compared to 8.7 percent of the controls. The assumption that all of the additional jobs paying

above the minimum wage in the program group are attributable to the induced program group

leads to the inference that 27.3 percent of the induced program group earned within 5 cents of the

minimum wage, and another 54.2 percent earned from 5 cents to a $1 above the minimum.15 The

   14
     We define the wage in months 12-14 as the simple weighted average of the available wages for each
of the three months, and hours per week similarly.
   15
     As indicated by the -8.1 percent entry in column 3 for the fraction of the induced program group
earning missing or sub-minimum wages, this strict interpretation is probably incorrect. SSP is only
available to paid employees who earn at least the minimum wage. This requirement may lead some
people who would be working in the absence of SSP to take slightly different jobs -- for example, hourly-
rated versus piece-rate jobs.
                                                 18

remainder (27.2 percent) were paid $1-2 above the minimum, with virtually none paid more than

$2 over the minimum. By comparison, close to 40 percent of control group workers in months

12-14 earned at least $2 above the minimum wage. The low relative wages of the induced

program group may explain why these people would not have worked in the absence of SSP.

        A similar tabulation of weekly hours suggests that the hours distribution of the induced

program group is largely concentrated between 30 and 40 hours per week. There is also strong

evidence that the availability of SSP affects the hours choices of the non-induced program

group. Specifically, the -20.8 percent entry in column 3 for the "under 29 hours per week"

category arises because there is a smaller total number of people in the program group working

part-time than in the control group, even though the size of the working population in the

program group is bigger. This is presumably attributable to the fact that SSP causes some people

who would have been working part-time in the absence of the program to shift to full-time work.

        A key conclusion we draw from Table 3 is that former welfare recipients who are induced

to work by SSP obtain jobs that pay in a narrow range above the minimum wage. The relatively

low wage outcomes are particularly noteworthy because without the SSP supplement a minimum

wage job is not a particularly attractive alternative to IA.16 Thus, in the absence of significant

wage growth, one might expect a sizeable fraction of the induced program group to eventually

return to IA. A secondary conclusion is that SSP tends to raise the hours of people in the non-

induced program group who would have worked part-time (under 30 hours per week) in the

absence of the program. To the extent that jobs with longer hours lead to systematically faster or


   16
     In New Brunswick in 1994 the monthly IA grant of $712 for a single mother with one child was
equivalent to 32.9 hours of work per week at the minimum wage. In British Columbia the monthly grant
of $982 was equivalent to 37.8 hours per week at the minimum wage.
                                                   19

slower wage growth, SSP may have some affect on the average wage growth of the non-induced

program group – an issue to which we now turn.



c. Does SSP Effect the Wage Growth of Non-induced Workers?

        As noted in section I, the rate of wage growth of the induced program group can be

readily estimated if it is assumed that SSP has no effect on the wages of people who would be

working without the program. We also noted that this assumption can be tested by comparing

the rates of wage growth in the treatment and control groups for a subgroup whose employment

rate in months 12-14 is unaffected by the SSP incentive. Table 4 presents some direct evidence

on this question, based on the outcomes of individuals who were working at the baseline of the

SSP experiment. As motivation for this analysis, observe in row 1 of the table that the

employment rate in months 12-14 for the subset of the program group who were working at the

baseline is insignificantly different from the employment rate of the comparable controls. This

small differential implies that only a minor fraction (6 percent) of the program group who were

working at the baseline would not have been working in months 12-14 in the absence of SSP.

Another way to see the same point is to recall from Table 2 that the fraction of the induced program

group who were working at the baseline is essentially zero. Thus, people who were working at the

baseline are nearly all in the non-induced group. A comparison of the growth rates of wages

between the program and control groups in this subgroup therefore provides a test of the effect of

SSP on the wage growth of the non-induced program group.

        The entries in rows 2-4 of Table 4 suggest that treatment and control group members who

were working at the SSP baseline have similar labor force attachment from months 12-14 to
                                                20

months 33-35, although the program group has slightly higher average hours per week. The

mean log wage of the program group in months 12-14 is slightly lower than that of the controls,

although the gap is insignificant (t-ratio =1). The average growth rate of log hourly wages over

the period from months 12-14 to months 33-35 is about 7 percentage points for the control group

and 5 percentage points for the program group, suggesting that if anything the induced program

group has slower wage growth that the non-induced group. A detailed examination of the wage

growth data, however, reveals a small number of outliers that potentially effect the comparison.

A standard way to reduce the influence of these observations is to consider medians, rather than

means. Another way is to “trim” or censor the large changes. Row 10 shows that median growth

rates for the program and control groups are very similar (and quite precisely estimated.) Row 11

shows that a similar conclusion emerges from the trimmed wage changes, constructed by

censoring observations above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of the pooled

distribution.

        Based on the results in Table 4 we conclude that the availability of SSP has no effect on

the wage growth of individuals who were working at the experimental baseline. While this

finding does not rule out the possibility that SSP affects the wage growth of other non-induced

workers, it is reassuring. Moreover, baseline workers account for 70 percent of all control group

members who were working in months 12-14. Since the control group reproduces the behavior

of the non-induced program group, we infer that baseline workers comprise about 70 percent of

the non-induced group. At a minimum, then, we can conclude that SSP has no effect on wage

growth for most of the non-induced group.
                                                   21

d. Wage Growth in the Program and Control Groups

        To implement equation (4) we need to obtain estimates of both the difference in wage

growth between the program and control groups of the SSP demonstration, and the average rate

of wage growth for the control group. We begin by focusing on the differential in growth rates.

Table 5 shows data on people in the two groups who were working in months 12-14. As in Table

4, we present means for the control group, means for the program group, and both raw and

regression-adjusted differences in means between the two.17 The entries in row 1 indicate that

just over two-thirds of the treatments and controls who were working in months 12-14 were re-

employed in months 33-35.18 The unadjusted difference in re-employment rates between the

program and control groups is small and statistically insignificant. Taking account of the

different characteristics of the control and program groups who were working in months 12-14,

however, the program group has a slightly higher employment rate. The two groups also have

similar amounts of cumulative labor market experience between months 12 and 33.

        The third row of the table shows the mean log wages of the two groups in months 12-14.

At this early stage of the SSP experiment workers in the program group had about 6 percent

lower wages than those in the control group. This gap is consistent with the argument that

people in the induced program group earn relatively low wages when they first enter the labor

market. Indeed, if one assumes that 68 percent of program group would have had the same

   17
     A total of 24 control variables are used in the regression model, including 2 dummy variables for
education, labor market experience and its square, indicators for province, gender, number and age of
children, labor market status at the baseline, two dummy variables measuring attitudes toward work, an
indicator for whether months 33-35 occur in the winter, and interactions of most of the controls with
province.
   18
    Again, we define employment in months 33-35 as having reported positive hours in 2 or more of the
3 months. Results based on other definitions are similar.
                                                    22

wages as the control group in the absence of the program, then the mean log wage of the induced

workers was about 1.78, or 20 percent below the mean wages of the non-induced group.

        Row 4 shows the mean log wages in months 12-14 for the subset of workers who were re-

employed in months 33-35. This subgroup is positively selected: the wage gap between all

workers and those who were employed 21 months later is 4 percentage points in both the

treatment and control groups. By comparison, as shown in row 9, mean log wages of those who

were subsequently not working are about 10 percentage points lower than the overall average.

Row 10 shows the difference in mean wages between those who were re-employed in months 33-

35 and those who were not. For both groups the differential is about 13 percent. We conclude

from these patterns that conditioning on employment status in months 33-35 introduces about the

same selection bias in observed wages in months 12-14 for the treatment group as for the

controls. This is potentially reassuring, since many standard models of earnings dynamics imply

that any selection bias in the growth rate of wages is proportional to the selection bias in the level

of wages at the start of the interval.19 In these models the equality of the differences between

rows 3 and 4 for the treatment and control groups implies that the average selection biases in

measured wage growth for the two groups are equal.


   19
     For example, if wages in months 12-14, wages in months 33-35, and the unobserved error
component determining the probability of employment in months 33-35 are jointly normally distributed
with the same covariance structure in the program and control groups, then if the two groups have the
same selection bias in the levels of wages in month 12-14, they also have the same selection biases in the
growth rate of wages. To see this, let w1 and w2 denote wages in months 12-14 and 33-35, respectively,
and let z denote a normally distributed index such that w2 is observed if z>0. Finally, let )t denote the
standard deviations of wt (t=1,2), let 'tz denote the correlations of wt and z, and let =E(z|z>0). Then the
selectivity bias in w1, given that w2 is observed, is )1'1z, and the selectivity bias in w2-w1 given w2 is
observed is ()2'2z-)1'1z). Clearly, if the covariance parameters are the same in the program and control
groups and the mean selectivity bias in w1 given that w2 is observed is the same for the two groups, then
the mean of  is the same. In this case the mean of the selectivity bias in w2-w1 given that w2 is observed,
is the same for the two groups.
                                                  23

       Row 5 shows mean log wages in months 33-35 for the subsets of the program and control

group who were working then, while row 6 shows the mean growth in wages between months

12-14 and 33-35. The data indicate a somewhat slower average growth rate of wages in the

program group than the control group, although the gap is far from statistically significant. As

shown in rows 7 and 8, however, this gap virtually disappears when medians, rather than means

are analyzed, or when the observations are trimmed to eliminate the influence of extreme

outliers. Taken at face value this similarity implies that the induced program group had virtually

the same wage growth as those who would have been working in months 12-14 in the absence of

SSP.

       There are two limitations of the simple differences in wage growth between the program

and control groups in Table 5. The first is that these estimates are based on specifications that

assume a constant differential between members of the program and control groups, irrespective

of their observed characteristics. The second is that the estimates are only valid if S1(xi), the

selection bias in measured wage growth for the program group, is equal to S0(xi), the selection

bias in measured wage growth for the controls.

       With respect to the first issue, a simple procedure is to estimate a fully-interacted

regression specification that includes all the covariates and their interactions with the program

group dummy, and then evaluate the interactions at the mean characteristics of the program

group. Using the trimmed wage growth measure, this procedure leads to an estimated difference

in expected wage growth between the program and control groups of 0.003 (with a standard error

of 0.013), which is very similar to the adjusted estimate shown in row 8 of Table 5. Moreover,

none of the 24 interactions terms between the program dummy and the covariates is individually
                                                    24

significant, and an F-test that the interaction terms are jointly insignificant has a probability value

of 0.67. We infer that the differences in wage growth between the program and control group are

relatively similar across subgroups.

        To address the selectivity issue, we began by estimating a probit model for the probability

of working in months 33-35, conditional on working in months 12-14. We fit the model

separately to the program and control groups, using the full set of 24 covariates used to estimate

the adjusted wage growth differentials in Table 5. We then used the model to predict the

probability of employment in months 33-35 for members of the program and control groups. The

distributions of predicted probabilities for the subsets of the two groups who actually worked in

months 33-35 show two interesting features. First, the predicted probabilities for the program

group have virtually the same mean as the predicted probabilities for the control group, but

somewhat less dispersion.20 Second, the support of the distribution of predicted probabilities for

the program group is contained in the support of the distribution for the control group.21

        These two features have potentially important implications for assessing the relative

selection biases in the observed wage changes of the program group versus the control group.

Specifically, suppose that the structural model given by equations (7) and (8) is restricted so that

the control functions for the program and control group are the same. Then a person in the

program group and a person in the control group with the same predicted probability of


   20
     The mean and standard deviation of the predicted probability of being re-employed in months 33-35
for those in the control group who were re-employed are 0.688 and 0.144, respectively. The
corresponding mean and standard deviation for the program group are 0.691 and 0.101, respectively.
   21
     The importance of checking the comparability of the support of the distributions of the probabilities
of selection between the program and control (or comparison) groups is emphasized for program
evaluation problems by Heckman, Ichimura, Smith and Todd (1998).

employment have the same selectivity biases their observed wage changes.22 In this case,

comparisons of wage growth between program and control group members with similar

probabilities of employment in months 33-35 will abstract from any selectivity biases.

        Table 6 presents a set of comparisons of wage growth between program and control group

members with similar values of the predicted probability of re-employment in months 33-35. For

simplicity, in this table and the remainder of the paper we use the trimmed wage growth measure

described above. Row 1 reports data for the overall program and control groups. As noted in

Table 5, the two groups have very similar growth rates in wages, with a raw difference of only

0.002. The adjusted(1) difference represents the difference in growth rates, controlling for a

basic set of baseline covariates and a set of dummy variables indicating the decile of the

predicted probability of employment (from the probit models described above).23 This estimate

is only slightly smaller than the unadjusted difference, suggesting that differences in wage growth

between program and control group members with similar predicted probabilities of employment

are small. The adjusted(2) difference is obtained from a similar model that includes a richer set

of 24 control variables (the same set of variables used to form the predicted probabilities of

employment within each program group). This estimate is slightly more negative than either the

other differences, but is not significantly different from 0.




   22
     This follows from the fact that the index rp(xi,%p) is an invertible function of the probability of
employment: Prob(Dif=1|xi,...) = Prob(rp(xi,%p)-pi>0) = F(rp(xi,%p)), where F is the distribution function
of pi.
   23
    The deciles are assigned from the pooled sample of program and control group members who
reported valid wage growth data (1100 observations).
                                                 26

       The remaining rows of Table 6 report similar comparisons between program and control

group members whose predicted probabilities of employment fall in specific decile ranges.

Across the decile groups there is some variation in the average growth rates of wages for the two

program groups, but little indication of a systematic pattern. As shown in the bottom row of the

table, weighted averages of the decile-specific differences based the distribution of the program

group are similar to those reported in row 1, but slightly more negative. If one maintains the

hypothesis of identical control functions for the program and control groups, the entries in the

bottom row of Table 6 suggest that the simple difference in the growth rate of wages between the

program and control groups may be slightly upward biased. In light of the modest sample sizes,

however, one could plausibly conclude that the selection biases for the program and control

group are equal, leading to little or no bias in the simple difference of observed growth rates.

       An alternative way to evaluate the potential effect of selection bias is to estimate a wage

growth equation that includes the conventional (multivariate-normal) control functions given by

equations (9a) and (9b). Table 7 reports estimation results for a series of models based on this

approach. The first three columns report models that assume the same control function for the

treatment and control groups, while the fourth and fifth columns report models with group-

specific control functions. The specification in column 1 includes a set of 24 control variables, a

dummy variable for the program group, and a conventional selection correction term. The model

in column 2 generalizes this by including a full a set of interactions of the covariates with the

program group dummy. We summarize the estimates from this specification by reporting the

mean difference in expected wage growth between the program and control groups, evaluated at

the characteristics of the program group. Since the probit model used to estimate the probability
                                                   27

of employment is based on the same set of 24 covariates fully interacted with program group

status, the coefficient of the control function in this specification is identified by functional form

alone. The model in column 3 is similar to the one in column 2, but it imposes some exclusion

restrictions. Specifically, four covariates representing the effect of different seasons of the year

are included in the employment probability model but excluded from the wage growth equation.24

These exclusions are valid if jobs are harder to find in the winter months, but rates of pay do not

vary over the seasons.

        The specifications in columns 1 and 3 of Table 7 both yield small and statistically

insignificant estimates of the selection parameter =') that indexes the correlation between

wage growth and the probability of employment in months 33-35. They also give estimates of the

selection-corrected difference in wage growth between the program group and the control group

that are very close to 0.25 These findings are consistent with the simple differences in mean wage

growth in Table 5, which are valid under the assumption that =0. By comparison, the

specification in column 2 of Table 7 leads to a point estimate of  that is large and negative, and

an estimate of the difference in mean wage growth between the program and control groups that

is relatively large in magnitude but imprecise. A concern with this specification is that the




   24
     The excluded variables are an indicator for the event that months 33-35 occur in the winter,
and its interactions with province and program group. People for whom months 33-35 fall in the
winter have significantly lower probabilities of employment in these months. This seasonality effect is
stronger in New Brunswick.
   25
    The model in column 3 imposes the restriction that the 4 seasonal terms are omitted from the wage
growth equation. We tested this using a conventional F-test. The p-value of the test statistic is 0.21,
providing little evidence against the exclusion restriction.
                                                   28

estimate of  is so large that the implied estimate of ' is bigger than 1 in absolute value.26 In

view of this fact, and the very weak basis for the identification of the coefficients in this

specification, we believe that the estimates in column 2 should be given less credence than those

in columns 1 and 3.

        Columns 4 and 5 present models that allow group-specific control functions. The model

in column 4 is similar to the baseline specification in column 1, while the model in column 5 is

similar to the one in column 3. Comparisons of parallel models with and without group-specific

selection terms suggest that the data are not sufficiently rich to allow separate identification of

the program-group-specific control functions and the difference in mean wage growth between

the two groups. For example, comparing the specifications in columns 1 and 4, the introduction

of group-specific control functions raises the standard error of the difference in mean wage

growth from 0.014 to 0.043, but yields no improvement in the fit of the model. For what they are

worth, the estimates in columns 4 and 5 suggest that there is some negative selection bias in the

observed wage growth of the control group, and some positive selection bias in the observed

wage growth of the program group, although the estimates are quite imprecise. Overall, the

results in Table 7 are consistent with the hypothesis that there is no selectivity bias in the

observed wage growth of either the program or control groups, although the estimates from the

more general specifications are not particularly informative.

        Based on the range of evidence in Tables 5, 6, and 7, we conclude that SSP program

group members who were working in months 12-14 had about the same wage growth as the



   26
     The estimated standard deviation of the wage growth residual, ), is 0.200. Thus the implied
estimate of ' is -2.19.
                                                 29

members of the control group. Moreover, there do not appear to be any significant interactions

between the observable baseline covariates and the difference in wage growth between the

program and control groups. Thus, our best estimate is that people in the induced program group

had about the same distribution of wage growth as people who would have been working without

the SSP incentive. The estimates in Tables 5 show a mean growth rate in wages of 8.0 to 9.0

percent for both the program and control groups over the 21 month period from the 12th to 33rd

months of the SSP experiment. Since there is no evidence of selectivity bias in the observed

wage growth of either group, we conclude that the average wage growth of the induced program

group was 8-9 percent. During the period from 1992 to 1996, the inflation rate averaged 2

percent per year. Thus, the induced program group in the SSP experiment had real wage growth

of about 4.5 to 5.5 percent, or a growth rate of about 2.6 - 3.1 percent per year.



e. The Effect of Minimum Wage Increases

        One potentially important influence on the rate of growth of wages of low-wage workers

is the level of the minimum wage (see Card and Krueger, 1995, and DiNardo, Fortin, and

Lemieux, 1996). During the period covered by the first 36 months of the SSP Recipient

experiment, the minimum wage rose from $5.00 to 5.50 per hour in New Brunswick, and from

$6.00 to 7.00 per hour in British Columbia.27 Given the concentration of the induced program

group’s wages in a narrow range above the minimum wage, it is possible that these increases

differentially affected the observed wage growth of the SSP program group. To investigate this


   27
    The minimum wage in New Brunswick was $5.00 from late 1992 to January 1996, rose to 5.25 on
January 1 1996, and to 5.50 on July 1 1996. The minimum wage was in British Columbia was $6.00
from late 1992 to March 1995, rose to 6.50 in March 1995, and to $7.00 in October 1995.
                                                 30

issue, we calculated the changes in the province-specific minimum wage over the period from

the 12th to 33rd month for each person in the SSP experiment, and fit the wage growth models

shown in Table 8. These models include a program group dummy, the percentage change in the

minimum wage (which varies across people depending on their province and their date of

enrollment in SSP), and an interaction of the minimum wage change with the program group

dummy.

       The estimates suggest a small effect of minimum wage increases on individual wage

growth, although the measured effect is never statistically significant (in column 2 the t-ratio for

the minimum wage coefficient is 1.52, which has a probability value of 0.12). The magnitude of

the effect implies that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage leads to a 1.2 to 2.0 percentage

point higher wage in months 33-35, relative to the case of no increase in the minimum. As

shown by the interaction coefficients in the third row of the table, however, the effect is very

similar for members of the program and control groups. This may be a little surprising, since the

program group includes more people whose wages are closer to the minimum wage, and one

might have thought this would lead to a bigger effect of the minimum wage on the program

group. Nevertheless, there is no evidence of a differential effect, perhaps because minimum

wages changes create ripple effects that raise wages of all low wage workers, and not just those

closest to the old minimum (see Card and Krueger, 1995, chapter 5). Given these estimates, we

conclude that minimum wage increases may have accounted for up to 1.7 percentage points of

average wage growth for both the program and control groups between months 12-14 and 33-35
                                                  31

(or 1 percent per year), but had very little effect on the relative wage growth of the program

groups.28



f. Other Evidence on Wage Growth

        The slow rate of real wage growth for people who were induced to enter work by the

financial incentives of SSP suggests a limited role for work experience to boost the earnings of

welfare leavers. In an effort to better understand this finding, we examined the cross sectional

association between wages and previous work experience in the SSP population. Table 9

presents a series of conventional human capital earnings models, fit to the hourly wages of the

SSP control and program group members who were working at the baseline, and to the hourly

wage outcomes of control group workers at 12-14, 24-27, and 33-35 months after the baseline.

Following standard practice, all of these models include controls for education and gender, and a

quadratic function of years of actual labor market experience as of the baseline. The estimates

imply that for a group of workers with an average of 6.6 years of work experience (the mean for

the SSP induced program group, as shown in Table 2), each additional year of work experience is

associated with 1.5-2.8 percent higher real hourly wages. Members of the induced program

group worked about 17 months, on average, over the period from months 12-14 to months 33-35.

Thus, the cross-sectional estimates suggest they should have experienced real wage growth of 2-4

percent over this period, a little less than actually occurred. The difference is potentially




   28
     The upper bound of 1.7 percentage points comes from multiplying the average percentage increase
in the minimum wage (8.3 percent) by 0.2, the coefficient from column 3 of Table 8.
                                                   32

explained by the effect of the minimum wage increases during the SSP experimental period.29

Taking this factor into account, estimates of the wage growth for the induced program group are

fairly close to the rates one would expect based on the cross-sectional return to experience in the

SSP population.

        Gottschalk (2000) has summarized the implications of several previous studies that

provide estimates of the rate of wage growth of welfare leavers. He finds a range of estimates

between 2 percent per year (in a study by Moffitt and Rangarajan, 1989) and 4.5 percent per year

( in a study by Bartik, 1997). Although they do not focus on welfare leavers, Gladden and Taber

(2000) estimate real wage growth rates of 3-4 percent per year of actual work for less-educated

women for the first 10 years in the labor market. Presumably this is an upper bound on the rate

of wage growth for a typical member of the SSP induced program group, who had 7 years of

work experience and worked about 70 percent of the time in our observation window. This

evidence is consistent with relatively modest rates of wage growth for low-skilled female

workers in general, and for welfare leavers in particular.



III. Conclusions

        This paper presents estimates of the rate of wage growth among former welfare recipients

in the Self Sufficiency Project. We present a simple procedure for estimating the wage growth of

the induced program group -- people who would not have been working in the absence of SSP --

using the observed growth rates of wages in the SSP treatment and control groups. The key



   29
   Another partial explanation is that there is measurement error in reported experience that leads to a
downward bias in the experience coefficients in Table 9.
                                                 33

requirement is that the SSP supplement has no effect on the wage growth of those who would

have been working in its absence. Although this assumption cannot be fully tested, it can be

evaluated for subgroups of the experiment, and it appears to be valid for the relatively large

subset of the SSP population who were working at the baseline of the experiment.

       Even under this assumption, a potential selectivity problem arises because wage growth is

only measurable for people who are working at some initial point and are re-employed at a later

date. We use several different techniques, including simple comparisons between subgroups

with similar probabilities of selection and conventional two-step selection correction methods, to

evaluate the potential magnitude of any selection biases. Our interpretation of the results is that

selection biases in the observed growth of wages are small, although our most general models are

imprecise.

       Based on the range of available evidence we conclude that SSP leads to wage growth

among the induced program group that is very similar to the growth experienced by people who

would have left welfare and entered work without the program’s incentive. After accounting for

inflation, we find that both groups had growth rates in the range of 2.5 to 3 percent per year. Up

to a percentage point or more of this growth may have been attributable to minimum wage

increases that occurred during the experiment. The range of estimated growth rates for SSP-

induced welfare leavers, while modest, is in line with predictions based on the cross-sectional

association of wages and labor market experience in the SSP population. Overall, the evidence

from the SSP experiment suggests that welfare leavers who are induced to enter work can

anticipate wage growth that is neither much faster nor much slower than the rate for other

workers.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. Deciles of predicted employment probability
are obtained from probit model fit separately to program and control group members who
were employed in months 12-14 with valid wage. Models include 24 covariates. Deciles
are defined over pooled subsample of program and control group. Adjusted(1)
difference in wage growth is obtained from a regression model, fit by decile, that
includes controls for gender, province, number and age of children and baseline labor
force status. Adjusted(2) difference is obtained from a regression model that
includes adjusted(1) controls, plus measures of attitudes toward work, indicators for
season, and interactions of key covariates with province. Regression models used in
row 1 (for overall sample) also include dummy variables indicating the decile of the
predicted employment probability.

Notes: Standard errors in parentheses. All models are fit to subsample of 429
control group members and 671 program group members who were employed in
months 12-14 and 33-35, and reported valid wages for both periods. Model in
column 1 include 24 covariates plus single indicator for program group. Model
in column 2 includes 24 covariates, fully interacted with program group
status. Models in column 3 includes 22 covariates, fully interacted with
program group status. All models also include program group dummy and control
function based on first-stage probit models for the probability of employment
in months 33-35, fit to the samples of control and program group members who
worked in months 12-14. The probit models include 23 covariates and are fit
separately to the program and control groups.
a/
 In interacted models, predicted difference in wage growth between program
and control groups is evaluated at the mean characteristics of the program
group.
