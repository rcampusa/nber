                 OPTIMAL ADVICE FOR MONETARY POLICY


                                ABSTRACT


 This paper addresses the issue of how to give optimal advice about

 monetary policy when    it   is   known   that   the   advice may not   be

 heeded.   We examine a simple macroeconomic model in which monetary

 policy has the ability to stabilize output by offsetting exogenous

 shocks to aggregate demand.       The optimal policy rule for such a

 model is easily derived.     But an advisor who knows that his advice

 may not be followed should not recommend the optimal policy rule.

 This is true because, in giving activist advice, such an advisor

 increases uncertainty about what monetary policy will be followed.

 We solve for the rule that such an advisor should use in giving

 advice.
