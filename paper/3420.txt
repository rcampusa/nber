                                   ABSTRACT


      The American population is aging rapidly. Persons 65 and
                                                               over who now
 constitute about one-fifth of the population will constitute about two-fifths

 of the population by 2040. In addition, individuals
                                                        are living longer. Yet
 the labor force participation of older Americans has fallen
                                                               dramatically in
recent years. This paper discusses this trend and the     principal arguments
put forth to explain it. The paper is in two parts. The first part reviews

trends in labor force participation and associated trends in Social Security

(SS) coverage, firm pension plan coverage, and other factors that are likely

to be associated with the labor force participation
                                                       trends, including

demographics. The second part of the paper discusses the incentive effects

of SS and retirement plans, with emphasis on firm pension plans.

         The American population is aging rapidly. Persons 65 and over who now

constitute about one-fifth of the population will constitute about two-fifths

of the population by 2040. In addition, individuals are living longer. Yet

the labor force participation of older Americans has fallen dramatically in

recent years. This paper discusses this trend and the principal explanations

put forth to explain it. The paper is in two parts. The first part review.

trends in labor force participation and associated trends in Social Security

(SS) coverage, firm pension plan coverage, and other factors that are likely

to be associated with the labor force participation trends. The second part

of the paper discusses the incentive affects of SS and retirement plans, with

emphasis on firm pension plans. The intent is to summarize the facts and the

research that has attempted to explain them. The presentation is primarily

graphical. We begin with a simple conceptual framework.



I.    A Cpncetup1 Framework.


      To help to organize the discussion that follows and to put the idea. in

context, a conceptual framework of the retirement decision is    outlined   in



     *We have paraphrased and borrowed freely from papers by Kotlikoff and
Vise [1985, 1987, 1989] and Stock and Wise [1988, 1989]. Data gathered by
several other authors have also been used, often in a format different from
the original author's presentation. In all cases the original sources are
cited.

 figure 1, which summarizes several stylized facts.1 Several factors have

 important influences on the retirement decision as workers age. As health and

 functional ability deteriorate, the disutility of work increases and the

relative desire for leisure increases, indicated by the line labelled L in the

figure. Real wage earnings typically rise over some portion of the working

life, but later decline with age, as indicated by .I.    Lower wage earnings and

greater hardship associated with working tend to increas, the      incentive   to

retire. As employees age they may also accumulate more personal saving and

their sntitl.ment to SS and firm pension benefits increases. Thus if the

utirent       a,e i   pLoued, loyees ar abld to uppot. high              lev1   of

consumption after retirement. In addition, any given level of personal saving

or SS and pension entitlement can support a higher annual consumption level if

rstirsm.nt is postponed; there are few.r remaining years of life      over which
support must be provided. This is summarized as B in the figure. The larger

thus. benefits, the greater the incentive to retire.

        The central theme of the discussion below is the upward shift over time

in the relationship between benefits and age; given age, SS and pension

entitlements have increased. Thus the incentive to retire has increased.

With respect to most of the discussion below, it may be assumed that the

relationship between real wage earnings and age, and the relationship between

the disutility of work (desire for leisure) and age, have not changed over

time.

        Worker productivity also declines with age. It is often argued that

productivity is greater than the wage early in the    working   life and less than

the wage later in the working life. This is the assumption reflected in the

relationship between worker productivity, F, and the wage shown in the figure.

This relationship is often put forth as an explanation for the structure of

private pension plans, that typically encourage early retirement, as discussed

below.



II. Life Expectancy. Labor FQrce Participation, and Associated Trends.

     A.   Life Expectancy and the Ase Composition of the U.S. Population.

     Americans are living longer and the proportion of the population that is

old is increasing rapidly. In 1950, for example, the annual death rate of

white men 75 to 79 was 90.1 per 1,000; by 1980 it had fallen to 80.7, a 10

percent reduction. Assuming current trends, the projected death rate for the

year 2000 is 63.9, a further 21 percent reduction. The reductions for white

women are even larger, as shown in figure 2.2

     An implication of the lower death rates is a marked increase in life

expectancy, especially for women. Men who were 65 in 1950 could expect to

live 12.8 more years; in 1980 they could expect to live 14.2 more years, an 11

percent increase. (See figure 3a.) Over the same thirty-year period, the

life expectancy of women who were 65 increased by over 23 percent, from 15 to

18.5. (See figure 3b.)

     The overall aging of the population probably has more important policy

implications than increasing individual life expectancy. The proportion of

the population 55 and over has increased from about 15 percent in 1940 to

about 21 percent in 1980. By 2020 almost 31 percent of the population will

be in this age group.   (See figure 4a.) The elderly (those over 54), who now

constitute about one-fifth of all adults, will constitute about two-fifths of

all adults by 2040.

     Th. oldest age groups are growing the fastest. Only 0.3 percent of the

population was over 85 in 1940; the proportion had increased to 1.0 percent by

1980, mostly since 1960. (See figure 4b.) The projected proportion is 2.4 in

2020. The proportion between 65 and 74 increased from about 5 percent of the

populMtion in 1940 to close to 7 percent in 1980; the 2020 projection is 10

percent. Thus an increasingly large fraction of the population is older than

typical retirement ages. As emphasized below, the dramatic reduction in

retirement ages magnifies this effect.

     From the point of view of the individual, increasing life expectancy

induces later retirement. If other factors remain the same, longer life

expectancy means that any given level of pension and SS entitlement, or of

personal saving, must be used to support consumption over more retirement

years. From the point of view of society, a larger older population means

that a smaller labor force must support a larger number of retirees.


     B.   Labor Force Parttcioatjpn.

     Although a larger and larger fraction of the population is old and

individual life expectancy is increasing, workers are leaving the labor force

at younger and younger ages. Thus there are more older people, living longer,

working less.

     A recent study of Ransom and Sutch 11988] shows that the labor force

participation rates of men over 60 were essentially constant between 1870 and

1930. Indeed for most older age groups, the rates in 1937 were
                                                                 essentially
the same as in 1930, according to their study. Since that time the labor

force participation rates of older men have fallen continuously. Adjusted for

the shift away from agricultural employment, the rate increased from a little

over 50 percent in 1870 to almost 65 percent in 1930 and then fell to about 30

percent by 1980. Social Security was introduced under the Social Security Act

of 1935. Company pensions were spurred by the Revenue Act of 1942, that

granted tax incentives to firms to establish pension plans. The Ransom and

Sutch data, based on the decennial censuses, are reproduced In figure Sa.

     These data, as reported in Sandefur and Tuisa (l98fl, also have been used

to construct labor force participation rates by age group for men and women at

10 year intervals, beginning in 1940. (See figures Sb through 5d.)3 The

rates for men fell in each age group. For example, 61.4 percent of men 55 and

over were in the labor force in 1940, by 1970 the proportion had fallen to



     3Sandefur and Tuma [19871. Labor force participation by gender and age
group can be computed from Sandefur and Tuma's tables 1, 2, 3, and 10. For
example, the labor force participation of men in a given age category is equal
to the percentage of men in that age group that are employed divided by the
percentage of men in that age group (which is given in table 3, panel a).
Since the tables are divided by gender and race simultaneously, the percentage
of employed men in a given age group is the percentage of white employed men
in that age group plus the percentage of nonwhite employed men in that age
group. For each race, the percentage of employed men in an age group is the
product of the following: the percentage of men of a given race and age that
is employed, the percentage of the population of a given race and age that is
male, the percentage of a given age that is a specific race. These are
obtained from tables 10, 3, and 2 respectively. To aggregate age groups,
additional information regarding the percentage of the population that is a
given age group is required; these data are found in table 1.

52.7, by 1985 only 39.6 percent of men in this age group were in the labor

force. The participation rates of women 55 and over increased until 1970.

But .ince 1970, even the rates for women have fallen.   (See figure 5b.)

Indeed for both men and women there was an abrupt change in labor force

participation rates in the early 1970's: for men the reduction was

accelerated in most age groups and for women the rates that had been

increasing began to decline.


     C.   Associated Trends.

     What has enabled people to leave the labor force at younger and younger

ages and still maintain consumption after retirement? It seems evident that

this has been made possible by Social Security benefits and by firm pension

plans. Before discussing trends in SS and pension coverage, it is useful to

establish first that support in old age is typically not financed by personal

saving.

     1.   The Composition of Total Wealth.

     Based on the recent Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP),

Venti and Wise [19891 have computed the composition of total wealth for all

households, for homeowners, and for renters in 1984. The results are

summarized in figures 6a, 6b, and 6c. The amounts reflect median wealth by

asset category. It is clear from figure 6a that most families approach

retirement age with very little personal saving other than housing equity.

For example, among households with heads 60 to 65. the median of liquid wea1th

is only $6.6 thousand; the median of housing equity is $43.0 thousand.4



     4Liquid wealth is broadly defined to include interest earning assets held
in banks and other institutions, mortgages held, money owed from sale of
businesses, U.S. Savings Bonds, and checking accounts, equity in stocks and
mutual fund shares, less unsecured debt.

     The majority of families rely heavily on Social Security (SS) benefits

for support after retirement, and to a more limited extent on the saving that

is done for them by employers, through defined benefit pension plans. The

Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) data, from which these

figures were computed, allow estimation of the value of SS and pension plan

benefits only after the payments are received.5 Thus wealth in the form of SS

and pensions is only recorded for persons who have begun to receive the

payments. Most persons have retired by 65 and thereafter are receiving the

benefits to which they are entitled. About 59 percent of householda with

reference persons between 65 and 70 receive pension benefits; R9 percent

receive SS benefits. The present value of pension and 55 wealth is based on

life tables together with the amount of the annual payments. Social Security

benefits are indexed to inflation; private pension benefits typically are

not.6 As can be seen from figure 6a, SS and pension wealth is by far the most

important component of the wealth of most elderly. Among households with

heads 65 to 70, for example, the median of 55 and pension wealth combined is

$113.4 thousand; the median of housing wealth is $38.0 thousand and the median

of liquid financial assets is only $10.0 thousand. The decline in 55 and



     5The SIPP data do not contain SS earnings histories (that determine 55
benefits), nor do they contain detailed pension plan provisions.



     6The present values of pension and SS benefits are the discounted
survival weighted streams of income from each source received by the reference
person and the spouse if present. Discounting is at 6 percent and survival
probabilities are calculated from mortality tables by sex. Payments from S5,
military pensions, federal employee pensions, and the railroad retirement
pension are assumed to be indexed at an annual rate of 4 percent. All other
sources of pension income are not indexed in the wealth calculations.
                                       (21)


pension wealth with age is largely an artifact of declining life expectancy,

The lower housing equity of older households is a cohort effect and does not

reflect a teduction of housing equity as individual households age; in fact,

housing equity increases on average as the elderly age; there is little change

in housing equity even among families that move from one home ro another.

     Comparison of figures Lb and Lc shows that households who rent have

substantially less wealth than homeowners in all asset categories. The median

total wealth of homeowners is $L70.4 thousand; the median for renters is $59.3

thousand. Renters, who comprise about 20 percent of all households, have

virtually no liquid assets.

     In summary: the majority of elderly hnuseholds live on Social Security

and pension benefits.

     2.   Social Security Coverage.

     It is clear from figure 5a that the trend to earlier retirement began

between the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935 and the Revenue Act of

1942. The 1942 Revenue Act granted tax incentives to firms to establish

pension plans. Indeed, after adjusting for the reduction in agricultural

employment, there was a sharp reversal In the prior trend to later retirement,

as shown by Ransom and Sutch 11988].

     The percent of persons 65 and over receiving SS benefits increased from

about 20 percent in 1940 to 85 percent in 1960; now about 95 percent receive

SS benefits.   (See figure 7.) In addition, the level of benefits has

increased sharply. The benefits for a retired male worker increased from

about 14 percent of median male income in 1950 to 37.5 percent in l980. Thus



     7See Tuma and Sandefur [1988).

not only has coverage been extended to virtually the entire labor force, but

the standard of living that the benefits can support has also increased

sharply.

     3.    Firm Pension Plans.

     The proportion of the workforce covered by a firm   (or   a federal or state

or local government) pension plan Increased from 23.8 to 48.6 percent between

1950 and 1979. Now about 50 percent of the workforce is covered by a pension

plan. Most of the growth in pension coverage occurred in the 1950s. The

proportion of the older poulatipn (55 and over) collecting pension benefits

continues to increase, as shown in figure 8. Zy 1984, 30.8 percent of persons

55 and over, and 39.0 percent of persons 65 and over were collecting pension

benefits from some source, according to the SIP?.

     In short: It is evident that the expansion of SS and firm pension plans

has allowed and encouraged earlier retirement. In addition to the incoma

incentive created by the entitlement to retirement income, the discussion

below shows that the timing of the accrual of pension entitlements, created by

firm pension plan provisions in particular, provides a strong incentive to

retire early. These provisions create large increases and decreases in the

total compensation from working at particular ages. Thus the retirement

benefit inducement to retire results from both income and price (wage)

effects.

     4.    Earnings of Older Employees.

     Like the earnings of younger employees, the earnings of older workers

increased consistently from 1940 to 1970. But after 1970, the earnings of the

oldest employees began to decline, and the earnings of all older workers were

declining by 1980. (See figure 9.) For example, the average 1985 annual

earnings of employees 65 to 69 were about the same in real terms as they were

25 years earlier, in 1960. The 1985 earnings of employees 55 to 59 were lower

than they were in 1970. These data may be affected by selective retirement of

the highest paid employees and by part-time work, but there is ample evidence

of a general decline in real wages across all age groups in the United States

since about 1972. Thus falling real wage earnings may also have contributed

to earlier retirement in recent years.

     5.   The Income of the Elderly.

     Although the labor force participation rates of older Americans have

fallen dramatically in recent years, the average income of the elderly has

increased sharply. Income data have been tabulated by Hurd and Shoven (1982)

for several years between 1963 and 1978.8 (See figures lOa and lob.) Between

1960 and 1980, the labor force participation rates of men 65 and older fell by

37.5 percent. from 31.7 to 19.8. Yet the incomes of the elderly increased

more than three fold over approximately the same time period. The proportion

of income from earnings declined, while the proportion from SS, firm pension

benefits, and government medical plans increased substantially. The Hurd and

Shoven computations include an estimate for the user Cost of housing and an

estimate for the income equivalent of Medicare and Medicaid insurance (valued

at cost). According to their numbers, the proportion of the income of the

elderly derived from their own earnings declined from 29 to 18 percent between

1963 and 1978. Over the same period the proportion from SS, firm pension

plans, and government medical insurance increased from 32 to 51 percent. The



     8The Hurd and Shoven data are based on several U.S. Bureau of the Census
and U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, Social Security
Administration reports, and the 1978 Survey of the Elderly.

proportion of income from assets remained roughly constant. The I-1urd and

Shoven data are based on         income by category. Data by Venti and Wise,

based on median income by category, make it clear that the vast majority of

the income of most elderly families comes from Social Security and pension

benefits. (See figures 6a-6c above.)

     6.   Personal Savjnz.

     Change. in personal saving may also affect retirement decisions.

Personal saving declined from 3 to 6 percent of disposable private income in

the 1950. to around 1 percent in the early l980s, based on computations made

hy Sutnm.ra and Carroll [1987] and reproduced in figure 11. These numbers are

adjusted for inflation and exclude saving by employers through defined benefit

pension plans.9 Without the inflation adjustment, the downward trend begins

only after 1973.     It is clear from papers by Venti and Wise [1987, 1989], for

example, that there is a very large range in personal saving rates, with a

large proportion of the population saving virtually nothing except in the form

of hou.ing equity. Thus the extent to which the aggregate data reflect a

reduction in saving that could impinge on the retirement decisions of an

important proportion of employees is not clear. In any case, less personal

saving, holding other income sources Constant, would typically be associated

with later retirement, clearly not the dominant force in the current trend.

     7.   Summary.

     The trends discussed above are summarized In Figure 12. The labor force

participation of older Americans has declined dramatically since 1940. Social

benefit pension plans under "personal saving." Inflation adjusted saving is
measured saving, minus the inflation rate (the CNP deflator) times net
interest bearing assets.

Security and pension benefits have become the major source of income for the

majority of older persons, and the total income of persons over 65 has

increased enormously, over three fold between 1963 and 1978 alone. (Real

annual earnings of the typical employee are about the same now as they were in

the •arly 1960..) These forces have clearly dominated longer life expectancy

and lower p.r.onal saving that would be expected to prolong labor force

participation. In addition, a fall in real wages since 1970 may have

contributed to earlier retirement in more recent years. Without some change

in labor force participation rate. of older persons, the prospect is that a

smaller s.g.nt of working persona will support an increasingly larger group

of retire...



III. The Incentive Effects of Public and Private Retirement Plans.


     Tb. foregoing discussion highlights the correlates of the reduction in

the labor force participation rates of older Americans, and suggests the

conclusion that the reduction was induced by the introduction of SS and firm

pension plans. The implication is that the adoption of public and private

entitlements to retirement benefits made early retirement possible; it

increased the income available to support retirement consumption. The

discussion below emphasizes the incentive effects inherent in the provisions

of public and private plans, independent of the retirement wealth that they

represent.

     The 1980s have witnessed a marked shift in government policy toward

promoting the labor supply of the elderly. The government has virtually

eliminated mandatory retirement and it has scheduled a gradual increase in the

Social Security retirement age from 65 to 67. It has limited somewhat the
                                     (33)


Social Security earnings test that reduces Social Security benefits for

"retired" workers earning more than an "exempt amount;" it   eliminated   the

arnings test after age 70. and it is increasing the actuarial incentive to

delay the receipt of Social Security benefits beyond age 65.

     The change in the government policy is responsive to the major

demographic swing that is underway and its important implications for

retirement finances in the next century. Given Social Security's pay-as-you-

go method of finance, the projected increase in the ratio of beneficiaries to

contributors means either significant cuts in future benefits or significant

future increases in the Social Security payroll tax.

     Reversing the trend toward early retirement represents an important

alternative for addressing the demographic transition. Additional labor

supply of the elderly would relieve Social Security's finances as well as

offset a potential shortage in the supply of labor relative to that of other

productive factors. In addition, it is argued that for many elderly

prolonging their labor force participation would mean more fulfilling lives.

     What has gone largely unrecognizeo is that, notwithstanding recent

changes in Social Security regulations intended to prolong work, private

pension plan provisions operate powerfully in the opposite direction. The

most prominent theoretical explanations for the firm behavior rest on the

proposition that the efficient structure of the age-wage profile is such that

older workers are paid more than their worth to the firm and must therefore be

encouraged to retire. (See Lazear [1979), for example.) Whether this is in

fact the reason has not been demonstrated. Conversations with pension

managers reveal that in some instances the incentives of the plans are not

fully understood and many plans have been introduced without consideration of
                                          (34)


their effects on retirement. Some special early retirement incentives

(temporary "window" plans) have been introduced to relieve the firm of older

workers so that younger workers could be promoted, or simply as a means of

reducing the size of the firm's workforce.

     Many researchers have pointed to the Social Security system's high

benefit levels and work disincentives as a major contributor to the continuing

trend towards early retirement and a great deal of research has focused on the

effect of Social Security benefits on labor force participation. Recent

examples are blinder, Gordon and Wise (1980], Burkhauser (19801, Hurd and

Boskin (1981], Burkhauser and Quinn [1983], Zurtless and Moffitt (1984],

Hausman and Wise [1985], Burtless (1986], and Gustman and Steinmeier (1986].

With few exceptions -      Hurd and Boskin [19811 and, to some extent, Hausman and

Wise (1985] -   - these   studies attribute only a modest portion of the early

retirement trend to the effect of Social Security provisions, although the

findings may reflect, to some degree, problems of misspecificatton in

accounting for its effects. In contrast, there has been very little work

relating retirement behavior to the retirement incentives provided by pension

plans)0 The apparent reason for this neglect has been the difficulty in

obtaining data that combine the retirement choices of older workers with

information about their past earnings and the specific provisions of their

pension plansj1



     10The most closely related work considers the effect of pension plans on
job mobility (Clark and McDermed [1987), Gustman and Steinmeier [1987], Allen,
Clark, and McDermed [1987), and Allen, Clark, and McDermed [1988]), but not
retirement.

     More recent work of Kotlikoff and Wise [1985, 1987. 19891. Stock and Wise

(1988, 19891, and Lumsdaine, Stock, and Wise [1989) suggests that the

provisions of private pension plans are typically much more important than SS

provisions as determinants of the retirement behavior of workers covered by

such plans. Their detailed analysis of the provisions of private defined

benefit pension plans, which account for roughly three quarters of all pension

plan recipients, indicates that a large proportion of these plans provide very

large incentives to retire early. Virtually all defined benefit plans

incorporate stiff financial penalties for working past the age of 65. and a

very sizable fraction have similarly stiff penalties for working past the

plan's early retirement age, often as young as 55.   Similar evidence is

presented by Bulow (1981], Lazear [1983], Clark and McDermad [1984), Fields

and Mitchell [19841, and Frant and Leonard [19871. Working an additional

year often involves losing, in expected present value of future pension

benefits, an amount equivalent to half a year's non-penaion earnings, if not

more. These retirement incentives in many, if not most, instances are

significantly greater than those ascribed to Social Security.

     We consider first the incentive effects inherent in the SS rules,and then

the incentive effects of private pension plans.


     A.   Social Security.

     The SS benefit amount is based on past individual earnings, although the

relationship between benefits and earnings is not linear. Benefits are a much

larger proportion of the past earnings of low-wage than of high-wage workers.

The initial benefit is based on nominal earnings indexed to age 60 dollars

using the Consumer Price Index (CPI). After retirement (receipt of benefits),

the benefits are indexed to the CPI. The SS normal retirement age is 65. But
                                      (36)


benefits can be taken as young as 62, with the benefit amount actuarially

reduced to reflect the increase in the expected number of retirement years

over which benefits will be received. That is, if the benefit entitlement is

not changed because of a change in earnings, the expected present value of

futur. benefits is the sam. irrespective of the age, between 62 and 65, at

which the benefits are first received. After age 65, however, the increase in

the b.nefits is much less than actuarial, It is now 3 percent per year, but

was only one percent per year until 1981.12

     The easiest way to understand the incentive effects of the benefit

structure is to consider the relationship between the present value of future

benefits and the age of retirement. Such relationships are shown in figures

13a for two representative workers, one a low-wage and the other a high-wage

•mployee. The top part of the graph represents nominal earnings by age (age

50 earnings are in 1980 dollars). The bottom part of the graph represents the

accrual of SS wealth (SSW). it is the change in the present value of SS

benefits between one year and the next. That is, SSAt —           -
                                                          SSW         SSWt1(i+r).
where in this case r is a nominal discount rate taken to be 9 percent. Thus

the figure represents two forms of compensation: one is wage earnings, the

other is the increase in the entitlement to future SS benefits.

     Social Security accrual is a small proportion of wage earnings for the

high-wage worker, but can be a significant proportion for the low-wage worker,

as shown in figure l3b. It is about 6 percent of the wage earnings of the

low-wage worker at age 50 and increases to almost 10 percent at age 62.       If




     12Although the change from 1 percent to 3 percent was the result of a
1977 law, it applied to those who would be 65 in 1981 and later years.

the low-wage worker continues to work from 62 to 65, the accrual is neaatiye,

(10% of the wage at 64). The .1Q in the present value of SS benefits would

be about 39 percent of wage earnings if the person continued to work past age

65. Thus the reduction in total wage and SS compensation between 62 and 66

would be about 50 percent, were the low-wage worker to continue to work. The

reduction in total compensation for the high wage worker would be about 14

percent. Thus the SS inducement to leave the labor force at age 65 is

inversely related to wage earnings.


     B.   Firm Pensions.

     Roughly three quarters of all persons participating in private pension

plans are enrolled in defined benefit plans where benefits are determined

according to a specified formula. The remainder are enrolled in plans where

benefits are directly related to contributions made on behalf of the employee

and to the performance of the plan's investment portfolio. Because most

workers are covered by defined benefit plans and because they are likely to

have the greatest effects on labor market behavior, the discussion here

emphasizes the incentive effects of this type of plan. The evidence is

presented in three sections. The first section discusses the "average"

incentives of a large number of plans. The second section discusses the

incentives of the plan of a single large firm and relates these incentives to

departure rates from the firm. The third section discusses a new econometric

model of retirement and simulations based on the model.

     1.   The Incentive Effects of Typical Plans.

     Kotlikoff and Wise [1985 and 19871 considered the retirement incentive

effects inherent in typical defined benefit plans and have analyzed the

provisions of a large number of firm plans. As with Social Security, it is
                                         (40)


 easiest to exhibit the potential retirement incentive effects of defined

 benefit pension plans by describing the accrual of vested benefits.       Figure 14
 is   taken from Kotlikoff and Wise [19871.     It shows the average accrual rates

 (weighted by plan membership) for U.S. defined benefit plans with selected

 early and normal retirement ages. The pension accrual in a year is the

 increase (or decrease) in the expected discounted value of future pension

benefits that results from working that year. It is the value of deferred

compensation analogous to current wage compensation. Pension accrual is shown

as a percent of wage compensation (the accrual ratio or accrual rate). The

data come from a randon sarnplc of approximately 2500 plans from the Bureau of

Labor Statistics Level of Benefits Survey.13 For each plan, accrual rates are

calculated assuming average wage-tenure profiles in the industry and

occupation to which the plan pertains, based on current population survey
data. 14


       Consider first plans with early and normal retirement at the sante age,

55. a plan stipulation that is common in the transportation industry, for

example. The average decline in the rate of pension wealth accrual at 55 is

equivalent to about 30 percent of wage earnings. If the typical person

covered by such a plan were to continue to work through age 65, pension

accrual would be negative and equivalent to approximately 30 percent of wage

earnings. Whereas at age 54 the pension benefit accrual Is equivalent to

about 30 percent of wage earnings, after age 65 continued work means a loss in



     '3Similar calculations have been made by Lazear [1983] based on the
Bankers Trust Survey of large pension plans.

 pension wealth equivalent to about 30 percent of wage earnings. Thus, between

 these two ages, the decline in the rate of pension wealth accrual is

 equivalent to a 60 percent wage reduction!

      The more common plans with early retirement at 55 and normal retirement

 at 65 typically exhibit an increase in pension wealth accrual to age 55 with a

 decline thereafter. Again, continued work past age 65 is associated with a

 substantial loss in pension wealth, with the decline in accrual equivalent to

 approximately 20 percent of wage earnings. The pension wealth of persons

 covered by plans with early and normal retirement both at 65 increases

 continuously until 65 and then declines by approximately 60 percent, from a

 positive accrual of about 21 percent of salary to a negative accrual of about

 19 percent.

      Thus, based on industry wide earnings profiles, continued employment with

the plan sponsor after the age of early retirement   and, in particular, after
the age of normal retirement1 typically involves a substantial reduction in

total annual compensation because of declines in pension wealth accrual.

     While figure 14 highlights the average characteristics of plans, it is

important to understand that there is a very wide range in plan provisions,

even among plans with the same early and normal retirement
                                                             ages. This is
demonstrated in figure 15. also taken from Kotlikoff and Wise [1987J. The

figure shows average accrual rates for the 513 plans of figure 14 with early

retirement at 55 and normal retirement at 65,
                                                together with upper and lower 5
percentile levels. The lower S percentile points for
                                                       any age group is that
accrual rate such that 5 percent of plans have accruals below the level. The

upper S percentile point is defined analogously. Consider the accrual ratio

at vesting. While the average vesting ratio for this sample is .071, the
                                                        and lower

median .021, the maximum is .383, and the minimum is zero. The ratio at the

lowest five percentile point is 0, while it is .201 at the largest five

percentile level. A similarly large dispersion in annual accrual ratios is

Indicated for each of the ages 40 through 70. The average accrual rates

between ages 55 and 65 are positive, but for many plans the rates by 65 are

very negative.

          Thus while the average plan may provide positive pension accrual at a

particular age, the accrual rate may be substantially negative for some plans.

Even a small proportion of plans that provide a strong incentive to leave the

labor force could have a very substantial effect on observed average labor

force participation rates. Thus it is important to base judgments about the

labor force participation incentive effects of pension plans on more than

average accrual rates.

          2.   The Plan of a Large Firm.

          Whether incentive effects like those described above have an effect on

retirement decisions is a second question. Rotlikoff and Wise [1985, 19891

have addressed this question by considering the relationship between pension

plan provisions and retirement rates in a large Fortune 500 fIrm. That work

Is summarized in this section. The analysis of the firm data shows a very

strong relationship between the plan provisions and departure rates from the

fi nil.


          a.   The Plan. The plan normal retirement age is 65; the early

retirement age Is 55. Vesting occurs after 10 years of service. The plan is

Integrated with Social Security, so that the benefits are reduced (offset) by

some proportion of SS benefits. Figure 16a summarizes the incentive effects

inherent in the plan provisions. The figure shows the pension accrual between

ages 50 and 70 of male managers hired by the firm   in   1960, at age 30. By

1980. they were 50 and had 20 years of service with the firm. The accrual of

Social Security benefits and predicted wage earnings for each year are also

shown. The wage predictions are based on actual average earnings of firm

employees. All of the numbers are In real 1985 dollars.

     At age SO, the typical male manager has wage earnings of about $48,446

per year. Compensation in the form of pension accrual is $2,646, or about 6

percent of wage earnings. If the manager were to retire at this age, he would

be entitled to benefits at 65, based on his earnings in the seven or eight

precedIng years. The benefits wouhi not be available until age 65, and thus

have a relatively low present value at age 50. Normal retirement benefits

could be taken earlier, as early as age 55, but they would be reduced

actuarially such that the present discounted value of the benefits remains

unchanged. The reduction in the benefit would be just enough to offset the

fact that benefits would be received for more years)5

     If the person remains in the firm until age 55 and then retires, however,

benefits are available immediately, and the reduction in benefits for early

retirement is less than the actuarial reduction. In addition, the worker who

remains until age 55 and then retires is eligible to receive a supplemental

benefit until age 65 equal to his Social Security offset. Thus there is a

very large increase in pension wealth at age 55, $72,527, corresponding to the

large spike in the graph. In effect, there is a bonus of $72,527 for

remaining in the firm from age 54 to 55.



     15Not accounting for any real rate of time preference.
                                      (48)


      After age 55, pension accrual falls to about 10 percent of the wage at

 age 60.16 Pension accrual is in fact negative beginning at age 61. The loss

 in compensation between ages 60 and 61 is equivalent to a wage cut of about 16

 percent. Between ages 61 and 65 the loss in pension benefits is equivalent to

 about 20 percent of annual wage compensation. If the worker has 30 or more

 years of service at age 60, he is eligible for full retirement benefits; the

 early retirement reduction factors no longer apply.'7

     Social Security accruals range from about $1,000 to $8,000 between age 50

and 65. After 65, Social Security accrual becomes negative, about -$8,500 at

age 66. At 66, the loss in private pension benefits and Social Security

benefits together amounts to about 32 percent of wage earnings at that age.

(For some groups of employees in the firm, the loss in pension and Social

Security wealth together after age 65 is equivalent to 95 percent of wage

earnings: if these employees continue to work, it is essentially without

compensation.)



     '6The plan provisions stipulate that an additional year of service adds 2
percent to normal retirement benefits per year of service before age 55, but
only j percent per year of service after age 55.

     '7Thus no increase in benefits will result for working another year from
the application of one less year of early retirement reduction, as was the
case before 30 years of service. In addition, for each year that benefits are
not taken between ages 55 and 65, the receipt of benefits for a year without
the Social Security offset (reduction) is foregone. This advantage is lost at
age 65. Thereafter, the loss in benefits from working an additional year is
smaller because this opportunity is no longer available; it was only available
until age 65. The accruals also depend to a small extent on the updating of
the years used in the calculation of "final" earnings. "Final" earnings are
used to determine the pension benefit.

     The data      in   figure 16a are shown in the standard budget constraint form

in figure 16b. Total compensation, including wage earnings, Social Security

wealth, and pension wealth, is graphed against age, beginning at age 50.

There is a discontinuous jump in the graph at age 55, the age at which early

retirement benefits are available on an advantageous basis.

     b.       The Firm Departure Rates.       Departure rates by age and years of

service suggest the effect of pension plan provisions on retirement. They are

shown   for   salesmen by age and years of service in table 1 below.

The yearly departure rate is the proportion of those employed at the beginning

of the year that retires -       - more strictly speaking, leaves the firm - - during
the forthcoming year. Several aspects of the data stand out:                (1) Before 55

departure rates are typically around 3 percent for vested employees; they are

substantially larger for those with less than ten years of service, who are
                                       (50)


not vested. At 55, the early retirement age, they jump to 10 percent or more,

but only for vested employees, those with at least 10 years of service. It is

important to notice that the departure rates stay at that level until age 60,

when there Is another jump in the rate of departure. (2) At age 60, the

departure rates increase very precipitously especially for persons with over

30 years service. For this group full benefits are available because there is

no longer an early retirement reduction according to the plan's rules. For

this group subsequent pension accrual is negative. (3) When Social Security

benefits become available at 62, the departure rates again increase very

sharply, but only for those who are vested in the firm plan.   (4) Finally,

there is a large increase in departure rates at 65, the SS normal retirement

age. Roth pension and SS accruals are negative if the employee continues to

work beyond age 65.

     To understand the potential importance of the early retirement benefits,

suppose that if it were not for this inducement, the departure rates would

remain at 3 percent until age 60 instead of the 10 or 12 percent rates that

are observed. Departure at 3 percent per year means that 14 percent of those

who were employed at 55 would have left before age 60;   at 11 percent per

year, 44 percent would leave between 55 and 59.

     Cumulative departure rates for all employees are shown in table 2 below

for three years, together with the rates by age. The cumulative rates are one

minus the percent who have departed.

Given employment at age 50, the cumulative rate a show the percent still

employed at older ages. 8as ed on the 1981 and 1983 departure rates, only 48

percent of those employed at 50 would still be employed at 60, and then 17

percent of these would leave.       Only 10 percent would remain until age 65, and

then about 50 percent of these would leave.

     These data also show the effect of a special early retirement incentive

(a "window plan) that was in effect in 1982 only. For employees who were

eligible for early retirement in 1982, the incentive program provided a bonus

of up to one year's salary.     t    is   clear that the effect of the incentive was

large: while the departure rates for 1981 and for 1983 are virtually

identical, the 1982 rates were much higher. For example, the departure rate
                                       (52)


 for 60 year olds was 17 percent in 1981 and 1983, but 29 percent in 1982. Of

 those employed at age 50, 40 percent would still have been employed after age

 60 based on the 1983 and 1983 departure rates. Only 27 percent would remain

 after age 60 based on the 1982 rates, Even under the normal plan, only 10

percent of those employed at age 50 would still be employed at 65. Only 2

percent would remain until 65 with the special incentive.

      c.   An Option Value Model of Retirement.

     The discussion above demonstrates the large incentive effects inherent in

the provisions of defined benefit pension plans and shows that these

inccntivcc have very substantial effects on fire retlre.Tel't Card other

departure) rates. An additional goal of research in this area is to predict

the effect on retirement rates of thanges in firm pension plan and SS

provisions.

     i.    The Model. Two basic approaches, in addition to least squares

regression, have been used in recent years to analyze retirement behavior.

The first is the method of estimation developed to analyze the choices of

Individuals who face discontinuous or kinked budget constraints, The central

feature of this method is a lifetime budget constraint analogous to the

standard labor-leisure budget constraint, but with annual hours of work

replaced by years of labor force participation, and annual earnings replaced

by cumulative life-time compensation. The optimal age of retirement is

determined by a utility function defined over years of work (post-retirement

years of leisure) and cumulative compensation. A careful application of this

approach to retirement is by Burtless [19861, who analyzed the effects of

changes in Social Security benefits on retirement]8 While appealing in many



     '8An analogous model was used by Venti and Wise [1984] to describe the
rent paid by low income families faced with discontinuous budget constraints.
Earlier papers that develop these techniques are Hausman and Wise [19801 and
gurtless and Hausman [1978)
                                         (53)



respects, this procedure has an important drawback. It implicitly assumes

that individuals know with certainty the opportunities -    - like   wage rates - -

that   will be available to them in the distant future. The hazard model is the

second approach. As implemented to date it is essentially a reduced-form

technique designed to capture the effects on retirement of movements in

variables such as Social Security wealth. Implementations of the hazard model

have not been as "forward looking" as the non-linear budget constraint

specifications.19      On the other hand, unexpected shocks, like sudden changes

in earnings, enter the analysis ver1 naturally.

       The Option Value Model as specified by Stock and Wise [1989] Incorporates

the advantages of both of the approaches described above. It allows updating

of information, as does the traditional hazard model, but also considers

potential compensation many years in the future, as does the nonlinear budget
                       20
constraint approach.        The key ideas of the model can be summarized briefly.



     19Thus in Hausman and Wise [1985]. for example,    changes from the current
period to the next, in earnings, pension wealth, and    the increment to pension
wealth, are allowed to affect the decision to retire    in the next period, but
expectations of these values several years hence are    not.

       20Antecedents of the Stock and Wise model begin with Lazear and Moore
[3988], who argue that the option value of postponing retirement is the
appropriate variable to enter in a regression equation explaining retirement.
Indeed it was their work and analysis of military retirement rates by Phillips
and Wise [1987) that motivated Stock and Wise to pursue this approach. The
Stock and Wise model is close in spirit to the stochastic dynamic programming
model of Rust [1989]. Rust's [1989] model poses substantially greater
numerical complexity than the Stock and Wise model and has not yet been
estimated for retirement. In principle, he observes not only the individual's
retirement age, but subsequent consumption decisions as well. Thus his model
allows the individual to optimize over age of retirement and future
consumption jointly. The individual's decision is modeled as the solution to
a stochastic dynamic programming problem. As in the Stock and Wise case, the
individual's expectations are conditioned on current known variables such as
income. The idea is to recover the parameters of a utility function specified
in terms of these choice variables. In practice, though, he uses income to
                                      (54)



 It is intended to capture an important empirical regularity, the



 describe consumption (Rust (19881), with a value function similar to that of
 Stock and Wise, specified in terms of income. To simplify the solution to the
 dynamic programming problem in his model, he assumes that random unobserved
 individual components are independent over time, whereas Stock and Wise allow
 such terms (representing differences among individuals in health status,
 desire for leisure, and the like) to be correlated. In short. Rust has
described a solution to a more complicated choice than Stock and Wise, but
with uncorrelated errors, whereas the Stock and Wise model is a solution to a
less complex problem, but with corre1ated errors. A "dynamic Programming"
model of employment behavior has also been proposed by Berkovec and Stern
[1988]. Berkovec and Stern's analysis is also in progress. They consider
transirons among three employment starps over time. To sflmp]ifv the o1utim
to their optir"ization problem, they assume that disturbance terms are
uncorrelated over time, except for an individual-specific random effect.
Their analysis is in terms of individual attributes like education, race,
health status, and age. Government benefits like Social Security are not
explicitly modeled, whereas these benefits, as well as firm pension benefits
play the central role in the Stock and Wise analysis. Stock and Wise estimate
a discount, or weighting factor, whereas they obtain estimates of other
parameters conditional on an assumed discount rate. Age itself is used
explicitly to estimate retirement. Age is not a direct determinant of
retirement in the standard version of the Stock and Wise model. This has
important implications if the model is to be used to predict the effect of
changes in firm pension plan or SociaL Security provisions on retirement.
Neither Rust nor Berkovec and Stern, however, have information on private
pension plan provisions, the focus of the Stock and Wise analysis. The
retirement decision rule proposed by Stock and Wise as an approximation to
individual behavior is much simpler than the dynamic programming rule. A
concomitant of this assumption is also much simpler econometric implementation
than the burdensome calculations imposed by the dynamic programming rule.
These simplificatjons reduce the computational
                                               requirements substantially
while retaining the key forward-looking features of the dynamic programming
approach. Of course both of these models are theoretical abstractions. The
important consideration is which decision rule is the better approximation to
the calculations that govern actual individual behavior.   The answer to this
question will have to await further analysis. Stock and Wise show that the
rule they assume predicts individual choices well; but the predictive
validities of the alternative decision rules have not been compared
                                             (55)


irreversibility of the retirement decision. Although it is not uncommon to

work -.   at   least part-time --   after    "retirement," it is rare to return to the

job from which one has retired. The model focuses on the opportunity cost of

retiring or, equivalently, on the value of retaining the option to retire at a

later date. It has two key aspects. The first is that a person will Continue

to work at any age if the option value of continuing work is greater than the

value of immediate retirement. In effect, the person compares the best of

expected future possibilities -.       the   option value of continuing to work - -

with   the value of retiring now. The second is that the individual reevaluates

this retirement decision as more information about future earnings -         - and    thus

future retirement benefits -- becomes available with age. For example, a

decline in the wage between ages 56 and 57 will cause the individual to

reassess future wage earnings. and thus future pension benefits and Social

Security accrual as well. Thus retirement may seem more advantageous upon

reaching 57 than it was expected to be at age 56. Retirement occurs when the

value of continuing work falls below the value of retiring.

       ii. Simulations of the Effect pf Chanees in Pension and SS Provisions.

To illustrate the potential to affect retirement behavior through changes in

pension and SS provisions, three simulations from Stock and Wise 11988] and

one from Lujnsdajne, Stock, and Wise [19891 are discussed here.

       (a). Increase the Firm Early Retirement Ae from 55 to 60.           The effect

of increasing the firm's early retirement age from 55 to 60, leaving other

provisions as they were, is shown in figure 17. Under the current plan 65

percent of those employed at 50 have left before age 60. Only 42 percent
                                         (56)

would    have left before age 60 if early retirement had been at 60 instead of

 55. Only 13.6 percent of employees leave between 55 and 59 if early

retirement is at 60, whereas 45.5 percent leave between these ages under the

current system. On the other hand, because the early retirement "bonus" is

now farther in the future, more employees leave the firm between 50 and 54.

This is the result of the greater weight given to current versus future

income. In short, many more workers would be employed between the ages of 57

and 65 if the early retirement age were 60 instead of 55.

      (b). Increase the SS Early Retirement Reduction Factor. Social Security

benefits can be taken beginning at age 62, but the curlent Social Scuriiy
rules include a benefit reduction of 5/9 percent per month of retirement
before   age 65.21 The simulated effect of increasing the reduction factor to 1

percent per month is shown in figure 18. It is clear that the effect of this

change is small relative to the effect of the change in the firm
                                                                   early
retirement age. This is primarily because only a small fraction of    firm

employees are still working at age 62, only 21 percent in the base case. The

retirement rates of those still employed at age 62, however, are considerably

lower --   about 14 percent -- with the higher reduction factor. They are also
lower at 63.    Still, the net result on the employment of persons covered
                                                                             by
the firm's pension plan is negligible.

     (c). Increase the SS Retirement Ages by One Year. Current plans are to

increase the Social Security retirement age from 65 to 67 by 2027. To judge



    21Th1s reduction is intended to be actuarially fair.

the effect of such a change on workers with pension plans like the one in this

firm, Stock and Wise [19881   simulated   the effect of increasing the normal

retirement age from 65 to 66 and the early retirement age from 62 to 63. The

results are in figure 19. Again, the effect on the retirement rates of

persons in this firm is small. This is true even though the effect on the

annual retirement rates of 62 and 65 year. olds is substantial. The retirement

rate of 62.year-olds is reduced from 33.9 to 25.2 percent. The rate at 65 is

reduced from 28.6 to 25.1. But only a few workers remain in the firm to be

affected by these changes.

      (d). The Effect of a Special Window Plan. During 1982, the firm had a

special retirement incentive program (a "window" plan) that provided up to one

years salary, in addition to regular retirement benefits, for employees who

retired in that year. The effects of this plan on the retirement behavior of

non.inanagerial office workers were simulated by Lumsdaine, Stock, and Wise

[1989) and are shown in figure 20.        For comparison, the figure shows

retirement rates in 1981 and then actual and simulated retirement rates in

1982. (Evidence on the effects of this plan is also shown in table 2 above.)

It is clear that the plan had a very large effect.        Annual departure rates

were more than doubled for many age groups. In addition, the figure indicates

the extent to which the option value model was able to predict the effect of

this exogenous change in "retirement benefits."



IV.   Summary.


      The labor force participation of older Americans has declined

dramatically since the inception of Social Security and the tax inducement to

develop firm pension plans. Between 1937 and 1980 the participation rate of

men over 60 fell from about 62 to about 32 percent, and it continues to

decline. Even the rate for older women has declined since 1970.         It seems

evident that the decline has resulted from the retirement income made possible

by these programs. The vast majority of the income of most retirees now comes

from pension and Social Security benefits. Most retirement age families have

almost no personal saving other than housing wealth. Yet the average income

of older families has increased dramatically in the past three decades,

possibly three fold between 1963 and 1978 alone. With reference to figure 1,

the retirement benefits curve has been raised. From the point of view of the

individual, the wealth associated with SS and firm pension benefits encourages

eatlli. retileineiiL.

        But it is not only the amount of the SS and pension wealth that matters.

Ilow it accumulates is also important. For example, if no benefits were

available until age 70, few employees would retire at age 55. If retirement

wealth accumulates rapidly between 55 and 60 and then starts to decline,

employees have an incentive to retire soon after age 60.        In effect, the

reduction in the accumulation of retirement wealth is like a reduction in the

wage; both reduce the incentive for labor force participation. In fact, the

formulas determining firm pension benefits in particular tend to encourage

continued employment with the firm until some age -   - often   between 55 and 60
-   - and provide an incentive to leave the firm thereafter - - the annual

addition to retirement wealth is reduced or even negative. The addition to

retirement wealth after age 65 is almost always negative. The amount of the

retirement benefit is not increased enough for a person who retires one year

later to offset the fact that the benefit is received for one year less.

       Thus even though individuals are living longer and even though a larger

fraction of the population is old, workers are leaving the labor force at
                                     (63)



younger and younger ages. The retired portion of the population is

increasing, the employed portion is declining. Whether by intent or by

happenstance, firm pension plan and Social Security provisions continue to

encourage this trend.
