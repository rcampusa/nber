                             The Welfare Analysis of
                           Product Innovations with an

                                     ABSTRACT




     The main goal of this paper is to put forward a methodology for the measure-
ment of product -innovations using a value metric, i.e., equating the 'magnitudet
of innovations with the welfare gains that they generate. This research design is
applied to the case of Computed Tomography (CT) Scanners, a revolutionary
innovation in medical technology. The econometric procedure centers on the esti-
mation of a discrete choice model (the nested mult-inominal logit), that yeilds the
parameters of a utility function defined over the - changing - quality dimensions
of the innovative product. The estimated flow of social gains from innovation is
used primarily to compute a social rate of return to R&D, to explore the inter-
relation between innovation and diffusion, and to trace the time profile of benefits
and costs, the latter suggesting the possible occurance of 'technological cycles'.

    I. Introduction

        Technological change has long been regarded as an economic phenomenon of

    paramount importance, be it in accounting for the secular growth of the economy

 at large, or the dynamic performance of individual sectors.        Yet, our

 understanding of it remains precarious, partly because theory had been for too

 long in the grip of the 'circular flow' mode of thought (in Schumpeter's words),

but more importantly, because of the pervasiveness of measurement problems.

This means, first, that many of the basic notions used to describe and analyze

technical change do not have clear empirical counterparts (e.g., stock of

knowledge, appropriability, spill—overs, etc.), and second, that the data

required to quantify those notions - when at all possible - are for the most

part unconventional and difficult to obtain.

        Those problems are the most severe when it comes to the study of
-    as opposed to         -
                               innovations,   since these come about and manifest

themselves in dimensions other than prices and quantities (the familiar turf of

economists), and cannot be easily reduced back to them. This is rather

disturbing, particularly so in view of the fact that product innovations have

become in the last few decades the most prevalent form of technical change.1

Moreover, it is quite clear that the measures of technical advance commonly

used, do not and cannot capture the impact of this type of innovations upon

the economic magnitudes of interest, be it 'real' income or productivity growth

(see Griliches [1919]). Thus, we are at risk of being constantly misled by

economic indicators that purport to gauge overall economic performance, but

in fact overlook a main ingredient of such performance. At the micro level, -in




      1See, for example, Mansfield [1968] and [1977], and Scherer [1980].
                                              -2-



    turn, we lack for the same reason basic empirical evidence -    or   'stylized facts'

    -   about the innovative process, and hence the proliferation of theoretical
-
    models, often yielding contradictory results, that cannot be either supported or
    refuted.

          Responding to those concerns, it is our main goal here to conceptualize and

    give an operational content to the notion of product innovations, in order to

    enable their empirical measurement. Mindful that the 'acid test' of any

    research design lies in its actual implementation, we apply the resulting

    methodology to a specific innovation in the realm of medical technologies,

    namely, Computed Tomography (CT) scanners. Even though there is little -       if   any
    -
        novelty   in the theoretical and econometric building blocks of the proposed

    methodology, we know of no previous attempt to explicitly measure product

    innovations in an economically meaningful way.2 Thus, we dwell extensively on a

    variety of implementation issues and, although these are discussed with

    reference to a specific case study, what can be learned from them is hopefully

    of general interest.

          A remark regarding the meaning of an economic 'measure' of innovations:

    given that the 'output' of innovative activity does not present itself in

    countable units of any sort,3 a quantifiable dimension for innovations can only

    be defined in value terms, i.e., in terms of their impact upon social welfare.

    In other words, the question of 'how much' innovation there was or occured in a



        2The only study that comes close is Mansfield et al [1977], but product
    innovations are in fact treated there as process innovations.

        3strictly speaking, such output consists of 'bits of new and socially useful
    knowledge', which is clearly an all but impossible notion to quantify. Patent
    counts will not do either, in view of the enormous variance in their scientific,
    technological and economic significance.
                                           -3--




certain field during a certain period of time is exactly equivalent to, and can

only be interpreted as asking, how much additional social surplus (i.e.,

consumer plus producer surplus) was generated by those innovations. Other

measures such as counts of patents or of 1important innovationst, rates of

change of attributes, sales of new products, etc., could at best play the role

of proxies, and their accuracy as such can be judged only by relating them to

the value measure put forward here.


II. The Definition and Measurement of Product Innovations

       The natural conceptual framework in which to analyze product innovations is

the so—called 'characteristics' approach.4 In it, products are thought of as

bundles of attitudes that enter explicitly in the utility function of consumers,

rather than as abstract entities having only a quantity dimension. The

analytical advantages of such an approach -       pertinent   to the study of innovation
-   are immediately apparent: first, it vastly reduces the dimensionality of the

optimization problem confronting agents in markets for differentiated and

technologically progressive products, since a relatively small number of

characteristics can span a much larger and even growing number of products.

Second, it allows one to analyze explicitly substitution effects, and hence to

derive the demand for new -   actual   or potential -   products.   More generally, the

representation of products as vectors -in attributes' space rescues the notion of

product quality from the sterile domain of exogeneously given tastes, thus

allowing to separate analytically between quality changes and changes in



    4Actually, this is not a unique, universally agreed—upon (sub)paradigm, but
an umbrella under which a diverse collection of analytical set-ups have been
formulated, e.g, Lancaster's original demand model and his subsequent
generalization (Lancaster [1966], [1971) and [1979]), the household production
function (Becker [1965], Muth [1966}, etc), the "hedonic" model of Rosen [1974],
                                         —4-


preferences.5 Quite surprisingly, however, the characteristics' approach has

rarely been applied to the study of product innovation: most existing

applications have to do instead with static product different-iatiori. We hope to

make some progress here in filling in the gap.

       We start therefore by representing a product -    or   brand    within a given

'product class'6 as s (z,p). z =             (ZiiZi2i•Zim)        being the vector of

relevant characteristics (that is, U. =      U(z),   U/az. t 0), and         its price.

Thus, the choice set from which the consumer selects the most preferred brand is

S =
       (si,s2,...,sn).
       Following the discussion on the nature of characteristics in Trajtenberg

[1979], we distinguish between concatenable and non-concatenable

characteristics,7 the former being formally defined as


                                   az.
                 z. .   = f(x.),
                             1     ax.   0      for x.        0



and the latter as


etc.

    5That is, in traditional demand analysis the qualities of products are
embedded in the structure of preferences, and therefore quality changes manifest
themselves as, and cannot be disentangled from changes in tastes. An important
implication of being able to separate between the two phenomena is that it is
then much more plausible to assume that preferences, defined over attributes
rather than over a given set of goods, do in fact remain stable in the face of
a changing universe of products. Needless to say, the stability assumption is
indeed central for much of micro theory.

    6By 'product class' we mean a well-defined set of close substitutes located
in a common space of attributes, and comprising a separable utility branch. We
shall return to this rather recalcitrant issue when discussing the specification
of the decision tree.

    7This terminology, borrowed from the theory of measurement (see Krantz et al
[1971]), was meant to focus attention on the physical properties that underlie
the different kinds of measurement, and their implications for economic
                                         —5-


                                   az.
               z.    =   g3(G.),         =0      for all     x. >   0.1
                13           1     ax                         1




where 0. denotes the 'natural unit' of product I and
                                                     x1 its quantity. Typical
examples of concatenable characteristics are proteins in food products, or

carrying capacity of vehicles, i.e., the amount of the characteristics available

to the consumer is a monotonic function -      usually   linear -   of    the quantity of

the product(s) that he/she chooses to consume. Non-concatenable charac-

teristics, on the other hand, are much closer to the intuitive notion of

'quality', that is, they are properties inherent to the product as such, and do

not vary with its quantity (e.g., speed of vehicles, aperture of photographic

cameras, etc.). Therefore, different amounts of characteristics can be obtained

only by switching products, and not by quantity adjustments. This distinction

carries interesting implications for economic behavior and competition, as

suggested in Trajtenberg [1979]. However, for our purposes here the relevant

issue is that, for there to be a distinct and meaningful notion of product inno-

vation, some of the characteristics (i.e., at least one) have to be non-

concateriable. Otherwise, the choice set would be homogeneous of degree zero in

prices and characteristics, which in turn implies that, regardless of their pre-

ferences, consumers would necessarily, be indifferent between price reductions

and proportional increases in the per-unit quantity of all characteristics. But




behavior. Concatenation is an operation by which objects are connected with
respect to some common attribute, alowing for 'extensive measurement' (e.g., the
placing of rods edge to edge for the measurement of length). Other authors have
used terms such as additive, or combinable (and their respective antinomes) to
make similar - if less precise - distinctions between types of characteristics.
if so then the distinction between process innovations (normally associated with

costs and hence price reductions) and product innovations (which is intuitively

linked to changes in attributes) all but vanishes, at least from the viewpoint

of their effects. Furthermore, consider the case where there is a change in,

say, product s1 =      (z,p)   such that s =   (Az,Ap),   X > 1. If all

characteristics were concatenable, then the transition from s. to s could not
                                                                  1       1


be regarded as an innovation at all, for it is totally inconsequential

for behavior, and more importantly here, for welfare (it should be clear that

V(s.,y) =   V(s.,y),   where V(S) -is the indirect utility function and y money

income). To sum up, the point is that the notion of product innovation is

inextricably related to and presupposes the existence of an independent quality

dimension, and since non-concatenability is essential for the latter, it is by

extension a sine qua non for the former.

     With this caveat in mind, we define product innovation simply as dS/dt (or

just AS), that is, as improvements over time in existing products, and/or

additions of new products to the set.8 This is, however, just a first step:

given the lack of commensurability between attributes of products in a given

set, and more so between attributes of products belonging to different product

classes, AS cannot render by itself meaningful economic measures of product

innovations. In fact, AS comprises just some of the raw data needed to

construct such measures. If, for example, S refers to computers, how can an x

percent increase in, say, speed of computation be linked to a y percent increase

in storage capacity? And moreover, how do these advances compare to an



    8Actually, AS may consist at times of 'negative' product innovation,
i.e., of the deterioration of existing products, and/or the net contraction of
the choice set. The definition above was meant to be general and encompass
those cases as well, and hence to be more precise one should substitute in it

improvement in the gas mileage of cars, or in the fidelt-ly of a stereo set?

This resembles the problem arising -in the construction of any aggregate measure

of economic performance, such as GNP: without appropriate price indices, the

rate of change of individual outputs are of little help. Furthermore, these

prices are supposed to reflect both marginal benefits to consumers and marginal

costs, so that the resulting value measures have normative significance.

Similarly, what we need to know in the present context is not, say, how much

faster and 'smarter' are today's computers, but what is the 'worth' of such

improvements to consumers, and the value of resources spent to bring them

about.

      Thus, what we want is a 'surplus' —    or   net social benefit —   function   W(S),

such that the extent of product innovation (which is, to insist, tantamount to

the social gains accruing from it) would be measured by


                   =           —
(1)
                       W(St)       W(Si)
      Assuming for a moment, and for illustrative purposes only, that W(') j

linear -in the characteristics,9 the problem resides in finding a set of

'marginal utility' coefficients, , such that the changes (innovations)

occurring from one period to the next in the set of products offered to

consumers would be evaluated by



(2)               =




'changes' for 'improvements.'

    9That will certainly not be the case in the analysis below; the linearity
assumption should be seen just as an expositional device.
                                      -8-

     However, these 's are not directly observable but have to be inferred

from an indirect piece of evidence, namely, the relative frequencies of actual

choices (i.e., the market shares of the different products in S), which

presumably reflect the structure and distribution of preferences in attributes

space.1° The main task ahead is thus to model the demand for products in S. so

as to be able to formulate an appropriate W function, and estimate something

akin to those    coefficients.



     a. The scope of AW and its limitations

     In the foregoing discussion we have referred to changes in characteristics,

without mentioning prices explicitly. In fact, AS was meant to comprise changes

in prices as well, and hence AW refers to the 'net' social benefits from having

the set St rather than       all things considered (think of price in (2) as

another characteristic, and the corresponding coefficient as the marginal

utility of income). It could be argued, however, that this is too broad a

measure, and that for some purposes the impact of changes in characteristics

(the 'pure' product innovation component) should be separated from the welfare

effect of price changes. After all - so the argument goes -   price   changes often

reflect phenomena that have little to do with innovation per se, e.g., changes

in oligopolistic pricing strategies, variations in input prices, etc. Even

though such a view is not without merit, we shall still stand by the broad

definition of AW, primarily because of pragmatic reasons: First, almost any

plausible W function will not be additive-linear in its arguments, and therefore



   10To put it in intuitive terms: If, for example, consumers are observed
to choose more often TV sets having sharper images rather than those with larger
screens (controling for all other attributes and price), then the 13• associated
with 'image quality' will be large relative to that of 'screen sized; this in
                                       -9-


 it is not clear how the two effects could actually be sorted out, without

 resorting to arbitrary procedures (local approximations would be helpful only

 for small changes, and not for discrete displacements of the choice set).

 Second, a great deal of what goes into S usually consists of additions of new

 products, and the dropping out of outmoded ones; for those 'births and 'deaths'

 it is simply meaningless to talk of a separate price effect, since by definition

there is no prior or posterior reference point to which the current price of the

new good (or the last price of a displaced brand) could be compared. This

problem is even more serious in view of the fact that in many instances it is

very difficult to distinguish between a change in an existing product from, say,

s.
 1 to s 1 on the one hand, and the simultaneous birth of s' and death of s.
                                                          -I                 1


on the other hand. In any case, it should be borne in mind that the whole point

of the methodology to be presented here is to deal with technologically dynamic

sectors, that is, with classes of products where innovation is the dominant

force, propelling directly or indirectly most of the observed changes, be they

in characteristics or in prices. Quite apart from the practical issues just

mentioned, it is clear that for those sectors the broad definition is indeed the

most appropriate.

     A brief comment on the scope of W: as suggested previously W(.) stands

for what is usually called the 'total surplus' function, that is, the sum of

consumer and producer surplus. There is, however, an important difference




turn will be reflected in the benefits from innovations in TV technology, which
are to be computed as some function of the improvements in image quality and
screen size, weighted by their respective marginal values.
                                      -10--



between them: profit (producer surplus) is a well-defined magnitude whose

measurement does not pose special difficulties, except f or the standard

practical problems of reconciling accounting with economic profits, and

obtaining the appropriate data. The fact that we are dealing with innovative

sectors rather than with static products is, quite clearly, of no consequence

whatsoever in that respect. The problem lies entirely in the specification and

estimation of the - changes in - consumer surplus; thus, we shall for the most

part ignore profits and associate W with the gains from innovation that are not

appropriated by the innovating firms, but passed on to consumers.

     Finally, two limitations of the approach put forward here should be brought

into the open. First, the proposed measure of gains from innovation,

actually excludes the possibility of directly assessing 'radical' innnovations,

that is, the introduction of entirely new products that cannot be fitted into

existing product classes, but span instead new classes of their own. The reason

is plain and simple: in order to compute W, there has to be an S and an a W(S)

to begin with, that is, something to compare the innovation to (the null set

does not qualify for Obvious reasons), and a yardstick to evaluate the

difference between old and new. However, these are precisely the conditions

that are not fulfilled by radical innovations."

     It could be argued that any new product, be it as revolutionary as -it may,




   It is interesting to note that Kuznets had clearly foreseen this limitation
long ago; -in a seminal paper on the nature of innovative activity he wrote:

     '. .If an invention involves a new product, a rough approximation
     to its economic magnitude seems to be possible only if the new product
     can be treated as a substitute for the old one so that it again beco-

 could be seen as belonging in some way or another to existing product classes,12

 and would therefore be amenable to this kind of welfare analysis. That may well

 be the case at some ultimate level of abstraction, but the relevant issue is,

 once more, pragmatic rather than conceptual: is there enough in common between

 the presumed breakthrough and existing product sets, so that the innovation

could be meaningfully evaluated -in the context of preferences already defined

over those sets? Or, alternatively, does its appearance bring about a

reformulation of preferences, very much like quality changes do in the context

of traditional demand theory? If the latter -is true, then we cannot estimate

directly (i.e., via W) the gains resulting from the introduction of the radical

innovation, that is, the discrete jump between not having anything of the kind,

and having the first commercial units. Of course, we can estimate the benefits

stemming from improvements from then on, provided only that enough variants

(i.e., different brands) of the new product appear -in the market, so as to make

the parameters of the emerging preferences statistically identifiable.    However,

the limitation is not unsurmountable: we shall show later on a way of obtaining

indirect estimates even of those elusive initial gains, that rely upon the

interaction over time between innovation and diffusion.

     The second limitation has to do with the fact that, by confining our

attention to the evaluation of changes within a given set S2. we leave out

spill-over effects, that -is, improvements -in other product sets (or processes)

resulting from the original advances -in S2. There -is nothing in the approach

itself that precludes, in principle, the inclusion of such externalities: if



        put it differently, -it can be argued that there is a limited number of
higher-level, all-encompassing 'wantst a la Karl Menger, or utility branches a
la Gorman or Strotz, so that any conceivable object, if desired and hence
consumed at all, will fall by necessity into one of those categories.
                                          —12--



there was information tracing these ripple effects from, say, AS to ASkI then

one could compute also        add it to AW2, dnd assign the total to the original

innovation. It is, however, very unlikely that such information could be

obtained, and moreover, -it   is   extremely hard to determine how much of ASk was

actually due to AS2, as opposed to independent developments -in     the other sector

itself. Likewise, as time elapses the once specific and localized scientific

and technological advances underlying AS2 become part of the general stock of

knowledge, making the identification of causal nexus between particular

innovations, and the proper assignment of down-the-line benefits a rather

hopeless task. Thus, the measures arrived at by looking only at S2 should be

regarded as conservative estimates, or lower bounds to the 'true' social gains

generated by any particular innovation.13



III. The Formal Derivation of the Surplus Function

     As mentioned above, AWt stands for the gains, in terms of consumer-surplus,

generated by changes over time in the set of available products. Thus, the

function W(St) is to be obtained by integrating an appropriately defined demand

system, which characteristics would depend in turn upon the nature of the choice

set S, e.g., on whether it is continuous or discrete, whether it comprises a

finite or an infinite number of porducts, etc.

     In order to gain some intuitive understanding of the matter, let us review

first the simple case whereby S consists of a single product having one quality



   134n innovation might also have what could be regarded as 'negative
externalities': Its appearance may render existing products obsolete 'before
their time' or, looked at from a more basic viewpoint, it may speed up the
depreciation of the social stock of knowledge. It is not as yet clear whether
these effects should be taken into account, and if so, how.

 dimension, q.14 Denoting by x(p,q) the demand function, and assuming away income

 effects, the benefit to consumers of a 'small' quality improvement S:

                          p

        Note that (3) and (3') measure the additional area under the demand curve,

brought about by its upward shift in response to the change in quality. To put

it differently, (3) stands for the marginal willingness to pay for quality

improvements, which is precisely the conceptual tool needed to evaluate product

innovations. It is worth keeping this in mind since the interpretation of W is

basically the same in all the models of interest.

        A brief note on the continuous case. Strictly speaking, this refers to

choice sets having infinitely many products that span a continuous spectrum in

attributes space. More pragmatically, the assumption can be taken to mean that

there is a sufficiently large number of contiguous products (and corresponding

markets) so that, for all practical purposes, consumers and producers can be

thought of as engaging in marginal optimization. This case has been examined in

a seminal paper by Rosen [1974] and, notwithstanding some remaining problems, it

seems that the framework and tools developed there could be adapted for the

assessment of product innovations. Needless to say, that would be warranted



   14For a detailed analysis of various versions of this case, see Willig
(1978]; see also Spence [1975] for a particular application of the same
construct.
                                        —14-


only in those instances where at least the mild version of the continuity

assumption -is empirically justified.

     In the discrete case it is assumed that the choice set Consists of a finite

number of different brands, these being located far enough from each other in

attributes space so as to preclude marginal adjustments.15 This is, in our view,

the case that corresponds more closely to technologically progressive products,

both theoretically and empirically,16 and we shall therefore concentrate on it.

Besides its referring to a property of the choice set, discreteness is commonly

used also to describe a behavioral pattern, i.e., when consumers purchase a

single unit of a single product out of the set, making the choice problem

exclusively qualitative rather than quantitative (incidentally, note that

neither aspect of discreteness entails the other). We shall assume throughout

that discreteness holds also in this latter sense, although the analysis can be

easily extended to accommodate cases of continuous/discrete choice as well (see,

for example Hanemann [1984]).

     Having thus defined the setting of the problem, we can now draw from the

extensive literature, on discrete choice in order to specify the demand side and

derive the surplus function.17 For the benefit of readers unfamiliar with this



   15Recall also that we assume non-concatenable characteristics, and hence we
rule out the possibility fo spanning a piece-wise continuous choice set from a
finite number of brands, as -in Lancaster [1971].

   16Simply put, the theoretical argument is that investment in R&D constitutes
a fixed cost, and hence -in any innovative sector there will be in equilibrium a
finite number of firms (brands) n*. Moreover, we know from the theory of
monopolistic competition that n is inversely related to the height of those
fixed costs, and hece the more R & 0 intensive a sector is, the smaller —
ceteris paribus - n would be. Thus, it is more reasonable to characterize
technologically progressive sectors as having discrete rather than continuous
choice sets; this is borne out by what we usually observe in the real world.

   17We rely here primarily on McFadden [1981], and Small and Rosen [1981].

 literature, and in order to set the stage for the subsequent analysis, we review

 first the ma-in ingredients of these models.

       The basic hypothesis underlying discrete choice models of demand for

differentiated products is that consumers maximize a random utility function,


 (4)            Max U. =   U(z,m;h)   +
                i ,m


                s.t. p + in =    y,   s. £ S



where in stands for a composite outside good whose price has been normalized to

unity, h is a vector of observable attributes of the individual, and €1 is an

-i.i.d, random disturbance (the rest of the notation has been defined above); for

notational simplicity the subscript for individuals has been omitted everywhere.

The error term c encompasses unobserved - and presumably less important -

attributes   of the individual and the product, and perhaps also an idiosyncratic

and irreducible element of randomness in tastes. Thus, individual choices

cannot be predicted with certainty, but depend upon the - unobserved -

realizations   of c. From the researchers! point of view, this implies having to

construct probabilistic rather than deterministic demand functions, conditional

on S and h

       The problem -in (4) is formally solved in two stages: first, the consumer

chooses the optimal quantity of m given s1, and then the optimal s e S. Since

by assumption only one unit of the product is purchased, the first stage is

trivial, i.e., the optimal quantity of the outside good -     conditional on s — is
just m* =              Substituting it for in in (4) renders the conditional indirect

utility function

      Denoting by f(e1) the density function of the residuals and by F(c.) the
corresponding cumulative distribution, and recalling that they are assumed to be

-Li.d., we can define the probability of choosing s. as



(7)                     Pr(s,       S,h) =
                                                        ll1F(c1

      The exact form of ir will depend, of course, upon the distribution of the

error terms: if, for example, these are normally distributed, then (7) -is just

the cumulative normal, and the resulting model -is the Probit. On the other

hand, if the residuals conform to the type I extreme-value (or Weibull)

distribution, then it      will     be logistic, i.e.,
                                            n
(8)             it.   = exp(V.)     /   E          exp(V)                       I =    1,...,n.
                                            j=1


      This is the well-known conditional multinomial logit model, hereafter

referred to as the MNL. The Prob-it and the logit - and some variants of them -

have been and remain the most commonly used choice models, at least within the

random utility framework. In our case the Probit had to be discarded from the
                                                                —17--



outset for pragmatic reasons: we had to estiamte models involving choice sets

of up to twenty alternatives, whereas with present-day computer capabilities the

Probit can successfully handle only up to four or five. Thus, we shall use

throughout the MNL, paying due attention to the limitations of the model that

stem primarily from the underlying assumption of 'Independence of Irrelevant

Alternatives' (this will eventually lead us to the nested MNL).

        The n equations in (8) constitute a system of probabilitistic demand

functions of the individual, that is, ir. stands for the probability that a

consumer with personal attributes h will choose product i, this being a function

of the price and attributes of the product in question, as well as of the prices

and attributes of competing brands. It is easy to prove that this is indeed a

well-behaved demand system, exhibiting all the properties of conventional -

i.e.,   deterministic - demand functions, and hence the notion of consumer surplus

applies to it as well, and can be computed by integration. The task is greatly

simplified by assuming away income effects; thus, we specialize the underlying

utility function to be additive separable in the group products (those in S) and

in the outside good m, rendering a conditional indirect utility function of the

form      =   a(y   -
                        p.)   +   q(Z.,h)       +   c.,       where a stands for the -       constant   -
                                                                                                            marginal
utility of income. Substituting in (8),




                        =
                                  a(y -

                                                    +

                                                                                          (z;h)
(9)                                                                     =                               =
                                                              (z.;h)                  +   (Z.;h)
                                    ea      -
                                                P)
                                                          +



       Thus, income drops out altogether from the choice probabilities, since -it

affects equally the utility level of all alternatives, and not their relative
                                                —18--



desirability (note, however, that y can still appear as a personal attribute in

q(.)). The identity of hicksian and marshallian demand functions in (9) allows

us to obtain the surplus function W(S,h) simply by integrating under these

demand functions, the integral being path independent. The result is'8


                                 n
(10)              W(S,h) =ln [E exp(—ap.1 +
                                 1=1
        As suggested earlier, the surplus function as defined in (10) is the key

element in the computation of welfare gains from innovation, and therefore it is

worth mentioning in brief some of its properties (we examine them in detail in a

separate paper). First, note that even though the consumer ends up buying one

unit of one specific product, the surplus function refers to the whole set S.

i.e.,    it   is calculated as if the consumer were to buy fractions it1 of each and

every product in the set. Reasons aside, this is a very convenient property for

our purposes, for it allows us to trace the welfare effects of changes

(innovations) in the entire set of products, regardless of what product each

consumer actually purchases.

        Second, it is easy to show that (10) can be decomposed as follows


(11)              aW(S,h) = E           + [-E     2n it1]   E(V) +
                                ir.V1


where E(V) stands for the expected value of the deterministic component of the

conditional indirect utility function (recall that here V1 = -ap1 +      q(z,,h),   and

p for the well-known entropy measure. The interesting aspect of (11) is that it

brings to light the existence of a taste for 'horizontal variety', that is, the



   18Actually, the full expression in (10) should include the income y as a
constant of integration (recall that utility is linear in income, and that, in
dividing by a, we are normalizing W(.) so as to express it -in money terms);
however, we shall ignore y throughout, since we are only interested in the
type of preferences underlying (10) are such that the welfare of the consumer is

enhanced by the proliferation of seemingly identical brands that may differ only

in their unobserved (and thus presumably less important) attributes. As we show

-in Trajtenberg [1983], Ch.II, this taste for variety -is embedded in 9, and it

stems from - and is formally equivalent to -   the assumption of Independence of
Irrelevant Alternatives. Thus, it may be of interest to actually decompose the

gains tW into the two components E(V) and s and, since the latter stands for

the benefits due only to increased variety, one may want, for some purposes, to

net them out and use the partial measure (AW—Ai).



       a. Incorporating the hedonic price functions into the MNL model

       Throughout the foregoing discussion we have ignored a prominent feature of

markets for differentiated products, namely, the fact that prices and attributes

usually exhibit a systematic relationship, embedded in the so-called hedonic

price function:



(12)           p-i =   p(z,)   +




where p(z) -is the systematic component, and . and i.i.d. error term, to be

referred to hereafter as 'residual price'. The existence of such a relationship

poses a serious multicollinear-ity problem in the estimation of the choice

probabilities defined in (9): since both price and the vector z1
                                                                   appear there




changes W1. Notice also that aW/p = it1, and hence (10) is indeed the
correct soiution,
                                      -20--



as explanatory variables, their individual coefficients cannot be estimated with

any precision. As we are reminded all to often, multicollinearity is a problem

affecting the data entering the model, rather than the model per se, and hence

cannot be easily circumvented. In this case, however, the question is not one

of mere statistical association between certain variables, but has to do instead

with more substantive conceptual issues. Thus, the solution that we shall put

forward involves providing the functions V1 with more structure, building upon

the role that the hedonic price function plays in the agents' optimization

problem.

     To recall, hedonic price functions are not just a statistical regularity,

but the result of simultaneous and interdependent equilibria occuring in a

string of continguous (sub)markets for differentiated products, as shown in

Rosen (1974]. From the point of view of the individual consumer deprived of

market power, the hedonic price function is to be thought of as an exogeneously

given, usually nonlinear budget constraint, i.e., it is the locus of feasible

'consumption bundles' in price-attributes space,19 and should be incorporated as

such in the analysis of consumer behavior. That is indeed done in the

continuous case (as in Rosen [1974]), in a rather straightforward manner:

assuming a continuous and non-stochastic hedonic function p =   p(z),   and the same

indirect utility as in (5) above, we simply substitute p(z) for p in the V

function, rendering the garden-variety maximization problem20




   19The consumption bundles are actually [(y-p1),z1] rather than [pz1], but
this transformation makes no analytical difference.

   201he vector of personal attributes -is of no consequence for the issue under
consideration, and we shall therefore disregard it throughout this discussion.
                                                 —21—


(13)            Max V =   a[y   —
                                    p(z)]   ÷ q(z)
                 z

                FOC: p'(z) =


       The rather obvious point made explicit by (13) is that the consumer cannot

independently choose both a vector z and a price p. but instead the choice of

the former uniquely determines the latter. Consequently, in the regression

analysis proposed by Rosen and based upon the FOC in (13) (for the demand

equations), only the characteristics z appear as explanatory variables, and

therefore the coll-inearity problem does not arise.

       We contend that the essence of the foregoing analysis applies to the

discrete case as well; obviously, the hedonic price function is, in that

context, neither Continuous nor fully deterministic, but -it still plays the role

of a -   stochastic    budget constraint, and should therefore be brought into the

analysis as such. Substituting (12) for p -in V, and ignoring y,


               V. =   -a[p(z.)      +       + p(z.)   =   4(z.)   -   ap(z.)   -
                                                                                   a.

discount resulting from random deviations of actual prices from predicted market

equilibria. Having thus stated the problem, the behavior of consumers is now

seen to depend upon z. and ,            rather   than upon z, and p., this being an

 intuitively appealing reformulation: given the existence of a hedonic function,

the price variable largely replicates the information already conveyed by
                                                                                            Z1;
hence, only the component of p. that is orthogonal to z.,,                   ,   can affect the

choice behavior, and qualifies as a legitimate explanatory variable in a model

that attempts to account for such behavior. Thus, (14) offers a conceptually

plausible solution to the collinearity problem, provided only that a suitable

specification for V'(z) is found. The following proposition furnishes the

required structure: V"(z) can be closely approximated by the sum of a linear

and a quadratic form, provided that it has an interior maximum, i.e.,

V11(z)      z'3   + z'Gz,   where G is a symmetric matrix, if there is a z* > 0 such

that

         When these conditions hold, the approximation z' + zGz obtains in a

straightforward manner from a second-order Taylor expansion about z*. Normally

we would expect p(z) to be concave (or quasi-concave), and the hedonic function

to be convex (as has been found to be the case in many empirical studies), in

which case Vn(Z) would necessarily meet the required conditions.21 Figure 1

illustrates such a case for a one-dimensional z. Notice that, since we operate




   21Actually, p(z) may be concave and the stated conditions could still hold:
all that is required is, loosely speaking, that p(z) be 'mre concave' than
q(z). If that is not the case then the expected optimum z will be in a corner,
and hence the proposed approximation will probably be less precise; likewise,
the estimated coefficients may turn out to have the wrong signs.

in the context of discrete choice, tangency between q(z) and p(z) is not

required, and z* does not necessarily stand for the actual choice; rather,

products in the vicinity of z* have, ceteris paribus, a higher probability of

being selected than those further apart (thus, the Taylor expansion 'is done

about the expected, not the actual, optimum).

       This specification of the 'net utility' leads to the following model,


(15)                 =   exp V/ E exp V

                V. =

                                       p(z.)

implying a two—stage procedure: first, estimate the hedonic price function

and compute the residuals .; second, enter . as an independent variable in

(15) and estimate the MNL model.22 Quite clearly, this is not the most general

formulation possible: a simultaneous equation framework could be more

appropriate, depending upon the presumed behavior of the supply side (e.g., the

pricing and product design behavior of firms) and related issues such as whether

list versus actual prices are used, the length of the periods analyzed (and

hence the likelihood of within-period adjustments), etc. Such a framework may

comprise a system of demand and supply equations, replicating -in the context of

discrete choice what Rosen [1974] does in the continuous case, or just the

demand system as in (15), but estimated simultaneously with the hedonic price

equation, instead of doing it in two stages. Since our main interest lies



   22it is interesting to note that Cowling and Rayner [1970] also made use of
the residuals from hedonic regressions as explanatory variables in a demand
equation; even though their model and econometric tools were rather rudimentary,
their approach was insightful and constituted a step -in the right direction.
                                      —24-


elsewhere (i.e., in obtaining the gains from innovation), we shall abstract for

now from simultaneity issues, thus avoiding excessive complications. Formally,

the working assumption here is that each choice set S, and hence each hedonic

price function, is determined prior to the beginning of period t and does not

change throughout the course of the period; fortunately, this corresponds quite

closely to the case analyzed below.

     There is, however, a related problem that may present itself when

implementing (15): the 'residual price' . may be correlated with left—out

attributes that do affect the choice behavior (i.e., that do belong in q(z)),

and hence its coefficient might overestimate the marginal utility of income, a.

We shall have more to say about this problem, and propose ways of dealing with

it, when discussing the results of the case study.

     Finally, it is interesting to note that the rather striking omission of

hedonic price functions in the existing literature on discrete choice seems to

be quite accidental: the case originally and most often analyzed in that

literature is the choice of transportation modes; in that context, however, the

hedonic price function is virtually non-existent, i.e., there is almost no

relationship between fares and the attributes usually considered there (e.g.,

driving time, route access, etc.). Thus, the practical problem of

multicollinearity that motivated the foregoing analysis simply did not arise.

Quite clearly though, the transportation case is, in this sense, the exception

rather than the rule.



IV. The Case Study: Computed Tomography (CT) Scanners
                                           -25--



     As mentioned in the Introduction, the methodology outlined above will be

applied to a particular innovation, namely, the case of Computed Tomography (CT)

scanners (also known as C.A.T. scanners). The following is a brief description

of the innovation and its background, its main characteristics (to be used in

the econometric analysis), data sources, and selected quantitative indicators.

     Although -it   is   generally recognized that medicine as a whole has advanced

enormously in recent times, it is perhaps less of a commonplace that one of the

areas to have experienced the most progress -is diagnostic medicine.

Particularly striking has been the pace of innovation during the last decade in

imaging technologies, these referring to a vast array of instruments and

procedures designed to provide visual information of the interior of the human

body, going back to Roentgen's discovery of x—rays in 1895, and the subsequent

development of radiography. CT scanners, widely hailed as one of the most

remarkable innovations of recent times, came to epitomize this ongoing

revolution in diagnostic technologies, and set the stage for subsequent

innovations, the last 'wonder' being MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Public

recognition of the significance of CT climaxed in 1979, when the Nobel Prize in

Medicine was awarded to the two scientists who pioneered the system.

     Research on Computed Tomography began in 1967 at the British electronic

company EMI, the first operational prototype was built and installed in 1971 -in

a London hospital, and the first commercial system, called the EMI Scanner, was

installed -in the U.S., in June 1973. Aware of the revolutionary nature of the

innovation and anticipating a vast market, a number of U.S., European and

Japanese companies rushed to enter the new field. In the period 1974—1977
                                         -26-


 nearly 20 firms stepped in, ranging from the giants in electronics (G.E.,

 Siemens, Hitachi, Philips), to pharmaceutical companies (Pfizer, Searle,

 Syntex), to small, specialized firms (AS&E, Elscint, etc.). They engaged in

 fierce product competition, each trying to capture a share of the growing market

 by offering ever improving performance, thus bringing about a staggering pace

of technological advance.

        In contrast to the traditionally cautious and often reluctant attitude of

 the medical profession to the adoption of innovations, the diffusion of CT

scanners in the U.S. proceeded at a very fast pace.23 This happened at a time of

mounting concerns regarding the spiralling costs of health care, and hence

brought to the forefront the intricate policy issue of how should society

allocate resources to that kind of new, very sophisticated but very expensive

medical technologies. An intense public debate followed, prompting the

government to take a series of regulatory measures, primarily through the

-unplementation of CON (Certificate of Need) requirements. The full impact of

these measures was felt in 1978-79, bringing about a sharp downturn in the

market for CT, and the exit of many firms, including EMI. This was to be,

however, a short-lived occurrence: after a major reshuffling of the industry

and the easing of regulatory controls, the market rebounded, settling on a 10—15

percent annual growth rate. The structure of the industry has since stabilized

as well, with General Electric as the well-established leader (holding about 50

percent of the U.S. market), and some ten other firms scrambling for the other

half.




   23CT scanners were the fifth fastest among a set of twenty innovations in
various fields for which diffusion studies have been performed, and by far the
fastest among the subset of medical innovations; see Trajtenberg and Yitzhaki
[1985J.
                                          —27—


         a. Quality dimensions of CT scanners

         Although CT scanners are highly complex systems, it 'is   relatively   easy to

identify their most important 'performance' - as opposed to technical' —

characteristics,24     these being scan time and image quality. In order to gain

some understanding of what these attributes stand for, it may be helpful to

think of a CT scanner as a photographic camera, that 'takes pictures' of very

thin cross—sections (or 'slices') of organs in the body. Since internal organs

are subject to involuntary motions, the faster a CT scanner can complete a

scan,25 (i.e., 'take a picture'), the less will be the 'blurring' -       or distortion
-   in   the picture caused by those motions (as would be the case in photography).

Thus, increasing the scanning speed widens the range of organs that can be

successfully visualized (recall that some organs are quite stable whereas others

are subject to fast motions): the scan time of the first CT scanner was of five

minutes, and hence it could be used only for studies of the brain (a motion-free

organ). As scan time dropped to twenty seconds and less, other body organs

could be seen and, with speeds of up to one second, present-day systems can

render good images of almost any section of the body, except the heart. We

shall denote scan time by SPEED, and take it to be the minimum scan time



   24Performance characteristics are those that affect directly the utility of
consumers, whereas technical (or physical) attributes are to be thought of as
inputs entering into some transformation function that produces the former
'final' characteristics. The distinction is in many instances not clear cut
and, even though performance characteristics are mostly to be preferred in
economic analysis, they are often difficult to measure, whereas there is usually
plenty of data on technical attributes, and in many cases they can serve as good
proxies for the others.

   25A scan is done by a rotational motion around the patient of a mechanism on
which there are mounted an x-ray source on one side, and an array of detectors
opposite to it. The x-ray tube emits a narrow beam that goes through the
section under examination, and then hits the detectors on the other side; these
read and quantify the outcoming energy, and rally the digitized information to a
                                      —28—


 technically possible in a CT scanner (most systems can be operated at several

speeds), measured -in seconds.

     The 'output' of a CT procedure, that -is, the final product to be used in

diagnosis, consists of a series of computer-generated pictures displayed on a

TV—like screen. Thus, the 'acid test' for the performance of a CT scanner is

the 'quality' of the received images, i.e., the accuracy and richness in detail

of the diagnostic informational content of the pictures. This is, quite

clearly, a broad and ill-defined concept that does not render itself easily to

quantitative, objective assessment; there is in fact a voluminous literature

(and a great deal of controversy) in Medical Physics on this issue, and the

search for evaluation standards still goes on. Since satisfactory,

comprehensive measures were nowhere to be found, we designed an econometric

procedure to estimate indices of image quality (very much in the spirit of total

factor productivity indices) and applied it successfully to experimental data on

six CT scanners, provided to us by researchers in radiology (see Trajtenberg

[1984]). However, we were unable to obtain the required data for all the CT

scanners marketed throughout the period studied (i.e., about 50 different

systems), and hence we could not use the proposed index as a measure of image

quality in this study. Instead, we had to content ourselves with a measure of

spatial resolution, that is, the ability of a system to record detail, or

distinguish small objects. More precisely, spatial resolution refers to the




computer. This procedure is repeated many times as the mechanism rotates,
taking readings at each angle in the rotation. Finally, the data thus gathered
are processed by the computer, and the reconstructed picture -is displayed on a
cathode-ray tube.
                                      -29-


size of the smallest object in the received image that can be just visualized in

high—contrast regions, -i.e,. where there are pronounced differences in density

between the small object and its surroundings.26 That is, to be sure, just one

dimension of the imaging performance of a system (although it is usually

correlated with the other dimensions) and therefore can be taken only as an

imperfect and partial indicator of overall image quality; still, it is the best

proxy available for almost all scanners. We denote spatial resolution by RESOL,

and measure it in millimeters.

     Scan time and image quality are, as said, the two most important

performance dimensions, standing well above other potentially relevant

attributes (e.g., those that have to do with the mode of operation and options

of the systems, patient throughput, data storage capabilities, etc.). Of these

we chose to consider, primarily for pragmatic reasons,27 two additional

attributes: reconstruction time and gantry tilt; however, the latter proved to

be statistically insignificant, and hence was eventually discarded.

     Reconstruction time refers to the time interval between the end of the scan

and the display of the image, i.e,. the length of time that it takes the

computer to process the massive amount of data generated during the scan, and

'reconstruct' the final picture out of these data. Clearly, faster

reconstruction times increase the efficiency of a CT scanner, both by reducing

the overall time of a CT examination (thereby increasing the number of patients



   26Thus, spatial resolution is the limiting capability of the system, i.e.,
it is the ability to visualize small objects in 'the best of conditions'.

   27The major difficulties that prevented us from considering additional
attributes were: (a) lack of data covering a sufficiently large number of
scanners; (b) small variance in cross-sections, i.e., some of the features of
interest were incorporated in most CT scanners at roughly the same time, and
hence their effect within a given period could not be successfully estimated;
                                            -30--




 per day that can be scanned) and by enhancing the operator's ability to monitor

and adjust the system. We denote reconstruction time by RTIME and, as with scan

 time, define it to be the minimum of the available range, measured in seconds.

 (For future reference notice that the three characteristics considered are

defined so that 'less is better').


        b. Data and sources

        We have gathered by ourselves, from primary and secondary sources, an

all-encompassing data bank on CT scanners, and related technological, economic

and institutional issues, covering the nine-year period since the first

announcement of the innovation in 1972 and up to the end of 198]. (some of the

data extend further, up to 1983). The main data sets thus compiled are:

(1) The technical and performance characteristics, and the prices of all CT

scanners developed and marketed up to 1982, by year (this is what we denoted

earlier by St).

(-ii)   Detailed   sales data, that is, information on each individual installation,

including the identity of each hospital (or private clinic) in the U.S. that

acquired a CT scanner, the date when the scanner was ordered and installed by

each user, and the precise scanner model bought. Repeat purchases (i.e., users

buying more than one unit over time, either for replacement or for additions to




(c) the qualitative nature of some of the attributes: their inclusion would
have required the use of many dummy variables, exceeding the limit number of
independent variables allowed. In any case, a preliminary statistical
examination showed that many of the excluded attributes are indeed highly
correlated with the included ones, and therefore not much is lost by leaving
them out.
                                      —31—


capacity) as well as upgrades of existmg units are also recorded in detail.

(iii) The attributes of hospitals, e.g., size, affiliation, services offered,

budget, etc.

(iv) Information about the manufactures of CT scanners, including annual R&D

expenditures on CT and patents granted.

     In assembling these data sets we had to resort to a wide range of sources,

primarily the following:

(a) A questionnaire sent to all CT manufacturers, and follow—up personal

contacts with officers from those companies.

(b) Articles in the scientific literature (i.e., in Radiology and Medical

Physics), journals related to the medical sector such as Modern Health Care and

Diagnostic Imaging, reports from consulting companies (e.g., A.D. Little,

Eberstadt, etc.), and a variety of other publications.

(c) Public and government agencies, primarily the Bureau of Radiological Health

(BRH) at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Office of Technology

Assessment of the U.S. Congress (OTA), the U.S. Patent Office, and the American

Hospital Association.

(d) A telephone survey of a few hundred hospitals; personal contacts with

faculty and researchers at various medical schools.

     All but two of the companies that were still active by 1981 in the CT

market answered the questionnaire, at least partially: Elscint, General

Electric, Omnimedical, Picker, Siemens, Technicare (of Johnson and Johnson), and

Toshiba. The two that did not were CGR (from France) and Philips; the latter

had to be excluded from the analysis for lack of reliable information, but not
                                          —32--



much is lost since the company had sold less than twenty scanners in the U.S. by

1981. Of those that had exited the market, only one (Varian) responded to the

questionnarie, whereas the other six (Artronix, AS&A, EMI, Pfizer, Searle and

Syntex) could not be reached. We are quite certain that the installation data

set, comprising more than 2,000 observations (including upgrades) covers about

98 percent of all CT installations in the U.S. up to July 1981, and that it is

very accurate.


     c. A first look at the data

     We present in Tables 1 and 2 various indicators of the technological and

market evolution of CT scanners over time. All figures refer to the U.S. market

only; nevertheless, the trends displayed by them are fairly representative of

the world market as well (with the possible exception of Japan) since the U.S.

accounts for some two-thirds of the total. A 'year' in these tables (and

throughout the paper) refers not quite to the calendar year, but to the period

from November 1 -   of   the previous year -   to   October 31. The reason is that most

new scanners are introduced at the annual meetings of the Radiological Society

of North America (RSNA), which takes place during the month of November.

     In Table 1 we present separate figures for Body and Head scanners: as

their names suggest, the former are systems capable of scanning almost any organ

of the body, whereas the latter are designed to scan the brain only. As can be

clearly seen in these tables, ever since their introduction in 1975 body

scanners came to dominate the scene in CT, both in sales and in terms of

technological advance. Moreover, the trends displayed by the two types of

scanners have been diametrically opposed: whereas head scanners became simpler

and cheaper over time, body scanners exhibited a tremendous pace of

technological advance and a corresponding steep rise in prices. Since 1981 the

market segment occupied by head scanners has shrunk to negligible proportions,

and it is very likely to remain at that.

        According to virtually all indicators, competition in the market for CT

scanners reached its peak in 1977, e.g., fourteen new scanners were introduced

that year, the number of firms reached 1.2, and the Herfindahi index hit an

only     in 1981, when replacement sales became substantial, compensating for the

natural decline in the number of new adopters (due to the leveling-off of the

diffusion porcess). To repeat, our mean interest lies in the evolution of

prices and characteristics over time, as reflected in the summary figures of

Table 1.



V. The Econometric Analysis

        The cornerstone of the econometric analysis leading to the computation

of gains from innovation consists, as already noted, of the estimation of

the MNL model of choice of CT scanners. We shall make use for that purpose

of the two-stage procedure developed in III.a above, and estimate the model

separately for every year in the period 1975_1981.28 In order to keep

computational complexities down at a manageable level, we shall ignore the

vector h of individual attributes and their effect on choices (except in the

estimation of the MNL for 1975). In other words, we shall estimate the



   28fl 1973 and 1974 there was in fact only one CT scanner in the market, and
therefore there is nothing to estimate for those years. As to the last year, we
have detailed data only up to June 1981, accounting for less than half the total
sales for the year. Unless stated otherwise, all figures for 1981 will thus
                                        —34-


 choice probabilities only as functions of the attributes and prices of

scanners -   these being common to all buyers29 - and omit the interaction

between these variables and the individual h's. Otherwise the function

W(St) would have to be computed for each buyer in every period, and then

 integrated over h; given that there are about 300 observations on average

per annum, such procedure would increase the computational burden by an

order of magnitude. Thus, the results from the estimation of the MNL model

refer to the 'average' or 'representative' user of CT scanners, this

including both hospitals and private clinics. Likewise, we do not consider

here firm-related variables that have a bearing on choices, but that do not

have a clear interpretation in terms of welfare, such as 'reputation'

(measured for example by cumulative sales) or advertising outlays.3°

     As pointed out earlier there are two different types of CT scanners,

namely, head and body systems. An important issue in formulating the MNL

model is how to structure the choice set in view of that distinction, i.e.

whether head and body scanners comprise a single choice set, or rather two

separate branches of the decision tree and, if the latter proves to be the

case, whether or not the two scanner types actually belong at all to a

common decision tree. These questions hinge on the pattern of substitution

between scanners, and hence on the compatibility of the various choice



refer to the first half of the year only.

   29Except that in some years the choice set changed during the year (because
of entries), and therefore buyers faced different effective choice sets
according to the exact date of purchase; more on this below.

   30We did estimate models including these variables (as well as individual
attributes) and, not surprisingly, the fit improves. However, we are not trying
here to account as much as possible for observed behav-ior,but to do so in a
manner consistent with welfare analysis. Needless to say, the detailed analysis
                                        —35—


structures with the assumption of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives

(hA) that underlies the MNL. The search for the appropriate specification

will proceed as follows: first, we estimate the MNL once for the entire set

of head and body scanners, and once for a restricted set of body scanners

only, and conduct an appropriate specification test. As the null hypothesis

that hA holds for the larger set (i.e., that head and body scanners form a

single choice set) is rejected, we specify next a nested structure with two

branches - one for head and one for body scanners - and estimate it

sequentially. The results indicate that the elasticities of substitution

between the two types of scanners are nil, and therefore that head and body

scanners constitute in fact unrelated sets from the viewpoint of the choice

process; this in turn will affect the way by which the gains from innovation

are to be computed.


     a. Estimating the hedonic price functions

     We now turn to the first stage of the procedure to be followed, namely,

the estimation of the hedonic price functions, and the subsequent

computation of residual prices. As is commonly the case in hedonic price

studies, we do not have strong priors regarding the functional form of the

hedonic equation and, except for plausible arguments favoring convexity,

there are virtually no theoretical guidelines to follow (see Griliches

[1971)). Thus, the matter is to be decided by comparing the fit of




of choice of CT scanners is interesting in itself from a positive point of view
and will be discussed in a separate paper.

 alternative specifications (the well-known limitations of such criterion not

 withstanding), and subsidiary considerations of a pragmatic nature. We

 experimented with three specifications (log stands for natural logarithms):


                    log p = a                             c.
 (1) Double—log                     +
                                         Elogz        +



 (-ii) Semi—log:    log p1 =    a   +            +


 (iii)Linear—log:   p = a   +
                                Elogz1       +
                                                 €1


      The double-log and the semi-log are the two forms most commonly used in

the literature, and constituted therefore natural candidates. The third

form has never been used before - as far as we know -          in   a hedonic price

equation, presumably for the converse of what made -it         plausible   in our case:

if the characteristics are defined so that ÔU/öz > 0, and hence op/öz > 0

(i.e., so that the more there is of them the better is the products, as is

usually the case) then the linear-log -is necessarily concave, which is

deemed to be rather an implausible feature of these functions. If, on the

other hand, ÔU/öz < 0 as in the case at hand,31 then (iii) is necessarily

convex, as are the other two forms.32

     The three equations were estimated both for the joint set of head and

body scanners (including a dummy variable for head scanners), and for body

scanners only, for every year in the period 1976-1981 (1975 will receive



   31Recall that the shorter is scan time (SPEED) and reconstruction time
(RTIME), the better is the scanner, and likewise, the smaller the value of RESOL
- in mm. - the
               better the imaging capabilities of the system.

   32To be more precise, the semi-log is always convex, whereas the double-log
depends upon the values of .:           If
                                      < 0 (i.e. if aU/az < 0) or if f3 >              I
then it is convex, whereas i 0 <     < 1 it is concave.

separate treatment). We compared the fit of the alternative specifications

using the Box-Cox transformation, and the linear-log emerged as the clear

winner:   it ranked first (i.e., minimum corrected mean-square error) in half

the cases, second in one—third, and last only in the remaining one-sixth of

the twelve cases considered.33 This was quite fortunate, since the linear—log

happens to be a highly convenient specification for our purposes: first, it

will allow us to further simplify the form of the 'net utility' in the MNL

model, and second, its residuals are defined in the same units as price

(since the dependent variable is indeed price, rather than log price as in

the other two forms) and can therefore by incorporated directly in the MNL

as an independent variable.

     We present in Table 3 the estimated hedonic price equations. Notice

that the R2 hovers about .85, and that the estimated coefficients are, with

few exceptions, statistically significant. Thus, the characteristics

included are indeed of relevance in the market for CT scanners, accounting

for most of the observed price variability. Consequently, the inclusion of

both price and attributes in the MNL would have resulted - as suspected -   in
a serious multicollinearity problem, and therefore the use of residual price

instead is amply justified.34



   33The 12 cases are made up of two sets of six equations each (one equation
for each year, 1976-1981): the first set for head and body scanners, and the
second for body scanners only. The second best specification was the
double-log: it ranked first in 1/4 of the cases, second in 7/12, and third in
1/6. For a detailed presentation of the estimated equations and of the
comparisons see Trajtenberg [1983J, Tables V.3-V.5.

   34Since our intention is just to generate residual prices for their
subsequent use in the MNL, we do not pursue here a systematic analysis of the
hedonic price regressions, even though the results are interesting in themselves
(e.g., the pattern followed over time by the estimated coefficients, the reasons
for the observed changes in the goodness-of-fit, etc.)

     b. The MNL: Preliminary remarks

     We argued in III above that the net utility function Vn(Z) =           4(z)   —

ap(z) can be closely approximated by V(z) z' + z'Gz,               relying for that

purpose just on general properties of the underlying utility and hedonic

functions. However, if we further assume that the utility branch as the

form 4(z.) =
               1f(z..),       where f3 (.)    is     a quasi—concave function of the

j-th attribute,35 and substitute the linear-log hedonic price equation for p(z)

in V(). then the approximation to the net utility function simplifies to the

simple -   rather   than the 'generalized' quadratic form,

(16) Vn(Z1) =
                                                            (az.._b.z2..)

Simply put, if both the utility function and the hedonic price equations are

additive separable in — some transformations of -           the zn's, then the
interaction terms drop out of the quadratic form, leaving only the linear

and squared terms. Quite clearly, the only reason to prefer (16) over the

original quadratic approximation is that we thus gain in(m-1)/2 degrees of

freedom in the estimation of the MNL; this may turn out to be a significant

advantage in the imp1ementation of the model, particularly so if the

individual attributes are not included (as in our case).36 Thus, we shall

use the specification laid out in (16) for the estimation of the MNL model.

     A note on the problem of changes in the choice set within periods. As



   351n words, the assumption is that utility is additive separable in the
characteristics, these being defined either in their original units, or in some
quasi-concave transformation of them. This is the working assumption in
virtually all aplications of the MNL model.

   36 the independent variables included in the MNL (such as z) are
'generic', that is, they vary across models (or 'alternatives') but not across
individuals, then the maximum number of variables allowed is n-i, n being the
number of alternatives in the choice set. This constraint does not hold when
                                       -39-


mentioned in IV above, most new models of CT scanners are introduced at the

annual meetings of the RSNA that takes place during the month of November,

setting the stage for what the market for imaging equipment is going to be

like in the course of the year; thus, for the purpose of the empirical

analysis we defined a year to be the period November 1 - October 3].. Still,

the choice sets did not remain constant within these 'radiological years':

some entries occurred after November, and the timing of exits was, of

course, unrelated to the RSNA meetings.37 in principle, the MNL allows the

choice set to vary across individuals in the sample and, since we have the

precise date (month/year) at which each buyer ordered a scanner (denote it

by t1), we could specify a choice set for each individual 2, namely, the

collection of scanners offered in the market at t2, net of entries and

exits. However, the software used here to estimate the MNL has an option

that allows us to easily incorporate expansions in the choice set, but not

contractions;38 moreover, -in many cases we were not certain of the precise

data of withdrawal of scanners from the market, whereas announcement dates



the variables do vary across individuals, or what is exactly equivalent, when
the marginal utilities are individual-specific, these 'individual effects' being
functions of personal attributes h. Thus, the saving of m(m-1)/2 variables can
be very important, if not decisive, in the former case. Still, it is important
to emphazsize that what allowed us to use (16) is the finding that the
linear-log form provided the best fit for the hedonic price functions: had it
been the log-linear or the double log instead, the approximation in (16) would
not be a legitimate one.

   37As a matter of semantic convenience, by 'entries' and 'exits' we refer here
to the introduction of new CT scanners to the market and the withdrawal of
existing ones, and not necessarily to the stepping in or out of firms, although
at times the two sorts of events do coincide.

   38We made use of the package called MLOGIT, originally written by Charles
Manski, later expanded by Bronwyn Hall, and interfaced with SAS by Danny Smith
at the NBER in Cambridge. For details on the procedure used to take care of
entries, see Trajtenberg [1983], ch.V.
                                       —40--



are for the most part well known. Thus, within-period changes -in the choice

sets due to entries have been duly taken into account, but that -is not the

case for exits, i.e. if a scanner was offered with certainty at the

beginning of the year, we assumed that it remained on the market thorughout

the year even though it may have been withdrawn earlier on. It -is

conceivable that this assymetry may have had a slight impact on the results,

but it is virtually impossible to be more precise.

      Finally, a comment on goodness-of-fit measures. As opposed to the

widespread reliance on the     in regression analysis, there is no

universally accepted scalar criterion of fit for discrete choice models. We

shall report here two measures: The popular p2 (or 'McFadden's R2), and
                                     *
the correlation between predicted (it.) and actual probabilities (it),
     *
Cor(ir,,ir.).
                                        2
                The first is defined as p = 1   -
                                                    [L(* )/L(0)],   where L(
                                                                            *


is the maximized value of the log-likelihood function, and L(0) the value of

the ML function when all the coefficients are assumed to be zero.39 Even

though 0p2ci, values of the order of .20 are considered to represent good fits

(so at least Hensher and Johnson 11981] claim), but more experience with these

models is needed in order to establish well-grounded benchmarks. The second mea-

sure Cor(ir, it.), although less precise and much rarely reported than p2, can still

be fairly informative of the performance of the model in the aggregate, that

-is, in predicting market shares. The correlations to be reported below have

been adjusted so as to take into account within-period changes (entries) in the

choice sets.



   39Tha-t is, L(0) = Im 1n.2n(1/m). where m is the number of alternatives in
the choice set, and n. Fie rumber of individuals choosing alternative j. In
other words, if we knw nothing about the determinants of choice we would assign
equal probabilities to each alternative (i.e. ir = 1/rn), and hence L(0)

      c. A specification test

      The most distinctive feature of the MNL, accounting for both its

 advantages (computational and otherwise) and its limitations, is the

 assumption of Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (hA). One way of

 stating it is that, for any pair of choice alternatives, i and j     in   S, the

probability ratio 7T/ir.   is   invariant with respect to the inclusion or

exclusion of other alternatives. The important point is that hA precludes

the possibility of having a flexible pattern of substitution between

alternatives of, to put it differently, it rules out differential proximity

between alternatives in the space of unobserved quality dimensions. For

example, one would expect the cross price elasticities within the sub-set of

head (or body) scanners to be higher than those between scanners of

different types, but hA constrains them to be equal (i.e. 8.Qn
                                                                   ir/a2n is
independent of i). The question is how to test for the hA property and, if

necessary, how to bypass it (at least partially), that is, how to introduce

more flexibility to the model.

     Houseman and McFadden [1981] put forward a specification test based

upon the comparison between the estimates obtained when applying the MNL to

the full choice set, , and those arrived at when estimating a restricted

set, r: if hA holds, both should be statistically equivalent. Formally,

the statistic




represents a sort of natural baseline built on the assumption of complete
ignorance.

(17)      S =



(m is the rank of the coy matrix) can be used to test the null hypothesis

          =   0.   The problem -is that this -is in fact an overall test that may

fail because of misspecifications other than hA and, as McFadden (1982]

points out, it is not powerful unless deviations from the MNL structure are

substantial. Still, it is the only specification test that does not require

a departure from MNL: more powerful tests call for higher-level models in

which IIA obtains as a special case, thus allowing for nested hypothesis

testing. Such is the case, for example, with Houseman and Wise [1978]

'Covariance Probit'; however, and as is typically the case with discrete

choice models other than the MNL, the covariance probit can handle only a

handful of alternatives, making it impractical in our case.

       In order to implement the Houseman-McFadden test, we estimate the MNL for

the full set of head and body CT scanners, and for the restricted set of body

scanners only. In view of our strong priors (favoring the alternative

hypotheses), and in order to avoid excessive computations, we do that only for

two years, 1977 and 1981.40 In both cases the estimated coefficients of the

restricted and unrestricted models differ substantially, and indeed, the null

hypothesis -is rejected: the actual x2 value at the .99 significance level is

18.5, whereas the values of the statistic in (17) are S(1977) = 21.83 and

S(1981) =     27.77.   Thus, we conclude that the data do not support the assumption

of hA for the full choice set, i.e. the choice behavior of buyers does not

allow for the symmetric treatment of head and body scanners.



   40We chose those years according to two criteria: first, that they be far
apart so that the choice sets are substantially different, and hence the results
can be presumed to hold also in the intervening periods, when the sets do
                                                            —43—


       d.     The Nested MNL

       In light of the above results, we formulate next a nested MNL (NMNL) having

two branches, one for the head (H) and the other for body (8) scanners.41 The

probablity of choosing the ith scanner of type h, h = H, S, can then be written

as



(18)        ir(i,h) =     ir(iI   h)ir(h)

                           • h
(19)        ir(i,h) =     e
                              1/.1e

                        AWh        AWH
(20)        itCh) =   e       /{e     + eAWB


where nh is the number of brands in cluster h, and Wh is the 'inclusive value'

of that cluster, i.e.




(21) h ln[,h1exp(V)] , h                         =   H,8.

       The key parameter in this model is A, which is to be interpreted as a

measure of substitutability -               or       'proximity' -   of   alternatives across clusters.42

Thus, and taking the limit cases (A has to lie in the unit interval): when

A = 1 the hA property holds for the entire choice set, and therefore cross—

elasticities do not depend upon the location of alternatives. Consequently, the



overlap; second, that the ratio of the number of head to body scanners be
approximately the same, so that the results will not depend upon the relative
number of alternatives deleted when going from the full to the resticted model.

   41Needless to say, the structure of the choice set can be made more complex,
with several stages - or levels - of decision (rather than just two as in here),
and a finer division into more than two clusters at the lowest stage.

   42The parameter A has been incorrectly interpreted in the literature as a
measure of the similarity (or 'independence') of alternatives within clusters:
see, for example, McFadden [1982], p. 49. In Trajtenberg [1983] we formally
prove the role of A in determining the pattern of inter- and intra- cluster
grouping of alternatives -into clusters is altogether inconsequential, and the

simple MNL applies to the whole set. On the other hand, A = 0 means that the

cross-elasticities between alternatives belonging to different clusters -is zero,

and therefore the decision three should be 'sliced down the middle, Le. each

cluster should be regarded as a separate analytical unit -        or'market'   -   from   the

point of view of demand behavior. Closely related, the value of A determines

also the form of the W(.) function: if 0 < A            1, then the form of the surplus

function is


          W =
(22)
                ln[jh(.   exp Vih)A]

whereas if A = 0 then


(23)      W =
                hWh       ,
                              W
                                  =
                                      1n(.exp   Vi,h)


where the probabilities ir(h) no longer depend upon the attributes and prices of

the alternatives as captured by the inclusive values in (20), but are instead

exogeneous to the model,43, and can therefore be taken to be simply the observed

frequencies in the population.

       We proceed now to estimate the NMNL model sequentially, that is, first we

estimate (19) for head and body scanners separately, then use the estimated

coefficients to compute the inclusive values in (21), and lastly we incorporate

them in (20) in order to estimate A;44 we do that for every year from 1976 to



substitution, and explore some of its implications.

   431n a more general model the r(h)'s could be made endogeneous, i.e. they
could be estimated as functions of variables pertaining to the different
clusters as such (other than their inclusive values) and of individual
attributes relevant to the choice of clusters.

  44Th-is procedure is not fully efficient, and hence the        second-stage standard
                                        -45-


 1981 - 1975 will receive separate treatment. The small number of different

 brands of head scanners offered in the market every year imposed several

 restrictions on the first—stage estimates of the head branch (recall that the

 maximum number of 'generic' independent variables that can be included -in the

 MNL is n-i, n being the number of alternatives in the choice set).     First, only
 four years (1976—1979) could be estimated: in 1980 and 1981 the choice set con-

 tained too few scanners (only three). Second we had to specify V as linear in

 the z's (with price), rather than quadratic with residual price.45 Third, only

three variables could be included in 1979, and hence RTIME (the least important

characteristic) was omitted.

     Table 4 presents the first-stage MNL estimates for head scanners, and Table

5 those for body scanners. We shall not analyze here these results in any

detail, but just note the following: first, the model fits fairly well -    par-
ticularly so in terms of C0R(ir', ii..) - even though we have used only z

variables, ommitting individual and firm—specific attributes. Second, the esti-

mated coefficients change substantially from year to year, suggesting that

'preferences'46 for attributes have evolved over time, as did the CT technology



errors are not entirely reliable. An alternative is to estimate the whole
system using the full information maximum likelihood method, but this is
difficult to implement in the case of the NMNL, and the experience with the
software available at the time for that purpose was not very satisfactory.

   45Simple correlations between price and characteristics of head scanners were
found to be systematically lower than those for body scanners, suggesting that
the multicollinearity problems (that motivated the use of the quadratic) might
be less severe for head scanners; if so, the linear form may in fact be the
appropriate specification for head scanners.

   46Since the underlying utility function is not linear, 'preferences' - or
'tastes' — are not uniquely defined in terms of the estimated coefficients, but
depend upon the level of the attributes. We have chosen to measure preferences
for an attribute as the derivative of the choice probabilities with respect to
that attribute, averaged over the choice set. Thus, whenever we talk of

been at work (see Trajtenberg [198311, VI.2 and VIII.3—5): relative preferences

for attributes in one year influence the direction of technological change (-in

attributes' space) in the following year, and conversely, as the set of products

offered in one period incorporates innovations that emphasize some attributes

more than others, preferences towards the enhanced characteristics will weaken

next period relative to other attributes. In other words, strong preferences

marginal desirability afterwards. As we shall see below, this inducement

mechanism will be of relevance in choosing the 'base preferences' to be used in

computing the yearly gains from innovation. Lastly, it is worth noting that,

contrary to what is normally to be expected, the coefficients of RPRICE for body

scanners are positive, except for 1981. On the other hand, those for head

scanners are negative and fairly stable; we shall elaborate on these two

findings later on.

     Now to the second stage of the NMNL: Table 6 presents the computed

first-stage MNL for head scanners could be estimated. The key result is that,

except for 1978, the estimates of X are very small, implying that the cross

elasticities between head and body scanners are nil, and hence that the two

types of scanners do not belong to a common decision tree. Lacking the




'relative preferences', we refer to the relative magnitudes of these weighted
derivatives.

corrected standard errors47 we could not test formally the hypothesis that A = 0,

using either a Wald or a Lagrangian test. However, the stated conclusion is not

contingent upon the acceptance of this hypothesis: even if the A's prove to be

statistically different from zero, their small magnitude make the 'between'

cross-elasticities negligible, and that is all that is required. As to 1978,

the negative value of A is symptomatic of a local failure of the conditions

underlying generalized extreme value models in general, and the NMNL in

particular. Although it is difficult to draw any firm conclusion from such a

finding, we take it as further evidence that head and body scanners are not to

be regarded as substitutes (if anything, A < 0 would suggest complementarity,

since the cross—elasticities turn out to be positive).

     The inference arrived at with the NMNL is no surprise, and only corroborates

our priors: the evidence regarding the evolution over time of the CT technology,

relative prices and capabilities, and patterns fo acquisition and use, clearly

indicates that head and body scanners rapidly diverged from each other, forming

two highly segmented sub-markets (see Trajtenberg 11983], V.3, for an extensive

and detailed discussion of the issue). At a more general level, we want to stress

the fact -   largely   overlooked in the literature -   that   the procedure followed

above, centered around the estimation of A, can help solve the all-pervasive

problem of drawing market boundaries in empirical micro studies.

    We now turn to 1975, the first year in which there was a choice of scanners

in the market, and hence the first that could be estimated, albeit in a somewhat

special way. Even though announcements of new scanners were made in late 1973



   47lhese could be obtained by further iterations using the Berndt-Hausman-Hall
[1974] procedure; however, the necessary software was not readily available at
the time, and hence we were unable to do so.
                                      -48-


and throughout 1974, in fact the only scanner sold during that period was the

EMI head scanner. In 1975 the first two body scanners were successfully intro-

duced to the market, as well as an additional head scanner. It is clear that at

that early stage head and body scanners were indeed close substitutes (they were

still very similar in terms of characteristics and prices), and hence the

effective choice set comprised both types, totalling four alternatives. That is

a very small number for estimation purposes, and moreover, since preferences of

buyers seem to have been ill-defined back then due to the newness of the tech-

nology, we had a great deal of trouble estimating the MNL for that year. After

experimenting with several specifications, the model converged and rendered sen-

sible results with a 'hybrid' specification, shown in Table 7: Notice that,

since there was room for only three generic variables, we omitted the quadratic

terms and RTIME, and interacted resolution with 'RAD', an attribute of

hospitals.48 All in all the model performs quite well and, in view of the rela-

tively narrow range of values of the incthded variables, the results are pro-

bably not very different from those that would have emerged had the quadratic

terms been included as well.


VI   Computing the Gains from Innovation

     The MNL estimates obtained in V above provide us with the parameters of the

utility functions needed to compute the social gains from innovation in CT

scanners. To recall, these gains are defined as     =           —              where
                                                        W(St)       W(St_i),

(24) W(St) =   ln   [   exp   V/a

   48RAD is defined as (Ri + R2 + R3)/3, where the R's are dummy variables for
the availability of X-ray, cobalt and radium therapy respectively. The
presumption is that hospitals with a wider range of radiation therapy services
will tend to value more resolution in CT scanners. Since RAD is defined only

     Thus, all we need is to compute the functions V using the estimated MNL

coefficients and the observed characteristics and prices of scanners in adjacent

years, aggregate them as in (24), and take differences. There are, however, two

important issues to be considered beforehand: first, the fact that the coef-

ficients of RPRICE for body scanners were found to be positive (except f or

1981), and second, the fact that virtually all the estimated coefficients change

significantly from year to year, and hence         is not uniquely defined.


     a. Upward-sloping demand curves, signaling, and welfare analysis

     Contrary to textbook dogma, positive price coefficients - and hence

upward-sloping demand functions -    are by no means an aberration: various types

of fairly prevalent price, quantity and quality interrelationships may easily

bring them about, particularly when some of the variables are imperfectly

observed, thus making room for signaling effects. However, positive

price coefficients do pose a serious problem when it comes to welfare analysis,

since they can no longer be regarded as estimates of the marginal utility of

income (MUI), which plays the usual role of conversion factor - from utility to

money terms —   in   (24) (notice that a positive price coefficient means, on face

value, a negative MUI).49 Likewise, it is no longer clear whether the term

should be included as such in V when computing (24): that will depend upon

the kind of phenomena that give rise to a positive price coefficient.




for hospitals, we excluded private clinics in the estimation of 1975. To
recall, interacting a generic variable with an individual attribute makes the
former vary across individuals, thus bypassing the limitation on the number of
variables imposed by the number of alternatives in the set.

   49More generally, one can no longer obtain a measure of consumer suplus by
integrating under the observed, upward-sloping demand curve.
                                               -50-


        In order to address these issues, consider first the framework put forward

by Spence [1973J to analyze price, quality and quantity interdependencies:

demand is modeled as a function of price, and a broadly defined 'quality' -           or
'desirability' -          perameter q, which in turn depends upon price and/or quantity,

i.e.,

(25) x =          x   (p,q)


(26) q = Q(p,x)


In equilibrium,


(27) x =    x     (P Q(p,x))

which defines the observed -         or   'actual' - demand function, as opposed to the

'virtual' demand function defined in (28) for a given q. Note that whereas

(25) behaves as a regular demand function in that dx/dp =                 the price
                                                                   x<0,
response of (27) is far more complex: totally differentiating (27) and

rearranging terms,

         dx x +          XqQp
(28)          =
         dp       1 -
                        XqQx

        Thus, the slope of the observed demand functions depends not only upon the

'pure' price effect x, but also on the feedback effects of price and quantity

via their impact on perceived quality, Of the many possible cases50, consider

the one where Q=O and Q>O1 i.e. where Q(p) stands for what amounts to an




   50For example, Q >0 corresponds to the 'bandwagon effect', Q<O to
congestion, etc.
                                           —51—


inverse hedonic price function. From (28) it is clear that in such cases the

slope of the observed demand function will always be steeper than that of the

virtual demand and, if XqQp>_Xpi it will be positive. In econometric terms, this

is equivalent of having left out quality from the demand equation - when price

and quality are positively correlated -      thus inducing an upward bias in the

price coefficient that may easily overwhelm the pure price effect.

       Presumably, however, we have explicitly taken care of 'quality' in the MNL

equations -    in   that we included the vector of characteristics z - arid therefore

the positive price coefficients are still in want of an explanation. This we

have to seek in the nature of the variables affecting choice: although the

included attributes are certainly of prime importance in describing the quality

of a CT scanner, some are only proxis to the 'true'performance dimensions of the

systems, and they surely do not exhaust the relevant quality space (recall the

discussion in IV above). It is important to emphasize that this is not just a

problem for outside observers - such as ourselves -      but   it is rather a prime

concern for the buyers of the systems themselves: observable attributes are

only partially informative of the expected performance of a CT scanner (as is

very often the case with durable goods), and the remaining uncertainty leaves

room for prices to play a role as signals of quality51 (see, for example,

Alcaly and Kievorick [1970], and Pollack [1977]). In terms of the model

outlined above, the demand function now becomes x =      x(p,z,qe),   where qe=Q(p,z)

stands for 'expected performance', and z is the vector of observed charac-

teristics. The price derivative is now

(29)      =   x + xqQp      0
                                   as       XqQp<_Xp


   51-Prospective buyers 'shopping' for CT scanners form expectations regarding
attainable image quality on the basis of data provided by the manufacturers
(such as spatial resolution), the visual inspection of sample pictures, etc.
                                           —52-


where Q(1z) can be thought of as the signaiing effect.             Note that qe is

assumed to depend also upon z, that is, consumers form their expectations

regarding performance on the basis of prices, conditional on observed charac—

teristics. In particular, we postulate.


(30) qe = Q[p-p(z)J     =   Q(i)

where   is, to recall, the residual from the hedonic price regression. In other

words, the informative component of price resides in its deviations from the

value that can be predicted on the basis of the data available to consumers

(i.e., the vector z).

     The key question is whether a signaling equalibrium can be assumed to hold

over time, in the sense of actual -   or   ex-post -   quality   coinciding on average

with expected performance (qe), thus implying that residual prices convey the

right information. Formal empirical tests for the existence of signaling

equilibrium have yet to be designed; however, some inferences can be drawn by

considering the market conditions required for either an equilibrium or a dise-

quilibirum to emerge.52

     In some circumstances, firms may have an incentive to violate the commit—



This constitutes, however, partial and imperfect information, and uncertainty
remains as to the imaging performance of the systems under different operational
conditions, as well as over time. Similarly, as ever faster scanners were
introducted, users could not anticipate exactly the extent of expansion in the
range of applications, or whether image quality could be maintained at high scan
speeds. The firms themselves confronted users with additional sources of
uncertainty (particularly in the late seventies),related to their upgrade,
product line and servicing policies and, more importantly, to their
survivability in the field.

   52See Farrell [1979J and Wolinsky [1981] for models where prices do serve as
signals of quality in equilibrium. For a qualified signaling equilibrium
involving advertising levels rather than prices, see Schmalensee [1978].
                                                 —53—


ment implicit in a signaling equilbirum and make a 'quick kill', that is, price

their goods higher than warrented by their true quality, realize extra profits,

and exit the market once the bluff is called. Quite clearly, the likelihood of

such behavior depends crucially on the extent and importance of intertemporal and

intermarket links; in particular, it will be inversely related to the importance

of reputation, both within the market of interest, and across related markets if

the firms are diversified. Similarly, persistently high fixed costs - par-

ticularly in R&D and marketing —          will   strongly discourage the 'hit and run'

behavior associated with a signaling disequilibrium. As suggested in IV above,

those conditions are undoubtedly met in the market for CT scanners: reputation

plays indeed a crucial role in medical instrumentation, most firms operate not

just in CT but in a wide range of interrelated markets, sustained R&D and

marketing efforts are key to commercial performance, etc. Thus, we can safely

conclude that a systematic relationship between residual prices and unobserved

quality dimensions was indeed maintained all along in this market.

       The implications for welfare analysis are immediate: a signaling equili-

brium implies that qeQ() should be regarded as an additional quality dimen-

sion, and be incorporated as such in the indirect utility function, i.e.,




(31) V1= V1(z1) +


Assuming for simplicity that v2(qe) =             qe,   and q1e =   9i,   and recalling

that p =       p(zi)   +
                           p1,

       V. =   v1(Z1)
                        +        - a[p(z)+]      =>

Recalling that the bracketed term in (32) -   defined   as the 'net utility' - was

approximated by a simple quadratic form on z, and denoting 8 = ($0 -    a),

which is the model actually estimated, except that now the price coefficient no

longer stands for the marginal utility of income, a, but incorporates also the

marginal utility of the signaling effect, 130 (thus, 8     0 <=> $6   a). To

insist, accepting the hypothesis of a signaling equilibrium implies that the

estimated 6 should indeed be used in computing V1 for purposes of welfare analy-

sis (i.e., in order to compute W(S) in (24)), whereas its rejection would have

required that we delete 130P1 from (33). Still, we need to know the true

price coefficient in order to be able to integrate under the 'virtualt rather

than under the observed demand function, the practical difference in this case

being that it is a that appears in the denominator of (24), whereas using 8

instead would be meaningless. Fortunately, the striking differences in the evo-

lution over time of head and body scanners will allow us to associate a with the

estimated price coefficients of head scanners.

     Consider the following straightforward proposition: uncertainty with

respect to product quality, and hence the extent to which prices may play a

signaling role, will be greater the more technologically complex a product is,

the less experience users have with it, and the faster is the pace of tech-

nological advance. Conversely, as the basic configuration and range of applica-

tions of a product stabilize, and as experience with it accumulates, the

signaling effect will tend to dissappear. Recalling the description in Section
                                           —55—


 IV,   it   is immediately clear how this proposition applies to the two types of

 scanners: head scanners were introduced first, their applications remained

 unchanged (i.e. for brain studies), and, after an initial stage of improvements,

the dominant trend was towards less expensive and simpler systems; on the other

hand, the trend in body scanners was all along towards increased sophistication,

with quantum technological jumps in the first couple of years, and a slow—down

in the pace of change afterwards. Thus, we would expect (a) that the signaling

effect vanished early on for head scanners, and hence that, after the first few

years following their introduction, the estimated price coefficients would be

negative and fairly stable; (b) that the price coefficients of body scanners

would be systematically higher than those of head scanners, but that they would

tend to converge towards the latter as the pace of innovation subsided.      Figure

2, displaying the estimated price coefficients of the two types of scanners,

strongly suports these conjectures. Thus, we can safely regard the price coef-

ficients of head scanners for 1976-1979 as unbiased estimates of a, the marginal

utility of income, and hence as the appropriate parameters to be used in com-

puting W(st)53. Likewise, the difference between the price coefficients of body

and head scanners can be taken as estimates of the magnitude of the signaling

effect. Although the foregoing discussion centers on a particular market, we

believe that this is just one instance of a fairly widespread phenomenon, and

that the line of reasoning developed here could be applied elsewhere; in par-

ticular, we suggest that a lot can be learned about signaling effects and

related phenomena by studying demand behavior in vertically segmented markets.



   53To recall, head scanners were introduced in 1973, and hence we are allowing
3 years for the signaling effects to vanish; note than in 1975 the price
coefficient is still positive and large, reflecting the uncertainty created by
the introducton of the first head scanners to compete with the EMI scanner.

         b. Alternative measures of welfare gains

         We noted in V.d that the coefficients estimated in the MNL model change

substantially from year to year, although the quadratic specification makes it

difficult to perform systematic comparisons just with the coefficients them-

selves (see Trajtenberg [1983], Ch. VIII, for convenient ways of summarizing

those estimates). However, it is virtually impossible to determine - from this

evidence alone - whether the underlying, 'true' preference structure is indeed

shifting over time or, -instead, that it is stable but the coefficients change

because the utility function is somehow misspecified. Be it as it may, the per-

tinent fact -in     the present context is that the preference structure as captured
b the estimated choice model does change, and therefore the welfare measures

are not unique but depend upon the choice of a reference -     or   base -   year.
Thus, there are two alternative ways of assessing the value of a change in the

choice set from St to St+i:


(i)      ex—ante:
                         wt(st+i)_wt(st)


(-i-i)   ex—post:        Wt+i(St+i)_Wt+i(St)

where       stands for the surplus function using the coefficients estimated for

year t. That is, the ex-ante, or forward-looking measure answers the following

question: how much would the consumer be willng to pay for the option of facing




Since we were able to estimate these 'pure' price coefficients only for 1976-79,
and in view of the fact that they are fairly stable, we shall use the 1976
coefficient as an estimate of a for earlier years, and that for 1979 as the
parameter for subsequent years.

 next year's choice set rather than the present one, given his/her preferences

 today? On the other hand, the question posed by the ex-post criterion IS: how

 much income could be taken away from the consumer, so as to leave him/her indif-

 ferent between facing today's and yesterday's choice sets, in light of his/her

 present tastes. Note that even though this resembles the distinction between

compensating and equivalent variations (or the Laspeyres - Paasche dichotomy),

ours is in fact entirely different: in the traditional context tases are held

fixed and the dilemma resides in choosing the reference utility level or con-

sumptiori bundle, whereas here it is the taste perameters themselves that

change.

     In general, the ex-ante and ex-post measures will provide different quan-

titative answers, and a priori it is not clear whether they would differ in a

systematic way (e.g., setting upper and lower bounds as the Laspeyres and

Paasche indices do) or, for that matter, which should be deemed to be more

'relevant.' However, the 'dual-inducement mechanism' mentioned -in V.d would

lead us to expect that the ex-ante measure be systematically higher than the ex-

post. That is, 'strong' preferences for a given attribute today will induce a

relatively large improvement in that attribute, which in turn will bring about a

reduction in its marginal desirability next period; thus, the value of the

improvement will necessarily be larger if judged according to the original pre-

ferences. Likewise, the same inducement mechanism seems to indicate that the

ex-ante measure is somewhat more 'appropriate' or 'relevant', at least for

policy considerations, since it could be argued that, for the sake of con—



   54To put it differently, the only source of ambiguity in traditional welfare
analysis lies in the existence of income effects: if these were absent then the
two situations would be directly and uniquely comperable. In our case, however
the hypothetical measure W =                    is meaningless regardless of

sistency, any kind of change should be judged according to the preferences that

gave rise to it, rather than by hinsight. Nevertheless, and given that the

issue is inherently inconclusive,55 we shall compute both measures wherever

possible; fortunately, the qualitative results hold for both measures equally

well.

        A word about Divisia-like measures, i.e., estimating each pair of adjacent

years (or more) jointly, and using the resulting 'average' preferences to evaluate

changes from one to the next. This is a legitimate and doable procedure, and it

has the extra advantage of circumventing the problem altogether (i.e., it

results in a unique measure). However, this very advantage is its weakness, for

if tastes are indeed substantially different from year to year, it is hard to

see how suppressing these differences (i.e., imposing a common set of

coefficients) can render a 'better' measure. On the other hand, if preferences

do not vary much then the ex-ante and ex-post measures would be very similar,

and the problem would not be there to begin with.


        c. Computations and results


        First, note that the residual prices in (33) have to be obtained from the

hedonic price function of the reference year, since p(z) (i.e., the non—

stochastic component of the hedonic regression) has to be added back to the quadratic

approximation in order to retrieve the original utility function. That is, in

computing Aw8 the hedonic price function of year t is used to generate the 's



income effects, since it is tantamount to making interpersonal comparisons.

   55A similar problem arises in the context of endogenous tastes, and there too
the choice of criteria for welfare analysis is not a closed issue; see, for
example, von Weizsacker [1971].
                                                —59—


of both years (t and t+1), and likewise, when computing AW the residuals are

obtained from the hedonic price regression estimated for year t+1. Second,

since we rejected the hypothesis that head and body scanners belong to a common

preference tree (from 1976 on), the LW's are computed separately for each type

of scanners -in the period of 1976-1982. As for the initial years, the gains

correspond to the joint set of head and body scanners, since the parameters used

are those of 1975 (i.e., we use the 1975 W function to compute the 1973—74 and

1974-75 ex—post gains, and the 1975-76 ex—ante gains; note, however, that the

1973 and 1974 sets include only head scanners, one each year). For completeness,

we impute the 1975-76 ex-ante joint gains to each type of scanners according to

                                            =     P    P     P
their respective ex-post shares:
                                                           WB), SB1_SH.
     We present in Table 8 the results for body scanners, performing the calcu-

lations in three stages :    first,     we compute

                                     in (expV+1) -
                                                           ln(expV)
as shown in column 1. Second, we divide b by the true price coefficient,

a, as listed in column 2; since a was estimated with prices defined

in $100K, we compute AW =   (A/a)1OO so as to present the gains in $K. Finally,
we deflate AW by the producer price index for capital equipment (the one most

closely related to CT Scanners) in order to obtain the 'real' gains shown in

column 5. We computed the gains for head scanners (1976-82) and for the joint set

of head and body scanners (1973-76), in a similar fashion. Table 9 brings all

these together, allowing us to compute the overall gains,

where ir(h) is the percentage of buyers that purchased scanners of type h.

Note that an overlapping series of ex-ante and ex—post pairs could be computed

only for four years: 1976-1979. As expected,              was found in those years to be

systematically higher than       by a relatively constant factor:



                Mean [AW/W) = 7.24,              S.D. =     1.34.

Thus, we use this proportionality factor to obtain the 1974 and 1975 ex-ante

gains (i.e., AW =   7.24xW,    t=74,75), and likewise for the 1980-82 ex-post

measures. As a matter of terminology, we refer to AWt as 'incremental' gains,

     d. On the Poor Health of Welfare Measures in the Medical Sector

     Although we have referred all along to W(.) as a 'surplus' or 'welfare'

function, and likewise to AW as welfare -   or   social -    gains,   these notions need

to be reassessed and qualified in view of the peculiarities of the case at hand.

First, notice that the buyers of CT scanners are not the final consumers, but

health-care providers that purchase the systems as a capital input and sell

their services to patients. Now, this fact by itself does not invalidate, nor

does it cast a shadow on, the welfare measures developed above (or any other

measure of consumer surplus): it is easy to show that, if markets are perfectly

competitive, then it is exactly equivalent to do welfare analysis either with

reference to the demand for the final product (as is usually done), or to the
derived demand for inputs (as we do here).56 Likewise, government regulation

in either market can only affect the magnitude of the surpluses actually

realized, but the proposed measures will still capture them well (see for

example White [1972]).

       The problem resides entirely with the behavior of hospitals, both in itself

and in relation to the utility of ill—informed patients. In order to pinpoint

the source of the difficulties, let us consider in a very schematic way two

'ideal types' of hospital behavior: in the first the hospital is a profit maxi-

mizer and a price taker, and in the second it maximizes a utility function

having as an argument the quality of CT scanners, z (we assume that the quality

of medical services provided by the hospital is indeed a positive function of

the quality of the CT scanner owned). In order to focus exclusively on quality

choice, we assume that the quantity of medical services, m, is exogeneously

determined. Since CT scanners are a capital input and we consider here the flow

of   services, there is a cost function determining the operating costs of a

scanner, which we assume to be multiplicative, i.e., C =   C[z,p(z)]m;   thus,57

      Denoting by q(z) the price of a CT procedure performed with a scanner of

qualty z, and assuming without loss of generality that m = 1, the behavior of

the profit—maximizing hospital is simply




   56Al1 that this says is that in a perfectly competitive environment, the
'firm' is, in a sense, a redundant entity, and one could conduct any type of
welfare analysis using only utility and costs functions, i.e., one could proceed
as if consumers themselves purchased inputs and produced the final goods.

   571t is assumed that more advanced scanners are more expensive to operate
(C/8z>O), and that they cost more (ap/az>O). The term aC/ap> 0 involves
interest - or leasing - payments, depreciation, insurance premiums, etc.

                  z

       In the case of a utility-maximizer, q(z) is replaced in the objective

function of the hospital by the branch of its indirect utility function related

to diagnostic medicine, Vh(z) (we assume that the underlying utility function

is additive separable), rendering FOC: V =
                                                      C.     Likewise, the behavior of the

final consumer (the patient) is characterized by Max V = VC(z) + yC -                       q(z),
with FOC: V =         If    the market were perfectly competitive, then the following

equalities would obtain,

                 v=q=c=vh
       Noting that the FOC for hospitals (i.e.,              =       and       =        define
                                                                 C                 C)
the demand functions for CT scanners, it is clear that if (34) were to hold,

then we would be indeed fully capturing the welfare of final consumers in our

W(') functions. Unfortunately, none of those equalities can be taken for

granted; in particular, it is rather doubtful that                   =   V,   i.e., that the

interests and perceptions of the medical profession fully coincide with those of

patients, as physicians choose diagnostic technologies. If anything, the

presumption is that physicians may tend to display an upward bias in their

valuation of those technologies, because of 'extraneous' motives such as rivalry

between hospitals, long-range scientific goals that have little to do with the

immediate well-being of patients, status and prestige, etc. If so, our measures

W will somewhat overstate the ttrue! social gains, the difference being gains

accruing to the medical community today, that probably will not be entirely

passed-on in the long-run to society at large.58

  58Not-ice that if the divergence between             and       was due primarily to long-
                                        -63-



       A more fundamental problem, though, is that    is    by no means a well-
defined construct to begin with, simply because patients are -      for   the most part

-   not in a position to evaluate independently the quality and medical value of
diagnostic procedures, not to speak of innovations in them. Thus, we lack the

baseline needed to assess the magnitude of the 'principal-agent' problem that

may occur in the choice of medical technologies. In other words, we cannot

really gauge the extent to which doctors may deviate from the choices that

consumers would have made, if the latter had the same medical knowledge that

their 'agents' command. However, that is a problem with medicine, not with

economics: all we can do is to estimate those AW's, on the assumption that what

was referred to as 'extraneous' motives are not the main determinants of

hospitals' choices of technologies, and therefore that the - presumably upward -

bias   in the resulting measures are not too substantial.


VII. Diffusion, Social Returns, and the Pattern of Innovation

       The AW's obtained in the previous section stand for the yearly incremental

gains accruing to the 'representative' buyer of CT scanners. We want now to

compute the yearly flow of total gains, relate them to R&D expenditures so as to

obtain a rate of return and, more importantly, examine in detail the time

profile of those benefits and costs.59 As it will shortly become clear,



term scientific interests influencing the choice of technologies by hospitals,
it is not clear which criteria should be used in evaluating the social gains
from innovation in those technologies: since using V -      if
                                                           it were possible -

would be too myopic, the issue boils down to the choice f an appropriate 'social
rate of discount', to be applied to a measure based on V (such as our AW).

   591he computations will be carried out using the ex—ante gains only: since
those were found to be systematically higher than the ex-post measures, the
total gains corresponding to the later would just be a - relatively constant -
fraction of the former. The qualitative results to be discussed below are thus
                                           —64-


     obtaining those total gains is by no means a mere computational issue, but has

     to do instead with an important phenomenon in the realm of technical change,

-
     namely, the dynamic interaction between innovation and diffusion.


         a. Total Gains and Diffusion

         As a first step, consider the problem of delimiting -   in   time and in

    technology space   the benefits from innovation accruing to a consumer buying,

    say, a personal computer today. Are these benefits to be identified with the

    cumulative gains stemming from the long sequence of innovations in computers

    from the ENIAC on? Or perhaps just from the first Apple onwards?

    Alternatively, should we rather consider him/her as benefitting just from the

    last incremental gains, gauged by contrasting the 1985 versus the 1984 sets of

    personal computers in the market? Looking at it from a different angle, the

    same conundrum can also be phrased as follows: are we to compute the total

    gains generated by the innovations embedded in the 1985 set of available PC's

    simply by multiplying the incremental gains        -   times the number of buyers
    of PC's in 1985? Or rather times the projected number of buyers from 1985

    onwards? And what about those buying replacement units versus first—time buyers

    (i.e., new adopters)?

         Aside from the issue of choosing an appropriate baseline,60 it is clear that



    unaffected by the type of measure used; on the other hand, the rate of return to
    R&D will obviously be much smaller if the ex-post gains were to be used instead
    of the ex—ante. As previously suggested the ex-ante gains seem to be a more
    meaningful measure, at least for normative analysis, but the issue is
    inherently inconclusive.

       60By 'baseline' we mean the starting point for the computation of benefits,
    e.g., the first mainframe computer versus the first PC in the hypothetical case
    just mentioned (incidentally, why not the abacus?). If the goal is to analyse
    the welfare impact of a specific, well defined innovation(s) (as is the case
    here with CT), then the baseline is simply identified with the first appearance
                                          —65—


the key to the problem lies in the dynamics of demand and the impact of

successive innovations upon it. The proper way to address it would therefore

be to formulate and estimate a dynamic discrete choice model, relying for

example on Heckman [1981J.61 If that were available, then the total gains

sought here would be obtained simply by integrating the ensuing intertemporal

demand function, over individuals and over time. However, both conceptual and

technical difficulties prevented us so far from estimating such a model. Thus,

we shall limit ourselves here to a highly simplified version, that amounts

essentially to the reduced form of a full-fledged dynamic model.

       In order to grasp the nature of the reduced form model, consider the

following polar versions of the diffusion process: in the first, diffusion is

due entirely to the workings of the traditional 'demonstration' -    or   'contagion'
-   effects,   e.g., learning, emulation, rivalry, etc. In other words, the process

has to do only with dynamic phenomena occurring within the population of

potential adopters, and is not affected by external forces. Thus, for example,

if technological change would have ceased immediately after the introduction of

the first CT scanner, then under the assumptions of this model the pattern of

diffusion would have been the same as it was in actuality. In the opposite

extreme version the diffusion path is nothing but a temporal demand curve having

only extensive margins, that is, it traces the distribution of some version of



of the new technology. The problem might arise when the question is posed the
other way (as we did at first), i.e. when trying to assess the benefits accruing
to a consumer at a point in time, since it is not clear then how far back into
the past should one pursue those benefits.

   61Such a model would comprise the decision of whether or not to buy in each
period, as well as the conditional choice of what product to buy. The former,
upper-level choice has to do primarily with the process of diffusion (i.e., when
to adopt), although traditional investment motives, accounting for replacements
and additions to capacity, should play an increasingly important role over time.
'reservation prices' in the population of potential adopters. Thus, successive

innovations that result in what can be thought of as reductions in 'real prices'

trigger immediate adoption y inframarginal individuals. Consequently, if the

process of technological advance were to come to a halt diffusion "ould stop as

well, all future purchases would be for replacement or capacity additions only,

and hence the innovations that took place up to that point would cease to

generate additional benefits.

       The implications of these alternative scenarios for the computation of

total gains are immediate: if diffusion corresponds to the 'distribution of

reservation prices' case, then the total gains generated by innovations

occurring at time t are just


(34)             TWt =   AWn.

where      stands for the number of buyers and TWt for total gains. On the

hand, if diffusion is due entirely to demonstration affects, then



(35)           TW =        N   f   f(T)eTt)dT

where r is an appropriate discount rate, N is the size of the population of

potential adopters, and f(.) the marginal distribution of adoption times,

corresponding to the cumulative distribution F(.). To make it clearer, let us

ignore discounting for a moment and rewrite (35) as,




These choice probabilities would be a function, inter alia, of the evolution of
the technology over time, as well as of expectations in that regard.
                                                   —67—


                    =
                        AW.
                              N[]. —   F(t)]   =
                                                   AWt[nt
                                                            + N(1 -   F(t   +   1))]
or, defining the number of future adopters as ni = N[1 —                    F(t   +    1)],

(36)            TW. = AWt(nt +         n)

       Contrasting (36) and (34), we see that the total gains would be larger in

the 'demonstration effects' model, since they include also the benefits bestowed

by current innovations to future buyers (with discounting n will be somewhat
smaller).

       Actual diffusion processes may correspond to either model or, most likely,

to a combination of both, and it is of course an empirical matter to uncover

the appropriate characterization. For that purpose we shall estimate the

aggregate diffusion process as a function of time, and of the cumulative gains
                         t
from innovation, CW.t =          As -in traditional diffusion models, time is
                        T 1
meant to capture the forces associated with the 'demonstration effects',

whereas CW. can be thought of as tracing the cumulative changes in a quality-

adjusted index,62 thus bringing—in the scenario associated with the 'distribution

of reservation prices'. In particular, we assume that the diffusion path

corresponds to a logistic distribution,63 and that innovation impacts the

process by raising the ceiling K, i.e., K = K(CWt).                   As to the functional form

of K(.), we tried both a linear and a concave specification, corresponding to

an underlying uniform and exponential distribution of 'reservation prices'

respectively. Since the two yielded very similar results, we shall present here

   62For a preliminary discussion of the construction of real price indices on
the basis of our AW's, see Trajtenberg [1983], ch. X.

   63The assumption of a logistic distribution is by no means an innocent one,
particularly when the goal is to estimate correctly the speed of diffusion - see
Trajtenberg and Yitzhak-i [1982]. For our purposes here, however, the choice of

only those obtained with      the linear form, K(CWt) =           + k CW. The estimated
equation is thus,64

                                                            t)J

        Note that (37) cannot be linearized by taking the log of the odds ratio (as

is usually done in diffusion studies), but has to be estimated instead with

non—linear methods. We applied (37) to the adoption of CT scanners, with t

defined in months and covering the period Nov. 1972 -             July   1981, and the total

population of potential adopters -       hospitals      and clinics - being N =    3,457•65
The dependent variables is thus F(t) =                  where n stands for the number of
                                                nt/N,
first-time buyers in month t; the figures for CW. are taken from table 9 (under

Toverall cumulative gains -ex-ante'). As a benchmark we estimate also a

logistic equation without k•CWt but with a free ceiling.

        The results are shown in table 10: first, note that diffusion was strongly

influenced both by 'demonstration effects' (embedded in t) and by technological

advance, as manifested in the fact that the estimates of                 and of k are both

highly significant; moreover, the fit improves greatly when going from (-I) to

(ii) (in terms of the RSS), implying that the traditional diffusion model, ignor-

-ing innovation, is wide'y off-mark. To put it in quantitative terms, k = 0.025

means that for every million $       worth of improvements in CT, the number of


a probability distribution does not make much of a difference.

adopters increased by 2.5; thus, -if technological change would have ceased just

after the -introduction of the first CT scanner, only 7.4 ot the total

population would have adopted throughout the period (since K                    0.074).   lo

reality, the ceiling had climbed to 49 by 1982, as a result                of   the flow of

innovations from 1974 on.66

      The estimated equation can also be put into use in order to obtain, albeit

in an indirect way, a measure of the initial gains from innovation, that -is, of

the gains associated with the introduction of the first CT scanner (recall the

discussion in II.a above). The question can be formulated as follows: what

would those initial gains (W73) have to be, in order to give rise to the

initial ceiling K0, given the estimated (sub)function K(CWt) =
                                                               K0
                                                                  +                k CW? The
answer is simply w73 =            =   0.074/0.025    =   2.99,   that is, and to put it
                           K0/k
carefully, (ii) in table 10 is equivalent to an equation in which K is deleted,

and       =   2.99 rather than zero. In other words, i-f the behavior underlying

equation (ii) is stable, then the introduction of the first CT scanner had to be

worth 3 million $ so as to induce 7.46 of hospitals and clinics to adopt the

innovation. Although we shall use this figure along with the other measures in

the coming sections, it should be born in mind that                   was computed in a very

different, and probably less precise fashion.

      A word about assigning benefits to purchases for replacement and additions

to capacity: again, these can be properly dealt with only in the context of a

full—fledged dynamic model, incorporating a capital accumulation process.




  66F4ote that CW82 =   16.65, and hence K82 = 0.074-fO.025x16.55           =   0.49.
                                        —70---




Short of that, and preferring to understate rather than overstate the total

gains, we proceed on the assumption that the benefits accruing to repeat

purchases at time t are just the incremental gains AWt.67

       We can now compute the yearly total gains as (note that         includes also

second scanners and replacements),



(38)            TW =   AW    + N(K0 + k CW) f           f(T)eTt1)dT]
                                                 t+l-



where the value of the parameters K0,k and those of f(.) are taken from the

diffusion equation as estimated in table 10, and the yearly discount rate is

assumed to be .05 (since f(T) is defined in months, the rate is actually .0041).

The integral -in (38) does not have a closed-form solution (because of

discounting), and hence we had to resort to numerical integration. The

computations are presented in table 11, which is largely self-explanatory. As

suggested above, these figures are likely to be biased downwards, and should

therefore be regarded as a lower bound: besides our assigning only the

incremental gains to additional and replacement scanners, we have ignored the

gains stemming from upgrades, i.e., from the retrofitting of older units,

usually at a fairly low cost to users.58 The only possible source of upward

bias lies in the implicit assumption that the underlying distribution of

'reservation prices' -is a step function, i.e., that -inframarg-inal users are



   67Note that this -is the lower bound, the upper bound being the sum of the
incremental gains from the time of the last purchase to the present one; the
latter requires separate calculations for each indivdiual, making it too costly
for us to undertake here.

   68Th-is was a fairly prevalent practice among the main manufacturers of CT
scanners, and it was aimed primarily at overcoming fears of 'premature
technological obsolescence' -in this rapidly advancing field. Nearly 259 of all
scanners installed up to mid-1981 have been upgraded, and hence ignoring them

indeed just at the margin prior to purchase so that, as he latest innovations

trigger adoption, they receive     in full; otherwise only a traction of the

incremental gains would actually be realized.69 On the other' hand, the

restraining influence of 'technological expectations' may significantl' reduce,

and even reverse this potential bias.7°


     b. R&D expenditures and social returns

     Having thus obtained the stream of social benefits from innovations in CT,

we want now to relate them to the costs of bringing them about, i.e., to R&D

outlays on CT, and compute some version of a rate of return. First, a brief

note about the data: one of the most pervasive problems in empirical micro

studies is the difficulty in obtaining reasonably good data at the level of

disaggregation prescribed by theory, i.e., specific, welldefined industries'

or 'markets'. R&D is particularly troublesome in that respect, since the

allocation of R&D expenditures across projects within firms is usually

regarded as highly confidential information, and there is little   if any

external evidence of such allocation. Furthermore, even if that kind of

information were available, it is not clear how one should distribute overheads

among the firm's various research fields, not to mention the problem of

accounting for externalities across R&D projects. Not surprisingly, studies



might result in a significant undercounting of benefits.

   69Obviously, the problem arises only because we are working with discrete
time periods: this would not be the case if we could compute dWt for
sufficiently small time intervals.

   70That is, users may delay adoption even though they have already passed
their threshold, expecting further technological improvements (see, for example,
Balcer and Lippman [1982fl; in that case the gains at the time of adoption will
exceed the latest incremental gains.
                                         —72--



using product-specific R&D are extremely rare.

     In spite of those difficulties, we have succeeded in gathering fairly

complete data on the R&D devoted specifically to CT scanners by almost all

firms that have -   or   had - been active in this field. Even though the sources

used vary substantially in their reliability and extent of coverage, there -is

plenty of independent evidence indicating that at least the orders of magnitude

are correct(see Trajtenberg [1983), section VII.3). The yearly figures for

total and US only R&D expenditures in CT are shown in table 12 (the breakdown by

firm cannot be exhibited because of a pledge of confidentiality).

     The question now is whose R&D should be used in computing a social rate of

return, that is, are we to count the R&D performed both in the US and abroad, or

just the R&D done by US firms? The source of ambiguity lies in the fact that we

have estimated the benefits accruing to US users only, whereas the market for CT

is global, both in terms of the origin of innovations and in the spread of their

benefits. Thus, for example, if we were to use just the R&D performed by US

firms, the resulting rate of return could be seen as an overstatement, since the

measured gains are due in part to foreign innovations whose costs are not

counted. Given the inconclusive nature of the issue, we shall compute rates of

return both to total and to US-only R&D, and loosely interpret them as lower and

upper bounds to the 'true' rate. As to the computational procedure, we have

chosen the capitalized benefit/cost ratio,71 (see, for example, Griliches

[1958]), i.e.,




   71An alternative would have been to use the internal rate of   return; however,
and aside from the fact that it may not render a unique result,   this method is
too sensitive to the benefits and costs -in the initial period.   Consequently,
small changes - or errors - in the magnitude or timing of those   initial Figures
(that usually are the least trustworthy), can drastically alter   the results.

that is, a dollar of R&D expenditures in CT scanners resulted in $3.5 of annual

returns in perpetuity when only local R&D is considered, and in $1.9 when

foreign R&D is included as well. Taking their average as a summary figure

(recall that (i) and (ii) can be interpreted as upper and lower bounds), we

conclude that the social rate of return to R&D in this field was about 27096.

To recall, we have not included profits in the measure of benefits, because of

lack of accurate data. However, even if profits amounted to, say, a staggering

5096 of revenues over the whole period,72 their impact on the computed rate of

return would be negligible, simply because the lw's are larger by a few orders

of magnitude. Thus, the above figure can indeed be regarded as a social rate of

return, subject only to the qualifications voiced in VI.d.

       What can be learned from this result? First, a rate of 27096 reaffirms the

view that R&D is indeed a highly rewarding activity for society as a whole, its

returns greatly exceeding those generated by more conventional forms of

investment. This is hardly news, but the sparsity of solid quantitative results




          exceeds what any firm had made in any particular period, not to
mention the fact that a few actually incurred substantial losses.
of this kind, and the traumatic impres3on       eft   cy   rhe      CCtiVt
seem to have fostered the   (nstaken) percept-ion that we may hee:'        hustino th

very same economy can and does generate new and better products with a

vengeance, only that we are not    used, or::ve   not yet icarued, to subsHtute

dollar figures for 'new' and 'better.

     Unfortunately, there are very few studies where rates of return to R&D for

individual innovations have been computed, and hence it is difficult to assess

the significance of the particualr figure arrved at here. Although referring

to a process rather than a product innovation, the main study in this context is

still Griliches [1958]: he estimated the social returns to R&D in hybrid corn

to be about 7OO, much higher than our estimates for CT scanners. Although

there is no reason whatever to expect that social, expust rates of return for

unrelated innovations will be of a similar order of magnitude, a closer look

reveals that in this case a methodological difference accounts for most of the

disparity in results. This has to do with the treatment of future benefits: in

Griliches' study the flow of benefits continues ad infinitum at the level

determined by the ceiling of the diffusion curve, i.e., whenever hybrid corn is

planted, now as well as in the future, society gets •the benefits of its superior

yield vis a vis conventional corn. By contrast, in our case the benefits cease

as the diffusion process dies off, since the purchase of additional --         cr
replacement - scanners in the future does not confer further gains. If we



   73The other important study of the kind is Mansfield et ml [1977]: they found
that the median social rate of return in a set of 17 innovations was 56, the
highest being 3O7. Unfortunately, their results are not directly comparable to
ours, since they used internal rates of return rather than benefit/cost ratios
                                             —75—


 recalculate the rate of return on hybrid corn omitting 'future' benefits (i.e.,

those accruing after 1955), using the figures for cumulated social net returns

and cumulated research expenditures from table 2 in Griliches [1958], we get

i =   .05(4,405/63)   =   3.5, almost the same as our upper bound of 346. This
similarity of results is somewhat suggestive and mildly reassuring, but in order

to be able to draw solid inferences one would need further empirical studies of

a similar nature, and a much better understanding of the determinants of social

returns to R&D.


      c. The time profile of benefits and costs

      Moving beyond the summary view provided by rates of return, we proceed now

to examine in detail the evolution over time of both social gains and R&D

expenditures: in so doing we hope to shed some light on the dynamics of the

innovative process itself. To that end we present in Figure 2 the time path of

incremental gains, both the actual figures and a 3-year moving average,74 and in

figure 3 the profiles of -      the   log of -   total   gains and total R&D

expenditures.75 To recall, the incremental gains reflect advances in the

technology itself (that is, the social valuation of those advances), whereas

total gains incorporate also the effect of a changing market size. However,



(recall footnote 68).

   74There is room to believe that the timing of specific innovations (e.g., the
date when the improved EMI head scanner was introduced in the US market) is
effected by random events, and, given the arbitrariness of any discrete partition
of the time dimension, a moving average may better capture the essence of the
underlying process.

   75We had to use logs (natural logarithms) rather than the actual numbers
in plotting figure 3, simply because of the enormous differences in the order
of magnitude of the figures: the total gains in the 1973-1977 period are in the
billions of dollars range, whereas later on they dip below 100 millions $, and
the R&D expenditures are well under that mark throughout.

since successive improvements in the technology t'ere found to strongly

influence the size of the market (by raising the ceiling of the diffusion

process), the time profiles of both incremental and          total   gainz look very much

alike, except of course for differences in scoic.

     The first feature to note is      that   the gains generated in the first half of

the period are far larger than those in the econd half. In fact, the

smoothed—out -   or stylized -    profile   resembles a log-normal distribution (or a

normal density truncated at about the first quartile), that is, it starts high,

rises still further during the initial period, and then declines rapidly,

carrying a long, low—level tail into the future.76 Such a pattern is, on

reflection, highly plausible and appealing, and it may be possible to account

for it by a -    generalization   of a -   fairly   common feature of economic processes,

namely, an initial, short-lived phase of scale economcs, promptly followed by

the setting—in of sharply diminishing returns. What -is peculiar -in the context

of innovation is that these increasing and decreasing returns appear to 'take

place' in three different dimensions: in the 'production' of innovations (i.e.,

in R&D/technology), in the utility or value generated by them, and in the

determination of market size (that is, the size of the population of adopters).

     With respect to R&D, it is usually relatively 'easy, both from the

viewpoint of the resources needed and of the underlying scientific and

technological principles, to improve the performance of a technology during its

initial stages. Later on, however, as the obvious advances are no longer there

to be made and the technology is pushed to its limits, the marginal cost of



   76Although we have measured the gains only up to 1982, we know that in the
period 1982-1985 no major technological advances have taken place; still, some
minor improvements were introduced, similar in character to those occurring in
1980—82. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the tail will indeed extend into
                                                 —77—


further improvements rises, and thus the rate of -innovation tends to abate. As

to the second dimension, it seems that there is often a 'threshold effect' in

the utility derived from the characteristics of new products, in the sense that

below a certain level of performance the product is pretty much worthless (that

was, for instance, the case with minimal resolution in CT scanners). That would

account for an initial phase of 'increasing returns' in the valuation of

technical improvements, but soon after diminishing marginal utility prevails:

thus, for example, increasing the speed of CT scanners from, say, 12 to 2 seconds

was not nearly as valuable as going from 60 to 10 seconds. As to the third

dimension, market size, consider how n evolves over time (recall that         stands

for the number of users that benefit from the incremental gain       as the

diffusion process unfolds):77 from (38), and assuming for simplicity K = 0,
                                                                         0


                           Cw
                      =   k -[1 -    F(t)]   -   k
                                                     CWf(t)
and hence,

                   d 2nnf = dlnCW
(39)                            dt
                                         -
                                             h(t)

where h(t) stands for the 'hazard rate', i.e., h(t)=f(t)/{1—F(t)]. In words

the behavior of n over time depends upon the rate of change of cumulative gains

vis a   vis   the hazard rate. As argued above, we would expect the former to be

non—increasing, whereas if diffusion follows a logistic pattern, h(t)=F(t) and

hence it increase monotonically. Thus, n will in general be a concave function




the future.

   77This is obviously relevant only for the time profile of total gains.
 and have a maximum, i.e. even if innovation proceeds at a constant pace, total

gains will eventually decrease, due to the fact that the diffusion process

exhausts itself faster than the rate of expansion of the market brought about by

technological change.

     As a convenient illustration of those effects, consider the innovation that

generated the largest benefits in the history of CT, namely, the introduction of

the second CT scanner model (the EMI CT 1000) in 1974: the basic design of the

system was virtually identical to the original EMI Mark I, except that its

resolution was almost doubled, a change that improved dramatically the ability

to visualize brain pathologies.78 Thus, if the first scanner proved the

jbilit of CI, the second transformed it into a useful diagnostic tool that

could be w-idely applied. This seems to be a fairly general phenomenon in

product innovations: the first commercial models of a new product are rarely

more than just the embodiment of a potentially useful idea; the real

leap-forward (and the concomitant benefits) comes with the advent of a model in

which some key quality dimensions are greatly improved, turning it into a

practical -   rather   than just an ingenious -   device   that can command wide appeal.

Examples about: the Ford—Model I in cars, the DC-3 in commercial aircraft, the

UNIVAC I in mainframe computers, etc.

     This early emergence of a 'big winner' that brings about the most gains

(let us refer to it as the 'Ford-I effect') can thus be seen as the lumpy

realization of 'increasing returns', that operate simultaneously along the three




   78I also had a much shorter reconstruction time, but that was not a crucial
characteristic at the time.

dimensions mentioned above, i.e. technology, utility and market size. Likewise,

the rather dramatic drop in   the flow of gains from innovation occuring later on,

can be attributed to diminishing returns setting-in at the same time in those

same dimensions.

     The idea that the process of technological advance may follow a cyclical

pattern, and perhaps even be the driving force behind wider economic

fluctuations, has been for a long time a favorite theme for some, as much as a

dubious subject of speculation for others.79 Once again, the lack of appropriate

measures of innovation has precluded so far the uncovering of solid empirical

evidence that could have 'set the record straight'. Taking a step in that

direction, our study shows that in one particular instance innovation did follow

indeed a wave-like pattern over time. Needless to say, much more is needed in

order to establish whether or not technological progress at large conforms to a

cyclical pattern; in particular, one would need to show: (a) that most

technologically progressive fields exhibit a similar innovative time profile,

and (b) that the innovation processes in different fields are not synchronized

or contiguous timewise, but rather sparce and lumpy (by synchronized we mean

that as one field starts experiencing a decline the next flourishes, so that

even if each fulfills (a), we would still observe in the aggregate a smooth and

approximately constant rate of innovation). To insist, there -is nothing in our

study to warrant such far-reaching generalizations (no individual case study can

do that); however, since casual observation and common experience (those much

abused providers of Hnformed guesses') seem to indicate that (a) and (b) might



   79schumpe-ter [1939] is still the most important and comprehensive statement
on this subject. As of late there has been, however, a resurgence of interest
in the possible existence of technologicai cycles": see, for example, Sahal
[1981], Judd [1985], and Shleifer [1985].
indeed be quite prevalent, the uncovering of the evidence presented here, even

if it refers just to one case, does enhance the plausibility of 'technological

cycles'. Of course, only further empirical studies of a similar sort can bring

us closer to a more definitive statement on this much debated matter.

     A few remarks about the time profile of R&O expenditures: as figure 3

reveals, the flow of R&D outlays closely traces, dth one year lead, the level

of activity -   or   'action' -   in   the field, as manifested in, say, numbers of

entrants and of new models, sales to new adopters (see table 1), etc. On the

other hand, it is not highly correlated with either incremental or total gains,

reflecting the above-mentioned increasing/decreasing returns sequence in the

technology dimension. To further highlight this notion, consider that the ratio

of social gains to R&D for the period 1968-1977 was a staggering 80 to 1 (taking

R&D up to 1976, on the assumption of a minimal lead-time of one year), whereas

the rate for 1978-1982 was a bare 1.4, and in 1980 the R&D outlays actually

exceeded the benefits. A straightforward implication is that average social

rates of return to R&D are not informative enough to serve as guides for policy:

the question is not so much whether public support to R&D -is warranted (it is

not too difficult to make a case for it), but rather until when along the

innovation cycle should such support be provided. In the case of CT, for

example, it is clear that whereas it was socially desirable to promote research

during the inital stages, that was certainly not the case after 1976.80 The

problem is that if one were to wait for hard evidence on returns to R&D over

time in order to decide what fields to support, the result might well be a



   80t is worth noting that the British Department of Health supported
Hounsfield's construction of the first prototype CT scanner at EMI in 1970-72,
and it seems that such support was crucial For the carrying out of the project.
Conversely, the American neurologist W.H. Oldendorf had independently developed
 stand—off, i.e. once the evidence is available the support may no longer be

 necessary. Thus, learning more about typical time profiles of innovations may

 substantially contribute to the design of public policy in this area.


     d. Further Applications

     The bulk of this paper has been devoted to methodog-ical and implementation

 issues in the measurement of product innovation, and hence there is little room

left here for applications, other than the most immediate ones as reported in

the previous section. To be sure, there are plenty of interesting ways in which

those measures can be brought into play: some we have already explored -in

Trajtenberg [1983] and elaborated in forthcoming papers, but a lot remains to be

done. Here we shall limit ourselves to mentioning the following: first, the

AW's can be easily related to the dynamics of market structure (e.g. changes in

concentration or in monopoly power), thus providing the means to address one of

the key issues in this area. Preliminary results show a strong positive

correlation between innovation and competition, and suggest simultaneity rather

than simple-minded one-way causal links. Second, the àW's can be used to

construct quality -adjusted price indices (or, more precisely, cost of living

indices), far superior to those that can be computed just from hedonic price

regressions. Third, these measures can help shed light on the usefulness of

patent counts for the study of innovation: so far we have found that whereas

simple patent counts correlate well with R&D outlays, patents weighted by number

of citations follow fairly closely the time profile of total gains. This seems

to be enough for now as a stimuli to the research agenda on technological

change.
