                                            ABSTRACT

       This paper characterizes the dynamic effects of shocks in government spending and taxes on
economic activity in the United States in the post-war period. It does so by using a mixed structural
VAR/event study approach. Identification is achieved by using institutional information about the
tax and transfer systems and the timing of tax collections to identify the automatic response of taxes
and spending to activity, and, by implication, to infer fiscal shocks.
       The results consistently show positive government spending shocks as having a positive effect
on output, and positive tax shocks as having a negative effect. The multipliers for both spending and
tax shocks are typically small. Turning to the effects of taxes and spending on the components of
GDP, one of the results has a distinctly non-standard flavor: Both increases in taxes and increases in
government spending have a strong negative effect on investment spending.

1 Introduction
This paper characterizes the dynamic effects of shocks in government spend-
ing and taxes on economic activity in the United States in the postwar period.
It does so by using a structural VAR approach that relies on institutional
information about the tax and transfer systems and the timing of tax col-
lections to identify the automatic response of taxes and spending to activity,
and, by implication, to infer fiscal shocks.
    One would have thought that such an exercise would have been carried
out already. But, as far as we can tell, it has not. Of course, large-scale
econometric models provide estimates of dynamic fiscal multipliers. Because
of their very structure however, they largely postulate rather than document
an effect of fiscal policy on activity. There exists also a large number of
reduced-form studies. But these have typically concentrated either on the
effects of some summary statistic of fiscal policy such as a cyclically adjusted
deficit, or on spending, or on taxes. Most theories do not suggest however

that the effects of fiscal policy on activity can be summarized by a single
measure such as the adjusted deficit, and studies that focus on either taxes
or spending implicitly make strong assumptions about the lack of correla-
tion between the included and the excluded fiscal variable, assumptions that
would appear unlikely to hold in general.1
    This paper can be seen as doing for fiscal policy what a number of studies
(in particular Bernanke and Mihov [1998]) have recently done for monetary
 policy. Indeed, the structural VAR approach would seem better suited to
 the study of fiscal policy than of monetary policy, for at least two reasons.
 First, budget variables move for many reasons, of which output stabilization
 is rarely predominant; in other words, there are exogenous (with respect to
 output) fiscal shocks. Second, in contrast to monetary policy, decision and
 implementation lags in fiscal policy imply that, at high enough frequency—
say, within a quarter—there is little or no discretionary response of fiscal
policy to unexpected movements in activity. Thus, with enough institutional
information about the tax and transfer systems and the timing of tax col-
lections, one can construct estimates of the automatic effects of unexpected
movements in activity on fiscal variables, and, by implication, obtain esti-
mates of fiscal policy shocks. Having identified these shocks, one can then
trace their dynamic effects on GDP. This is what we do in this paper.
     One methodological twist —one that was imposed on us by the data but
is likely to be useful in other contexts—is that we combine this structural
VAR approach with one akin to an event-study approach. Occasionally, the
data provide us with examples of large discretionary changes in taxation
or expenditure, for instance the large legislated tax cut that took effect in
the second quarter of 1975. These changes are too large to be treated as
realizations from the same underlying stochastic process and must be treated
separately. Thus we trace the effects of these large, one-time, changes by
studying the dynamic response of output to an associated dummy variable
        a study of the effects of fiscal policy in twelve large macroeconometric models, see
Bryant [1988]. A non-exhaustive list of reduced form studies includes Barro [1981] and
Ahmed and Rogers [1995] (who look at the effect of expenditures), Blanchard and Watson
[1986] (who look at the effect of an index of fiscal policy), Poterba [1988] (who looks at the
effects of tax cuts). The four studies closest to ours are by Rotemberg and Woodford [1992]
and Fatas and Mihov [1998], who study the dynamic response of government spending to
identified shocks in standard VARs, and Ramey and Shapiro [1997], Edelberg et al. [1998],
who trace out the effects of spending dummy variables in a reduced form VAR. Of these,
only Fatas and Mihov [1998] includes a revenue variable. We compare our results to these
four studies below.

                                             2
that we include in the VAR specification.2 As we show when we look at
the 1950s, not all such large fiscal events can be used so cleanly; when they
can, as in the case of the 1975:2 temporary tax cut, we find a high degree of
similarity between the impulse responses obtained by tracing the effects of
estimated VAR shocks, and by tracing the effects of these special events.
    Our results consistently show positive government spending shocks as
having a positive effect on output, and positive tax shocks as having a nega-
tive effect. The size and persistence of these effects vary across specifications
(for instance, whether we treat time trends as deterministic or stochastic)
and periods; yet, the degree of variation is not such as to cloud the basic
conclusion. Turning to the effects of taxes and spending on the components
of GDP, one of our results has a distinctly non-standard flavor: We find that
both increases in taxes and increases in government spending have a strong
negative effect on investment spending. (Keynesian theory, while agnostic
about the sign, predicts opposite effects of tax and spending increases on
investment.)
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the main specifica-
tion, and discusses identification. Section 3 presents the data and discusses
their main properties. Section 4 discusses the contemporaneous relations
between shocks to government spending, net taxes and output. Section 5
presents the dynamic effects of tax shocks. Section 6 does the same for
spending shocks. Section 7 discusses robustness; among other things, in this
section we take up the important issue of anticipated fiscal policy. Section 8
extends the sample to cover the period 1949:1-1959:4, and shows what can
be learned from the Korean war buildup. Section 9 presents the response of
the individual output components. Section 10 concludes.


2 Methodological issues
Both government expenditure and taxation affect GDP: since the two are
presumably not independent, to estimate the effects of one it is also necessary
to include the other. Hence, we focus on two-variable breakdowns of the
budget, consisting of an expenditure and a revenue variable.
    We define the expenditure variable as total purchases of goods and ser-
vices, i.e. government consumption plus government investment. We call
   2This is also the approach taken by Ramey and Shapiro [1997] and further developed
in Edelberg et al. [1998].

                                         3
it "government spending", or simply "spending" for short. We define the
revenue variable as total tax revenues minus transfers (including interest
payments). We call it "net taxes", or "taxes" for short. We discuss the data
in more detail in section 3.

2.1 The VAR
Our basic VAR specification is:
                                   = A(L, q)Yt_i + U                                 (1)

      [Ta, G, Xe]' is a three-dimensional vector in the logarithms of quarterly
taxes, spending, and GDP, all in real, per capita terms.3 We use quarterly
data because, as we discuss below, this is essential for identification of the
fiscal shocks. We allow either for deterministic (quadratic trends in logs), or
stochastic (unit root with slowly changing drift) trends, but defer a discussion
of this choice to the next section. We also allow for the presence of a number
of dummy variables; again we defer a discussion of this issue to later.
           [ti, gt, Xt]' is the corresponding vector of reduced form residuals,
which in general will have non-zero cross correlations.
    A(L, q) is a four-quarter distributed lag polynomial that allows for the
coefficients at each lag to depend on the particular quarter q that indexes the
dependent variable. The reason for allowing for quarter-dependence of the
coefficients is the presence of seasonal patterns in the response of taxes to
economic activity. Some taxes—such as indirect taxes, or income taxes when
withheld at the source—are paid with minimal delays relative to the time of
transaction. Other taxes—such as corporate income taxes—are often paid
with substantial delays relative to the time of the transaction; in addition,
if the bulk of the payment is made in one or two specific quarters of the
year, the delay varies depending on the quarter. Suppose, for illustrative
purposes, that a tax is paid in the last quarter of each year, for activity over
the year: then, in the last quarter, the tax revenue will depend on GDP in
the current and past three quarters; in the other three quarters, it will be
equal to zero and thus will not depend on GDP.4 We have collected evidence
  3We use the GDP deflator to express the variables in real terms. This allows us to
express the impulse responses as shares of GDP. Results using the own deflator to express
spending in real terms are very similar.
  4Note that the use of seasonally adjusted data does not eliminate the problem: the


                                           4
on quarter dependence in tax collection over the sample period from various
institutional sources. The appendix lists the main relevant features of the
tax code.5

2.2 Identification
As is well known, the reduced form residuals t, gt and Xt from (1) have
little economic significance: they are linear combinations of the underlying
 "structural" tax, spending, and GDP shocks. Without loss of generality, we
can write:

                              t, = aixt+a2e1+e
                              gt = bixt+b24 +4'                                       (2)
                              Xt = c1tt+c2g           +e
                    e
where 4, 4', and are the mutually uncorrelated structural shocks that we
want to recover.
   The first equation states that unexpected movements in taxes within a
quarter, t, can be due to one of three factors: the response to unexpected
movements in GDP, captured by a1 Xt, the response to structural shocks to
spending, captured by a2 4', and to structural shocks to taxes, captured by 4.
A similar interpretation applies to unexpected movements in spending in the
second equation. The third equation states that unexpected movements in
output can be due to unexpected movements in taxes, unexpected movements
seasonal adjustment corrects only for the "normal" seasonal variation in tax revenues, not
for the effects on tax revenues of changes in GDP that are not seasonal. To continue
the previous example, suppose GDP has been constant every quarter for a long time.
A seasonal adjustment like the X-1 1 method will correctly attribute approximately one
fourth of the last quarter's tax revenue to each quarter of the year. Suppose now there
is a shock to GDP in quarter 3. The seasonal adjustment will leave a large seasonally
adjusted value for taxes in quarter 4. The relation between this increase and the increase
in GDP will only be captured by a quarter dependent regression. Note also that, because
equation (1) is a reduced form, quarter dependence in the relation of taxes to GDP can
show up in all three equations; we thus have to allow for quarter dependence in all three
equations.
   5A warning is in order here. In some cases the pattern of collection lags has changed—
slightly—over time. Allowing for changes in quarter dependence in the VAR over time
would have quickly exhausted all degrees of freedom. We have not done it; as a result, our
adjustment is better than none, but still not quite right.


                                            5
in spending, or to other unexpected shocks, e. Our methodology to identify
this system can be divided into three steps.

     (1) We rely on institutional information about tax, transfer and spending
 programs to construct the parameters a1 and b1. In general, these coefficients
 could capture two different effects of activity on taxes and spending: the au-
tomatic effects of economic activity on taxes and spending under existing
fiscal policy rules, and any discretionary adjustment made to fiscal policy
 in response to unexpected events within the quarter. The key to our iden-
tification procedure is to recognize that the use of quarterly data virtually
eliminates the second channel. Direct evidence on the conduct of fiscal policy
suggests that it takes policymakers and legislatures more than a quarter to
learn about a GDP shock, decide what fiscal measures to take in response,
pass these measures through the legislature, and actually implement them.
The same would not be true if we used annual data: to some degree, fiscal
policy can be adjusted in response to unexpected changes in GDP within the
year.
     Thus, to construct a1 and b1, we only need to construct the elasticities
to output of government purchases and of taxes minus transfers. To obtain
these elasticities, we use information on the features of the spending and
tax/transfer systems:
     We could not identify any automatic feedback from economic activity to
government purchases of goods and services; hence, we take b1 = 0.
     Turning to net taxes, write the level of net taxes, T, as T =       where
the Ti's are positive if they correspond to taxes, negative if they correspond
to transfers.6 Let B be the tax base correspond to tax T (or, in the case of
transfers, the relevant aggregate for the transfer program, i.e. unemployment
for unemployment benefits). We can then write the within-quarter elasticity
of net taxes with respect to output, a1, as:

                              a1 ,        77T,B,   7lB,X
                                                           T.
                                                                                     (3)

where,      denotes the elasticity of taxes of type i to their tax base, and
7lB,X denotes the elasticity of the tax base to GDP.
   6The use of the tilde to denote the level of net taxes comes from the fact that we have
used T earlier to denote the logarithm of net taxes per capita.


                                            6
   To construct these elasticities, we extend earlier work by the OECD
(Giorno et al. [1995]), which calculated output elasticities of four separate
categories of taxes (direct taxes on individuals, corporate income taxes, so-
cial security taxes, and indirect taxes) precisely using the formula above,
i.e. as the product of the tax base elasticity of each type of tax revenues
and of the GDP elasticity of the tax base. The need to extend the OECD
work comes from the fact that OECD estimates are computed with respect
to annual changes, while we need them with respect to quarterly changes.
Both the elasticities of taxes to their base, the         in expression (3), and
the elasticities of the tax bases to GDP, the        s, can be quite different at
quarterly and annual frequencies:
    The quarterly tax base elasticities of tax revenues to their tax base can
differ from the annual elasticities because of tax collection lags. In the United
States, collection lags are probably relevant only for corporate income taxes
(see the Appendix).
    A more important source of divergence is the difference in the quarterly
and annual elasticities of the tax bases with respect to GDP. For instance, the
contemporaneous elasticity of profits to GDP, estimated from a regression of
quarterly changes in profits on quarterly changes in GDP, is substantially
higher than the elasticity obtained from a regression using annual changes
—4.50 versus 2.15, respectively. The reverse is true of the elasticity of un-
employment to output changes: it is, not surprisingly, lower when using
quarterly changes rather than annual changes.
    The value of a1 we obtain following this procedure varies over time, both
because the ratios of individual taxes and transfers to net taxes— the terms
T/T in expression (3) above—and the tax base elasticities of tax revenues—
the terms T,Bs—have changed over time. The average value of our measure
of a1 over the 1947:1-1997:4 period is 2.08; it increases steadily from 1.58 in
1947:1 to 1.63 in 1960:1 to 2.92 in 1997:4.

    (2) With these estimates of a1 and b1, we can construct the cyclically
adj'usted reduced form tax and spending residuals, t t — aixt and g
   —
     b1x = g (as b1 = 0). Obviously t and g may still be correlated with
each other, but they are no longer correlated with e. Thus, we can use them
as instruments to estimate c1 and c2 in a regression of Xt on t and g.
   (3) This leaves two coefficients to estimate, a2 and b2. There is no con-
vincing way to identify these coefficients from the correlation between t and

                                       7
g: when the government increases taxes and spending at the same time, are
taxes responding to the increase in spending (i.e. a2 0, b = 0) or the
reverse? We thus adopt an agnostic approach. We identify the model under
two alternative assumptions: in the first, we assume that tax decisions come
first, so that a2 = 0 and we can estimate b2; in the second, we assume that
spending decisions come first, so that b2 0 and we can estimate a2. It turns
out that, in nearly all cases, the correlation between t and g is sufficiently
small that the ordering makes little difference to the impulse response of
output.

2.3 Impulse responses
Having identified the tax and spending shocks, we can study their effects
on GDP. One of the implications of quarter dependence is that the effects of
fiscal policy vary depending on which quarter the shock takes place. One way
to deal with this would be to derive four impulse responses, depending on the
quarter where the initial shock occurs. This however would be cumbersome.
We adopt a simpler procedure. We use a quarter dependent VAR to obtain
the estimated covariance matrix, and thus the coefficients in equation (2) and
the contemporaneous effects of fiscal shocks. We then use a VAR estimated
without quarter dependence (except for additive seasonality) to characterize
the dynamic effects of the shocks; this gives, admittedly only in a loose sense,
the average dynamic response to fiscal shocks.
    We then consider a number of different impulse responses. We consider
the response of the three variables to a shock to taxes, both when taxes
are ordered first (a2 = 0), and when they are ordered second (b2 = 0).
Symmetrically, we consider the response of the three variables to a shock in
spending, both when spending is ordered first (b2 = 0) and when it is ordered
second (a2 0).
    The identified VAR also allows us to consider a number of counterfactual
experiments. Take for example the case of a shock to spending, when ordered
first (b2 = 0). We can ask how the response of output would have looked,
had taxes not responded within the quarter; this corresponds to putting a2
also equal to 0. We can go further and ask how the response of output would
have looked, had taxes not responded at all; this is done by looking at the
subsystem in the VAR composed of the terms in spending and output in the



                                       8
spending and the output equation.7

2.4 Discussion
Although the logic of our approach is similar to that of Bernarike and Mi-
hov [1998] and Gordon and Leeper [1994], our approach to identification is
different in one important respect. In those papers on monetary policy, iden-
tification is achieved by assuming that private sector variables, like GDP and
even interest rates (as in Gordon and Leeper [1994]), do not react to policy
variables contemporaneously. By contrast, we assume that economic activity
does not affect policy, except for the automatic feedback built in the tax code
and the transfer system.8
    No identification is without flaws, and ours is no exception. One implicit
assumption in our construction of a1 is that the relation between the various
tax bases and GDP is invariant to the type of shocks affecting output. For
broad based taxes, such as income taxes, this is probably fine. It is more
questionable, say, for corporate profit taxes: the relation of corporate profits
to GDP may well vary depending on the type of shocks affecting GDP.9


3 The data
We define net taxes as the sum of Personal Tax and Nontax Receipts, Corpo-
rate Profits Tax Receipts, Indirect Business Tax and Nontax Accruals, and
Contributions for Social Insurance, less Net Transfer Payments to Persons
and Net Interest Paid by Government. Government spending is defined as
Purchases of Goods and Services, both current and capital. The source is
the Quarterly National Income and Product Accounts, with the exception of
    71n reporting these counterfactual experiments, we admit to committing two crimes:
We ignore the Lucas critique. We violate the intertemporal government budget constraint.
With respect to the second, one interpretation is, barring Ricardian equivalence, that the
increase in taxes are pushed far into the future.
    8Thus, our approach is more akin to that of Sims and Zha [1996], who have argued
that cutting off the contemporaneous effects of policy on private sector variables might
give a misleading view of the importance of policy innovations.
    9Another issue is that we do not control for inflation. Much of government spending
is set in nominal terms, and unexpected inflation leads to unexpected movements in real
government spending. We are working on it.

Corporate Profits Tax Receipts, which are obtained from the Quarterly Trea-
sury Bulletin.10 All these items cover the general government, i.e. the sum
of the federal, state and local governments, and social security funds.1' AU
the data are seasonally adjusted by the original source, using some variant
of the X-11 method.12


3.1 High-frequency properties
Figure 1 displays the behavior of the ratio of government spending (i.e. pur-
chases of goods and services) and of net taxes (i.e. taxes minus transfers) to
GDP over the longest sample, 1947:1 to 1997:4. It is immediately obvious
that these series display a few extremely large quarterly changes in taxes and
spending, well above three times their standard deviations of 4.3 percent and
1.9 percent, respectively.
   There are two particularly striking changes in net taxes. First, the in-
crease in 1950:2 by about 26 percent (more than 6 times the standard de-
viation), followed by a further increase in 1950:3 by about 17 percent (or
about 4 times the standard deviation). These episodes represent in part the
reversal of the temporary 8 percent fall in net taxes in 1950:1, caused by a
large once-off payment of National Service Life Insurance benefits to the war
veterans; but mostly they represent a genuine increase in tax revenues. The
second episode is the large temporary tax rebate of 1975:2, which resulted in
a net tax drop by about 33 percent.'3
  '°The Quarterly National Income and Product Accounts report taxes on a cash basis,
except for the Corporate Profits Tax and the Indirect Business Tax, which are reported on
an accrual basis. We used the Quarterly Treasury Bulletin to obtain data on Corporate
Profit Tax on a cash basis. We could not find data on indirect taxes on a a cash basis;
however, the difference between receipts and accruals for the latter is very small.
  11We do not have data on the corporate profit tax on a cash basis for state and local
governments. This represents about 5 percent of total corporate profit tax receipts at the
beginning of the sample, and about 20 percent at the end.
  12            profit tax receipts are only reported without a seasonal adjustemnt. We
used the RATS EZ-X1 1 routine to seasonally adjust this series with the X- 11 method.
  13See Blinder [1981] for a detailed analysis of this tax cut, and its effects on consumption.
The 1975:2 tax rebate (which was combined with asocial security bonus for retirees without
taxes to rebate) corresponded to an increase in disposable income of about $100 billion at
1987 prices; by comparison, the 1968 surtax decreased disposable income by $16 billion

     On the expenditure side, the Korean war stands out: in 1951:1, at the on-
 set of the Korean war buildup, government spending increases by 10 percent
 (more than 5 times the standard deviation), and continues to grow at about
 the same quarterly rate during the next two quarters, 1951:2 and 1951:3;
 after this, spending continues to increase at more than twice the standard
 deviation in 1951:4 and again in 1952:2. It is difficult to think of the early
 1950s as being generated by the same stochastic process as the rest of the
data. Thus, our strategy is to proceed in two steps. For most of the paper,
we run a benchmark regression starting from 1960:1. In section 8, we extend
the sample back to include the 1950s and look at what we can learn from
this longer sample.
     Note that our benchmark sample still includes a large net tax episode,the
1975:2 tax cut. This episode is a well-identified, isolated, temporary, tax
cut which was reversed after one quarter. Hence, it can be easily and clearly
dummied. This allows us to compare two different types of impulse responses
to a net tax shock: one tracing the dynamic effects of the estimated estimated
net tax shocks, the other tracing the effects over time of a unitary shock to
the 1975:2 dummy variable.

3.2 Low-frequency properties
The general visual impression from Figure 1 is one of no clear trends, but clear
low—frequency (say decade to decade) movements in both spending and taxes.
One may be surprised by the general absence of upward trends in spending
and net taxes; but recall that we are looking at government spending not
including transfers, and that net taxes are taxes net of transfers. Thus, the
figures hide the trend increases in taxes and transfers, which have indeed
taken place during this period.
   The main practical issue, for our purposes, is how to treat these low-
frequency movements in our two fiscal series in relation to output. We have
conducted a battery of integration tests for T, C and X. Formal tests (Aug-
mented Dickey-Fuller and Phiffips-Perron, with a deterministic time trend)
do not speak strongly on whether we should assume stochastic or determin-
istic trends for each variable. We have also conducted a battery of coin-
tegration tests. One obvious candidate for a cointegration relation is the
difference between taxes and spending, T — C:'4 In fact, the stationarity of
 14Recall that T includes interest payments.


                                         11
 the deficit is the basic idea underlying the tests of "sustainability" of fiscal
 policy by Hamilton and Flavin [1986] and Bohn [19911.15 Figure 2 displays
the logarithm of the tax/spending ratio. Again, formal test results do not
speak strongly: one can typically reject the null of a unit root at about the
5% level, but no lower.'6
    In the light of these results, we estimate our VARs under two alternative
assumptions. In the first, we formalize trends in all three variables as de-
terministic, and allow for linear and quadratic terms in time in each of the
equations of the VAR. In the second, we allow for three stochastic trends.
We take first-differences of each variable, and, to account for changes in the
underlying drift terms, we subtract a changing mean, constructed as the
geometric average of past first differences, with decay parameter equal to
2.5 percent per quarter (varying this parameter between 1 and 5 percent
makes little difference to the results).17 For brevity, in what follows we will
refer to the two specifications as 'DT' (for 'deterministic trend') and 'ST'
(for 'stochastic trend'), respectively. In both specifications, we allow for the
current value and four lags of a dummy for 1975:2.
    In our benchmark specifications, we do not impose a cointegration restric-
tion between the tax and the spending variable. Later, we present results
under the restriction that T — C are integrated. This makes little difference
to the results.
    From now on, unless otherwise noted (in particular in section 8), our
results are based on the 1960:1-1997:4 sample.
  15Note however that we test cointegration between the logarithms of taxes and spending.
This is equivalent to testing cointegration between the logarithms of the net tax/GDP ratio
and of the spending/GDP ratios.
  16This lack of strong evidence for cointegration between T and G is consistent with a
number of recent empirical studies: see e.g. Bohn [1998], who tests for cointegration over
the 1916-95 period using annual data.
  '7A popular approach to dealing with changing trends is to apply a two-sided filter
such as the Hodrick-Prescott filter, or the filter developed by Baxter and King [1996] and
Stock and Watson [1997]. When the filtered data are used for econometric purposes, these
two-sided filters have the disadvantage that future events can heavily influence today's
trend: for example, a large temporary increase in defense spending in a given quarter will
cause the estimated trend to increase long before that quarter, causing a large fall in the
detrended series before and a large increase after the event (the graph of filtered defense
spending in Stock and Watson [1997] illustrates this point vividly). Our filter is one-sided,
and thus not subject to this problem.

4 Contemporaneous effects
The first two panels of Table 2 give the estimated coefficients of the contem-
poraneous relations between shocks in equation (2), under DT and ST, and,
for a2 and b2, under the two alternative assumptions that taxes come first,
or that spending comes first.'8 For convenience of interpretation, while the
original estimated coefficients have the dimension of elasticities, the table
reports derivatives, evaluated at the point of means (dollar change in one
variable per dollar change in another). Table 2 yields two main conclusions.
   The first is that the signs of the contemporaneous effects of taxes and of
spending on GDP —c1 and c2—are those one would expect — the former
negative and the latter positive, and are rather precisely estimated. The two
coefficients have very similar absolute values, and are also very similar across
the two specifications, DT and ST. Under DT, a unit shock to spending
increases GDP by 0.96 dollars, while a unit shock to taxes decreases GDP by
0.87 dollars. The estimated negative effect of taxes on output depends very
much on the use of instruments: the simple correlation between unexpected
movements in cyclically unadjusted taxes, t, and unexpected movements
in output, Xt, is positive and equal to 0.38. This raises the issue of the
robustness of the construction of cyclically adjusted taxes to the specific
value of a1; we return to the issue below.
    The second conclusion is that the correlation between cyclically adjusted
tax and spending innovations is low (—0.09 in our sample) yielding relatively
low estimated values of a2 and b2 under either of the two alternative iden-
tification assumptions. These small values imply that the ordering of taxes
and spending makes little difference to the impulse responses.

same under ST.'9 For visual convenience, the impulse responses in these and
the following figures and tables are transformations of the original impulse
responses, and give the dollar response of each variable to a dollar shock in
one of the fiscal variables. The solid line gives the point estimates. The
broken lines give one-standard deviation bands, computed by Monte Carlo
simulations (assuming normality), based on 500 replications. Table 3 sum-
marizes the main features of the responses of the three variables. This table
will be useful to compare in a compact way the results from the benchmark
specifications to alternative specifications.
   Under DT (top panel of Figure 3 and of Table 3), output falls on impact by
about 70 cents and keeps falling for another year, reaching a trough 5 quarters
out, with a multiplier (defined here and below as the ratio of the trough
response of GDP to the initial tax shock) of 0.78. From then on, output
increases steadily back to trend. The effect of tax shocks on government
spending is small at all horizons, with the largest effect being -0.26 after 12
quarters, but it is precisely estimated.
   Under ST (bottom panel of Figure 3 and of Table 3), the response of
output is stronger and more persistent. Tax shocks have a very similar effect
on output on impact, but the output trough is larger (-1.33 against -0.78
under DT), taking place after 7 quarters instead of 5; after this, the response
of output stabilizes at around the peak response. The effect on taxes is
slightly more persistent than in the DT case, while the effect on spending is
similar.
    Thus, under both specifications tax increases have a negative effect on
output. In both cases, the effect on output takes time to build up, with the
largest response occurring after 5 or 7 quarters depending on the specification.
The negative response of output is more pronounced under the assumption
of a stochastic trend.
   When taxes are ordered second, the results (not shown) are virtually
identical to those in Figure 3. This comes from the low correlation between
cyclically adjusted tax and spending innovations, which in turn leads to a
small value of a2.
    The counterfactual GDP impulse responses in which government spending
is taken to be constant over time (not shown) are almost identical to those
in Figure 320 The reason is again clear from Figure 3: the response of
  19Note that the initial value of taxes is not exactly 1. A unit tax shock translates
into a less than unit change in taxes tt, since GDP falls in the same quarter.
  '°We compute the counterfactual responses by using the subsystem composed of the

                                         14
spending to changes in taxes is small anyway; setting it equal to zero makes
little difference to the rest of the results.

5.2 Dynamic effects of the 1975:2 net tax cut
The two panels of Figure 4 trace out the dynamic effects of a unit shock
to the 1975:2 dummy variable, under DT and ST respectively.21 As we are
looking at a tax decrease, the signs are reversed relative to Figure 3. But
the effects are very similar. The impulse response captures well the fact that
this tax decrease was temporary: taxes are back to normal after a quarter.
The effects on output take some time to build up, reaching a peak after 4
quarters with a multiplier of 0.75 under DT and 1.02 under ST, thus close to
the multipliers in Table 3. As usual, the response of output is more persistent
under ST. The effects on spending are again small.
    We find this similarity of results with the impulse responses from iden-
tified shocks comforting. The main difference is that the largest output
response is reached sooner than in the impulse response to the typical tax
shock; this is plausibly explained by the smaller persistence of the tax shock
in the 1975:2 episode than of the typical tax shock in Figure 3.


6 Dynamic effects of spending
The two panels of Figure 5 show the effects of a unit spending shock on GDP
when spending is ordered first (b2 = 0) under DT and under ST. As in the
case of taxes, Table 4 summarizes the main features of the responses to a
spending shock under alternative specifications.
    Under DT (top panel of Figure 5 and of Table 4) spending shocks are
longer lasting than tax shocks: 95 percent of the shock is still there after
2 years. GDP increases on impact by 0.84 dollars, then declines and rises
again, to reach a peak effect of 1.29 after almost 4 years. Net taxes also
respond positively over the same horizon, probably mostly as a consequence
of the response of GDP (notice that the shape of the tax response mimics
closely the shape of the output response).
output and the tax equation only in the VAR.
  211n this and in figure 7 the standard errors are computed by bootstrapping instead
than by Monte Carlo integration.

                                           Figure 5: Response to a spending shock
    The peak output response is smaller under ST (bottom panel of Figure 5
and of Table 4), 0.90 against 1.29. The peak effect is now reached on impact
rather than after 4 years; notice also that the impact response is very similar
under DT and ST. The standard error bands are also quite large, so that
the response of output becomes insignificant after only 4 quarters. Note the
strong response of spending, which stabilizes at about 1.6 after 2 years.
    Thus, in all specifications output responds positively to a spending shock.
Spending reacts strongly and persistently to its own shock. Depending on
the specification, the spending multiplier is larger or smaller than the tax
multiplier.
    As in the case of taxes, the ordering of the two fiscal variables does not
matter for the response to spending shocks: when taxes are ordered first, a
shock to spending yields virtually identical effects on output (not shown) to
those in Figure 5.
    Given the strong response of taxes to spending, one is tempted to ask:
If taxes did not increase in response to spending, how much larger would
the response of output to such a 'pure' change in spending be? Recall that
in the benchmark responses in Table 4 taxes continue to increase, reaching
0.52 and 0.37 (under DT and ST, respectively) after 5 years. Hence, when
we set the path of taxes exogenously to 0, we obtain a larger GDP response
(not shown), particularly at longer horizons. Under DT, the peak multiplier
and the GDP response after 5 years are 1.43 and 1.34, against 1.29 and 0.97,
respectively, in the benchmark case of Table 4. Under ST, the same numbers
are 0.98 and 0.88 in the counterfactual exercise, against 0.90 and 0.66 in the
benchmark impulse response.

7 Robustness
7.1 Sub-sample stability
Subsample stability is an important concern in a VAR that covers nearly
40 years. Unlike monetary policy, fiscal policy does not lend itself easily
to a periodization based on alternative policy regimes. Hence, we check for
subsample stability by dropping one decade at a time.22 Table 5 reports the
results from this exercise. The left and right parts summarize the impulse
   221n performing this exercise, each time we recompute the average value of a1 over the
relevant sample.

responses of output to a net tax shock and a spending shock, respectively,
obtained by dropping one decade at a time.
    The exclusion of the eighties causes a substantial drop in the magnitude
of the tax multiplier, under both ST and DT. The instability is more pro-
nounced under DT: the tax multiplier ranges from -0.49 when the eighties
are excluded to -1.45 when the nineties are excluded. There is also evidence
of some instability in the spending multiplier, in particular under ST: the
multiplier when the eighties are excluded is about three times that when the
seventies are excluded — 1.80 against 0.62.

7.2 Quarter dependence
How important is quarter dependence for our results? 23 In terms of F tests,
not very important: Under DT, an F-test on the coefficients of the quarter-
dependent lags in our reduced form equations 24 gives p-values of 0.24 in the
tax equation, 0.67 in the spending equation, and 0.46 in the output equation.
Under ST, the p-values are 0.12, 0.32, and 0.15.
    Turning to impulse responses: The responses to tax shocks obtained from
non-quarter dependent estimation (the first two panels of Table 6) are very
similar to those in Table 3. The difference is larger for spending shocks (next
two panels of Table 6). Under DT, the response of output on impact increases
by about 40 percent, so that now the peak response occurs immediately rather
than after 15 quarters; under ST, the impact response and the spending
multipliers increase by about 30 percent.

7.3 Cointegration
The last panel of Table 6 simimarizes the impulse response when we impose a
cointegrating relation between G and T in our ST specification with quarter
dependence. As one can see, there is surprisingly little difference in the
  23Recall that we use quarter dependence only to identify the shocks, but we compute
the impulse responses from a system estimated without quarter dependence.
  24Formally, if qi, q2 and q3 are dummy variables for the first three quarters, we can
write our system as
   Yt = B(L)Y_1 + B1(L) * ql * Yt—i + B2(L) * q2 * Yr—i + B3(L) * q3 * Yt_i + Ut      (4)
and run an F-test on all the coefficients of the appropriate row of B1, B2, and B3.

7.4 Alternative net tax elasticities
Our identification procedure depends crucially on using as an instrument.
This series in turn depend very much on the elasticity of net taxes a1. One
may ask how sensitive the results are to alternative values of a1. Figure 6
gives the effects of a tax shock on GDP, for DT and ST, when taxes are
ordered first (a2 = 0), and for three different values of a1: the baseline value
minus 0.5, the baseline value, and the baseline value plus 0.5. We believe that
the range implied by these three values more than covers the relevant range
for a1. A simple way of describing our results is that a change of a1 from
the bottom to the top of the range increases the impact effect on GDP (in
absolute value) by 0.5 under both specifications, and increases the maximum
multiplier (in absolute value) by 0.5 under DT and by 0.8 under ST. We
read this figure as saying that the broad response of output we characterized
earlier is robust to the details of construction of a1.

7.5 Anticipated fiscal policy.
Implicit in our approach is the assumption that the policy innovations we
have estimated were indeed unanticipated by the private sector. While we
share this assumption with the whole VAR literature, we recognize that it
is particularly problematic here: most of the changes in tax and transfer
programs are known at least a few quarters before they are implemented.
    We do not have a general solution to this problem; but once again we can
use the large tax event of 1975:2 to make some progress. Suppose the large
tax cut had been anticipated by, say, one quarter; then if we add one lead of
the 1975:2 dummy in our specification, it will pick up the effect, if any, of
the anticipated tax cut on GDP. The coefficients on leads of the tax duimny
simply pick up the residuals for GDP (in the benchmark specification) in the
quarters before the change. For both 1974:4 and 1975:1, the two residuals
are negative, leading to estimated negative effects, at one and two leads, of
the 1975:2 tax cut on GDP in 1974:4 and 1975:1. Thus, there is no evidence
of anticipated effects of the 1975:2 tax cut on GDP.
 251n keeping with quarter dependence, we allow the coefficient of the cointegrating term
G_1 — Ti_i to differ depending on the quarter.

        Figure 6: Response to a tax shock under alternative tax elasticities
8 Adding the fifties
We have used the post-1959 sample in the benchmark regressions presented
so far. The reason, we argued, was that the 1950s, with their large spending
and tax shocks, do not appear generated by the same stochastic process as
the post-1959 data. Still, there is a number of ways in which the 1950s can be
used to provide information on the effects of fiscal policy. We have explored
two of them.

8.1 Using dummies for the major tax and spending
       shocks.
The first approach parallels our treatment of the 1975 tax cut. We extend
the sample to start in 1949:1, use dummies for the major tax and spending
episodes, then trace both the effects of normal fiscal shocks in the VAR
estimated using the extended sample, as well as the effects of the dummies.
    The last approach runs however into an identification problem which we
did not face in the post 1960 sample. We can still trace the dynamic effects
of normal fiscal shocks—et and epsilon9—on output. But if we allow the
dummy associated with each major tax and spending shock to have its own
distributed lag effect, we cannot identify the effects of each major spending
or tax shock: they are too close in time to each other. More concretely, when
looking at output for example in 1950:3, we cannot distinguish between the
effect of the 1950:1 tax cut after two quarters, the effect of the 1950:2 tax
increase after one quarter, or the contemporaneous effect of high spending in
1950:3. Nevertheless, something—admittedly more informal—can be learned
by estimating the deviations of taxes, spending and output from normal in
the early 1950s. We shall show what can be learned below.
    Table 7 displays impulse responses estimated using the sample starting
in 1949:1, but allowing for 13 dummies from 1950:1 to 1953:1 (equivalently 9
dummies, each with four lags; this is another way of stating the identification
problem we just discussed). Under both DT and ST, the tax and spending
output multipliers are similar to those of Tables 3 and Table 4, respectively.
The shapes of the impulse responses are also very similar to those from the
post-1959 sample. The main difference is that the output response to a
spending shock under DT is much less persistent, stabilizing after about 8
quarters at around 0.20, instead of 0.65 in the post-1959 sample.
   Turn now to the effects of the large fiscal shocks of the early 1950s. Figure

                                              Figure 7: Response to a shock to the 1950:1 dummy
 7 gives the deviations of taxes and spending from normal, starting in 1950:1,
and the associated deviation of output, as captured by the coefficients on the
 13 dummies and their dynamic effects through the VAR dynamics.
    The figure shows an initial fall in taxes, followed by a strong increase,
which after the first 2 quarters, largely mimics the path of GDP. This captures
the large tax cut of 1950:1, and the larger tax increases of 1950:2 and 1950:3.
    Spending initially deviates little from normal, then it increases over time.
This captures the large buildup in defense spending associated with the Ko-
rean war, starting in 1951:1, and continuing until 1952:2.
  We can then think of the path of GDP as the response of GDP to this
complex path of taxes and spending. The response of GDP shows an initial
increase—presumably to the initial tax cut—followed by further increases—
presumably in response to the Korean war buildup. The effects of spending
and taxes appear larger than in the post-1960 sample. In the DT case, the
maximum increase in output is more than 2.5 times the maximum increase
in spending (and this despite the fact that the increase in spending comes
with a nearly equal increase in taxes). In the ST case, this ratio is smaller,
but still equal to 1.5.

8.2 Defense vs. non-defense spending
Another way of approaching the difference between the 1950s and the rest of
this sample is to note that the 1950s were dominated by shocks to defense
spending, while the rest of the sample is dominated by shocks to non-defense
spending. Hence, by dividing government spending between its defense and
non-defense components, we can hope to capture explicitly the different per-
sistence of the spending shocks in the early 1950s and in the rest of the
sample.
   Following this approach, Table 8 and Figures 8 and 9 display the im-
pulse responses from a four-variable VAR, with defense and non defense
government spending on goods and services replacing aggregate government
spending on good and services. The system also includes the 1975:2 dummy
variable and its first four lags.
    The contemporaneous correlation between the two shocks to defense and
non-defense spending is small —0.18——so the order of the first two variables
makes virtually no difference to the results. We report the results in 8 so the
variable whose effect is studied is ordered first. In general, the standard error
bands for the GDP response are larger when we shock non-defense spending,

reflecting the fact that the standard deviation of the latter is about half the
standard deviation of defense spending.
    Under DT, we obtain large and similar multipliers for defense and non-
defense spending 2.50 and 2.67, respectively —, with a bell-shaped output
response in both cases. The persistence of the two spending shocks is indeed
very different: defense spending keeps increasing considerably for one year
after the initial shock, while non-defense spending starts falling immediately
after the shock. Note also that, after a few quarters, defense spending declines
substantially in response to a non-defense shock, while the response of non-
defense spending stabilizes at about 0.20 after a defense shock.
    Under ST, the responses to a defense shock display a similar picture—
the output response is smaller and the spending response stronger and more
persistent. But the output response to a non-defense shock is now small
and always insignificant, despite the fact that non-defense own response is
stronger and more persistent. The likely explanation is in the estimated
defense response, which becomes negative very soon and exceeds, in absolute
value, the response of non-defense spending. At the moment, we do not
have an explanation for this lack of robustness of the impulse responses to
non-defense shocks across the DT and ST specifications.

8.3 Discussion
This is the place to compare our results to those of Fatas and Mihov [1998],
Rotemberg and Woodford [1992], Ramey and Shapiro [1997], and Edelberg
et al. [1998]. All of these studies except Fatas and Mihov [1998] study the
response of output to defense spending shocks.
    The first two studies estimate impulse responses of output to fiscal vari-
ables innovations estimated from VAR's. In both cases the identification
procedure differs somewhat from ours.
    Fatas and Mihov's specification is closest to our benchmark: Their VAR
includes output, the GDP deflator, the ratio of the primary deficit to GDP,
and the interest rate; their sample starts in 1960:1. Identification is achieved
by assuming that the "sluggish" private sector variables, output and prices,
do not respond to changes in policy within a quarter; this, in a sense, is
the exact opposite of our approach. An increase in the primary deficit by 1
percentage point of GDP leads to an increase in GDP by about 1 percentage
point after about two years, while the primary deficit goes back to trend very
quickly. If we interpret the increase in the primary deficit as coming from an

                                      21
increase in spending, then their estimated spending multiplier is similar to
what we find over the same sample (see Table 4, DT), although our spending
shocks are much more persistent.
   Rotemberg and Woodford's specification is closest to our defense/non de-
fense decomposition. They trace the effects of military spending and military
employment shocks on output by Choleski-decomposing a four-variable VAR
in personnel military expenditure, military purchases, output, and the real
wage. They do not control for other spending or for taxes. Their sample
covers 1947 to 1989. The estimated impact elasticity of private GDP to mil-
itary purchases (when ordered first) is about 0.1, which implies an impact
multiplier above 1.0 (the average ratio of military purchases to GDP has been
below 10 percent after WWII), and a bit larger if one considers total GDP,
as we do. This effect persists for about 4 quarters, and dies out completely
after 8 quarters. Thus, they find a smaller defense multiplier than we do.
    The last two studies are closest to our event study approach. Ramey and
Shapiro and Edelberg, Eichenbaum and Fisher adopt a 'narrative approach'
exploiting the exogeneity of military buildups. They define one dummy vari-
able taking the value of 1 in 1950:3, 1965:1, 1980:1, and trace out its effects on
a number of macroeconomic variables, including GDP. Ramey and Shapiro
do so in the context of univariate models, Edelberg, Eichenbaum and Fisher
in the context of a VAR.
    Both sets of authors find a roughly coincidental increase of defense spend-
ing and of GDP. Based on the graphs in Edelberg, Eichenbaum and Fisher,
defense spending peaks after two years at about 2.5 percentage points of
GDP, and slowly declines thereafter. GDP peaks after 4 quarters at about
3.5 percent, and then goes back to trend within 2 or 3 years. Because their
estimated initial increase in spending is small, the defense spending multi-
plier, defined as we do as the ratio of the peak response of GDP to the initial
spending shock, appears to be about 28; if the multiplier is defined as the
maximum increase in GDP to the maximum increase in spending, it is about
1.4.
   Assuming the episodes that are captured by the dummy variable approach
are truly exogenous, the advantage of their approach is that one does not
need to identify the VAR in order to trace out the effects of the dummy
variable. But when the dummy variable incorporates episodes with different
characteristics, it is not clear exactly what response one is estimating when
tracing the effects of a shock to the dummy. And the episodes appearing in
the Ramey and Shapiro dummy do differ greatly, in terms both of size and

                                       22
of the accompanying tax policy: the Korean war buildup was accompanied
by large tax increases, the (much smaller) Reagan buildup by tax cuts.

9 Effects on output components
9.1 The system
We now go back to the post-1959 sample, and decompose the output effects
of tax and spending shocks into the effects on each component of GDP. This
exercise is interesting in itself, and also because it helps sort out the relative
merits of alternative theories. For instance, both standard neoclassical and
Keynesian models imply a positive effect of government spending on output.
However, neoclassical models usually predict a negative effect on private
consumption (see e.g. Baxter and King [1993]), while Keynesian models
usually predict the opposite sign.
    We estimate a four-variable VAR, with the component of GDP whose
response we are studying ordered last. The relation between residuals now
becomes

                           t    = aixt+a2e' +e
                           gt =    b1   Xt   + b2 e + e                       (5)
                           Xt   = c1t+c2g +e
                          Xj,   = d1 t + d2 g + e
where "x,t" indicates a component of GDP, so e and et are in general be
correlated.

9.2 Response to a tax shock
Table 9 displays a summary of the impulse response of the various GDP
components to a net tax shock, under DT and ST. The impulse responses of
aggregate GDP and government spending change with each component added
to the VAR, raising the issue of which one to report; in the first two lines in
each case, we give the response of GDP and government spending from the
three-variable model (see Table 4). The last line in each case displays the
unconstrained sum of the responses of the individual components of GDP,
which is denoted by 'SUM'.

  Sample: 1960:1 - 1997:4. See also notes to Table 3.
   Under DT, an increase in taxes reduces all the private components of
GDP. After a small decline on impact, private consumption falls by a maxi-
mum of 0.35 (35 cents) after 5 quarters; investment falls by 0.36 on impact
and then increases to become marginally positive after 2 years. The negative
effect on imports and exports is very small. The sum of the responses of the
components of GDP is not too far from the response of GDP in the 3-variable
system.
   A similar picture emerges under ST, with very similar peak negative re-
sponses of private consumption and investment, and again small responses
of imports and exports. However, the difference between the GDP response
in the 3-variable model and the sum of the responses of its components is
more pronounced.

9.3 Response to a spending shock
The next two panels in Table 9 display the responses to an increase in gov-
ernment spending. The peak responses of each component are considerably
larger than in the case of tax shocks.
    Under DT, on impact private consumption increases by 0.50 (50 cents),
while investment does not move; imports and exports now react strongly,
increasing by 0.64 and 0.20, respectively. The positive effect on consumption
builds up for 14 quarters, reaching a peak of 1.26; investment declines for
the first 5 quarters, with a peak crowding out effect of 1. After the initial
surge, exports start declining with a maximum negative effect of 0.80 after
9 quarters; similarly, after an initial positive impact imports start declining
and reach a negative peak of 0.49 after 9 quarters. All these responses are
precisely estimated, and the unconstrained sum of the responses is close to
the impulse response of GDP in the. 3-variable system.
   Under ST, the basic picture is qualitatively similar, but the peak re-
sponses of consumption, imports and exports are weaker; the standard error
bands for these components also become wider. Note that in this case also
the output response is very close to the sum of the responses of the individual
components.
    Thus, we find that private consumption is consistently crowded out by
taxation, and crowded in by government spending. Perhaps more surpris-
ingly, we consistently find a considerable crowding out of investment both
by government spending and to a lesser degree by taxation; this implies a
strong negative effect on investment of a balanced-budget fiscal expansion.

                                      24
The effects of fiscal policy on investment are clearly inconsistent with a stan-
dard Keynesian approach. In the standard Keynesian model, an increase
in spending may increase or decrease investment depending on the relative
strength of the effects of the increase in output and the increase in the inter-
est rate; but, in either case, increases in spending and taxes have opposite
effects on investment. This is not the case empirically. Interestingly, using a
yearly panel VAR on 20 OECD countries over the same period, Alesina et al.
[1999] reach the same conclusion on the effects of fiscal policy on investment.
Note also the decline in imports (after a brief initial surge), which is also
rather surprising in light of the considerable increase in GDP.


10 Conclusions
Our main goal in this paper was to characterize as carefully as possible the
response of output to the tax and spending shocks in the post-war period in
the United States. From the several specifications we have estimated and the
different exercises we have performed, we reach the following conclusions:
    The first is consistent with standard wisdom: When spending increases,
output increases; when taxes increase, output falls. The others are perhaps
more surprising:
    In most cases the multipliers are small, often close to one. In the case
of spending shocks, the proximate explanation is in the opposite effects they
have on the different components of output: While private consumption in-
creases following spending shocks, private investment is crowded out to a
considerable extent. Both exports and imports also fall.
    The responses of investment and imports are difficult to reconcile with
most macroeconomic theories; thus, while we do not attempt an explanation
here, we believe they certainly deserve further Investigation.

A. 2 Elasticities
To construct the aggregate net tax elasticity to GDP, a1, we consider four
categories of taxes: indirect taxes (IND), personal income taxes (INC),
corporate income taxes (BUS), and social security taxes (88). For each
category, we construct the elasticity to GDP (X) as the product of the tax
elasticity to its own base,        and the elasticity of the tax base to GDP,
       (see expression (3) in the text). For each tax, we must also take into
account the possible presence of collection lags and of quarter dependence.
  26For the corporate income tax, the NIPA report only taxes on an accrual basis. We
therefore replace coprorate income taxes from NTPA with corporate income tax receipts
from the Quarterly Treasury Bulletin. We do not have this series for the state and local
governments.
  27Corporate income taxes collected by state and local governments are not included.


                                          26
On the expenditure side, we also construct an approximate output elasticity
of total transfers. The rest of this section describes our assumptions.

Indirect taxes.
We take the tax base to be GDP. (This is an approximation. In many states,
food consumption is excluded. In most states, the sale of materials to manu-
facturers, producers and processors is also excluded (see Advisory Committee
of Intergovernmental Relations [1995]). Hence:

77BIND,X = 1.0
IND,BIND = 1.0    (from Giorno et al. [1995])

Collection lags: 0.
Quarter dependence: none.

Personal income taxes.
We start from the formula for the elasticity to GDP from Giorno et al. [1995].
Let T = t(W)W(E)E(X), where T is total revenues from the personal in-
come tax, t is the tax rate, W is the wage (or earnings, in the OECD terminol-
ogy), E is employment and X is GDP. Define the tax base as BINC = w * E.
Assuming constant elasticities everywhere, define:

elasticity of taxes to earnings: D = dlog(tW)/d log W
elasticity of earnings to employment: F = d log W/d log E
elasticity of employment to output: H d log E/d log Y
Totally differentiating the expression for total tax revenues ,after some steps
one obtains:

7/BINC,X =   H/(F+1)
711NC,BINC =  (FD+1)/(F+1)
We obtain values of D from Giorno et al. [1995]. We estimate F from a re-
gression of the log change of the wage of production workers on the first lead
and lags 0 to 4 of the log change in employment of production workers. We
estimate H from a regression of the log change of employment of production
workers on the first lead and lags 0 to 4 of the log change in output. The
values of F and H are the estimated coefficients of lag zero of the dependent

                                      27
variable. We find F = .62 and H =     .42.

Collection lags: 0.
Quarter dependence: none.

   Note that for personal income taxes we assume the same elasticity for
employees and self-employed: the former have their taxes withheld at the
source, while the latter make quarterly payments based on the estimated
income of that quarter. As long as there is no systematic pattern in the end-
year adjustments (as it should be, if the tax system is well designed), our
assumption does not introduce any substantial bias in our aggregate elastic-
ity.

Social security taxes.
We follow exactly the same procedure as for personal income taxes. The only
difference is in the value of the elasticity of taxes to earnings, D, which we
also obtain from Giorno et al. [1995].

Corporate income taxes.
Each corporation can have its own fiscal year different from the tax year.
Large corporations are required to make quarterly installment payments, of
at least .8 of the final tax liability. No penalty was applied if the estimated
tax liability is based on the previous year's tax liability; this exception has
been gradually phased out from 1980 on. Hence:

          we estimate it as the lag 0 estimated coefficient from a regres-
sion of quarterly changes of corporate profits on the first lead and lags 0 to
4 of changes in output.
71BUS,BBUS Giorno et al. [1995] gives a value of 1 for the annual elasticity.
This would be the right value of the quarterly elasticity for tax accruals. For
tax receipts, we estimate it from a regression of tax receipts on the first four
lags of tax accruals, allowing for a different coefficient when the dependent
variable is measured in the second quarter, and constraining the coefficients
on the first four lags to be the same. Our value for BUS,BBUS is this con-
strained coefficient on the first four lags. We obtain a value of .85 from this
procedure.

Collection lags: yes. This follows from the fact that we use a value of .85 for

                                      28
T1BUS,BBUs' as explained above. This value appears stable over time.
Quarter-dependence: yes. (for the same reason as above)

Transfers.
Among transfers, unemployment benefits certainly have a large within-quarter
elasticity to the cycle. However, unemployment benefits are a relatively small
component of transfers: in 1993, unemployment expenditures (defined as the
sum of 'active' and 'passive' measures) represented 2 percent of total expen-
diture in the United States. Other categories of transfers might be sensitive
to the cycle. We do not have reliable quarterly data for our sample on the
components of transfers that might be sensitive to the cycle. Therefore, we
use a value of -.2 for the elasticities of total tranfers to GDP. This is just a
gross approximation based on the annual GDP elasticity estimated by the
OECD for total current expenditure, -.1. As the effects are small to start
with, and given our results on robustness reported in the text, this is unlikely
to make any significant difference to our results.
