                                              ABSTRACT

Does significant market power or the presence of large rents affect optimal income taxation, calling
for greater redistribution due to tainted gains? Or perhaps less because of an additional wedge that
distorts labor effort? Do concerns about inequality have implications for antitrust, regulation, trade,
and other policies that influence market power, which contributes to inequality? This article addresses
these questions in a model with heterogeneous abilities and hence a concern for distribution, markups,
multiple sectors, ownership that is a function of income, allowance for any share of profits to be recoveries
of investments (including rent-seeking efforts), endogenous labor supply, and a nonlinear income tax.
 In this model, proportional markups with no profit dissipation have no effect on the economy, and
a policy that reduces a nonproportional markup raises (lowers) welfare when it is higher (lower) than
a weighted average of other markups. With proportional (partial or full) profit dissipation, proportional
markups are equivalent to a downward shift of the distribution of abilities, and the welfare effect of
correcting nonproportional markups associated with nonproportional profit dissipation now depends
also on the degree of dissipation and how that is affected by the policy. In all cases, optimal policies
maximize consumer plus producer surplus, without regard to a policy’s distributive effects on consumers
and profits or how markups and income taxation distort labor effort.

1. Introduction
         Market power has long been a subject of economic analysis and plays a central role in a
range of public policies including antitrust, intellectual property, and regulation. Pertinent
literatures often use models that examine a single industry, ignore income distribution through
the use of a representative agent, and do not focus on labor supply. In contrast, analysis of
optimal income taxation typically assumes perfect competition when addressing the tradeoff of
distribution and labor supply distortion. It is natural to extend both sets of analysis by exploring
the interaction of market power and income taxation in a model in which all of these
considerations are in play.
         Growing concerns for inequality and about the extent of market power magnify the
importance of this subject. 1 If a large slice of the profits that contribute to inequality constitutes
tainted gains from monopoly or rent-seeking, might the case for greater redistribution be
magnified? Conversely, if inequality is a substantial concern and is partly attributable to market
power, should the broad range of policies influencing the state of competition be toughened and
perhaps also tilted toward the maximization of consumer surplus rather than total surplus? Such
issues were the subject of earlier literatures—for example, Robinson (1933) and Comanor and
Smiley (1975)—and have recently received increasing attention, such as in OECD (2017) and
World Bank and OECD (2017).
         On the other hand, might the presence of compound distortions cut in the opposite
direction, as some other literatures suggest? After all, markups in product markets raise prices,
thereby reducing the real wage, and quantity reductions by sellers with market power are
associated with reduced input demands, notably, for labor. As a consequence, the quantity of
labor supplied is below the optimal level. Moreover, labor income taxes—and consumption
taxes, such as a VAT, along with payroll taxes and income-based phaseouts of transfer
payments—also create a substantial wedge that distorts labor supply downward. If each
distortion was of a similar magnitude, the aggregate distortion would be on the order of four
times that of each considered alone, and the marginal contribution of taxation to total distortion
would be three times as high in the presence of the preexisting distortion created by market
power (and vice versa). Does this interaction imply that the optimal degree of redistribution is
significantly lower? And does it suggest that all manner of policies aimed to enhance
competition should be pursued more aggressively than otherwise would seem efficient?
         Finally, we should ask how the answers to these questions change if the corresponding
profits from the exercise of market power constitute returns to prior investments in fixed costs or
R&D. And what if instead markups are generated by rent-seeking activity wherein profits are
dissipated by real, unproductive resource costs?
         This article addresses these issues by analyzing a model with market power and income
taxation. As will emerge, each of the foregoing ideas viewed in isolation captures a piece of the
story, but examination of the system as a whole reveals them to be incomplete and even
misleading. When taking an integrated view of market power and income taxation that accounts
for labor effort, distributive concerns relating to both consumer surplus and profits, and the
inefficiencies of imperfect competition, it turns out that some of the competing considerations in
a sense cancel each other out. Perhaps surprisingly, the overall result is to leave largely intact

 Studies finding large average markups include Domowitz, Hubbard, and Petersen (1988), Rognlie (2015), Feenstra
and Weinstein (2017), De Loecker, Eeckhout, and Unger (2018), and Hall (2018); see also the discussion in
Syverson (2019).


                                                       1
standard competition policy prescriptions that ignore distribution, labor supply distortion, and
income taxation, and also to preserve familiar formulations for the optimal degree of
redistributive income taxation that are predicated on models with no market power.
         Section 2 begins by introducing the model. Individuals of different abilities choose labor
effort and a vector of goods to maximize utility. Their budget constraint is given by labor
income net of payments under a nonlinear labor income tax schedule, plus an ownership share of
the economy’s profits. These shares are taken to be some function of income, allowing for
higher-income individuals to hold larger portfolios and to have access to higher-return
investments (none of which is explicitly modeled). Following a number of literatures, each good
is produced at constant marginal cost but sold at a some markup. The government uses income
tax revenues to purchase a vector of goods at the markup-inclusive prices.
         As a benchmark for thinking, the analysis begins with the case of proportional markups.
It is demonstrated that such an economy is equivalent to an otherwise-identical economy with no
markups. The definition of equivalence is that, for any income tax schedule that balances the
government’s budget in one economy, there exists what is referred to as a corresponding income
tax schedule in the other economy such that individuals of every type choose the same labor
effort, purchase the same vector of goods, and therefore achieve the same level of utility, while
the government’s tax revenue is just sufficient to purchase the same vector of goods at the prices
prevailing in that economy. A further implication is that the optimal income tax for the economy
with markups corresponds to that for the economy with no markups, which means that it
achieves the same distribution of utilities and thus social welfare (for any social welfare
function), although its stated marginal tax rates differ, perhaps substantially.
         To explore the more realistic case of nonproportional markups, the section analyzes
marginal reforms that change a single markup. It uses the methodology employed in Kaplow
(2008) and other work of analyzing policy experiments that include an offsetting (in aggregate,
distribution-neutral) adjustment to the income tax schedule that enables Pareto assessments and,
relatedly, does not require that the income tax be optimal. Reducing a markup raises (lowers)
everyone’s utility if the markup is above (below) a particular weighted average of the other
markups in the economy. As will be explained, this average differs for each markup that might
be changed (both because different other markups are averaged and because the weights are
different), so there does not in general exist a single level of markup for which it is optimal to
reduce all higher markups and raise all lower markups. The fact that reducing low markups
tends to decrease welfare runs counter to much conventional policy in antitrust, regulation, and
other realms in which interventions often focus on an industry in isolation. Although the
conventional approach could be rationalized if all markups but the targeted one equaled zero,
that assumption is contrary to empirical evidence.
         Section 3 extends the model to the case in which some or all of the profits produced by
markups constitute recoveries for investments—which may be thought of as fixed costs, entry or
search costs, R&D, rent-seeking, or anything else. See, for example, Schumpeter (1947) and
Demsetz (1973), and, on rent-seeking in particular, Tullock (1967), Krueger (1974), and Posner
(1975). Importantly, the analysis is qualitatively the same regardless of the social desirability of
the investment and the degree to which profits are thereby dissipated. Of particular interest is the
case of full dissipation, as in a wide range of models with free entry in which expected profits
equal zero in equilibrium. See, for example, Dixit and Stiglitz (1977), Mankiw and Whinston
(1986), Aghion and Howitt (1992), Hopenhayn (1992), Ericson and Pakes (1995), and Melitz




                                                 2
(2003). 2 But the analysis also covers partial dissipation and no dissipation as well as negative
dissipation (positive spillovers) and more than full dissipation (negative spillovers beyond the
creation of the markup itself).
         When markups are proportional and the degree to which profits constitute returns for real
resource use is also proportional across all goods, the economy is equivalent to an otherwise
identical economy with no markups (and no dissipation) in which the distribution of individuals’
abilities is shifted downward to a degree that reflects the portion of profits in the original
economy that constitute the recovery of real resource costs. An economy’s production
possibility frontier can be thought of as a combination of the production technology (including
the nature of investments that produce markups) and the distribution of abilities. With
proportionality, we can equate any economy to one with the same marginal costs for goods but
with all other costs embedded, in a sense, in the ability distribution. This equivalence is useful
because the optimal income tax problem and others have been extensively analyzed for models
that assume perfect competition. As a consequence, familiar results can be translated
mechanically to an economy with markups and profit dissipation.
         For the general case in which markups or profit dissipation are not proportional, marginal
reforms are again assessed using offsetting adjustments to the income tax schedule to enable
Pareto comparisons. Section 2’s results are amended to reflect that only the undissipated portion
of markups is relevant to allocative efficiency. In addition, most actual policies (antitrust,
regulation, and so forth) that affect markups also affect resource use related to the generation of
the markups, so a full policy assessment incorporates these productive efficiency effects as well.
Policy rules are derived for general reforms that involve any relationship between effects on
allocative and productive efficiency. These rules, like all others in this article, can be stated as
involving the maximization of consumer plus producer surplus, regardless of the distributive
effects of the reform on either one and independently of how markups and income taxation
distort labor effort.
         Throughout the analysis and in the conclusion, a number of qualifications and potential
extensions are noted. The model explored here offers a preliminary but expanded view of the
intersection of market power and income taxation. A byproduct is the illumination of a number
of related literatures that are largely complementary to this investigation in both the questions
they address and, relatedly, the models they employ.
         The closest prior discussion, which pertains to the analysis in section 2, is Lerner’s
(1934) brief but insightful suggestion that what matters is not the difference between price and
marginal cost but the dispersion of markups, a perspective that grounds some modern work in
international trade. See, for example, Epifani and Gancia (2011) and Holmes, Hsu, and Lee
(2014). 3 Of particular interest, Lerner stated that, in a world in which every good was subject to
proportional markups—noting parenthetically “including leisure”—there would be no
distortion. 4 For that qualification to hold would require a tax on leisure, which some literature
(for example, Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (forthcoming)) implements, in a representative-agent
model, with a flat-rate subsidy (negative tax) on labor income funded by a lump-sum tax. Of

2
  Relatedly, empirical analysis by Hall and Woodward (2010) suggests that entrepreneurs funded by venture capital
approximately break even on an ex ante, risk-adjusted basis.
3
  Weyl and Fabinger’s (2013) analysis of pass-through also examines the case in which there are positive markups in
multiple industries.
4
  Given the era, it is not surprising that Lerner did not consider heterogeneous types, which would have introduced
concerns for income distribution, or income taxation.


                                                        3
course, we generally see the opposite: a positive tax on labor income, some of which funds
transfers that resemble a lump-sum grant, which also accords with the prescriptions of the
optimal income taxation literature.
         Taking this latter point further, some writing, such as Hart (1982) and World Bank Group
and OECD (2017), has discussed market power as involving a labor wedge, and Browning
(1994), Kaplow (1998), and Jonsson (2007) suggest that the combination of the labor wedge due
to monopoly markups and that due to income taxation involves the sort of magnification of
deadweight loss noted above. Some of this latter work, however, is informal, and it all operates
in a representative-agent setting that does not allow for a flexible income tax schedule or address
the distributive incidence of markups or profits.
         Traditional work in industrial organization and that considering competition policy in
particular typically focuses on a single industry and implicitly is in the setting of representative-
agent models with no concern for distribution and no income taxation. See, for example, Tirole
(1988), Motta (2004), Whinston (2006), Kaplow and Shapiro (2007). Earlier work that focuses
on distributive effects, such as Robinson (1933) and Comanor and Smiley (1975), does not
analyze or even refer implicitly to heterogeneous ability, labor supply, and income taxation.
Some modern informal commentaries—for example, Baker and Salop (2015) and OECD
(2017)—and government policy statements—such as the U.S. Horizontal Merger Guidelines
(2010) and the EU Guidelines on Horizontal Mergers (2004)—endorse a consumer surplus test,
often motivated by the difference in the distributive incidence of markups and profits.
         Seminal work in public economics on income taxation (Mirrlees (1971)) and various
extensions (for example, Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976)) assume perfect competition. Two
literatures have straddled public economics and industrial organization. One line, surveyed in
Myles (1995) and Auerbach and Hines (2002), considers the use of corrective taxes (subsidies)
to offset markups in a representative-agent setting without distributive concerns or an income
tax. Another, starting with Barro and Sala-i-Martin (1992), is pursued by Judd (1997, 2002),
who considers markups with representative, infinitely-lived agents in a dynamic model, wherein
a capital subsidy can offset the input market wedge on capital.
         None of these varied literatures focus on the intersection of market power and income
taxation, specifically in a world with heterogeneous abilities, concerns for distribution,
ownership shares that may depend on income, multiple sectors, and markups. Nor is there an
assessment of policy experiments or a consideration of how the analysis differs if some or all of
the markups constitute returns to investment, whether in fixed costs, R&D, or rent-seeking.


2. Analysis

2.1. Model

        There are 𝑛𝑛 goods 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 , 𝑖𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛𝑛, and 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 denotes the total quantity of good 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 in the
economy. Each good 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 is produced at constant marginal cost 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 and sold at price 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 + 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 ,
where the 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 are exogenously given markups (expressed for convenience as amounts rather than
as fractions of marginal cost). It will also be convenient to employ the Lerner index, 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 ≡ 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 .
Total profits in selling good 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 are 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 = 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , and economy-wide profits are Π = ∑𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖=1 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 .
        Individuals’ abilities (wage rates) are denoted by 𝑤𝑤, distributed according to the density
function 𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤), which is positive on [0, ∞). Each individual chooses a nonnegative level of labor


                                                    4
supply, 𝑙𝑙, earning income 𝑦𝑦 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤, and quantities of each of the 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 . It will sometimes be useful to
refer to the total income earned in the economy, 𝑌𝑌 = ∫ 𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑, where the notation 𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)
refers to the level of income that an individual of type 𝑤𝑤 optimally chooses to earn. (Similar
notation expressing the optimally chosen level of a variable as a function of the type 𝑤𝑤 will be
employed below without further comment.)
         Individuals’ utility functions, 𝑢𝑢(𝑥𝑥1 , … , 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 , 𝑙𝑙, 𝑤𝑤), are increasing in each 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 and decreasing
in 𝑙𝑙. Individuals maximize utility subject to the budget constraint
                                            𝑛𝑛

                                     (1) � 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦 − 𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) + 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦)Π.
                                           𝑖𝑖=1

In this expression, 𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) is the nonlinear income tax schedule (which may be negative, indicating
transfers), and 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦) is the share of profits received by individuals who earn y. The latter is a
reduced form that incorporates, for example, the possibility that individuals with higher income
have greater ownership positions or access to higher-return investments. (It includes the case in
which 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦) = 1 for all 𝑦𝑦, as assumed in many literatures, typically in the context of
representative-agent models.)
             The government’s revenue from the income tax is used to provide public goods (taken to
be outside the model and given) using quantities of each private good in the economy, denoted
𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 . Its budget constraint is
                                           𝑛𝑛

                                   (2) � 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 = � 𝑇𝑇�𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)�𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.
                                         𝑖𝑖=1

When the budget constraints of all individuals and the government hold, an economy-wide
resource constraint will also be satisfied: ∑𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖=1 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = 𝑌𝑌, where 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 = ∫ 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 (𝑤𝑤)𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 . The
markups paid by individuals and the government for goods are ultimately received by individuals
as profits, and what individuals pay in taxes is received by the government, leaving only the
production costs for goods and the total income produced by labor.

2.2. Proportional Markups

        This section will establish that in an important sense proportional markups are of no
consequence in this setting. Define an economy 𝐸𝐸 as the set of n private goods 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 , the
government’s consumption of those goods (the 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 ), production costs 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 , markups 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 , utility
functions 𝑢𝑢, a density function for types 𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤), and an ownership distribution function 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦).
Note that the nonlinear income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) is not part of the definition of E. We will wish
to compare such an economy to another economy, 𝐸𝐸� , that may differ in its markups, 𝜇𝜇̂ 𝑖𝑖 , and, in
section 3’s extension, in its density function for types, 𝑓𝑓̂(𝑤𝑤). Now we can define:

Equivalent Economies: Economy 𝐸𝐸 is equivalent to economy 𝐸𝐸� if and only if, for every
admissible income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇 in economy 𝐸𝐸, there exists a corresponding income tax
schedule 𝑇𝑇� in economy 𝐸𝐸� such that:



                                                         5
           (a) Individuals of every type 𝑤𝑤 have the same budget sets in both economies.
Specifically, when choosing any level of labor 𝑙𝑙, any choice of the goods 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 that satisfies the
budget constraint (1) in economy 𝐸𝐸 with income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇 also satisfies the budget
constraint in economy 𝐸𝐸� with income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇�.
           (b) Individuals of every type 𝑤𝑤 make the same choices of labor effort, 𝑙𝑙, and the goods,
𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 , in both economies, and achieve the same level of utility, 𝑢𝑢.
           (c) The government’s budget constraint (2) is satisfied in economy 𝐸𝐸� with corresponding
income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇�.

         A few remarks on this definition are in order. An admissible tax schedule 𝑇𝑇 refers to one
that satisfies the government’s budget constraint (2) in economy 𝐸𝐸 when individuals in that
economy maximize their utility subject to their own budget constraints (1). Requirement (a), that
individuals have the same opportunity sets in both economies, implies that each type 𝑤𝑤 will
choose the same 𝑙𝑙 and 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ’s in both economies and achieve the same level of utility 𝑢𝑢 (assuming
throughout that, in cases of indifference, the same choices will be made). Hence, requirement
(b) is implied by requirement (a), but it is stated separately for clarity. Requirement (c),
concerning satisfaction of the government’s budget constraint, assumes that individuals’
behavior is indeed the same, as just stated. (Of course, this does not in itself imply that the
condition is met because the income tax schedule, and thus tax revenue, as well as the prices the
government pays for goods, in general differ.) Finally, it will sometimes be useful to refer to 𝑇𝑇
and its associated 𝑇𝑇� as corresponding income tax schedules.
        We are now ready to state:

Proposition 1: If the markups in economy 𝐸𝐸 are proportional (i.e., there exists 𝜆𝜆 such that 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 =
𝜆𝜆 for all 𝑖𝑖), then the otherwise identical economy 𝐸𝐸� , except with no markups (i.e., 𝜆𝜆̂𝑖𝑖 = 0 for all
𝑖𝑖), is an equivalent economy. 5

            Proof: We will begin with economy 𝐸𝐸 and an (otherwise arbitrary) admissible tax
schedule 𝑇𝑇 and construct a tax schedule 𝑇𝑇� for economy 𝐸𝐸� that satisfies the definition. Start with
individuals’ budget constraints (1) in economy 𝐸𝐸. They can be restated using the proposition’s
assumption of proportional markups—and the fact that, from the definition of the Lerner index,
𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 ⁄(1 − 𝜆𝜆)—as follows:
                                           𝑛𝑛
                                                   𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖
                                    (3) �               𝑥𝑥 = 𝑦𝑦 − 𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) + 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦)Π.
                                                 1 − 𝜆𝜆 𝑖𝑖
                                          𝑖𝑖=1

Multiplying both sides of equation (3) by 1 − 𝜆𝜆, this can be expressed as
                                    𝑛𝑛

                             (4) � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦 − 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆 − (1 − 𝜆𝜆)(𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) − 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦)Π).
                                   𝑖𝑖=1

Let us now define the corresponding income tax schedule as

5
    Note that Proposition 1 implies that any two economies with proportional markups are equivalent.


                                                            6
                              (5) 𝑇𝑇�(𝑦𝑦) ≡ 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆 + (1 − 𝜆𝜆)(𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) − 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦)Π).

Substituting definition (5) into equation (4), we have
                                                  𝑛𝑛

                                           (6) � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦 − 𝑇𝑇�(𝑦𝑦).
                                                 𝑖𝑖=1
Finally, observe that Π� = 0 because, with a zero markup on every good, there are no profits in 𝐸𝐸� .
Therefore, equation (6) is individuals’ budget constraint in economy 𝐸𝐸� . Moreover, this
derivation shows that it is equivalent to the budget constraint (1) in economy 𝐸𝐸: for any level of
labor effort 𝑙𝑙, which earns the same before-tax income 𝑦𝑦 in each economy (for any given type
𝑤𝑤), individuals can afford precisely the same bundles of the goods 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 in both economies. This
establishes that the hypothesized corresponding income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇� meets requirement (a) of
the definition for equivalent economies, which, as already explained, implies requirement (b).
        It remains to demonstrate requirement (c): that, when individuals behave the same way
(regarding both labor effort and purchases of goods), the government’s budget constraint (2) is
satisfied in economy 𝐸𝐸� with income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇�. Beginning with this constraint, which is
assumed to be satisfied in economy 𝐸𝐸 with income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇, we can, as with individuals’
budget constraints, make the substitution on the left side, 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 ⁄(1 − 𝜆𝜆), to yield
                                      𝑛𝑛
                                              𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖
                               (7) �               𝑥𝑥 𝐺𝐺 = � 𝑇𝑇�𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)�𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.
                                            1 − 𝜆𝜆 𝑖𝑖
                                     𝑖𝑖=1

Next, we can rearrange terms in expression (5) for the corresponding income tax schedule to
isolate 𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) and then integrate both sides over 𝑤𝑤, which yields

                                                         𝑇𝑇��𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)� − 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆(𝑤𝑤)
                 (8) � 𝑇𝑇�𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)�𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = �                                 𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + Π.
                                                                  1 − 𝜆𝜆

Using equation (8) to substitute on the right side of equation (7) and multiplying both sides by
1 − 𝜆𝜆 gives us
                        𝑛𝑛

                  (9) � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 = � �𝑇𝑇��𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)� − 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆(𝑤𝑤)� 𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + (1 − 𝜆𝜆)Π.
                       𝑖𝑖=1

Using the expression for total income earned in the economy, 𝑌𝑌, we have
                               𝑛𝑛

                    (10) � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 = � 𝑇𝑇��𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)�𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆 + (1 − 𝜆𝜆)Π.
                              𝑖𝑖=1

The economy-wide resource constraint in 𝐸𝐸 is




                                                         7
                                                             𝑛𝑛

                                              (11) 𝑌𝑌 = � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 .
                                                            𝑖𝑖=1

Furthermore, another manipulation of the Lerner index shows that 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 = ((1 − 𝜆𝜆)⁄𝜆𝜆)𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 .
Substituting this in equation (11) allows us to state
                                    𝑛𝑛                              𝑛𝑛
                                   1 − 𝜆𝜆             1 − 𝜆𝜆          1 − 𝜆𝜆
                       (12) 𝑌𝑌 = �        𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 =        � 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 =        Π,
                                     𝜆𝜆                 𝜆𝜆              𝜆𝜆
                                   𝑖𝑖=1                            𝑖𝑖=1

where the latter two equalities follow from the definitions of 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 and Π, respectively. Finally,
using expression (12) to substitute for 𝑌𝑌 in expression (10) and simplifying, we have
                                         𝑛𝑛

                              (13) � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 = � 𝑇𝑇��𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)�𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.
                                     𝑖𝑖=1


Expression (13) indicates that, under income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇�, the government’s budget constraint
holds in economy 𝐸𝐸� (which, recall, has no markups, so prices for private goods, 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 , are given by
𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 ).∎

         Return now to Lerner’s (1934) suggestion that markups do not matter if all prices are
elevated proportionally above respective marginal costs. In his first (of two) statements of this
claim, he noted parenthetically that this conclusion supposes that the proportionality of markups
holds with respect to leisure as well, that is, a reciprocal markdown on labor. As the introduction
mentions, some subsequent literature, in the context of representative-agent models, instantiates
this idea by postulating a negative linear tax (a constant subsidy) on labor income financed by a
lump-sum tax.
         In actual fact, of course, most modern economies instead have a positive marginal tax on
labor income—through income taxes as well as payroll taxes and consumption taxes, and also
due to phaseouts of transfer programs. Relatedly, we are interested in economies in which
individuals have different income-earning abilities, so the notion of financing a negative tax on
labor with a positive lump-sum tax is the opposite of what is usually contemplated. Also, to
close the model, explicit attention must be paid to the ultimate distribution of profits to different
individuals, which compounds distributive concerns because higher-income individuals tend to
receive greater shares of profits. The foregoing derivation shows that, when one incorporates all
of these features, which may have been thought to cut against or at least complicate Lerner’s
claim, one nevertheless obtains equivalence.
         As the introduction notes, this conclusion also runs contrary to a suggestion in some
literature that, when we take the negative wedge on labor supply required to offset the distortion
due to markups and combine it with a preexisting positive labor income tax (as allowed for here),
the result is a compound distortion. One might have thought that the labor wedge due to
markups reduced the optimal degree of income redistribution. Proposition 1 shows that, in the
present setting, this is not the case.
         To put this point more precisely, consider explicitly the implications of proportional
markups for optimal income taxation. An optimal income tax schedule, 𝑇𝑇 ∗ (𝑦𝑦), in economy 𝐸𝐸 is


                                                        8
defined as the admissible income tax schedule that maximizes an individualistic social welfare
function of the standard form (that is, a positive function of all individuals’ utilities). The
following corollary is immediate from the fact that Proposition 1 holds with respect to any
admissible income tax schedule.

Corollary 1.1. 𝑇𝑇 ∗ is the optimal income tax schedule for economy 𝐸𝐸 with proportional markups
if and only if the corresponding income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇� ∗ is the optimal income tax schedule for
the otherwise identical economy 𝐸𝐸� , except with no markups.

         Reflection on the definition of an equivalent economy, particularly requirement (b)’s
statement that all individuals have the same utility levels, explains why this result follows. The
derivation of an optimal income tax schedule for economy 𝐸𝐸� with no markups is, of course, the
standard optimal nonlinear income tax exercise. In an economy that instead has proportional
markups, the optimal income tax schedule can be seen in two ways. First, in a substantive sense,
there is no difference: the degree of redistribution will be the same and, indeed, all real activity
in the economy is the same—everyone’s labor effort and choices of goods are the same, their
utilities are the same, and the government’s purchases are the same. Second, the actual
(nominal) income tax schedule is different, in a manner that is mechanical, as determined by
expression (5) that defines the relationship between 𝑇𝑇 and the corresponding income tax
schedule 𝑇𝑇�. For example, if 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦)⁄𝑦𝑦 rises with 𝑦𝑦, the average tax rate under 𝑇𝑇 (that is, in the
economy with proportional markups) will rise more quickly with income (in real terms) than
under 𝑇𝑇�.
         It aids intuition to restate expression (5) as follows:

                        (14) 𝑇𝑇�(𝑦𝑦) ≡ (1 − 𝜆𝜆)𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) + 𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆 − (1 − 𝜆𝜆)𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦)Π.

The first term on the right side of expression (14) scales down the original income tax (or the
transfer, if negative) so that it is denominated in what may be viewed as the new currency (price
index) of economy 𝐸𝐸� , reflecting that everything is correspondingly cheaper when the markups
are removed. The second term taxes away the portion of an individual’s labor income that went
to covering the markups that are no longer charged. The third term is a subsidy to reimburse
individuals for the profits they no longer receive, scaled (like the first term) to reflect the new
currency of economy 𝐸𝐸� . This explains why the construction in the proof results in individuals
having the same budget sets in the two economies and hence making the same choices and
achieving the same utility.
        Finally, the fact that the income tax schedule that produces this equivalence for all
individuals also produces equivalence for the government can best be understood from the
economy’s total resource constraint (as used in the proof). Once we know that all real behavior
is the same—individuals, as just explained, behave the same, and we are further supposing that
the government’s purchases of goods are the same—the resource constraint will likewise be
satisfied in 𝐸𝐸� . When examining the real resources in the economy, we can ignore profits (which
are transfers from individuals and the government, as consumers, to producers, who in turn
distribute those profits in some manner to the individuals) and income taxes (which are transfers
between individuals and the government). In all, individuals’ labor produces the same quantum
of goods, and individuals’ and the government’s consumption of these goods is the same.



                                                  9
2.3. General Markups

        In this section, which examines more practically relevant settings in which markups are
not proportional, our interest is in how to evaluate reforms rather than to state equivalences. 6
Clearly, much competition and trade policy as well as regulatory revision aims, at least in
significant part, to reduce markups in the economy. In order to undertake policy evaluation, it is
convenient to restrict the utility function so that it can be expressed as 𝑢𝑢(𝑣𝑣(𝑥𝑥1 , … , 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 ), 𝑙𝑙, 𝑤𝑤),
where 𝑣𝑣 is a subutility function that depends only on the goods consumed (and the functions are
now taken to be differentiable). This weak separability implies that changing the consumption
bundle in a manner that generates the same amount of subutility 𝑣𝑣 from goods does not alter the
attractiveness of labor effort. 7
        A reform will be understood as a change in the exogenous markups. 8 Due to the
presence of a nonlinear income tax that we are assuming may be adjusted, it will be possible to
compare regimes using the Pareto principle, drawing on the method used extensively in Kaplow
(2008) and some other work. Specifically, it is possible to demonstrate:

Proposition 2: Given any economy 𝐸𝐸 with markups 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 and admissible income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇,
for a marginal increase (decrease) in any 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 , it is possible to adjust the income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇 in
a manner that, taken together, generates a strict Pareto improvement if and only if 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 < 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗
(𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 > 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 )—where 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 is the weighted average of the 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 ’s, 𝑖𝑖 ≠ 𝑗𝑗, defined in expression (25).

         Proof: Consider a reform parameterized by 𝛾𝛾: in economy 𝐸𝐸, set 𝛾𝛾 = 1 and restate the
markup on good 𝑗𝑗 as 𝛾𝛾𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 (so we now have 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 = 𝑐𝑐𝑗𝑗 + 𝛾𝛾𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 ). In the reform to be evaluated—a
marginal increase in 𝛾𝛾—we will construct a marginal adjustment to the income tax schedule
𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) (that is, at each 𝑦𝑦), now denoted 𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦, 𝛾𝛾). 𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦, 1) is the income tax schedule in our original
economy 𝐸𝐸, and the specific adjustment to the income tax schedule that we will analyze is given
by

                                             𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑦𝑦, 𝛾𝛾)                           𝑑𝑑Π
                                     (15)                 = −𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 (𝑦𝑦) + 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦) .
                                                 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                               𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

This income tax schedule adjustment is chosen because, under it, an individual who continues to
earn income 𝑦𝑦 is (just) able to continue to purchase the same goods as in the original
(unadjusted) economy 𝐸𝐸. This claim follows immediately if one differentiates the individual’s
budget constraint (1) with respect to 𝛾𝛾 (holding 𝑦𝑦 and the 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 constant), and substitutes for
𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑦𝑦, 𝛾𝛾)/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 using expression (15). To see the underlying intuition, note that the first term on
the right side is the degree to which income taxes must fall to compensate for the fact that

6
  That said, analysis similar to that employed in the proof of Proposition 1 can be used to show that, with general
(nonproportional) markups, two economies will be equivalent if and only if they have the same price ratios (which
occurs when the markups are such that the ratios (1 − 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 )⁄(1 − 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 ), for all 𝑖𝑖, 𝑗𝑗, are the same in the two economies).
7
  The weak separability assumption is familiar in public economics (e.g., Atkinson and Stiglitz (1976)). If relaxed,
then reforms that increase the relative consumption of goods that are leisure substitutes (complements) result in an
increase (decrease) in labor supply, thereby generating an increase (decrease) in income tax revenue. Because such
effects are familiar and are orthogonal to this article’s focus, they are set aside for ease of exposition.
8
  The analysis is best understood as a comparison of two economies in long-run steady state because no account is
taken of transitions and associated implicit capital levies or conferrals of windfall gains.


                                                             10
purchases of 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 are more expensive due to the marginally higher markup (the increase in 𝛾𝛾𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 ).
Offsetting this compensation, the second term taxes away the individual’s share of the increase
in profits due to the change—which, if profits fall, is negative and hence a source of further
compensation.
        Of course, because of the increase in 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 (with all of the other 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 taken to be unaffected),
individuals will consume different bundles of goods. However, by the envelope theorem,
individuals’ subutility, 𝑣𝑣(𝑥𝑥1 , … , 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 ), will not change.
        Moreover, because each level of before-tax income 𝑦𝑦 generated by the corresponding
choice of labor effort 𝑙𝑙 therefore yields the same level of subutility 𝑣𝑣, it follows that individuals’
choices of labor effort will be the same and their overall utility will be the same. To prove this,
begin by defining the indirect subutility function

                           (16) 𝑉𝑉(𝑦𝑦, 𝑇𝑇, Π, 𝑝𝑝1 , … , 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 ) ≡ max 𝑣𝑣(𝑥𝑥1 , … , 𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛 ),
                                                                 𝑥𝑥1 ,…,𝑥𝑥𝑛𝑛


where the maximization of 𝑣𝑣 is subject to the budget constraint (1). Each individual chooses a
level of labor effort 𝑙𝑙 to maximize 𝑢𝑢(𝑉𝑉(𝑦𝑦, 𝑇𝑇, Π, 𝑝𝑝1 , … , 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 ), 𝑙𝑙, 𝑤𝑤). Because we have defined the
income tax schedule adjustment 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑦𝑦, 𝛾𝛾)/𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 such that 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑦𝑦, 𝑇𝑇, Π, 𝑝𝑝1 , … , 𝑝𝑝𝑛𝑛 )⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 0 for all 𝑦𝑦
and, furthermore, an individual of type 𝑤𝑤 determines 𝑦𝑦 solely by a choice of labor effort 𝑙𝑙, it is
possible to write a reduced-form utility function 𝑈𝑈(𝑙𝑙, 𝑤𝑤, 𝛾𝛾) which has the property that, for any
given 𝑙𝑙, 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕(𝑙𝑙, 𝑤𝑤, 𝛾𝛾)⁄𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 = 0. Hence, whatever 𝑙𝑙 maximizes utility for a given type 𝑤𝑤 in the
initial economy 𝐸𝐸 (with 𝛾𝛾 = 1) continues to maximize utility as 𝛾𝛾 is increased. That is, 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 =
0 for all individuals. A further consequence is that, since each individual chooses the same 𝑙𝑙 and
utility is unchanged for any given 𝑙𝑙, all individuals’ utilities are unchanged as well.
         Next, consider the impact of increasing 𝛾𝛾 on the government’s budget. Using expression
(2), we can define the budget surplus (or deficit, if negative) under the economy parameterized
by 𝛾𝛾 as
                                                                                 𝑛𝑛

                         (17) 𝜎𝜎(𝛾𝛾) = � 𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤), 𝛾𝛾)𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − � 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 (𝛾𝛾)𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 ,
                                                                                𝑖𝑖=1

where, regarding the prices, now denoted by 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 (𝛾𝛾), only 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 (𝛾𝛾) in fact changes with 𝛾𝛾. Making
use of expression (15) for 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝑦𝑦, 𝛾𝛾)⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑, the effect of the reform on the budget surplus (which
equals 0 when 𝛾𝛾 = 1) is given by

                              𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)                                       𝑑𝑑Π
                       (18)            = − � 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 �𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)� 𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 +      − 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗𝐺𝐺 .
                                𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                                         𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

(Throughout, these derivatives and others are evaluated at 𝛾𝛾 = 1, with explicit notation to this
effect omitted.) Combining the first and third terms on the right side and recalling the definition
of 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 , we have

                                                 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾) 𝑑𝑑Π
                                         (19)            =      − 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 .
                                                   𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑    𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑



                                                         11
Note that expression (19) carries the interpretation that the change in the government’s budget
surplus is given by the change in total economic surplus: the increase in profits (producer
surplus) minus the reduction in consumer surplus (where, here, the government is regarded as a
consumer with respect to its purchases). This intermediate result, which will be elaborated
below, arises because of the manner in which the income tax adjustment in expression (15) was
constructed, specifically, by compensating individuals for their reduction in consumer surplus
and taxing away their increase in income attributable to profits.
       Differentiating the earlier expression for total profits, Π, we have
                                                       𝑛𝑛
                                         𝑑𝑑Π           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖
                                    (20)      = � 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖        + 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 .
                                         𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                                      𝑖𝑖=1

The first term indicates how profits change as a consequence of individuals’ changes in their
consumption bundles on account of the change in the price ratios. (The 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , being economy wide,
include the government’s purchases, but since they are taken as given they do not contribute to
these derivatives.) The second term is the mechanical effect of raising the markup on 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 .
Combining equations (19) and (20) yields a simple expression for the change in the
government’s surplus:
                                                               𝑛𝑛
                                           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)          𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖
                                      (21)          = � 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖        .
                                             𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑             𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                                              𝑖𝑖=1

Note that the right side indicates the total change in profits (producer surplus) net of the
mechanical effect, which effect in turn equals the reduction in consumer surplus. Because the
adjustment to the income tax schedule, as mentioned, moves all effects on consumer and
producer surplus to the government, the change in the government’s budget surplus
unsurprisingly equals this net change in total economic surplus.
        In examining expression (21), it is helpful to use the fact that 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 = 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 (from the
definition of the Lerner index) and to separately state the 𝑗𝑗th term:

                                      𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)             𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗               𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖
                               (22)            = 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗        + � 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖        .
                                        𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                                                      𝑖𝑖≠𝑗𝑗


Next, define the weights

                                                              𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖
                                                               𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖
                                                               𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                           (23) 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ≡ −             .
                                                              𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗
                                                         𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗
                                                               𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

In interpreting this definition, keep in mind that the 𝑑𝑑𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 (which equal the integral of
individuals’ 𝑑𝑑𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑) are compensated derivatives given how the income tax adjustment is
defined in expression (15). Hence, the denominator is negative (it is the compensated change in
purchases of 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 as its price increases), so a given 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 will be positive (negative) when good 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 is a


                                                        12
Hicksian substitute (complement) for 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 , interpreting these notions as weighted averages over the
population. Furthermore, it is straightforward to demonstrate (using individuals’ budget
constraints) that ∑𝑖𝑖≠𝑗𝑗 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 = 1, so indeed the 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 carry the interpretation of weights.
       Using expression (23), we can restate expression (22) as

                                             𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)        𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗
                                     (24)             = 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗        �𝜆𝜆 − � 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 �.
                                               𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑗𝑗
                                                                             𝑖𝑖≠𝑗𝑗


Furthermore, define

                                                 (25) 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 ≡ � 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ,
                                                                   𝑖𝑖≠𝑗𝑗


which allows us to rewrite expression (24) as

                                                 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)        𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗
                                         (26)             = 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗        �𝜆𝜆 − 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 �.
                                                   𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑗𝑗

To interpret expression (26), recall that 𝑑𝑑𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 ⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is negative. Therefore, the sign of the change in
government surplus is the opposite of the sign of �𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 − 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 �, so there will be a surplus if and only
if 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 < 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 . To complete the argument, we can rebate this surplus by making a further
adjustment to the income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦, 𝛾𝛾) (such that it is lower for all 𝑦𝑦), in an amount that
the government’s budget balances. 9 Before this rebate, all individuals’ utilities were unchanged,
so with the rebate all enjoy higher utility.∎

        Proposition 2 tells us, roughly speaking, that it is desirable to reduce high 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 ’s and
increase low 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 ’s. 10 The intuition is that, because the resulting price vector thereby involves less
distortion, the induced reallocation of consumption increases efficiency. This statement is only
rough because the 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 defined in expression (25) are not in general the same for each good 𝑗𝑗. 11
Hence, there may not exist a 𝜆𝜆∗ such that it is optimal to reduce (increase) any 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 that is greater
9
   Alternatively, recalling that the government’s purchases of private goods are used to create public goods that are
outside the model, one could suppose that the surplus is expended to increase public goods that generate utility to all
individuals.
10
    Proposition 2 therefore loosely supports Lerner’s (1934) statement, followed in some of the trade literature, that
what matters is the dispersion of markups; Lerner specifically suggested the standard deviation. As the text that
follows makes clear, no simple measure of dispersion will in general be a sufficient statistic for the welfare cost of
markups. It can be demonstrated, however, that a proportional reduction in all markups, combined with an
offsetting adjustment to the income tax schedule, is Pareto improving, which does entail a reduction in dispersion.
(It also reduces the mean, but it follows from Proposition 1 that this is not necessarily meaningful. For example,
after proportionally reducing all markups, one could then scale them up in a manner that keeps all price ratios the
same and restores the original mean, and adjust the income tax accordingly, without having any further effect on
social welfare.)
11
    Note further that there are not simple and appealing sufficient conditions, consistent with nonproportional
markups, that would result in the 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 ’s being identical, because the omitted 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 in expression (25) is different for each
𝑗𝑗 and the derivatives underlying the 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 in expression (23) depend on 𝑗𝑗.


                                                              13
(less) than 𝜆𝜆∗ . To illustrate this point, suppose that two goods, 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 and 𝑥𝑥𝑘𝑘 , are close substitutes for
each other but not for any of the other goods, and assume further that both have particularly high
relative markups; then, raising the lower of the two markups—suppose that is 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 —might
improve welfare. (In expression (25) for 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 , most of the weight would be on the relative
markup that was even higher, 𝜆𝜆𝑘𝑘 , so we could have 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 < 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 .)
         The foregoing intuition and interpretation can be expressed in another, closely related
manner. Noting from expression (23) that 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗 = −1 (which refers to the marginal dollar no
longer spent on good 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 that is reallocated to all of the other goods, 𝑖𝑖 ≠ 𝑗𝑗), we can use expression
(26) to restate the requirement for a Pareto improvement as
                                                        𝑛𝑛

                                               (27) � 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 > 0.
                                                       𝑖𝑖=1

Expression (27) indicates that a Pareto improvement is possible when the increase in markup 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗
reallocates consumption expenditures to goods with higher relative markups, on a weighted
average basis (note that ∑𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖=1 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 = 0). Nonproportional markups distort behavior by
discouraging (encouraging) consumption of goods with relatively high (low) markups, so
efficient reforms are those that, on net, counter this tendency. 12
         Much policy analysis, such as in the antitrust realm, focuses on a single firm or sector and
operates on the assumption that a reduction in markups is desirable. Proposition 2 shows that
this is problematic. One might attempt to rationalize the standard approach by viewing the rest
of the economy as approximately competitive and, moreover, supposing that distributive issues
(including impacts on profits) are addressed through the income tax. This workaday view can be
stated more precisely in the world of this model as follows:

Corollary 2.1: In an economy 𝐸𝐸 in which 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 = 0 for all 𝑖𝑖 ≠ 𝑗𝑗 and 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 > 0, there exists an
adjustment to the income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇 that, when combined with a marginal decrease in 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 ,
generates a strict Pareto improvement.

The demonstration is immediate from expression (25), where we can see that 𝜆𝜆̅\𝑗𝑗 = 0. As
mentioned in the introduction, however, this corollary’s predicate is contrary to empirical
evidence. Interestingly, a feature of modern merger guidelines that has not previously been well
rationalized is an apparent requirement that a proxy for total price elevation (that is, inclusive of
the pre-merger elevation) be reasonably high, suggesting that anticompetitive effects may need
to be in highly distorted sectors to support a challenge. 13


12
   Observe that, unlike with Proposition 1, which held for any admissible income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇, Proposition 2
begins not just with the economy 𝐸𝐸 but also with a particular (but it can be any) admissible income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇.
The reason is that aggregate demands, the 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , generally depend on the distribution of income, so the 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 defined in
expression (23) depend on the original choice of 𝑇𝑇. Therefore, it is in general possible that a reform would be Pareto
improving from one starting point but not from another. This possibility is an instance of the familiar notion
(associated with the second fundamental theorem of welfare economics) that what constitutes an efficient outcome
generally depends on the distribution of income.
13
   For example, the U.S. Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2010) provide targets stated not only in terms of how much
a merger raises the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), a proxy related to the predicted price increase, but also by


                                                          14
        Before proceeding, it is also useful to remark briefly on the interpretation of equation
(19). As explained, this expression indicates that there will be a government budget surplus
(enabling the funding of a Pareto-improving reduction in the income tax schedule at all levels of
income) if and only if the effect of the reform is to increase the sum of consumer surplus and
profits (producer surplus). This point is notable with regard to debates about whether
competition policy should aim to maximize total surplus or just consumer surplus, with many
government policy statements and much commentary advocating the latter, as noted in the
introduction. One of the main arguments for this preference invokes distributive concerns,
notably, that the economy’s profits are allocated disproportionately to high-income individuals
relative to the allocation of consumer surplus. In the present construction, the adjustment to the
income tax schedule eliminates all distributive effects, whatever they might be, which follows
from expression (15) for the offsetting adjustment to the income tax schedule.
        More broadly, unlike many analyses that employ representative-agent models, we are in a
setting where distribution matters, profits are present and may have any distributive incidence,
and we are concerned as well with possible compound distortions of labor supply that depend on
the economy’s markups as well as on the income tax schedule. The corresponding (adjusted)
income tax schedule is constructed in such a manner that the reform as a whole is distribution
neutral (regardless of the incidence of the change in markups on consumption expenditures and
on profits) and, as demonstrated, labor supply is unchanged. All that remains is the pure, direct
effect on the efficiency of resource use. 14


3. Investment and Rent Dissipation

        Section 2 implicitly assumes that no resources were expended in creating the market
circumstances in which markups can be charged, generating profits that in turn accrue to
individuals in proportion to their ownership interests. This section extends the model to allow
for such expenditures. Specifically, it is now assumed that 𝜋𝜋𝑖𝑖 = (1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 )𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 , for all 𝑖𝑖. That is,
the portion 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 of the markup associated with good 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 is taken to be the return to an investment of
real resources. (Section 2 analyzed the special case in which 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 = 0 for all 𝑖𝑖.) These
investments can variously be interpreted as expenditures on fixed costs, entry, search, research
and development, or rent seeking. Here, it is sufficient to suppose that the costs reduce net
profits. As a consequence, the economy-wide resource constraint is no longer given by
expression (11) but instead is
                                                         𝑛𝑛

                                          (28) 𝑌𝑌 = �(𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 + 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 )𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 .
                                                       𝑖𝑖=1

       The structure of this section parallels that in section 2. For the proportional case, we will
focus on equivalent economies and use the unrestricted utility function 𝑢𝑢 introduced in section

reference to the level of the HHI, a proxy for the overall degree of price elevation. Nevertheless, other statements in
the Merger Guidelines contradict this requirement, and it is unclear the extent to which actual practice reflects it.
14
   The present model, like many in these fields, has only final goods. With intermediate goods and concomitant
double (multiple) marginalization, the analysis is more complex and the conditions for markup irrelevance are much
more stringent. Nevertheless, in the present setup, distributive effects and labor supply distortion remain separate
and competition policy rules continue to be efficiency tests that reflect total welfare.

2.1. For the general case, we will undertake Pareto assessments of marginal reforms using an
offsetting adjustment to the income tax schedule and use the differentiable utility function
exhibiting weak separability (via the subutility function 𝑣𝑣) employed in section 2.3.

3.1. Proportional Case

         Assume that the economy 𝐸𝐸 has proportional markups, as in section 2.2, and, moreover,
that the fraction of these markups that constitutes real resource costs is the same for all goods,
that is, 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 for all 𝑖𝑖. The main result is:

Proposition 3: If the markups in economy 𝐸𝐸 are proportional (i.e., there exists 𝜆𝜆 such that 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 =
𝜆𝜆 for all 𝑖𝑖) and the fraction of markups that constitutes real resource costs is the same for all
goods (i.e., there exists 𝛼𝛼 such that 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 for all 𝑖𝑖), then the otherwise identical economy 𝐸𝐸� ,
except with no markups (i.e., 𝜆𝜆̂𝑖𝑖 = 0 for all 𝑖𝑖) and with a density function for abilities given by 𝑓𝑓̂,
as defined in expression (43), is an equivalent economy.

This proposition states that the only effect of proportional markups concerns the common
fraction that corresponds to real resource costs, any remainder being irrelevant in the manner
associated with Proposition 1. Moreover, because we are assuming that the same fraction of
markups on all goods is so consumed, we can state that, to this degree, the economy is equivalent
to one with no such markups but in which labor is less productive to that extent. This reduction,
in turn, can be depicted as a downward shift of the original density function for abilities, 𝑓𝑓, as
will emerge in the proof’s construction of 𝑓𝑓̂.

          Proof: The proof will proceed in two steps. In the first, the portion 1 − 𝛼𝛼 of the markups
that constitutes true profits will be eliminated, using a variation of the proof of Proposition 1,
with the resulting intermediate economy, denoted 𝐸𝐸� , being equivalent to economy 𝐸𝐸. Second,
the portion 𝛼𝛼 of the markups that constitutes real resource costs will be eliminated, with the
ultimately resulting economy 𝐸𝐸� being the one referred to in the proposition.
          To begin, define economy 𝐸𝐸� as identical to economy 𝐸𝐸 except for the markups, which are
now given by 𝜇𝜇̌ 𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 ; moreover, in 𝐸𝐸� , 𝛼𝛼� = 1, which is to say that all of the remaining markups
involve the return to real investments. We can further state that 𝑝𝑝̌ 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 + 𝜇𝜇̌ 𝑖𝑖 and 𝜆𝜆̌ = 𝜇𝜇̌ 𝑖𝑖 /𝑝𝑝̌1, for
all 𝑖𝑖. It will also sometimes be useful to make reference to an expression for 𝜆𝜆̌ in terms of 𝜆𝜆
(which can be derived by manipulating the definitions of these Lerner indexes): 15

                                                               𝛼𝛼𝛼𝛼
                                             (29) 𝜆𝜆̌ =                  .
                                                          1 − (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜆𝜆

        Turning to the budget constraint (1), taken to hold in economy 𝐸𝐸, we can multiply both
sides by (1 − 𝜆𝜆)⁄(1 − 𝜆𝜆̌), making use of the definitions of the Lerner indexes and expression
(29), as appropriate, to yield the following analogue to expression (4):



15
  The interpretation of 𝜆𝜆 and 𝜆𝜆̌ as Lerner indexes when some of the former and all of the latter constitute the
recovery of prior investments is often employed, viewing the rents as quasi-rents.


                                                           16

               (30) � 𝑝𝑝̌𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦 − (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆 − (1 − (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜆𝜆)(𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) − 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦)Π).
                          𝑖𝑖=1



Paralleling expression (5), we can define the corresponding income tax schedule for economy 𝐸𝐸�
as

                   (31) 𝑇𝑇�(𝑦𝑦) ≡ (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆 + (1 − (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜆𝜆)(𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) − 𝜃𝜃(𝑦𝑦)Π).

Therefore,
                                                  𝑛𝑛

                                          (32) � 𝑝𝑝̌𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 𝑦𝑦 − 𝑇𝑇�(𝑦𝑦).
                                                 𝑖𝑖=1


Note that, from the above definition of profits and the definition of economy 𝐸𝐸� , it is also true that
� = 0 in 𝐸𝐸� , so expression (32) indicates that individuals’ have the same budget sets and, as
Π
explained previously, will make the same choices and achieve the same utility.
        Next, we need to show that the government’s budget constraint holds. Here, we will
multiply both sides of expression (2) by (1 − 𝜆𝜆)⁄(1 − 𝜆𝜆̌) and make use of the Lerner index
definitions and expression (29) to yield
                                  𝑛𝑛

                          (33) � 𝑝𝑝̌ 𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 = (1 − (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜆𝜆) � 𝑇𝑇�𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)�𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.
                                 𝑖𝑖=1


We can use definition (31) for 𝑇𝑇�(𝑦𝑦) to solve for 𝑇𝑇(𝑦𝑦) and then integrate accordingly to yield
                     𝑛𝑛

             (34) � 𝑝𝑝̌ 𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 = � 𝑇𝑇��𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)�𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜆𝜆𝜆𝜆 + (1 − (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜆𝜆)Π.
                    𝑖𝑖=1

Using expression (28) for 𝑌𝑌 (the resource constraint for economy 𝐸𝐸 in this version of the model)
and the pertinent definition of Π, and making appropriate substitutions using manipulations of
the Lerner index definitions and expression (29), it is possible to show that the last two terms are
equal. Accordingly, we have budget balance in economy 𝐸𝐸� :
                                           𝑛𝑛

                                   (35) � 𝑝𝑝̌ 𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 = � 𝑇𝑇��𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤)�𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.
                                          𝑖𝑖=1


This completes the proof that economy 𝐸𝐸 is equivalent to the otherwise identical economy 𝐸𝐸� ,
except that 𝜇𝜇̌ 𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 and 𝛼𝛼� = 1.
       In step 2, we now show that this economy 𝐸𝐸� is, in turn, equivalent to the economy 𝐸𝐸�
described in the proposition. An individual’s budget constraint in economy 𝐸𝐸� is given above, in


                                                         17
expression (32). Using the fact (from the definition of the Lerner index) that 𝑝𝑝̌ 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 ⁄�1 − 𝜆𝜆̌�,
multiplying both sides by 1 − 𝜆𝜆̌, and recalling that 𝑦𝑦 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 yields:
                                         𝑛𝑛

                             (36) � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = �1 − 𝜆𝜆̌�𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 − �1 − 𝜆𝜆̌�𝑇𝑇�(𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤).
                                     𝑖𝑖=1


             � ≡ �1 − 𝜆𝜆̌�𝑤𝑤, so we can restate equation (36) as
Next, define 𝑤𝑤
                                              𝑛𝑛
                                                                           𝑤𝑤
                                                                           �𝑙𝑙
                                                   �𝑙𝑙 − �1 − 𝜆𝜆̌�𝑇𝑇� �
                                (37) � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 𝑤𝑤                               �.
                                          𝑖𝑖=1
                                                                          1 − 𝜆𝜆̌

Now, starting with the income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇� for economy 𝐸𝐸� , we can define the corresponding
income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇� for economy 𝐸𝐸� as

                                                                   𝑤𝑤
                                                                    �𝑙𝑙
                                             �𝑙𝑙) ≡ �1 − 𝜆𝜆̌�𝑇𝑇� �
                                    (38) 𝑇𝑇�(𝑤𝑤                           �.
                                                                  1 − 𝜆𝜆̌

Inserting definition (38) into equation (37) yields
                                                    𝑛𝑛

                                                            �𝑙𝑙 − 𝑇𝑇�(𝑤𝑤
                                         (39) � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 = 𝑤𝑤        �𝑙𝑙),
                                                   𝑖𝑖=1


confirming that individuals’ budget constraints continue to hold in economy 𝐸𝐸� . Specifically,
individuals choosing any 𝑙𝑙 can just afford the same consumption bundles, the 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 . A further
implication, discussed in connection with Proposition 1, is that individuals will indeed make the
same choices and thereby achieve the same utility.
       The government’s budget constraint in economy 𝐸𝐸� is given by expression (35). Here too
we can use the fact that 𝑝𝑝̌ 𝑖𝑖 = 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 ⁄�1 − 𝜆𝜆̌�, multiply both sides by 1 − 𝜆𝜆̌, and recall that 𝑦𝑦 = 𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤 to
yield
                                    𝑛𝑛

                            (40) � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 = �1 − 𝜆𝜆̌� � 𝑇𝑇��𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤(𝑤𝑤)�𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑.
                                   𝑖𝑖=1


Now, define 𝑓𝑓̂(𝑤𝑤         � ⁄�1 − 𝜆𝜆̌��. That is, we take a grossed-up magnitude for the original
                   �) ≡ 𝑓𝑓�𝑤𝑤
ability distribution in order to determine the density for a particular ability level in the new
distribution. Running in the opposite direction may be more intuitive: for any ability level in the
original distribution for equivalent economies 𝐸𝐸 and 𝐸𝐸� , we consider a scaled down ability level
(wage) in the distribution for economy 𝐸𝐸� (recalling that 𝑤𝑤 � = �1 − 𝜆𝜆̌�𝑤𝑤), reflecting that a fraction
of everything that labor produces is paying for the investment costs associated with the markups
in 𝐸𝐸� (or 𝛼𝛼 of the markup in 𝐸𝐸) and thus is not available to pay the costs 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 associated with the 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖 .

       We can use this definition of 𝑓𝑓̂(𝑤𝑤
                                         �), the definition of 𝑤𝑤
                                                               �, and expression (38) to restate the
integrand on the right side of equation (40):

                                                𝑤𝑤
                                                 �𝑙𝑙(𝑤𝑤
                                                     �)           𝑤𝑤
                                                                  �        𝑇𝑇��𝑤𝑤
                                                                                �𝑙𝑙(𝑤𝑤
                                                                                    �)�
                (41) 𝑇𝑇��𝑤𝑤𝑤𝑤(𝑤𝑤)�𝑓𝑓(𝑤𝑤) = 𝑇𝑇� �         � 𝑓𝑓 �         �=              𝑓𝑓̂(𝑤𝑤
                                                                                            �),
                                                 1 − 𝜆𝜆̌        1 − 𝜆𝜆̌        1 − 𝜆𝜆̌

where the first equality makes use of the fact that 𝑙𝑙(𝑤𝑤) = 𝑙𝑙(𝑤𝑤
                                                                �), as discussed after expression
(39). Substituting into equation (40), and returning to the definition of labor income 𝑦𝑦, gives us
                                         𝑛𝑛

                                                              �)�𝑓𝑓̂(𝑤𝑤
                                (42) � 𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑖 𝑥𝑥𝑖𝑖𝐺𝐺 = � 𝑇𝑇��𝑦𝑦(𝑤𝑤     �)𝑑𝑑𝑤𝑤
                                                                         �.
                                        𝑖𝑖=1


Therefore, the government’s budget constraint holds in economy 𝐸𝐸� , which completes the proof
of equivalence.
        Finally, it is useful to restate the definition 𝑓𝑓̂(𝑤𝑤      � ⁄�1 − 𝜆𝜆̌�� more in the notation
                                                            �) ≡ 𝑓𝑓�𝑤𝑤
of the original economy 𝐸𝐸. Substituting from expression (29) for 𝜆𝜆̌ yields

                                                    1 − (1 − 𝛼𝛼)𝜆𝜆
                                  (43) 𝑓𝑓̂(𝑤𝑤
                                           �) = 𝑓𝑓 �               𝑤𝑤
                                                                   ��,
                                                       1 − 𝜆𝜆

which indicates that, in scaling the ability level (wage) between our original economy 𝐸𝐸 and our
final, equivalent economy 𝐸𝐸� , we wish to account for only the portion of the markup that recovers
for real resource use, retaining in a sense that which produces actual net profits that ultimately
are enjoyed by individuals in their role as owners.∎

       By analogy to Proposition 1, this equivalence result has immediate implications for
optimal income taxation.

Corollary 3.1. 𝑇𝑇 ∗ is the optimal income tax schedule for economy 𝐸𝐸 with proportional markups
and a constant (across goods) fraction of markups that constitutes real resource costs if and only
if the corresponding income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇� ∗ is the optimal income tax schedule for the otherwise
identical economy 𝐸𝐸� , except with no markups and with a density function for types given by 𝑓𝑓̂, as
defined in expression (43).

Proposition 3 and Corollary 3.1 tell us that, as in section 2, the fraction of markups that
corresponds to profits that are ultimately received by individuals does not matter in a substantive
sense, whereas we now can add that the fraction that corresponds to real resource costs is
equivalent to a downward shift in the economy’s production possibility frontier, here indicated
by a simple downward shift in the distribution of abilities (wages). The actual optimal income
tax schedule is influenced by both of these features. (For an explicit statement of the
corresponding income tax schedules for economies 𝐸𝐸 and 𝐸𝐸� , combine expressions (31) and (38).)
Note that the optimal income tax problem for economy 𝐸𝐸� is precisely the standard one (with no
markups); hence, determining the optimal income tax for economy 𝐸𝐸 is a mechanical exercise.




                                                      19
         Interestingly and importantly, with regard to neither of these two portions of markups is
there what might be viewed as a second wedge that reduces the optimal degree of income
redistribution. The former portion was discussed previously, and the latter, because it involves a
real resource cost—essentially indicating that the economy has a less advantageous production
possibility frontier—does not constitute a “wedge” as that term is ordinarily used. Note that this
is true regardless of whether the actual investments involve research or building facilities on one
hand or pure rent seeking on the other hand. Potential policy implications may differ but, taking
the state of the economy 𝐸𝐸 as given, the nature of those investments does not affect equivalence.
         These results hold for any value of 𝛼𝛼. Section 2 assumed that 𝛼𝛼 = 0, so all of the
markups involved profits that individuals received without any involving the recovery of prior
investments. Another special case of interest is 𝛼𝛼 = 1, which holds in a wide range of models
used in many literatures noted in the introduction, such as when there is free entry with fixed
costs, investment in information about opportunities, or rent seeking that dissipates all rents.
Then all markups might be referred to as quasi-rents. In this case, the first segment of the proof
of Proposition 3 is moot (it applies to 1 − 𝛼𝛼 of the markups, which is to say, none of them; note
from expression (29) that, in this case, 𝜆𝜆̌ = 𝜆𝜆). Obviously, the results cover intermediate cases,
with 𝛼𝛼 ∈ (0,1). Finally, note that nothing in the proof restricted 𝛼𝛼 to be in the interval [0,1]:
perhaps some investments generate positive spillovers, in which case the production possibility
frontier is expanded rather than contracted, or negative externalities beyond the industry itself,
further contracting the frontier.

3.2. General Case

        This section extends the results from section 2.3 regarding which marginal reforms
generate Pareto improvements, now taking into account that, in addition to nonproportional
markups, there may also be nonproportional fractions of each markup that involve real resource
costs rather than profits. Because of this difference, it is useful to state profits explicitly for this
economy:
                                                  𝑛𝑛

                                     (44) Π = �(1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 )𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 .
                                                 𝑖𝑖=1

        Focus again on reforms that pertain to a single good, 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 , which are here taken to affect its
markup 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 and also the resource use portion 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 —with the latter permitted to change in either
direction and to any degree for a specified increase in the former. We can state:

Proposition 4: Given any economy 𝐸𝐸 with markups 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 , resource use portions 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 , and admissible
income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇, for a marginal increase in any 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 and any accompanying marginal
change in the associated 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 , it is possible to adjust the income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇 in a manner that,
taken together, generates a strict Pareto improvement if and only if inequality (49) holds.

        Proof: We will parameterize the reform by 𝛾𝛾 as was done in the proof of Proposition 2,
with the addition that we will now take the resource use portion for good 𝑗𝑗 to be 𝜌𝜌(𝛾𝛾)𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 , where
𝜌𝜌(1) = 1. The steps of the proof and pertinent equations are the same until we reach expression
(20) for 𝑑𝑑Π⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 , reflecting that in this section’s model profits are now given by expression (44),


                                                   20
taking into account as well that, for this parameterized reform, the 𝑗𝑗th element of that summation
is now �1 − 𝜌𝜌(𝛾𝛾)𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 �𝛾𝛾𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 . The resulting analogue to expression (20), evaluated at 𝛾𝛾 = 1, is

                   𝑑𝑑Π                    𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗                    𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖               𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)
           (45)         = �1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 �𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗        + �(1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 )𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖        + �1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 −          𝛼𝛼 � 𝜇𝜇 𝑋𝑋 .
                   𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                    𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                      𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                  𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 𝑗𝑗 𝑗𝑗 𝑗𝑗
                                                      𝑖𝑖≠𝑗𝑗


Substituting this derivative into expression (19) for the effect of the reform on the government’s
budget surplus and cancelling terms yields

                    𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)                   𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗                    𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖             𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)
            (46)             = �1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 �𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗        + �(1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 )𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖        − 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 �1 +          � 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 .
                      𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                      𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                      𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                                               𝑖𝑖≠𝑗𝑗


Using the fact that 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 = 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 , we have

                𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)                        𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗                         𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖             𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)
        (47)             = �1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 �𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗        + �(1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 )𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖        − 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 �1 +         � 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 .
                  𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                                              𝑖𝑖≠𝑗𝑗


For this economy, it is useful to define modified Lerner indexes, 𝜆𝜆𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 ≡ (1 − 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 )𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 , which
indicate the portion of the markup that involves true profits rather than resource use, and use
these to define

                                                   (48) 𝜆𝜆̅𝛼𝛼\𝑗𝑗 ≡ � 𝜆𝜆𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 ,
                                                                            𝑖𝑖≠𝑗𝑗


where the 𝛽𝛽𝑖𝑖 are defined in expression (23). We can now restate expression (47) as indicating
the presence of a government budget surplus if and only if

                                          𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗 𝛼𝛼                            𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)
                             (49) 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗          �𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 − 𝜆𝜆̅𝛼𝛼\𝑗𝑗 � > 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 �1 +         � 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 .
                                           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                                  𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

As with Proposition 2, if this inequality holds, it is possible to further adjust the income tax
schedule to rebate the budget surplus so as to generate a strict Pareto improvement.∎

          The left side of expression (49) is analogous to the right side of expression (26) in
Proposition 2, indicating the effect of the reform on allocative efficiency. The difference is that
the 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 are now replaced by the 𝜆𝜆𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 , indicating that only the portions of the markups that involve
pure profits rather than resource use are pertinent. Hence, we now have two corrections relative
to conventional analysis: for the presence of markups on other goods and for the fact that a
portion of a markup may reimburse resource use rather than constitute true profits.
          The right side is new. It captures the change in productive efficiency due to the reform.
This, in turn, has two components. The “1” in the parentheses is a mechanical effect reflecting
that, as this model is stated, the portion 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 of the increase in 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 is taken to involve real resource
use. The 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 component indicates how 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 changes with the reform.


                                                                       21
         Interpreting the right side as a whole for particular values of 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 is helpful. First,
suppose that 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = −1. Then the right side of expression (49) equals zero. Here, all of
the increase in 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 constitutes pure profit. The portion 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 falls just enough that the total resource
use per unit of 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 remains the same. (In this special case, this aspect of the result is the same as
under Proposition 2.) When 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 > −1, therefore, there is at least some increase in
resource use. (When 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 0, of course, the portion of resource use is constant, leaving
the full mechanical effect.) When 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 < −1, there is a reduction in the resource use
involved in producing 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 , that is, an increase in productive efficiency.
         Taken as a whole, expression (49) indicates that the effect on the government’s budget
surplus is given by the change in allocative efficiency (defined appropriately for this economy)
and the change in productive efficiency (resource use) with respect to the good (sector) subject to
the reform. Because expression (19) from Proposition 2’s proof applies here as well, the test can
also be stated as the effect of the reform on the sum of consumer and producer surplus. This
tests governs even though the price change affects the distribution of consumer surplus; the price
change and the change in production costs affect profits that may be distributed as any function
of income; and we are also concerned with labor supply distortion in the presence of both
markups and income taxation, each of which affects the labor wedge. As a consequence of the
corresponding adjustment to the income tax schedule, the net impact of all of these other effects
(on individuals’ behavior, including their choices of labor effort, and on achieved utility) is fully
offset, leaving only the efficiency effects captured in expression (49).
         To round out the discussion, consider again the case with a markup on only a single good.

Corollary 4.1: In an economy 𝐸𝐸 in which 𝜇𝜇𝑖𝑖 = 0 for all 𝑖𝑖 ≠ 𝑗𝑗 and 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 > 0, for a marginal
increase in 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 and any accompanying marginal change in the associated 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 , it is possible to
adjust the income tax schedule 𝑇𝑇 in a manner that, taken together, generates a strict Pareto
improvement if and only if inequality (50) holds.

In this economy, expression (49) simplifies to

                                           𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗 𝛼𝛼              𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑(𝛾𝛾)
                               (50) 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗         𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 > 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 �1 +          � 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗 𝑝𝑝𝑗𝑗 𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 ,
                                            𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                    𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

which compares the changes in allocative efficiency and productive efficiency. In interpreting
expressions (49) and (50), keep in mind that the experiment parameterized by 𝛾𝛾 involves an
increase in 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 , 𝑑𝑑𝑋𝑋𝑗𝑗 ⁄𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 on the left side is negative (so the left side of (50) is positive when 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 is
reduced), and the right side measures the increase in resources used in producing 𝑥𝑥𝑗𝑗 .
        Consider cases that involve tradeoffs. Suppose, for example, that allocative efficiency
increases, which here (still) occurs when 𝜇𝜇𝑗𝑗 falls (although the magnitude of this gain is smaller
than in section 2 by the proportion 𝛼𝛼𝑗𝑗 , as reflected in 𝜆𝜆𝑗𝑗𝛼𝛼 ), and that productive efficiency
decreases. This might arise, for example, from the application of antitrust rules that prohibit
some joint ventures or exclusionary practices that raise prices but also generate some
efficiencies. In the reverse case, allocative efficiency falls but productive efficiency increases.
This might occur when a rule permits mergers that raise price because of reduced competition
and also generate efficiencies, the latter not being sufficiently passed through to consumers to
eliminate the price increase. Expression (50) states that in both cases a total surplus test


                                                           22
indicates when the rule, if implemented along with an offsetting adjustment to the income tax
schedule, generates a Pareto improvement.
        Finally, returning to economies with multiple markups, covered by Proposition 4 and the
policy rule of expression (49), consider the special case in which 𝛼𝛼𝑖𝑖 = 1 for all 𝑖𝑖 (and 𝜌𝜌 = 1,
which is to say, constant). The left side of (49) now equals zero, regardless of how relatively
high or low is the markup that is changing, and the right side indicates that reducing any markup
is associated with a rise in productive efficiency. When all profits are dissipated, there is no
producer surplus, so total surplus equals consumer surplus and policies that directly influence
only a single sector can aim simply at reducing that sector’s markup.


4. Conclusion

         This article examines a model that features market power in multiple sectors, different
degrees to which the resulting profits may reflect the recovery of real resource costs involved in
investment (including in rent-seeking), different abilities and hence a concern for distribution,
endogenous labor supply, ownership that may be any function of income, and income taxation.
Although the model is simplified in a number of respects, it sheds substantial new light on
analysis and policies concerned with market power and also with income taxation and the
familiar tradeoff of redistribution and labor supply distortion.
         Proportional markups that generate undissipated profits have no effect on an economy in
the sense that eliminating them does not alter what budget sets are feasible, the level of utility
that can be achieved, or the optimal income tax problem. If the profits are dissipated in whole or
in part (also in a proportional manner), the economy is equivalent to one with no markups (or
profit dissipation) and a downward-shifted distribution of individuals’ abilities. Standard
optimal income tax analysis for an economy with perfect competition in every sector can,
therefore, be directly translated to these settings with proportional markups.
         For markups or profit dissipations that are not proportional, marginal reforms that affect a
single good (industry) are analyzed using the technique of an offsetting (in aggregate,
distribution-neutral) adjustment to the income tax schedule that enables Pareto assessments.
Reducing a markup, ceteris paribus, raises (reduces) welfare when the markup is above (below) a
specified weighted average of the undissipated portion of other markups in the economy. When
such a reform—whether of antitrust policy, intellectual property protection, trade policy, or other
regulation—also influences productive efficiency, as is often the case, a total surplus test
indicates which policies are Pareto superior. 16 This efficiency test, which sums allocative and
productive efficiency—equivalently, consumer and producer surplus—applies regardless of the
distributive consequences of the changes in markups and profits and of any impact on labor
supply, which is subject to preexisting distortions due to both markups and income taxation. The
reason is that the contemplated policy experiment’s adjustment to the income tax schedule
neutralizes all distributive effects and precisely offsets all effects on labor supply (assuming


16
   The problem of optimal public sector pricing, which has its own literature surveyed in Bös (1985), is similarly
covered by the present analysis; hence, those results change substantially with heterogeneous individuals and an
income tax. Note also that, in considering international trade policy, one would need to modify the implicit closed-
economy setting employed here if national rather than global welfare is taken to be the social objective; for example,
one might consider only the consumer and producer surplus that accrues to citizens or residents.

weak separability of labor in the utility function), leaving only the traditional efficiency
consequences of the reform.
         Future work could extend this analysis in a number of ways. Most important is to
consider particular models of ex ante investment in the present setting—that is, with
heterogeneous abilities and an income tax—wherein resulting markups, ownership shares, and
the degree to which profits constitute recoveries for prior expenditures are all endogenous. The
results derived here may well hold because they pertain fairly generally to economies and to
policies that are associated with various results of such ex ante behavior. The markups,
ownership portions, and dissipation functions (along with familiar fundamentals) are sufficient
statistics for the present characterizations of the optimal policy. Nevertheless, a direct analysis is
necessary for policy evaluation because these statistics must be derived. Moreover,
endogenizing key features in certain ways may violate some of this model’s assumptions, in
which event the results would need to be modified accordingly.
         It also seems fruitful to devote more refined attention to labor supply and to investment.
Some recent work considers different dimensions of earning ability with a focus on
entrepreneurship, which seems particularly relevant when addressing ex ante activity that
generates future markups. 17 Investments typically involve the supply of capital, which was not
modeled here but has been examined in other work in different settings. 18 On both dimensions
dynamic modeling is appropriate with particular attention to the role of uncertainty because we
wish to understand the most successful firms that are able to charge significant markups as well
as the individuals, often founders, who end up owning large stakes in these firms as a
consequence of their prior labor efforts and financial investments. 19
         In contemplating these and other extensions, it is important to keep in mind that the
present analysis shows how misleading it can be to examine industries in isolation, to employ
representative-agent models in which distributive concerns do not arise, to fail to consider that
profits due to markups are often attributable to prior investments, to take labor supply as
exogenous, and to ignore the important role of income taxation. Multiple factors that contribute
to redistribution and to labor supply distortion can act in synergy, thereby magnifying each other,
or, as was often true here, can be largely offsetting. Models that exclude closely related
considerations can produce results that are not only incomplete but misleading. Many of the core
lessons developed here require substantial amendments to current thinking and to results
obtained in models that examine only some of the pertinent phenomena in isolation.

   See, for example Rothschild and Scheuer (2013) for a theoretical exploration and Smith et al. (2019) for empirical
evidence that most of the recent increase in top incomes in the United States involves labor earnings of small
business owners. See also Rothschild and Scheuer (2016) and Lockwood, Nathanson, and Weyl (2017), who
examine externalities due to labor effort.

   See Judd (1997, 2002), and for further refinements of the analysis of that type of dynamic model, see Straub and
Werning (2018) and Chari, Nicolini, and Teles (2018). Such analysis also introduces a tax (which may be negative,
a subsidy) on capital income, from which point one could perform an extended version of the policy experiment
employed here that adjusts this tax so as to hold the capital wedge fixed, thereby separating the analysis of
distortions of capital.
19
   Optimal income taxation of uncertain labor income is surveyed by Golosov, Tsyvinski, and Werning (2007).
Work on income taxation of uncertain capital income includes Gordon (1985) and Kaplow (1994), but they focus on
market risk whereas founders often make undiversified investments due to information asymmetries.
