Individual Time Preferences and Energy Efficiency

                                              ABSTRACT

We examine the role of individual discount rates in energy efficiency decisions using evidence from
an extensive survey of U.S. homeowners to elicit preferences for energy efficiency and cash flows
over time. We find considerable heterogeneity in individual discount rates. We also find that individual
time preferences systematically influence willingness to invest in energy efficiency, as measured through
product choices, required payback periods, and energy efficiency tax credit claims. Individual discount
rate heterogeneity is in turn significantly related to characteristics of the individual and their household,
including their financial situation. Individuals with less education, larger households, low income,
and low credit scores had systematically higher discount rates, as did black, non-Hispanic respondents.
Our findings highlight the importance of individual discount rates to understanding energy efficiency
investments, the energy-efficiency gap, and policy evaluation.

Note: See Table A1 for the variable descriptions. The number of observations in the estimation sample equals 879. Note that the econometric
analysis in Table A2 differs from Newell and Siikamäki (2014) to match the goals of this paper. First, we estimate WTP for reduced annual energy
operating cost, whereas Newell and Siikamäki (2014) estimates WTP for present value operating cost. Second, we estimate heterogeneity
associated with the characteristics of the respondent, household, and their home directly as a determinant of WTP for annual operating cost
savings, whereas Newell and Siikamäki (2014) considers those variables as determinants of heterogeneous marginal utility of income (interact
them with purchase price). Third, here we exclude treatments 3, 8, and 11 in Newell and Siikamäki (2014) as not directly relevant for the
estimation of WTP for annual operating cost savings. Constant in this model denotes the coefficient on “any economic information” as a label
attribute in Newell and Siikamäki (2014), as all treatments in the analysis include at least some economic information.

efficiency. This section was placed after the choice experiments in the survey instrument. We use the midpoint of
the categorical responses to create a continuous variable for estimation.

                                                   Paying for Energy Savings

Energy efficient water heaters use less energy to operate. They typically are relatively more costly at the time of purchase, but
help reduce household’s long-run energy bill. Whether choosing an energy-efficient water heater makes sense depends on the
household, how costly the water heater is, and how large energy savings it can provide over time. People also have different
views regarding how quickly their spending on energy-efficiency improvements should pay back in reduced energy bill. Many
factors, such as life situation, income, and personal preference and judgment, influence such views, and rightfully so.


11. Consider purchasing a water heater. In your situation and view, how quickly should a more energy-efficient alternative
    recover its additional purchase expense in energy savings? (Check the longest amount of time it can take to recover the
    additional purchase price for you to still be happy with purchasing an energy efficient model.)

              In less than a year                      3-4 years                         7 years or more
              1 – 1.5 years                            4-5 years                         Don’t know

              1.5 – 2 years                            5-6 years

              2 – 3 years                              6-7 years


12. For every $10 reduction in the annual energy cost of a water heater, how much greater purchase price would you be willing
    to pay for the model (at the most)?

              $1 – 10                                  $25-29                            $45 – 49                          $65-69
              $10-14                                   $30-34                            $50-54                            $70-74

              $15-19                                   $35-39                            $55-59                            $75-99

              $20-24                                   $40-44                            $60-64                            $80 or more


               I would not pay more for lower energy cost, but simply choose a less costly appliance
