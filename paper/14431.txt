                                              ABSTRACT

This paper discusses both the potential contribution that trade policy initiatives can make towards
the achievement of significant global carbon emissions reduction and the potential impacts of proposals
now circulating for carbon reduction motivated geographical trade arrangements, including carbon
free trade areas. We first suggest that trade policy is likely to be a relatively minor consideration in
climate change containment. The dominant influence on carbon emissions globally for next several
decades will be growth more so than trade and its composition, and in turn, the size of trade seemingly
matters more than its composition given differences in emission intensity between tradables and nontradables.
We also note that differences in emissions intensity across countries are larger than across products
or sectors and so issues of country discrimination in trade policy (and violations of MFN) arises.

We next discuss both unilateral and regional carbon motivated trade policy arrangements, including
three potential variants of carbon emission reduction based free trade area arrangements. One is regional
trade agreements with varying types of trade preferences towards low carbon intensive products, low
carbon new technologies and inputs to low carbon processes. A second is the use of joint border measures
against third parties to counteract anti-competitive effects from groups of countries taking on deeper
emission reduction commitments. A third is third country trade barriers along with free trade or other
regional trade agreements as penalty mechanisms to pressure other countries to join emission reducing
environmental agreements. We differentiate among the objectives, forms and possible impacts of each
variant. We also speculate as to how the world trading system may evolve in the next few decades
as trade policy potentially becomes increasingly dominated by environmental concerns. We suggest
that the future evolution of the trading system will likely be with environmentally motivated arrangements
acting as an overlay on prevailing trade and financial arrangements in the WTO and IMF, and eventually
movement to linked global trade and environmental policy bargaining.

1. Introduction
    This paper discusses both the potential contribution that trade policy can make
towards significant global carbon emissions reduction and the potential impacts of
proposals for both unilateral and regional carbon emission reduction motivated trade
policy arrangements now circulating, including carbon free trade areas proposals.
    The background to our discussion is the present global negotiating situation regarding
global carbon emissions reduction initiatives, both in the Bali /post Kyoto UNFCCC
negotiating process (out to Copenhagen 2009 and beyond), and also in debate on
possible unilateral measures by various entities around the world (and especially in the
EU). In Europe the view is that individual countries (or a group of countries )going faster
and father than other countries in terms of emissions reduction commitments inevitably
face issues of linkage to the trade regime if offsets are to be provided to anti-competitive
effects on domestic producers within countries flowing from environmental commitments.
     The combination of the Post Bali road map discussion following the recent
UNFCCC Bali Meeting (Dec 2007) and the EU commitments in their 2020 programme
(20% emissions reductions by 2020, and 20% use of renewables by the same date) has
lead to increased discussion as to how trade and environment regimes may need to be
more closely linked in a post Kyoto world. The future, as seen in Europe, is for Europe to
lead the world with deeper emissions reduction commitments than elsewhere. But while
others lag new trade measures may be needed. Such measures may well eventually
involve fellow travelers in new carbon driven regional trade arrangements.
    We first highlight the seemingly much larger role to be played by economic growth
rather than trade in fuelling growing carbon emissions and whose containment is more
likely to significantly reduce emissions than trade policy interventions. We also suggest
that since much of global merchandise trade is in emissions intensive manufactures, the
more critical issue may be the level of trade relative to non-traded services than the
product and country composition of trade, which trade policy proposals largely address.

                                                 -2-
Having said this, however, we also note the large differences in emissions intensities
across countries and hence the potential role for (non-MFN) country discrimination in
trade policy.
   We suggest that discussion of unilateral carbon motivated border measures and
carbon motivated regional trade arrangements is likely to grow in significance as global
negotiations on climate change intensify. This will occur especially as the impacts of
such initiatives on the size and pattern of trade become more apparent, and trade
measures to support climate change initiatives are explored. Unilateral carbon motivated
border measures could involve either or both of tariffs on high carbon imports and
subsidies on low carbon exports.
    At a trade policy level, we also discuss emerging ideas and proposals for carbon
emission reduction motivated free trade areas, and accompanying border measures when
carbon reduction initiatives are implemented. We differentiate both objective and form in
such proposals, emphasizing how such measures can in some cases serve to increase
rather than reduce carbon emissions.
    In their simplest form, carbon free trade areas would involve free trade in low carbon
containing products among countries jointly committing to significant emissions
reductions or renewable commitments, and also with external trade barriers against third
countries that do not follow. Discussion of both their form and impact is related to the
long studied customs union issue originally analyzed by Viner(1950), but now the
impacts of carbon pricing/reduction policies on emissions is the focus.
   We discuss three different forms of possible trade arrangements. One is regional trade
agreements with varying types of trade preferences towards low carbon intensive
products, low carbon new technologies and inputs to low carbon processes to stimulate
trade (and hence consumption) in low carbon intensive products, and in this way are
designed to contribute directly to emissions reduction through changed trade patterns. A
weakness of this approach is that seemingly there is more differentiation in emissions
intensity by country than by product. Also, this discussion does not focus on the external
trade arrangements of the group of countries entering into such an agreement.
   A second type focuses on the anti-competitive effects on domestic producers when
significant joint emissions reduction commitments are made which others do not follow.
Such commitments raise costs for domestic producers and whether there should be offsets
for these relative cost effects compared to third country producers operating outside of

                                            -3-
such arrangements is an issue, as well as the form they should take. This perceived need
for border tax adjustment has already arisen in Europe (see Lockwood &Whalley (2008)).
     Hence, if various entities within the OECD, such as, the US and the EU were to
jointly agree on carbon emission reduction initiatives, some forms of joint border
measures against third parties might be used to counteract the anti-competitive effects on
domestic producers from the joint environmental commitment. These could take the form
of common or country differentiated external barriers against third parties.
   A third type of arrangement could be where countries enter into free trade or other
regional trade agreements and use joint and discriminatory carbon motivated trade
barriers against third parties as a way of pressuring countries to join their joint
environmental agreement. This form of trade arrangement is similar to that contained in
the Montreal Protocol of 1987.
   We discuss what may be involved in each of these, and also in the wider use of trade
policies to achieve global carbon limitation objectives. We note in passing that similar
ideas to those now surrounding carbon motivated trade policies could be discussed for a
wide range of policy related areas and their interaction with trade, quite besides climate
change. Joint or unilateral trade policies could be argued for countries with, say, a high
level of provision of social programs, high labor standards, high minimum wages and
other policy features. We thus suggest, including in the carbon emissions case, that the
motivation for these types of trade arrangements and their forms and impacts should be
discussed as separate issues.
   We also discuss the potential systemic impacts of such arrangements and how the
world trading system may evolve in the next few decades in light of the likely growing
interface between trade and environmental policies. International agreements are critical
for countries whose policy objectives are to avoid destructive policy retaliation and gain
common benefits from cooperation. We suggest that the Bretton Woods 1944 Conference
yielded a global trade and monetary order whose main aim was to rebuild the
international economy after World War II, but the resulting system only focused on trade
and finance, not physical interactions between countries. Today, given concerns over
global warming, the future evolution of the trading system may well be that
environmentally motivated arrangements act as an overlay prevailing trade and financial
arrangements in the WTO and the IMF. The world of global policy coordination may thus


                                              -4-
move beyond WTO trade negotiations to linked trade and environmental policy
bargaining.


    2. Carbon and Trade
   The central issue this paper discusses is the use of trade policy either unilaterally or
through international coordination as an instrument for achieving significant reductions in
carbon emissions. We also discuss the potential use of carbon-linked trade policies by
countries. A number of broad ranging issues have to be addressed first before specific
carbon motivated trade policy interventions can be discussed.
     First is the general issue of linkage between trade on one hand and carbon emissions
on the other. Negotiated carbon emissions reductions seek to address the lack of
internalization of global externalities assorted with emissions and climate change.
Whether or not and how trade policies can be productively used as for the supportive
internalization mechanisms and whether they are effective or other instruments are more
appropriate to use in achieving internalization objectives is the follow on issue.
     At first sight, the uses of trade policy for these purposes would only seem indirect,
and even clumsy, since it is economic growth more so than trade and its composition that
seemingly fuels growing emissions. Recognition of the political pressures to use trade
policy to compensate loses and effectively operates as a system of supporting side
payments to new arrangements as part of carbon policy regimes seems more
comprehensible. Whether trade policies can be effectively used as penalty or enforcement
mechanisms to achieve and underpin environment cooperation is a further issue. This
bears on the border tax adjustment and external trade barrier issues for regional
agreements which we touch on later in the paper.
     On casual inspection, trade policy as a mechanism to reduce carbon emissions would
seem to be an ineffective tool and only offer quantitatively small and indirect effects.
This is principally because the largest contributor to the growth of carbon emissions over
the next 30 to 40 years will almost certainly be economic growth rather than the growth
of trade. China has been growing at approximately 10-11% a year. Real income per
capita in China has increased by a factor of 8 since 1978. If this growth rate prevails out
to 2050, real income per capita in China will increase by a factor of 30 between 2000 and
2050. This growth will inevitably generate large increases in carbon emissions, and
quantitatively, the effect of growth would seem to swamp by many orders of magnitude
                                             -5-
anything which may be achieved by the use of trade policies. As such, compared to
reductions in the size of the national economies by constraints imposed on growth, trade
policies would seemingly only offer second order effects.
       In addition, since much of international trade in industrial products is in
manufactures and because manufactures are relatively carbon intensive compared to
services and non-manufactures, the size of trade relative to non-trade activity seems more
important than the product composition of trade which trade policies may influence. In
OECD economies, around 70% of national income originates in service-related activities,
and manufacturing activity in terms of value added is only a small portion of GDP, in the
range 15-25%. If trade policy interventions are largely focused on changing the
composition of trade ,then this would seem to be a third order effect on carbon emissions
relative to the two bigger effects of growth and the relative size of trade and non-trade
activities.
    But the ways in which trade policy interventions can affect carbon emissions are a
little more subtle .An important consideration is that there are large differences in
emissions intensity of production by country. This especially the case when comparing
high and low wage economies, such as China and the OECD. Indeed, one can
persuasively argue that differences in emissions intensity are larger across countries than
they are across products or sectors.
    In Table 1, we report data on carbon emissions intensity by product by country
reported by Ahmad & Wyckoff (2003). These data clearly show large differences in
emissions intensity across countries, and suggest that for certain pairs of countries,
differences in emissions intensity across countries are larger than across products or
sectors. China, in particular, exhibits sharply higher emissions intensities than in OECD
countries.
    And even within countries, there are large variations in emissions intensity depending
upon location. In some countries (China is such a case), there can be small localized high
emitting power plants which are used for electricity generation, and relocation of
production from one region of a country to another can also generate significant
reductions in emissions. It is thus unclear whether trade policy interventions should be
more focused on discrimination across and within countries rather than discrimination
across products.


                                             -6-
   There are also other trade policy effects to be taken into account. One is on relocation
of production and on component slices of larger production chains more so than on
individual product production. It is now common in some countries to use R&D tax
credits focused on particular component of activities, such as design and product
innovation, rather than the whole production process to induce production mobility.
Mobility effects stemming from both different emissions reductions intensities by country
and carbon motivated trade policy intervention thus also come into play.
     At a crude level, therefore, the intuition would seem to be that trade policies which
affect the composition of trade may only provide a third order effect on the overall level
of carbon emissions. But, a more nuanced approach to trade policy which goes beyond
conventional product based differentiation in trade policy, and focuses on country or
region within country differentiation may have larger effects.
     Policies which focus on differences in emissions intensities of production for
similar products across countries, and even differences in emissions intensity across
locations within countries seemingly also suggest a sharply different form of trade policy
intervention than in conventional trade policy discussions. This is because if there are un-
internalized externalities, the degree of internalization that might be sought through trade
policies will be a function of the relative differences in emissions, as well as the overall
size of the emissions involved. If emissions intensities are higher in one country than in
another (as in the case of China and the OECD), then the argument would be that trade
policy should sharply discriminate by country more so than by product, with higher
barriers against those countries which are the source of high emissions. This direction for
policy is obviously in sharp conflict with non-discrimination in the WTO.
   This discussion also has the implication that if trade policies to support efforts to
achieve carbon emissions reduction targets are to be used in a discriminatory manor to
achieve internalization of externalities, then the discrimination should be targeted directly
towards the largest differences in emissions intensity. Discrimination in trade policies
will presumably by product and country, and the data we present above suggest that
country discrimination will quantatively dominate product discrimination.
   This also suggests that in any regional trade agreements scheming to achieve
emissions reductions, discrimination should be targeted in a combined border based
system reflecting differential emissions intensities across supplying countries. If one
region with a range of higher emissions intensities by product trades with other region

                                             -7-
with a range of low emissions intensities, and all in the region take on significant carbon
emissions commitments, rather than having common external trade barriers against non-
participants, and zero barriers within the region, they should use a gradation of third
country barriers. There would be both in region and across third country barriers which
are more preferential within the region and less preferential outside the region, with
discrimination among suppliers to the region from outside. Thus, in the carbon case, what
is at issue are not common external trade barriers against third parties, and zero barriers
within regions, as in conventional customs union and free trade area literature , but
different gradations of barriers within and without which focus on correction for
differential severity of externality inflicted damage through trade measures.

3. Possible Carbon Motivated Regional Trade Agreements
   The uses of trade policies to support emissions reduction initiatives cover not only unilateral
actions individually by countries, but also joint actions by groups of countries. Such
arrangements typically centre on three distinct forms, each reflecting different objectives for
trade policies. One involves lowering trade barriers on both low carbon products and products
central to low carbon new technologies as well as products that are inputs to low carbon
processes. The aim is to change the composition of trade in ways which lower global carbon
emissions. Here given differences in emissions intensities by country, country discrimination
may also enter.
   Another use of trade policies is as a protective device to provide offsets to domestic
producers adversely affected relative to foreign competition by the cost implications of own
country emissions reduction initiatives. A third uses trade policies as a sanctioning mechanism
against other countries in an effort to force them to adopt emission reduction initiatives
comparable to own country or within group actions. The last of these is typically to be employed
by a sub group of countries rather than on a single country basis.
     As far as own country actions are involved two issues arise. The first is the potential
effectiveness of new trade policy preferences towards low carbon products. If these were
designed to be WTO compatible they would involve product selective non discriminatory
reductions in tariff rates among partners to agreements, more so than tariff rate increases. Here
the key determinations of effectiveness are the preexisting dispersion in tariff rates across the
high-low carbon divide, and the differences in carbon intensity by product or sector.
     The WTO compatibility of such arrangements raises two key issues. The first is that they
would need to be non discriminatory, and selective actions against high emitting countries would
be ruled out. The second concerns WTO provisions regarding regional agreements under Article
24 of GATT (1994). Even though Article 24 disciplines are notoriously lax in their application,
they do require that regional agreements cover substantially all trade, and not the sector or
product specific. A case could be made that Article 20 exceptions which justify trade measures
that deal with threats to animals, humans or plant life would provide WTO cover given damage
from global warming. But Article 24 would seemingly mean that carbon motivated regional
arrangements to be GATT / WTO comparable would best be additions to or extensions of
existing regional agreements, rather those de novo arrangements.


                                                - 11 -
   One clear weakness in using refocused WTO compatible tariff structures reoriented towards
low carbon products to achieve significant impacts on emissions is that tariff rates on most major
industrial products are already low in the OECD countries and also bound in preexisting WTO
commitments. Table 2 reports both bound and MFN applied tariff rates by product by country
from WTO Tariff Profiles 2006 data. Higher rates are in clothing and textiles, and (in Australia
and New Zealand) transport equipment. Also the largest sources of emissions lie in the power
generation and transportation sectors, which do not correspond to traded products as in national
tariff schedules.
   In Table 3, data for the EU also suggest that 50% of carbon emissions occur in power
generation, transportation, steel, aluminum and cement. These sectors then are used to produce
items which are traded and discrimination in tariff rates among traded goods may yield less
discrimination among emissions intensities.
   Outside of these sectors, the highest OECD tariffs remain in clothing and textiles, and they
are also heavily produced outside of the OECD and so production effects of OECD tariffs are
correspondingly reduced. This all suggests that the room for achieving significant emissions
reductions using WTO comparable low carbon regional tariff reductions may be limited.

   In the Doha Round WTO negotiations, there has been a side negotiation underway on tariff
liberalization in environmentally sensitive goods and services (ICTSD, 2007). It has, however, become
embodied in definition of problems as to what constitutes an environmental goods or service. An
indicative list of 43 such goods (including windmills and bicycles) from the US has circulated in Geneva.
This has, however been opposed by several countries for not including key potential exports by them of
what they regard as environmental goods. A key area is ethanol exports by Brazil to the EU for which
the effective tariff rate on what the EU regard as in agricultural good not an environmental good is
around 70%. This case highlights the definitional problems as to what environmental goods and services
actually are. In the later stages of the Doha negotiations, Brazil went so far as to suggest a request and
offer basic negotiation on nomenclature as a way of reaching agreements on definition of such goods
(Mahesh, 2004).
     Table 4 reports World Bank data on maximum and applied tariff rates on the same 43 select climate
friendly product and technologies across both high and low income countries. High-income WTO
members already have low tariff rates on these items, and while low and middle income WTO members
higher tariff rates on these goods and technologies and these is little trade in these among them. Trade
liberalization in developing countries will give countries access to these technologies and reduce global
emissions, but the starting point in terms of trade volumes is low. Tariff reductions on products that are
inputs to low carbon process will also contribute to emissions reductions, but again among developing
countries, such trade is small. There are isolated large barriers which offer potentially larger effects,
such as in Brazil, as data from Wikipedia, where bioelectricity from sugarcane currently accounts for
4% of Brazilian electricity use and is expected to reach 15% by 2015 and the EU tariff on ethanol is high.
As noted above, this has been excluded from the WTO EGS negotiation on the grounds that sugarcane is
an agricultural product, not an environmental good and has been sharply contested by Brazil.
    That large portion of emissions are associated with a small number of high emitting sectors where
outputs are little traded directly, but traded indirectly embodied in produced goods is a father central
difficulty for carbon motivated regional trade initiatives. Table 3 reports data on emissions by sector by
country that suggest that power generation is the largest of these (accounting for nearly 50% of
emissions in some OECD countries), and transportation is the second (25% in some countries),also iron
and steel, and extractive industries. Also, as Table 1 suggests, among traded higher stage fabricated
products, the differences in direct emissions intensity are relatively small compared the differences
across production of basic commodities (electricity, steel, etc). This seemingly greatly weakens the
potential impacts on emissions of any WTO compatible tariff based measures.

     Finally and as already noted in Table 1, we return to the point that there are considerably
larger differences in emissions intensities between countries (and even across regions within
countries) than there are across sectors or products produced within countries. As we note above,
this suggests potentially sharp differentiation in tariff rates across supplying countries for any use
of trade policies that is to be effective in reducing carbon emissions. Accompanying these would
be considerably more complex rules of origin than currently used in existing regional agreements.
     The central problems however ,with this latter approach is that it is diametrically opposed to
the central principle of MFN/ non discrimination in Article 1 of GATT 1944, the key element in
the charter of the WTO. As such, there is seemingly a central and critical conflict between the
idea of using non discrimination (MFN) in trade arrangements in the WTO to spread the benefits
of any bilaterally negotiated trade liberalization more broadly across all countries, and more
costly country discrimination in trade, as an objective of global environmental policies. If the
latter aim to internalize external effects, and if the country of the original source of damage
associated with the externality differs greatly across countries, seemingly on global efficiency
grounds discrimination by country seems called for. Remedying location varying externalities
through geographically discriminatory measures thus might seem logical to environmental
economists, but the idea also strikes at the heart of the post war GATT/WTO based trading
system which is so close to the heart of trade economists.
   Turning to group wide uses of trade policies to support emissions reductions initiatives, there
are a variety of potential forms that carbon motivated free trade area or regional arrangements
could be. These range across the different forms and permutations.
   One idea which has attracted recent attention is that either existing or newly negotiated
bilateral or regional trade arrangements directly reflect emissions reduction objectives shared by
pairs of countries or groups of countries in the agreements reached. A recent Chatham House
study (Lee & Froggatt, 2007) proposed a version of this idea, when discussing a possible EU-
China bilateral agreement. The Chatham House explicitly suggests the use of trade preferences in
favor of low carbon products in such an agreement, with the objective of lowering emissions
from the two participating entities by encouraging switching of both production and consumption
in the two countries into relatively low carbon products. Whether or not global emissions
necessarily fall as a result of such agreements is, however, not clear as it depends on the relative
emissions intensities of productions inside and outside of the regional agreement countries. Some
existing free trade agreements already have added environmental context, such as in US-Chile

                                                - 17 -
free trade agreements, which include elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers on
environmental goods and services (USTR,2003) , and NAFTA which has special dispute
settlement rules for environmental cases, and establishes a trilateral US-Mexico-Canada
commission to evaluate environmental impacts of the agreement. The latter arrangements are not
climate change focused however.
   This discussion of carbon free trade agreements therefore focuses on possible ways in which
regional trade agreements can contribute directly to emissions reduction through changes in the
composition of trade among member countries in such agreements. They would potentially
depart from classical free trade areas as simply zero tariffs within a geographical zone, by using
product specific arrangements which embody larger or tiered preferences toward low carbon
products as a way of encouraging both consumption and productions switching towards low
emission products.
   It is generally thought that these types of carbon free trade agreements would be relatively
easy to implement as an overlay on existing customs unions/ free trade areas since they would
basically depart from conventional arrangements only by using product specific low carbon tariff
rates. There is the added issue of potential new and more complex rules of origin which would be
involved, but such agreements are believed to be easily negotiable. It is their effectiveness that is
the more central issue.

     A second type of carbon free trade agreement would go farther by also embodying offsets to
the perceived anti-competitive effects potentially generated against domestic producers from
significant carbon emissions reductions .The issue is the cost increases they face from own
country emissions reductions relative to smaller impacts abroad if others do not match the
emissions reductions. This issue has come up centrally in the European debate on unilateral
European emissions reductions, and is further discussed in Ismer & Neuhoff (2007), and
Lockwood & Whalley(2008).
     In the EU case it has been not only the prospective use of carbon emission reductions in a
single region not matched by other countries but also the prospective changes post 2012 in the
European Carbon Emissions Trading Scheme with less dependence on cap and trade
arrangements and more reliance on auctioning of emissions quotas. Under a cap and trade
scheme, existing products receive agreed allocations of quota and must buy more. Under quota
auctions they must buy the full amount. A related concern in such arrangements is also to reduce
carbon leakage effects through potentially increased emissions by non participants.
     The offsets proposals take the form of border tax adjustments and as noted by Lockwood &
Whalley (2008) there are two ways those that have been advanced to offset the leakage and cost
effects involved. One is that imported goods would be taxed at the border in ways which reflect
the cost of the emissions trading were they to be produced in the home market they are entering.
This would involve border tax adjustments between countries. Another alternative approach to
BTAs which has been suggested is to use tax equivalents based on enforcement of emissions
allowance trading for all importers. US debate has focused on this approach. Under this, any
importer of products would need to buy emissions rights domestically to meet required offsets,
and exporters could sell some of their emissions permits acquired for production to gain offset.
     These schemes however, face a number of issues. At a conceptual level, a key issue is
whether such border adjustments would have the offsetting effects which are claimed in the
proposals made. It has long been argued in analytical literature on border tax adjustments at the
time of the introduction of the value added tax in Europe going back to the late 1960’s and early
1970’s, that in a uniform tax case no effects on trade will be generated from such measures. If
imports are taxed while exports receive equal rate tax rebates, there would be no real effects
from such measures because they would simply induce changes in exchange rates or price levels
which would offset the border tax adjustments. Put another way, a border tax adjustment is


                                               - 21 -
simply a movement between a consumption to a production based tax and vice versa and has no
effects on relative prices and hence no real effects on trade or production. Hence there is a need
to clearly specify what the potential offset effects actually might be in practice from such
arrangements.
     Also, and as emphasized in Lockwood & Whalley (2008), the motivation for such border
measures should be seen as a separate matter from the impacts of the measures themselves. Thus,
the motivation for the use of border measures should be put on one side once the impacts of such
measures become the issue since their impacts on trade are independently of the motivation. As
Lockwood & Whalley (2008) also note, such border adjustments could also be rationalized based
on differences in labor costs, labor standards or other policy elements.
     There is also the issue of the administrative complexity of implementing such measures.
Calculating the carbon content involved in products is difficult. Not only is there the direct
carbon content of production involved, but also the indirect carbon content – the amount of
carbon involved in producing the steel which goes into a car. Equally problematic is that
international sourcing involves products which have components with origins in multiple
countries. Indeed, in many production processes within countries component origins are often
not kept track of in detailed ways and this makes the calculation of carbon content even more
difficult. Rules of origin associated with such arrangements would thus be complex and
considerably more difficult to administer than rules of origin in conventional trade arrangements.
     On top of these complications, the form of such arrangements is a further issue since
different countries may be adopting emission reductions commitments at different speeds and in
different ways. Country discrimination in such agreements becomes difficult to calculate and
administer if they involve groups of countries who are going farther and faster than other
countries in their emissions reduction commitments. And if the border tax adjustments being
discussed in the EU are instead applied by groups of countries, the structure would no longer be
one of complete free trade between integrating members and common external barriers towards
third parties as in a customs union or a free trade area. Instead a gradation of trade arrangements,
both among members within countries and members outside would seemingly be needed .These
would involve differentiated trade preferences based on different carbon reduction commitments
and varying carbon contents of production by county. These arrangements thus would face many
difficulties in implementation, which would also complicate assessment of their impacts and add
to administrative complexity.

                                                - 22 -
   A third type of carbon free trade arrangement would revolve around groups of countries who
jointly commit to emissions reductions ,but who either threaten or actually discriminatorily use
trade arrangements as a penalty mechanism against non-participants to force them to join in the
emissions reduction. As mentioned earlier, this is the structure embodied in the 1987 Montreal
Protocol, which involves the use of trade barrier threats to force non signatories to the agreement
to eliminate use and production of hydro carbons and other ozone depleting substances to join
the original agreements struck by a sub coalition of countries (Werksman, 2006).
   Here, there are difficulties with the potential size of penalties which might be required, as
well as that their penalties would likely violate tariff bindings in the WTO, This would
seemingly inevitably occur in some arrangements if the threats were to be strong enough to
enforce compliance by heavy and large emitters such as India and China. Under this type of
carbon free trade agreement the conflicts between environmental arrangements using trade
policies and the existing WTO commitments embodied in preexisting trade policy structure
would be greatly elevated.
   Who would be involved in such arrangements is also a central issue, especially as the major
differences in global environmental negotiations is now lying between the OECD and the rapidly
growing large population low wage economies (Brazil, China, and India) who took no
commitments under Kyoto and who were granted special treatment under the principle of
Common But Differentiated Responsibilities. Lack of satisfactory progress in global climate
change negotiations could thus well fuel the pressures for trade action across the same decade.
   This then indicates the types of trade arrangements that might be involved in the form of
regional trade initiatives undertaken in the name of supporting significant carbon emission
reductions. They range from WTO compatible low carbon product trade pacts, to country
discrimination that would undermine the MFN non discrimination in the WTO, and from
cooperative offset mechanism to unilateral commitments. Trade policy sanctions by groups of
countries or parties in agreements could also be used to force compliance by non participants.
The growing links between global climate change and trade arrangements would seemingly
likely intensify with increasing severity of climate related damage.

4. Potential Impacts and Systemic Implications of Carbon Motivated Trade
Policies
     What are potential impacts of carbon motivated trade policies on emission levels, and how
significant might they be? What is the size of the potential barriers involved? Are there potential
reversals of trade flows and what would be the impact generally on global trade flows? Would
the trade threats involved be strong enough to induce environmental compliance by major
entities? And how might the trading system evolve under a scenario of growing severity of
climate related damage?
     On the emissions front, the general presumption as noted earlier is that growth has
seemingly much more impact on emission levels than trade, and it is the level of trade more so
than the composition of trade that matters. For carbon free trade areas of the first type, involving
tariff preferences towards low carbon intensive products, there could be some reductions in
emission levels, but these effects would likely to be small. And even the sign of the effect is
ambiguous.
     An important variable in determining the emissions outcome is the relative emissions
intensity of production in these industrialized products (characterized as low carbon) across third
countries outside of the agreement and those countries within the agreement. If third countries
have lower emissions levels in production then members of the regional agreement with trade
diversion effect away from third parties , it is possible that emissions levels could rise as a result
of the agreement, even though low carbon trade within there countries (and consumption and
production ) is stimulated. If more emission intensive production inside the region displaces
lower emission intensive production outside the region, emission levels will still be high, even
though there is more consumption and production globally of low carbon intensive productions.
Hence impacts of regional agreements on emissions are not clear.
     The effects on emissions can also be influenced by the reactions of those outside the
agreement. If third countries with lower emission intensive production join the carbon motivated
FTA to gain market access, or relocate plants from outside the region to inside the region, and in
the process produce with lower emissions levels than original members and regain market share,
emission levels can fall due to these effects. Thus investment diversion effects can make carbon
motivated FTA’s emissions reducing. The net effect of all these possibilities will require




                                                 - 24 -
numerical simulation analysis to get exact estimates of possible net effects, or export
decomposition to separate out FTA influences from other changes impacting trading relationship.
    With the second form of regional agreement where there is use of border measures for offsets
to anti-competitive effects on domestic producers, again the relative emissions intensity of
production inside and outside the region will be important assuming that real effects occur.
Lockwood & Whalley(2008) have recently discussed carbon motivated border tax adjustments in
light of earlier border tax literature on the value added tax in Europe in the 1960s (see Krauss &
Johnson(1972), Shibata(1967), and Whalley (1979)). They note the earlier emphasis on
neutrality of border tax changes and discuss scenarios under which similar outcomes could
occur with carbon motivated border adjustments. They highlight the need to separately consider
price level and relative price effect like more broadly border adjustments occur.
    Similar considerations come into play in appraising the possible effects of threat driven
agreements. Again strategic response matters. If countries with higher emission levels are not
induced to join the agreement then increases in emissions can occur. One also needs to consider
the combined effects of the three kinds of carbon motivated regional trade agreements, when
carbons FTAs are designed as penalty mechanisms. If they induce high emission countries to
join the agreement, then they can tend to reduce global emissions.
    Finally, there is also the size of the threatened measures involved under the third type of
regional carbon motivated trade measures that might be needed to induce compliance. There has
been speculation that for larger economies such as India and China, who are rapidly growing and
have large internal markets, that the potential costs for them of meeting global environmental
commitments requested of them could be so large as to dissuade them from participating in
environmental agreement and even trade threats pushing them all the way to autarky might not
be sufficient to generate their compliance. The severity of the threats involved will depend on the
severity of the anticipated damage from elevated global warming, but even if very high trade
barriers were in effective to induce compliance, conflicts would inherently intensify on other
fronts.
    If these forms of carbon motivated regional trade agreements grow over time (say over the
next 5-10 years) and if the potential severity of global warming issues is viewed as worsening,
trade measures associated with the environmental component of global trade arrangements will
also likely grow in profile. Were that to happen, carbon regional agreements could potentially
involve large barriers against parties outside them. If carbon prices in the region of 50 or 100 –

                                                - 25 -
200 dollars/ tonne were needed to appropriately price out the global externalities associated with
carbon, the barriers involved and also the potential competitive offsets involved with border
measures could be very large. The same would be true for threats needed to induce compliance.
   As a result, progressively over time, the environmentally based component of global trade
arrangements could come to dominate the conventional component of trade policy in terms of
relative size. In turn, these heightened trade barriers would increasingly likely generate violations
of tariff bindings committed to the WTO under Article 2 and generate a series of dispute
settlement cases in the WTO. The prospect that the levels of the environmentally motivated trade
protection could increase sharply over the next few decades is a major difficulty for the WTO
rule based trading system, with substantial pressure potentially being placed on the trading
system from the quarters in the years ahead.
   Another set of issues are the potential trade impacts of such trade policy initiatives. Results
from an earlier modeling piece by Piggott, Whalley & Wigle (1993) suggested that significant
global emissions commitments could have the effect of sharply reducing global trade volumes.
This reflected the relative price effects between energy and other inputs feeding through the
global economy onto the price of manufactures and from these to nontrade services given that
manufactures are sharply more energy intensive than services. Some of their model simulations
showed reductions in the level of world trade in the region of 25% from significant carbon
motivated initiatives and their results suggested that global climate initiatives potentially have
large impacts on global trade flows. They would operate in the opposite direction to the trade
effects of liberalization that have driven the system under the GATT and the WTO since 1947.
   Along with changes in trade patterns, the modeling work by Piggott et al also suggested that
some large economies, such as Japan which are large exporters of manufactures could become
net importers of manufactures due to energy price effects. Their results thus suggest that there
could be major impacts on global trading patterns from climate actions taken globally. Not only
are trade impacts from high barriers involved, but the impacts applied to global trade flows
themselves could reverse the direction of trade in some cases.
   A further potential effect of climate motivated trade policy is to fuel linkage of trade policy
to other areas and objectives. Since the 1940’s trade policy has been viewed generally as a direct
and separate policy subsystem, whose objectives were in part to achieve global cooperation to
prevent retaliatory closing of the global economy as in the 1930’s, and to fuel global growth by
progressive move to policy. Only have recently with the debate in the WTO on trade and

                                                - 26 -
environment has linkage to non trade areas arisen in a significant way. With climate motivated
areas of trade policies, similar issues and uses of trade policy potentially arise in many other
areas. Trade policies could be stimulated to offset competitive disadvantages from minimum
wages, social programs, tax policies, equality regimes, and many other forms of initiatives. They
would be used by regions to force other countries to adopt policies they wish to perceive. Uses
of trade policy for emissions reduction thus potentially sharply elevate the strategic interactions
among countries, and the actual impacts of polices introduced need to be separated from their
motivation.
   This discussion of carbon motivated trade policies adopted either unilaterally or by groups of
countries also raises issues as to what the future might be for the trading system in a world where
both climate change concerns and physical manifestation of climate change progressively grow
over time. Can the GATT/WTO based system of the post war years as we have come to know it
survive and continue to operate?
   We see the future evolution of the trading system as one where potentially the
environmentally motivated component of trade arrangements increasingly acts as an overlay on
conventional trade arrangements involving rules and disciplines under the WTO along with
growing and spreading regional trade agreements. The growths of the latter have been
extensively discussed in recent literature (Whalley, 2008a). Environmental agreements, in turn,
are likely to grow in significance and trade interventions motivated by new climate agreements
will grow. Under a severe global warming scenario climate related considerations could
eventually come to dominate the evolution of the trading system.
     In this world, linkage and the interface of trade and the climate then will likely be different
from that which has the focus of debate in the WTO for the last 10 – 15 years. The focus has
largely been on whether or not countries should have rights to use trade restricting measures on
environmental grounds, not the trade implications of environmental measures, most of which
would arise from developments operates outside of the framework of the WTO. These
developments would trigger disputes within the WTO for violation of tariff bindings, and in this
way could become dominant part of global trade debate, but the WTO could not directly control
the underlying climate related actions.
     If this trend was to occur (and it would likely depend on the severity of climate changes) the
prospect would be for global environmental negotiations to progressively grow in profile to the
point that they dominated trade negotiations in perceived significance. Trade policy bargaining

                                                - 27 -
would then more and more have to take into account links to global environmental negotiations
to the point that the present WTO becomes a global bargaining entity which progressively moves
beyond trade. As evolution from the WTO to a World Bargaining Organization (as discussed in
Whalley (2008b)) could be the outcome.
   The size and speed of institutional modification that might be associated with more severe
global warming scenarios suggests major global change ahead. Increased use of carbon
motivated trade policies may be only one manifestation. The post Doha WTO might evolve as an
entity heavily dealing with trade linkage to higher profile climate change. Negotiation in the
WTO both in tariff barriers and in MFN could come under pressure to resuspend. The pressure to
formally link trade negotiations to higher profile global environmental negotiations could grow.
