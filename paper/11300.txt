The Life-Cycle Personal Accounts Proposal for Social Security: A Review
Robert J. Shiller
NBER Working Paper No. 11300
April 2005
JEL No. H55

                                            ABSTRACT

The life-cycle accounts proposal for Social Security reform has been justified by its proponents using

a number of different arguments, but these arguments generally involve the assumption of a high

likelihood of good returns on the accounts. A simulation is undertaken to estimate the probability

distribution of returns in the accounts based on long-term historical experience. U.S. stock market,

bond market and money market data 1871-2004 are used for the analysis. Assuming that future

returns behave like historical data, it is found that a baseline personal account portfolio after offset

will be negative 32% of the time on the retirement date. The median internal rate of return in this

case is 3.4 percent, just above the amount necessary for holders of the accounts to break even.

However, the U.S. stock market has been unusually successful historically by world standards. It

would be better if we adjust the historical data to reduce the assumed average stock market return

for the simulation. When this is done so that the return matches the median stock market return of

15 countries 1900-2000 as reported by Dimson et al. [2002], the baseline personal account is found

to be negative 71% of the time on the date of retirement and the median internal rate of return is 2.6

percent.

     The Life-Cycle Personal Accounts Proposal for Social Security: An Evaluation1


        President George W. Bush has outlined a specific plan for personal accounts

within Social Security, allowing workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in

exchange for a reduction in their traditional Social Security benefit. The plan is similar in

spirit, but different in important details, to a plan proposed by President Bill Clinton in

1999, which relied on a government budget surplus at the time. Bush has not yet unveiled

an entire plan to restore solvency. This paper focuses on one aspect of the portion of the

plan he has already announced: the life-cycle personal accounts. Specifically, the paper

investigates the possible returns and possible risks associated with the personal account

option. I use historical returns to assess the potential range of future investment

outcomes under the life-cycle portfolio envisioned under the President’s plan.



I. How the Accounts Would Work

        Under the present Social Security system, each working individual must

contribute 6.2% of his or her earnings (up to an earnings ceiling, currently $90,000) to

Social Security, and this is matched by another 6.2% of earnings that the individual’s

employer must contribute. Upon retirement, the individual’s and employer’s

contributions for all the years that he or she worked, updated for inflation using a wage

index, are fed into a formula that determines the annual Social Security benefit that the

individual will receive upon retirement. The present formula is progressive, that is,

people with lower earnings get relatively more in benefits per dollar contributed than do

                                                   3
people with higher earnings. The formula does not take as inputs any financial variables

such as interest rates or stock returns, and so the benefits ultimately received are

independent of the performance of financial markets. While Social Security benefits are

subject to political risk and risks about changes in the economy, they historically have not

exhibited any of the annual volatility associated with investments in financial markets.

       The proposed new personal account system would be optional: people can stay in

the old system (subject to future changes in that system that Congress might make) or

elect to have 4.0%, that is, nearly two thirds of their 6.2% contribution, up to a maximum

amount that would be phased out by 2041, diverted into personal accounts. They can then

allocate these accounts, according to their tastes, into a portfolio of their choosing,

subject to the restriction that it be comprised of a few broadly diversified investment

funds of stocks and bonds along the lines of the options currently offered to Federal

employees through the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), and including as well a life-cycle fund

option, which the TSP has announced plans for, but which it does not currently offer.

       But, according to the President’s plan, the personal account does not come for

free. Indeed, there is a much-discussed budget problem that the President’s plan must

allow for. A plan that simply allows workers to divert part of their Social Security

contribution into a personal portfolio will mean that the government will no longer be

able to use this part of current contributions to support the current beneficiaries of Social

Security. The government will have to borrow money to make up for the money workers

have diverted to the personal accounts. So, in an attempt to preserve balance over an

infinite horizon, the plan specifies that when the individual finally retires, an “offset”

value, the terminal value of the Social Security contributions cumulated at a 3% real




                                              4
interest rate, will be annuitized (converted into a series of payments for life, analogous to

the payments that people make on mortgages) and subtracted from the traditional Social

Security benefit. In addition to this reduced traditional benefit due to the offset, the

worker will also get the lump sum value of the personal account, although he or she

would be required to annuitize at least enough of that so that the combined traditional

benefit and personal account would be above the poverty line, whenever there is enough

in the personal account to make that possible. In effect, the worker has not really

“diverted” his or her Social Security contributions into a personal account, but has merely

borrowed from the government to invest in a personal account, and must eventually pay

the loan back. The offset will eventually help the government deal with the debt it

incurred to maintain benefits to retirees.

         While the plan is described as a way of “fixing” Social Security, in effect, the new

personal accounts are nothing more than a plan to encourage people to buy stocks and

bonds on margin that is to borrow money to buy stocks, with the Federal government as

the lender offering a 3% real interest rate on the loan. The computation that is made

when a worker retires is the same as one that a brokerage firm would do for customers

with margin accounts who elected to put the equity in their margin account into a

retirement annuity on the day they retired. In the brokerage business, the “offset” would

be called the “debit balance” in the margin account.2

         Of course, there is nothing morally or practically wrong with buying stocks on

margin, despite popular prejudices against the practice. Encouraging people to do this

might help many of them diversify their personal portfolios better, taking better


2
 In this case, however, the “debit balance” is subtracted from the traditional Social Security benefit,
although in net this is equivalent to subtracting the balance from the personal account itself.


                                                      5
advantage of higher expected returns from some more risky investments and offsetting

the anti-equity bias that infects the portfolios of most small investors.3 Encouraging

people to buy securities on margin might also help a broad element of the public learn a

lesson in finance, thus furthering the President’s goal of promoting an “ownership

society.” But, we have to think whether this plan for margin purchases of securities is

going to work out as well for them financially as the President has been intimating.



II. The Life-Cycle Portfolio

         The President’s plan is based on the concept that the optimal portfolio for most of

the participants is a “life-cycle portfolio.” The managers of the life-cycle accounts would

invest more aggressively when the worker is young, and gradually more conservatively

as he or she ages, in accordance with the advice of most financial advisors. According to

the President’s plan, the life-cycle portfolio would be an option for younger workers and

all personal accounts would be “automatically invested in the ‘life cycle portfolio’ when

a worker reaches age 47, unless the worker and his or her spouse specifically opted out

by signing a waiver form stating that they are aware of the risks involved.”4 Thus, in a

sense the life cycle portfolio is the centerpiece of the personal account plan.

         The life cycle plans are important to the plan in that they attempt to respond to the

complaint that the president’s Social Security plan is too risky, that by encouraging

people to achieve higher returns on their Social Security contributions by investing in

risky assets, they will run major risks that a market decline will impoverish them in their

3
  The best-stated theoretical argument for personal accounts is that they encourage people to diversify their
portfolios better, see Geanakoplos et al. 2000 and discussion below in this paper. In contrast, many popular
accounts of the advantages of personal accounts neglect to note that higher returns that investments such as
stocks appear to offer are really just compensation for the higher risk that these investments entail.

retirement. A life cycle plan would involve riskier investments only in the earlier years of

the life cycle.

        However, the life cycle plan may also not live up to its promise of giving workers

a return higher than they would have gotten under the original Social Security plan. Any

plan that deals with risk by investing more conservatively will tend to lower also the

expected return.



III. Methods and Assumptions Underlying the Analysis

        In this paper I will do a simulation of the returns from such life-cycle personal

accounts, using long-term historical data. Long-term historical data are important to look

at, lest our results be over influenced by recent years, for which stock market returns have

been very high. It is common sense that if we want to assess the returns from a lifetime

investing strategy, we should look beyond one or two lifetimes: we need to look at the

range of history.

        I will use for this purpose a U. S. data set on U.S. stocks, bonds and money

market 1871-2005 that I assembled years ago for my book Market Volatility, 1989, and

also used in my book Irrational Exuberance, Princeton University Press, 2005. In this

paper I will use these data both with and without adjustments to returns to reflect

international experience.



A. Historical Simulation

        I will use returns on stocks, bonds and the money market, from 1871 to 2004 to

devise 91 separate draws of a worker’s 44-year experiences in these markets. Earnings by




                                              7
age for a representative worker are taken from the “scaled medium earner” developed by

the Social Security actuaries.5 This earner is meant to reflect the typical employment and

earnings pattern with rising wages through age 51 and then falling off by 64. In all of the

simulations the worker is born in 1990, starts participating in the accounts in 2011, and

retires in 2055 at age 65. The simulations hold the earnings path constant and only vary

the rates of return experienced by this hypothetical worker. It is assumed that the worker

places the full 4% of earnings, into a personal account, the maximum under the Bush

plan.



B. Assumptions on Assets and Rates of Return

         These simulations require an appropriate series of historical returns and an

assumed portfolio. The Social Security Trustees have assumed that future real returns for

stocks will be 6.5% per annum, for government bonds 3%. This assumption appears close

to long-term historical experience for the U. S., see Table I.6 For the years 1871-2004, the

geometric average real return on U.S. stocks was 6.8%, for U.S. government bonds 2.6%.

For the more recent subsample of 1950 to 2004, the returns were broadly similar, higher

for stocks, lower for bonds. It might seem, then, that the Social Security actuaries were

making reasonable assumptions about future returns.

         However, there are important reasons to doubt that the numbers can be trusted as

a guide to the next century. We do not know that the successful twentieth century will be

scaled factors. These are multiplied here by $46,142, which is the Social Security Administration
intermediate assumption for the average wage in 2011, http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR04/lr6F7-2.html.

  The reader is reminded that returns are computed as geometric averages of gross returns, which are
always lower than the arithmetic averages that are often quoted. See Jeremy Siegel, Stocks for the Long
Run, 2002. Also, real (inflation-corrected) returns are lower than the nominal returns that are often quoted.


                                                      8
duplicated in the U.S. in the twenty-first century. The U.S. has been a very successful

country. It would be a mistake to assume that the U.S. will be so extraordinarily

successful in the next century. In fact, the Social Security Trustees themselves forecast a

considerable slowdown in GDP growth in the 21st century compared to the experience of

the 20th century.

         Table 1 also shows the median of the geometric average return for 15 countries,

including the United States, for 1900 to 2000 as reported in Dimson et al. [2002]. Note

that the stock return is considerably lower for this international historical sample than it is

for the United States alone, 4.8% rather than 7.0% over the same sample. Moreover, bond

returns are also lower for the international sample, 1.2% rather than 1.5%.7

         Brown, Goetzmann and Jorion [1999] did a study of the capital appreciation in the

long history of the stock markets of 39 countries, going back as far as the 1920s. They

found that while for their sample the U.S. annual real stock market capital appreciation

was about 5% a year, the median for the 39 countries was only about 1.5% a year. Their

results suggest an even bigger difference between the U.S. and the rest of the world.

Indeed, Dimson et al. excluded many countries with poor stock market performance,

such as many in Latin America, where they could not get data on returns. But I did not

include the Brown et al. results in the table since their data referred to capital

appreciation only, omitting the dividend component of returns.



7
  Dimson et al. themselves report the geometric average real return 1900-2000 of 5.8% per year for stocks
for a world portfolio comprised of the individual countries, where portfolio weights for the countries are
proportional to their GDPs. This figure is higher than the median shown in the table because it is a
weighted average of returns that gives a great deal of weight to the United States. For an investor who
diversified around the world 1900-2000, their world return is likely to be a better indicator of portfolio
return than is the median. However, if we interpret each country’s data as providing a separate draw of
country experience unrelated to size of country, the median is likely to be a better indicator of likely future
experience of a country.

        A February 28 2005 Wall Street Journal article by Mark Whitehouse reported the

expectations for future stocks and corporate and government bonds for the next 44 years.

While he does not describe how he chose his respondents, most of these respondents are

prominent economists at top Wall Street firms. The median expected return on the stock

market is 4.6%, very close to the historical experience for the international sample, much

lower than the 6.5% assumed by the Social Security Actuaries.

         As a result, these simulations use two sets of data on returns: both the actual

historical data and an alternative series in which the returns on stocks are lowered by 2.2

percentage point per year, the difference seen in Table 1 between the U.S. data and the

rest of the world data in Dimson et al. [2002]. This adjusted returns series correspond

more closely to projections of financial economists and should be emphasized more as

the appropriate evaluation of the accounts going forward.8

         The Social Security actuaries have asserted that the costs to investing the funds

and running the accounts will be 30 basis points per year. Accepting this estimate, the

analysis below subtracts 30 basis points from returns of the accounts.




8
 Note, if the life cycle equity account is assumed to invest in international equities, as recommended by
most financial advisers and included as an option in the TSP, then including international returns would be
appropriate even in a purely historical simulation without any adjustment. Realistically, however, there is a
“home bias” in most investors’ portfolios, and most of the portfolio is likely to remain in the U.S. In the
Thrift Savings Plan that is the model for the personal accounts, participants chose to invest only 1.8% of
account balances in the I Fund (international) as of December 31, 2003.

C. Defining Life cycle funds

         No one knows exactly what the life cycle funds will look like. Indeed, the asset

allocation for such a fund is going to be a contentious issue; economic practitioners and

theorists will have plenty to confront. The White House has been describing the fund as

one that is initially concentrated in stocks, but that gradually moves towards bonds.9

         Ideally, the design of life cycle funds would reflect the risks in labor income over

the life cycle and the level of income in retirement, including traditional Social Security

defined benefits.10 Moreover, the funds must reflect as well the other assets, such as the

home and claims on future Social Security benefits, owned by the beneficiary. In his

classic Econometrica mathematical treatise on optimal investment strategies, Robert

Merton stressed that portfolio allocation must be designed to hedge future changes in

investment opportunities, and John Campbell and Luis Viceira in a treatise on lifetime

portfolio allocation showed that variations in future investment opportunities are of some

practical significance for portfolio design.

         Among those who have worked on the theory of life-cycle portfolio allocation, it

is not unanimous that younger people would go more heavily into stocks. Luis Viceira

showed that high idiosyncratic labor income risk and positive correlation between stock

returns and labor income can mean that the stockholdings of the young should be lower


9
   A problem with this general notion, as Jeremy Siegel pointed out in his book Stocks for the Long Run,
2002, is that over a really long-term sample 1802-2000 for long-term investors, in real terms investments in
bonds have actually been riskier than investments in stocks. This is because over long intervals of time
changes in the consumer price index (CPI) have cumulated to cause major changes in the real value of
long-term bonds, whose values are fixed in nominal terms. However, over more recent samples, such as
1871-2004, stocks have been clearly more risky in real terms than bonds for long-horizon investors.
10
   Paul Samuelson showed in 1966 under fairly general assumptions that in the absence of non-portfolio
sources of income, young and old investors would both have the same risk tolerance in their portfolios. Zvi
Bodie, Robert Merton and William Samuelson [1992] and John Heaton and Deborah Lucas [1997] showed
that if labor income is added to the model, employed persons will optimally hold more risky assets than
will retired persons.


                                                    12
than those of retired investors. His calculations also show that the optimal portfolio can,

depend a lot on assumptions that are made about preferences and stochastic properties of

variables, and under some assumptions the optimal portfolio may look quite extreme.

One of his candidates for optimal portfolios has young people investing over 300% of

their money in the stock market, borrowing on heavily on margin far beyond the limits

imposed by margin requirements today.

        Benzoni et al. showed that if one takes account not only of the contemporaneous

correlation between stock returns and labor income, but also the correlation through time,

then it may be that young people should not only own a lower fraction of their income in

stocks than older people, but beyond that, they should actually be short the stock market.

Andrew Lynch and Sinan Tan concluded that young people should have a lower

proportion of stocks in their portfolios than old people, given that when stock returns are

low (as in a recession) there is both lower mean income growth and higher volatility. We

learn from these studies that there are a lot of difficult issues to confront in designing the

optimal life-cycle portfolio, and that there is an extraordinarily wide range of

possibilities, not just the possibilities that might sound intuitively plausible at first glance.

        Obviously, the design of a life-cycle fund is not a simple matter. It is difficult to

predict now how the concept of life cycle funds will be interpreted in coming decades.

        The most likely model for the life cycle plan that is instituted, at least initially,

may be based on existing life-cycle plans. Unfortunately, life cycle plans that are

currently privately offered vary considerably. Furthermore, these life cycle plans are

designed for people to save in addition to Social Security and by reducing current

consumption. In contrast, the life-cycle accounts in the President’s plan would be for




                                               13
people who would expect a substantially smaller traditional Social Security benefit.

Specifically, in a system reformed to be permanently sustainable, the President’s

accounts might lead to a traditional Social Security benefit of about $5,000 or even less

for a middle-income worker. As we shall see below, the optimal portfolio for people who

are offered a new option to buy stocks on margin would be to invest entirely in risk-free

Treasury bonds. A reasonable life-cycle portfolio would fall somewhere between these

two extremes of current life-cycle portfolios and investing entirely in bonds.

       The Vanguard Target Retirement 2045 Fund is for people expecting to retire

around 2045. As of September 30, 2004, this fund had Vanguard Total Stock Market

Index Fund 71.2%, Vanguard European Stock Index Fund 12.4%, Vanguard Total Bond

Market Index Fund 11.0% and Vanguard Pacific Stock Index Fund 5.4%. The prospectus

says that the allocations will gradually be changed towards those of the Vanguard Target

Retirement Income Fund (which is aimed at current retirees): Vanguard Total Bond

Market Index Fund 50.0%, Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund 25.0%,

Vanguard Stock Market Index Fund 20.0%, and Vanguard Money Market Fund 5.0%.

       T. Rowe Price Retirement 2040 Fund starts out, according to its prospectus,

investing 90% in stocks, 10% in fixed income, and 0% in conservative fixed income. It

will convert into the Retirement Income Fund approximately five years after reaching

their target dates. Thus it would eventually be 40% stocks, 30% fixed income, and 30%

conservative fixed income.

       These funds, which must pass the market test to the general public in its current

mindset, may not represent the funds that will be designed for the personal accounts.

They may under-represent the money market, since money market returns have recently




                                            14
been very low and apparently unattractive to investors to whom these funds must make a

sales pitch, even if money market rates will be much higher in future years when the fund

shifts into them. Today’s funds may under-represent inflation-protection securities

because the general public has been very cool to these, but it would be rational if inflation

protection securities became a significant portion of the asset allocation of life-cycle

funds as year pass, and this may thus be expected to happen.

         For the purposes of this historical simulation, for which historical data must be

found, I have assumed that the allocation for the life cycle accounts will be between two

funds, a U.S. equity fund (analogous to the C Fund in the Thrift Savings Plan that is

offered to U. S. government employees) and a bond-money-market fund that is 50%

long-term U.S. government bonds and 50% private-sector money market (6-month

commercial paper until 1997, 6-month certificates of deposit thereafter). I am assuming

that the G Fund offered by the Thrift Savings Plan will not be available for the personal

accounts, and under that assumption it would be reasonable to suppose that a bond fund

would combine both public long term and private short term debt. 11

         I consider six potential asset allocations:

              •    Baseline life-cycle portfolio. This portfolio is invested 85% in equities

                   through age 29 and then falls linearly to 15% in equities by age 60. This

                   is slightly more conservative than the Vanguard portfolio, reflecting the

                   fact that this portfolio is designed to largely replace the existing Social

                   Security benefit.

11
  The G Fund that invests in short-term government securities specially created for it, not available to the
general investing public. These securities pay the long-term interest rate as if it were a short rate. Since
long-term bonds generally have a higher yield than short-term bonds, these securities tend to outperform
short-term securities with no additional risk. The G Fund is effectively subsidized by the Federal
Government; it may be unlikely that the government will offer such a subsidy to the general public.


                                                     15
             •    Entirely bonds portfolio. This portfolio is invested 100 percent in

                  bonds, specifically 50% in long-term bonds and 50% in money market.

                  This portfolio itself is not risk free.

             •    Conservative life-cycle portfolio. This portfolio follows the same

                  pattern as the baseline life-cycle portfolio, but falls from 70% in equities

                  to 10% in equities.

             •    50 percent stock portfolio. This portfolio is fixed at 50 percent in

                  equities, it does not vary with the lifecycle. This corresponds to the

                  featured portfolio in the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social

                  Security, which the Social Security actuaries projected would have a real

                  rate of return of 4.6%.12

             •    Aggressive life-cycle portfolio. This portfolio follows the same pattern

                  as the baseline life-cycle portfolio, but falls from 90% in equities to 40%

                  in equities.

             •    Entirely stocks portfolio. This portfolio is invested 100% in equities in

                  every period.



IV. Simulation Results

        Results are shown in Tables 3 and 4. Two benchmarks are used to assess each

portfolio. First, the tables show the internal rate of return for the stream of payments

represented by the contributions. An internal rate of return in excess of 3 percent means

that the personal account exceeded the offset and the worker is better off. Second, the

12
  President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security, Strengthening Social Security and Creating
Personal Wealth for All Americans, 2001.


                                                  16
tables present the final net value of choosing the personal account after the benefit offset.

The tables show various summary measures for these benchmarks for the five portfolios.

       The baseline case shown in the tables assumes that stocks return 6.5% each year

and that bonds earn 3.3% each year, the assumption of the Social Security actuaries

(assuming “bonds” are a composite of government bonds and corporate bonds). This

means that the stocks earn 6.2% a year and bonds earn 3.0% a year after expenses. Note

that from the tables that the baseline case for a portfolio 100% in bonds (column 4) ends

up with a zero balance, even though the account is associated with some risk because it is

partially invested in corporate bonds.

       Table 3 shows results using U.S. historical data. In Table 4, the returns on stocks

are lowered by 2.2% a year, the difference seen in Table 1 between the U.S. data and the

rest of the world data in Dimson et al. [2002]. Figures 1 and 2 show the internal rates of

return for the baseline life-cycle portfolio by the year of retirement.

        When historical U.S. returns are used for the analysis, the baseline life-cycle

portfolio is at best disappointing, at least compared with the rhetoric that has

characterized much of the advocacy for the personal accounts. The real internal rate of

return is only 3.4% a year, only slightly above the offset rate of 3%. While the median

final portfolio value (after offset) is positive, the portfolio value is rather small, only

$15,172 (net of the reduction in the traditional benefit). The portfolio value after offset is

hardly a windfall. The lifetime annuity value of $15,172 is about $1,000 a year. Compare

this with the benefits for our "scaled medium earner." Those benefits are promised to be

$21,770 under the current schedule, are $15,934 on the "payable" baseline (which

assumes benefits are paid from payroll taxes after the trust fund is exhausted), and would

be $14,025 with price indexing. Any of these conventional Social Security benefits would

dominate the median extra annuity income created by the personal account. Moreover,

there is a substantial probability that the worker will actually lose from having

participated in the program. The portfolio minus offset winds up with negative value

(after offset) 32% of the time.

        Workers could do better, of course, if they eschewed the life cycle accounts and

went for 100% stocks. In this case (Table 3 columns 11 and 12) indeed the performance

of the personal account lives up to the kind of expectations that many recent discussions

of personal accounts have suggested. The median net account upon retirement is

$157,708, ten times as large as with the baseline life cycle account, and the internal rate

of return on participating in Social Security is 5.9%. Workers who choose the 100%

stocks option lose only 2% of the time. The internal rate of return is a little lower than the




                                               21
6.2% after expenses in the baseline case, substantially because most cohorts miss out on

the spectacular returns of the 1990s.

       Of course the outcome of a portfolio of 100% bonds, Table 3 columns 3 and 4, is

terrible. The final balance is negative 89% of the time. This is no surprise given that

bonds have performed historically less well than the 3% offset rate.

       Given that a 100% stock portfolio does not disappoint, one might be inclined to

think that an aggressive life cycle portfolio would do similarly well. The aggressive life

cycle portfolio (Table 3 columns 7 and 8) does less well assuming historical returns than

a portfolio that is 100% stocks, but still ends up with a median net account of $67,335.

There is some concern that the balance winds up negative 8% of the time.

       The conservative life cycle portfolio (Table 3 columns 5 and 6) does much less

well assuming historical returns than does the aggressive life cycle portfolio: the median

net account is a negative $9,564, and the account winds up negative 56% of the time.

The 50-50 portfolio considered by the President’s Commission is somewhere between

these two life-cycle portfolios, losing money 20% of the time.

       When we look at the more realistic case, returns adjusted for international average

returns, Table 4, all the portfolios involving stocks do less well. Notably, the baseline life

cycle portfolio now has a negative median value upon retirement, and is negative 71% of

the time. For this baseline portfolio, there is a 25% chance that the value upon retirement

is less than a negative $33,213, which would mean, assuming the payable baseline for

conventional benefits, that benefits would fall from about $16,000 a year for those who

did not participate in the personal accounts to $14,000 a year for those who did, after the

annuitized offset is subtracted.




                                             22
       Here, with the adjusted returns, the 100% stocks portfolio does only a little better

than the baseline life cycle portfolio that was shown in Table 3: the median net account is

$27,947, and the account is negative 33% of the time.

       As one might infer from the weak performance of the 100% stock portfolio, the

life cycle funds do really badly. For the aggressive life cycle fund, the median net

account is only $10,374, and the account is negative 38% of the time. For the

conservative life cycle fund, Table 4 column 7, the median account is a negative $29,212,

and the net account is negative 76% of the time.

       Why is the overall advantage to these life cycle portfolios so low? Much public

discussion has implied that, with the historical experience, we should expect great returns

from such an account.

       The most important reason for the disappointing performance of the life cycle

portfolio is just that the returns of the safer assets are below the 3% real rate used to

compute the offset. The returns on the stock market are not high enough to make the life

cycle portfolio a good investment, especially if we use the stock returns computed from

the experience of the world, as shown in Table 4.

       Moreover, with these life cycle portfolios, relatively little is contributed when the

allocation to stocks is high, since earnings are relatively low in the younger years.

Workers contribute only a little to stocks, and do not enjoy a strong effect of

compounding, since the proceeds of the early investments are taken out of the stock

market as time goes on.

       Ultimately, there is no getting around the fact that stocks are risky investments,

that the higher average return on stocks is at least in part a compensation for such risk.




                                              23
V. Which Portfolio Should Workers Choose?

        The results are disappointing for the life cycle portfolios, especially when we use

the more realistic assumption about future returns that they should match world

experience rather than the experience of the U.S. One is tempted to say that workers

should eschew the life cycle portfolio altogether, and participate only in the 100% stocks

portfolio.

        That would appear to be the correct conclusion for many workers. For example,

consider a worker who finds it difficult to invest in the stock market because of purely

psychological inhibitions, who is excessively fearful about the market, and who invests

only in an account at the local savings and loan association. Given the reassurance from

the government that the President’s plan is a good one, and given the high predicted

returns for the 100% stocks portfolio, that worker might just be tipped into electing the

personal accounts and investing in the 100% stock market portfolio. If that worker also

continues to save a lot in the savings and loan association, the worker’s overall portfolio

with the personal account 100% in stocks might represent a distinct improvement in the

overall portfolio, even if it is not a life cycle portfolio. Advisors might well not mention

the life-cycle portfolio for this worker, not only because it doesn’t look attractive enough

that the worker would really follow up and elect a personal account, but also because,

when combined with the worker’s large savings and loan account, the worker’s overall

portfolio may not have enough exposure to stocks.

       For workers who have a different sort of psychological barrier, who are unable to

save, the advice would be different. These workers will be totally dependent on the Social




                                             24
Security system for their survival. As was noted above, the offset has the effect of

drastically reducing the guaranteed conventional Social Security benefit. With any of the

life cycle accounts, and also with the 100% Social Security accounts, there is a significant

chance of loss that will be painful to bear in retirement. For these workers, given their

psychological problems, it would appear that the best advice is not to participate at all in

the personal accounts.

        If we are considering workers who are not inhibited by psychological barriers,

workers who will follow the optimal strategy, then the advice we would give would look

very different. There are two issues in considering the optimal portfolio in the President’s

plan: first, is it rational to participate in the accounts? Second, conditional on

participating in the accounts, what is the optimal portfolio?

        For such workers, who already have optimized their portfolios before being

offered the personal accounts, it is not generally rational to participate in the personal

accounts at all. Such a worker will already be diversified and will already own both

stocks and bonds. We have noted that participating in the personal account amounts to

borrowing at a 3% real rate to buy a portfolio of stocks and/or bonds. But, this worker

can already in effect borrow at a rate lower than 3%: just sell some of the bonds already

owned (which have an expected real yield less than 3%) to get the money to make the

desired adjustments in the portfolio. For example, a worker who wished to make his

portfolio riskier by investing more in stocks could just sell some of his or her bonds and

buy more stocks.13


13
  There may be a reason for some of these workers to participate in the personal accounts as a way to
lower their federal income taxes, however any such tax-avoidance motivations for participating in personal
accounts are complex to analyze, and depend not only on current tax law but also on tax laws decades into
the future. Under present tax law, workers desiring to increase their exposure to the stock market because


                                                    25
         We have seen that the safest assets available have a historical real return that is

less than 3%. Currently Treasury inflation-indexed bonds have average yields that are

below 2 percent. As a result, borrowing at 3% to invest in an asset that is yielding less

than 3% would entail serious costs.14

         But, can we advise such an optimizing worker who has already decided to invest

in a personal account what account to choose? Suppose that worker is somehow

compelled to choose the personal accounts. The worker already holds an optimally

diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds so that, on the margin, the average equity

premium was just enough to compensate risk associated with stocks. Conditional on

participating in the accounts, the rational choice would be to invest the entire portfolio in

bonds. That way the risk and return of the overall portfolio would stay essentially

unchanged. The personal account portfolio would be used merely to cancel out the debt

represented by the offset.15

         The optimizing investor would be made worse off if he or she used the personal

account to acquire more equities because he or she is already just at the point where the




of anticipated high returns on stocks would do better to sell some bonds and put the proceeds in a Roth
IRA, which is not subject to taxation at the end as Social Security benefits often are.
          If the individual held no bonds at all and wished to go even more heavily into stocks, he or she
could make use of margin lending facilities currently available to the public from brokerage firms,
bypassing the personal accounts. Here, however, the real margin rate is unlikely to be as low as 3% except
for large accounts.
14
   Some rational constrained investors might choose to participate. For example, someone who is invested
100% in stocks, has such high return expectations for stocks that 100% appears too low, and does not have
alternative borrowing opportunities at less than a 3% real rate, would choose to participate.
15
   Technically, the individual could not perfectly offset the effects of participating in the personal accounts,
since the real borrowing rate of 3% does not exactly match, and is likely to exceed, the return obtainable by
investing in bonds. Still, if compelled to participate, the best thing to do, to a first approximation from a
risk-management perspective, would be to swallow the loss and invest in bonds. Note that the worker could
also choose to invest the personal account 100% in stocks and at the same time sell stocks in his or her
brokerage account, substituting bonds for stocks in the brokerage account so that the overall portfolio,
brokerage account and personal account together, remain unchanged. Which assets are in the personal
account and which in the brokerage account will not matter, except for possible tax effects.


                                                      26
additional risks associated with equities outweigh the higher returns associated with

equities.



VI. Interpretation of Results and Conclusions

           The simulations presented in Tables 3 and 4 showed a disappointing outlook for

investors in the personal accounts relative to the rhetoric of their promoters. I think that

the disappointment may be even greater than the tables indicate. The simulations

depended on the historical experience of either the United States or the rest of the world

for over a century. While a century may seem like a long enough sample period to prove

any point, in fact even with a century of data we do not know the true probability

distribution of future returns. The twenty-first century may differ fundamentally from the

twentieth. Moreover, whenever we look at long historical data on stock markets, we are

of course looking at survivors, stock markets that made it, and ignoring countries where

conditions turned out so badly that we get little or no stock market data.16 Obviously,

Russia and China were not in Dimson et al. for their century-long data set. While it is

highly unlikely that the particular upheavals that hit Russia and China in the twentieth

century will repeat themselves in the U.S. in the twenty-first century, it should be

remembered that nobody predicted in 1900 the kind of upheavals that were to follow in

Russia or China. Similarly, it is difficult for us to imagine all the different kinds of things

that might disrupt stock market performance in the future. Thus, there is additional

uncertainty, uncertainty of regime change or model uncertainty or survivorship bias, that

should ideally be taken into account. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any

objective way of quantifying this additional uncertainty about the future.

           We are living in the aftermath of the spectacular stock market boom of the 1990s,

a boom that generated irrational exuberance about the outlook for the stock market. A

public attitude of exaggerated expectations about the stock market is still with us, and

probably accounts for a good portion of the support for personal accounts.

           In thinking about the redesign of Social Security, it would be better to get away

from thinking about chasing past returns and instead focus more on the theoretical

fundamentals that underlie Social Security. From this perspective, the government’s

offering margin credit to the general public, thereby duplicating a service that is already

available from the private sector, should not be the focal point of discussions. There are

some important theoretical justifications for the government’s providing a Social Security

system, if not margin credit.

           Notably, a justification for a pay-as-you-go Social Security system is that the

private sector cannot allow people to share risks across generations effectively, since

children, and unborn future children, cannot make financial contracts. We could redesign

the existing Social Security system to do a better job of managing such intergenerational

risk than it does today. 17 But this justification for Social Security would not appear to

offer a reason for the government to get involved in margin lending.

           The intergenerational-risk-sharing justification for Social Security is so strong and

palpable that it is likely to trump any effort to design it along different lines. That is, a

design that imposes risks rather than reduces risks will ultimately be discarded. In fact,

people likely know this and will likely use this information in their choice of personal

accounts. Many people will probably choose the 100% stocks portfolio, thinking that it

                                                     28
might do very well, and that if it does poorly, the government will probably change the

program and bail out the losers.

       In any event, the 3% real offset rate appears to be too high, and if the program is

instituted, it should be done with a lower rate. If the offset rate were lowered from 3%

per annum to 2%, it would shift the net values of the accounts at retirement shown in

Tables 3 and 4 up by $30,322 the difference between the real offset cumulated at 3% and

the real offset cumulated at 2%, generally making the median net values positive. Better

yet, the offset could be cumulated at a market rate. The offset could be calculated as the

terminal value of the contributions brought to the final date using actual U.S. Treasury

Inflation Protected Security (TIPS) yields of the appropriate maturity.

       Reducing the offset rate would move the distribution of the returns to the right,

but of course would will do nothing to reduce the uncertainty of the returns that we saw

in Tables 3 and 4. Even with an offset rate of 2%, the baseline personal account net value

at retirement as simulated with adjusted historical returns (shown in Column 1 of Table

4) would still be negative over 25% of the time.

       Note that the personal account plan does nothing directly to improve the saving

rate, or to make the economy grow faster. It might possibly increase the saving rate, if the

experience of being invested in the financial markets and having made choices among

investment accounts stimulates people to think more favorably about investing. But, the

personal accounts might also have the perverse effect of lowering saving rates if people’s

perception that they have money in the stock market that is going to make them rich some

day discourages them from saving on their own outside Social Security. Psychologists

have documented a “wishful thinking bias” that encourages people to think that their own




                                            29
team will win the game or their own candidate will win the election; the same tendency

might encourage personal account holders towards great expectations for their account.

The experience of crashing saving rates in the U.S. at the same time as the stock market

boomed in the last two decades suggests that the latter outcome might be more

significant.

        If the personal accounts do not raise saving rates and do not make the economy

grow faster, then the accounts will not increase opportunities for aggregate consumption.

Any increase in consumption that is provided to some people must come one way or

another from others. The argument is sometimes made that the President’s plan cannot be

a bad idea because it merely expands people’s choice set and so anyone can choose not to

participate. But this is not valid. Those who choose not to participate in the program are

still affected by it. The program will affect them through prices in the stock market; the

personal accounts program could have the effect of causing speculative demand to bid up

the stock market in the short run, followed by a crash in the longer run, an outcome that

would help and hurt people both in and out of the personal accounts depending on the

timing of their exposure to stock market risk that they chose.

        The President’s Social Security plan might be described as a plan to allow small

investors to use their expected future Social Security benefits as collateral for margin

loans, offering a plan at such a large scale that economies of scale reduce administrative

costs, and streamlining the program so that workers do not impose costs by expecting the

kind of services they get from brokers, thereby making it possible for the government to

charge a lower rate for margin loans than is available in the private market today. If the

government does this it will not be met with unmitigated enthusiasm from the brokerage

community: providing a lower rate puts the government program in competition with

private margin lenders, who do not offer such attractive margin rates to small accounts.

More importantly, perhaps, if the government offers a lower rate on the offset balance

then the government will be losing an opportunity to lower its long-term budget deficit.

The present plan saves the government money by lending to individuals at a rate that is

higher than the real rate at which the government can borrow money.

       We have seen that the President’s plan might well help some people (the example

given was people who have savings but, because of psychological obstacles, are too

conservatively invested) but may hurt other people (the example given was people who

have no savings and who might invest their personal accounts in too risky a manner).

Thus, the personal account is a blunt tool. It would seem to be a better plan if the

government merely subsidized personal financial advisors, making it cheaper for people

to get financial advice that is really appropriate for their own economic circumstances.

Today, most people get no significant professional help with their investments. With

proper financial advice people could also make use of some better choices among their

personal accounts, such as choices designed to hedge their labor income or home value.

       Much of the design of Social Security also depends on the need to design around

human foibles, and to provide public goods that might help them out of their errors. The

failure of many people to save at all for their retirement is one such foible, and ultimately

our society feels a need to protect such people. More broadly, a failure of many people to

embrace capitalist institutions, to learn about investing and about the benefits of

ownership, may also be a factor justifying actions from a government that provides an

educational service that will not be provided privately because it is a public good.

       One might justify government intervention to help people deal with these

psychological failures, and this is indeed part of the justification of the President’s

ownership society. The personal accounts may indeed help achieve this, even if they are

probably not the ideal vehicle for this purpose.

       But to say that there is a money machine in the stock market, that it can be tapped

to yield great wealth without significant risk if one uses life-cycle investment methods, is

a big mistake. The stock market is an uncertain place, and even if the risk is effectively

managed over the life cycle, important uncertainty remains.
