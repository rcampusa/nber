Not Just the Great Contraction: Friedman and Schwartz’s A Monetary History of the United
States 1867 to 1960

                                             ABSTRACT

A Monetary History of the United States 1867 to 1960 published in 1963 was written as part of an
extensive NBER research project on Money and Business Cycles started in the 1950s. The project
resulted in three more books and many important articles. A Monetary History was designed to provide
historical evidence for the modern quantity theory of money. The principal lessons of the modern quantity
theory of the long-run neutrality of money, the transitory effects of monetary policy on real economic
activity, and the importance of stable money and of monetary rules have all been absorbed in modern
macro models. A Monetary History , unlike the other books, has endured the test of time and has become
a classic whose reputation has grown with age. It succeeded because it was based on narrative and
not an explicit model. The narrative methodology pioneered by Friedman and Schwartz and the beautifully
written story still captures the imaginations of new generations of economists.

Not Just the Great Contraction: Friedman and Schwartz’s A Monetary History of the

United States 1867 to 19601




Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz (afterwards FS) published A Monetary History of the
United States 1867 to 1960 (afterwards AMH) with Princeton University Press in 1963 to critical
acclaim. Many leading economists of the day including Sir Roy Harrod, James Tobin, Robert
Clower, Karl Brunner and Allan Meltzer wrote glowing reviews but all of course had issues of
disagreement. Its contribution after twenty five years was assessed in an NBER conference in
honor of Anna Schwartz (Bordo 1989) and after thirty years in a Symposium of the Journal of
Monetary Economics (1994) with articles by Robert Lucas, Jeffrey Miron and Bruce Smith.
       The book has been heavily cited by economists, economic historians, journalists and
policy makers since its publication. Indeed Ben Bernanke, then a Governor of the Fed told
Milton Friedman at his 90th birthday party at the University of Chicago “I would like to say to
Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression. You’re right. We did it. We’re very sorry.
But thanks to you, we won’t do it again” (Bernanke 2002b). He was referring to the indictment
of the Fed in chapter 7 of AMH for causing the Great Contraction of 1929 to 1933 by not using
their policy tools to offset four devastating banking panics from 1930-1933.The book is easily
one of the most influential volumes in economics in the twentieth century.
       The collaboration by FS that led to AMH was part of the NBER’s project on Money and
Business Cycles started in the 1950s.This project resulted in two more books by FS: Monetary
Statistics of the United States (1970) and Monetary Trends in the United States and United
Kingdom (1982), several important articles including “Money and Business Cycles” (1963a) and
Philip Cagan’s The Determinants and Effects of Changes in the Stock of Money (1965). This
project fit solidly into the Bureau tradition which emphasized the gathering of new data,
particularly monthly data. One of the most enduring products of the project was FS’s new
estimates of the stock of money. These estimates have been widely used by both supporters and
critics of the story told in AMH, and by macro-economists exploring completely different

avenues of research. The Bureau tradition, reflecting the views of its founder Wesley Clair
Mitchell, moreover, stressed that the business cycle was a complex product of numerous factors
that had to be investigated one by one by a collective of scholars. Friedman and Schwartz’s
assignment, so to speak, was to tease out the effects of money on the business cycle (Rockoff
2010).
         The theoretical background for the project was Friedman’s “Restatement of the Quantity
Theory of Money” (1956) which was intended to be a counterfoil to the then prevailing
Keynesian paradigm. At the time, a common, although by no means universal, view among
Keynesian economists was that monetary policy had very little influence on the economy.
Increases in the money supply might lower interest rates, but only a bit, and lower interest rates
might stimulate investment spending, but only a bit. Any correlation between money and
economic activity reflected mainly a causal path from income to money or a common third factor
that affected both. AMH changed the way most economists thought about monetary policy. What
came to be called the Neo-Keynesian consensus put considerable weight on monetary policy and
owed a great deal to AMH.
         The key propositions of the modern quantity theory were that: based on the interaction
between a stable long run demand for money and an independently determined money supply, a
change in the rate of growth in the money supply would produce a corresponding but lagged
change in the growth of nominal income. In the short-run changes in money would produce
changes in real output; in the long run changes in money would be fully reflected in changes in
the price level. In modern terms, monetary changes would temporarily impact real output
reflecting nominal rigidities but ultimately the growth of real output is independent of monetary
forces and monetary neutrality would prevail.
         AMH was designed to provide long-run historical evidence for the modern quantity
theory (with the underlying statistics presented in Monetary Statistics), Money and Business
Cycles was to provide short-run cycle evidence, and Monetary Trends was to provide long–run
econometric evidence. Of all these efforts only AMH and Monetary Statistics have survived the
test of time.

                                  I. The Narrative Approach

Milton Friedman outlined the methodology that he and Anna Schwartz would employ in AMH –
what has come to be called “the narrative approach” – in his classic paper “The Methodology of
Positive Economics (1953).” To illustrate the importance of natural experiments Friedman
(1953, 11) turned to monetary history:

        “Occasionally, experience casts up evidence that is about as direct, dramatic, and
       convincing as any that could be provided by controlled experiments. Perhaps the most
       obviously important example is the evidence from inflations on the hypothesis that a
       substantial increase in the quantity of money within a relatively short period is
       accompanied by a substantial increase in prices. Here the evidence is dramatic, and the
       chain of reasoning required to interpret it is relatively short. Yet, despite numerous
       instances of substantial rises in prices, their essentially one-to-one correspondence with
       substantial rises in the stock of money, and the wide variation in other circumstances that
       might appear to be relevant, each new experience of inflation brings forth vigorous
       contentions, and not only by the lay public, that the rise in the stock of money is either an
       incidental effect of a rise in prices produced by other factors or a purely fortuitous and
       unnecessary concomitant of the price rise.”



The phrase “wide variation in other circumstances that might appear to be relevant” deserves
attention. In any one inflationary episode there will be non-monetary forces at work that some
observers will claim caused the inflation: wartime mobilization, government deficits, union
militancy, shocks to the supply of crucial raw materials, and so on. The economist needs to
examine those factors, and see how they varied across historical episodes. If the generalization
that money causes inflation holds across episodes, even as other factors vary, there is compelling
evidence for it. The quotation also illustrates another hallmark of Friedman’s methodology: the
importance of a “short chain of reasoning.” The goal of science is to explain much with little;
Occam’s razor must be wielded ruthlessly. Thus, Friedman’s essay anticipates the main mission
of AMH: to show that in a long series of examples, stretching across very different monetary
regimes, the relationships between money, prices, and output suggested by basic economic
theory continue to hold.
       An overview of some of the evidence that is examined in AMH can be seen in Figure 1
which compares the rate of change of money per unit of output and the rate of change of prices
in 11 monetary regimes stretching from the end of the Civil War to 2012. During the greenback

                                                 4
era from the end of the Civil War until 1879 the United States was on a floating exchange rate.
The growth of high powered money was determined internally. And the rate was low because the
federal government followed a policy of letting the economy “grow up to the currency.” The
resulting deflation was necessary so that the United States could rejoin the gold standard at the
prewar parity. Once the United States returned to gold, the sources of the increase in the stock of
money were different. Under the gold standard the stock of high-powered money was the
product of net international transactions and domestic mining. From 1879 until 1896 the money
supply grew relatively slowly producing a mild deflation. Then the supply of gold increased due
to discoveries in a number of countries, most importantly South Africa, and the development of
the new cyanide process for extracting gold from ore, a crucial development for the South
African industry: clearly exogenous shocks that the narrative approach was able to identify. The
acceleration in the growth rate of money was not dramatic, but was sufficient to turn a secular
decline in prices into a secular advance. This was a persuasive natural experiment: an increase in
the stock of money that was unplanned by any government authority, but rather the result of
exogenous events, had produced the consequences predicted by the quantity theory of money.
       With the founding of the Fed in 1913, the monetary system changed again. Now, the
amount of high-powered money was controlled by the Fed. Gold flows could affect the stock,
but the Fed had considerable power to neutralize those flows. During World War I, the Fed
became subservient to the Treasury, buying debt in order to keep nominal interest rates low and
stable. The same was true in World War II, and the two wars together became further grist for
the mill (Friedman 1952; AMH 1963b, 567-71). As shown in Figure 1, inflation proceeded at a
somewhat slower pace in World War II than in World War I. Yet World War II was by many
measures the more intense conflict: the period of active engagement was longer, the casualty rate
was higher, and federal deficits were larger relative to GDP. Part of the difference between the
wars was that money per unit of output grew more slowly in World War II than in World War I
for a variety of reasons related to the behavior patterns of the banks and the public with respect
to money. In the last period examined in AMH, which we have designated Postwar in figure 1,
the United States returned to a regime of slow growth in money per unit of output and inflation.
       We have added three regimes that were not covered in AMH: the Great Inflation (1965-
82), the Great Moderation (1982-2008), and the Great Recession (2008-2012). The Great
Inflation was the product of a number of factors; an important part of the story was a change in

                                                 5
policy objectives at the Fed that made achieving and maintaining low unemployment the top
priority. This policy was reversed under Fed Chairman Paul Volcker. Slower monetary growth
per unit of output during the Great Moderation appears to have contributed to the slowing of
inflation from about 6 per cent per year from 1965 to 1982 to about 2.5 percent per year from
1982 to 2008. The monetary regime changed because the Fed was persuaded to put greater
emphasis on price stability. The main reason was that the public was frightened by inflation and
demanded action to stop it. But some of the credit for the change in the policy regime must go to
the monetarists and to AMH. Figure 1 includes the Great Recession (2008 to 2012) in order to
contrast it with the Great Depression. One can see immediately that over the course of the Great
Depression money per unit of output grew at a very low rate and that prices declined. During the
Great Recession money per unit of output has grown far more rapidly and inflation has continued
despite the economic slowdown. Most likely the greater increase in the stock of money relative
to output helps account for the relative mildness of the Great Recession. Again the improvement
in policy rests in part on the lessons taught by AMH.
       AMH discusses many natural experiments that occurred over shorter intervals than a
“monetary regime.” The sharp increases in the Fed’s discount rate in 1920, when the Fed tried to
end inflation; in 1928, when the Fed tried to discourage stock market speculation; and in 1931,
when the Fed jacked up the discount rate to protect its gold reserves while ignoring a banking
panic; in each case undermining the economy, are important examples. Another example that has
garnered considerable attention in recent years was the decision by the Fed to double required
reserves in a series of steps in 1936-37 in order, the Fed believed, to lock up potentially
inflationary excess reserves (AMH 1963b, 520-7). AMH (1963b, 544) concluded that the decline
in the stock of money that resulted from this decision – and the “equally important” Treasury
gold-sterilization program – “significantly intensified the severity of the decline [in economic
activity] and also probably caused it to occur earlier than otherwise.” Of course, it was not a
laboratory experiment. For one thing, fiscal policy was also changing. Taxes increased, partly
because the new Social Security Tax came on line; and spending declined, mainly because the
one-time veteran’s bonus ran its course. As a result, the budget deficit fell from 4.4 billion in
1936 to 1.2 billion in 1938 (Carter et al 2006, series Ea586). But the episode was, nevertheless,
another piece of evidence consistent with the view that money matters.



                                                  6
          AMH is usually remembered today because of chapter 7, The Great Contraction, in
which the authors carefully show how the Fed, which was designed to prevent a repeat of the
banking panics of the National Banking era, failed to prevent four major banking panics from
producing a monetary collapse leading to the worst recession in U.S. history. Some readers of
chapter 7 have been frustrated by what seemed to them to be an attempt by AMH to assume the
relationship between monetary events and the severity of the Depression rather than to prove it.
But a causal relationship between money and income cannot be established in one chapter about
one period in monetary history. One set of natural experiments, however suggestive, cannot
prove that money matters; the proof comes from the weight of all the evidence. That evidence
includes some experiments that fell within the period 1929-1939, but many more that fell outside
it.
          AMH, we should emphasize, did not espouse a monocausal explanation of the business
cycle. In the course of their narrative FS drew attention to many non-monetary factors that they
believed had influenced the business cycle, although they did not investigate them systematically
across time. For example, FS (1963b, 307) thought that the 1929 stock market crash had “made
the decline in income sharper than it otherwise would have been.” And in explaining the
incompleteness of the recovery in the 1930s, FS turned to a non-monetary explanation that has
reemerged recently to explain the slow recovery from the current recession (Ohanian and Taylor
2012). Here they endorsed the view of Kenneth D. Roose (1954) that “Business confidence,”
and as a result business investment, had been weakened by increased regulation, the expansion of
government activities into areas traditionally reserved for private enterprise, measures that
threatened the sanctity of private property, Roosevelt’s attack on the “economic royalists,” and
so on (FS 1963b, 495-96).
          A wave of research was triggered by Peter Temin’s (1976) revival of a Keynesian
explanation of the Great Depression In 1976.2 Since then a new generation of economic
historians have mined the details of chapter 7 unearthing new data sources and revising or
reconfirming the old masters (e.g. Calomiris and Mason 2003, Richardson and Troost 2009,
Bordo and Landon-Lane 2010).
          The key finding of AMH, to sum up, is that the money-income relationship is invariant to
changing monetary arrangements and banking structures. Although FS identify an influence from

2
    See (Bordo 1986) for a survey of the literature on the Temin debate.
                                                  7
income to money over the business cycle, they argue that the main influence both cyclically and
secularly runs from money to nominal income. Of special importance is the evidence they give
on monetary disturbances: sharp declines in output were precipitated by sharp reductions in
money supply, while episodes of sustained inflation were invariably produced by the growth of
money in excess of the growth of real income. In both types of disturbances, the historical record
provides instances where inappropriate actions by the monetary authorities were to blame. Thus
the Great Contraction of 1929-33 was a consequence of an unprecedented collapse in the stock
of money that the Fed could have prevented, while episodes of inflation during the World Wars
were products of wartime issues of fiat money.
       The narrative approach of AMH took time to gain traction. In his admiring, although also
critical review of AMH, James Tobin (1965) conceded that FS had “identified some convincing
examples of monetary changes that were clearly independent of contemporary or immediately
preceding economic events,” and he was “willing to agree that these monetary events contributed
in important degree to the economic events which followed.” But in later work Tobin (1970)
focused on timing evidence as the key data for establishing a causal relationship between money
and income. In his reply to Tobin Friedman (1970, 320) pointed to the weight that he and Mrs.
Schwartz placed on historical evidence. He conceded that “It may be that in the early years of my
work on money, I regarded the lead of money at peaks and troughs as decisive evidence of the
independent influence of money.” But he went on to argue that for at least a decade prior to 1970
he was fully aware of the limitations of timing evidence, and rather was examining such
evidence to determine the leads and lags that could be used to formulate policies and make
predictions (Friedman 1970, 322). A short and consistent lag would point to leaving monetary
policy to the discretion of the Fed; the long and variable lag that FS found pointed toward a
monetary rule.
       The narrative approach pioneered by AMH to isolate independent sources of monetary
change was picked up by later macroeconomists as a way to solve the identification problem in
macroeconomic models. In his remarks on Milton Friedman’s ninetieth birthday Ben Bernanke
(2002b) explained how FS use natural experiments to solve the identification problem in
monetary economics, and how after reading AMH as a graduate student at M.I.T. he became
hooked on monetary economics and economic history. Romer and Romer (1989), however, are
critical of FS for not clearly demarcating their identification strategy and for picking dates which

                                                 8
may have been tainted by endogenous feedback from the real economy. They extend the FS
strategy to the Post World War II era using FOMC minutes to identify episodes of deliberate Fed
tightening to offset inflation. Miron (1994) and Lucas (1994) both praise FS for the narrative
approach as breathing new life into macroeconomics.




            II. The Continuing Influence of AMH on the Monetary Policy Debate.


         The wide ranging discussions in AMH have been an inspiration to generations of macro-
economists and economic historians. Their discussions of the determinants of the exchange rate
under the greenback standard, the possible effects of a switch to a bimetallic regime in the 1890s,
the effects of the issue of the Aldrich-Vreeland emergency currency in 1914, the reasons for the
decision not to bail out the Bank of United States when it failed in 1930, the experiences of
countries that departed sooner from the gold standard during the 1930s compared with countries
that adhered for a longer period, and the impact of New Deal financial reforms on the stability of
the banking system, to name only a few, have spawned substantial literatures. AMH, moreover,
continues to play an important role in recent debates over monetary policy issues. We briefly
mention some of them.

The Great Depression versus the Great Recession. The Great Recession of 2007-2009 has
been compared to the Great Depression 1929-33. Many argued that the virulent nature of the
collapse in real economic activity and its global reach had considerable resonance with the Great
Contraction (e.g. Eichengreen and O’Rourke 2009), and the global liquidity panic of 2008
evoked memories of 1931 (e.g. Bordo and James 2010). It was also argued that the Great
Recession did not become a Great Contraction because the Fed and other central banks learned
the lessons of AMH and flooded the financial markets with liquidity (Bordo and Landon-Lane
2010).

Banking Panics versus Bank Insolvency. FS in chapter 7 described the first Banking Crisis of
the Great Contraction in October 1931 as a panic reflected in a large drop in the public’s deposit-
currency ratio. It was transmitted from its origin in the Midwest to the rest of the nation by “a
contagion of fear”. They also refer to the events in the spring of 1931, the fall of 1931, and early

                                                 9
1933 as banking panics. Temin (1976) and White (1984) argued that the banking crisis of 1930
was really a solvency event driven by the collapse of economic activity since August 1929. This
solvency view gained traction in the work of Wicker (1996) and more recently Calomiris and
Mason (2003) and Hetzel (2012). Bordo and Landon-Lane (2010) present econometric evidence
reconfirming the FS story. In the recent crisis Schwartz (2009) criticized the Fed and other
central banks for failing to recognize that the main problem facing the banking system in 2008
was the inability to distinguish solvent from insolvent institutions.

Good versus Bad Deflation. The Fed in 2002-2006 followed a very expansionary monetary
policy based on negative deviations of its policy rate from the Taylor Rule (Taylor 2007). It did
this because of the fear of the then very low inflation rate spiraling into a 1930s type debt
deflation or a Japan in the 1990s style stagnation. Research by Bordo and Filardo (2004) and
Bordo, Landon-Lane, and Redish (2008) looked back to the discussion in AMH chapter 3 on the
deflation of 1879-1896 when real output grew at a rate as least as rapidly as in the subsequent
episode of low inflation of 1897-1914. In that episode classified as Good Deflation, the price
decline reflected a positive aggregate supply shift reflecting rapid productivity growth. By
contrast the Bad Deflation of the 1930s reflected a collapse in aggregate demand driven by the
events described in AMH.

The Zero Lower Bound. Research at the Fed in the early 2000s on the potential challenge for
the use of the conventional short–term interest rate policy tool posed by very low inflation and
interest rates close to zero has resonance to AMH treatment of the low interest rates in the 1930s
in chapter 8 (Eggertson and Woodford 2003; Coenen, Orphanides, and Wieland 2004). By 2008
the zero lower bound constraint on the use of conventional monetary policy was reached. The
Bernanke Fed, taking a page from AMH’s discussion of the expansionary gold and silver
purchase programs of the US Treasury in 1933-34, where FS argued that the Fed itself should
have conducted expansionary open market purchases, engaged in a massive unconventional
monetary policy action – open market purchases of long term government bonds and mortgage




                                                 10
backed securities – in December 20093. Some argue that these actions may have attenuated the
contraction (Hetzel 2012).

Rules versus Discretion. Friedman (1959), following a long Chicago tradition, made the case
for following his constant money growth rate rule rather than central bank discretion. The
experience of the Great Contraction described in AMH, as well as many other episodes where
Fed stabilization policy backfired, provides historical evidence for his case. Warburton (1966)
and later Bordo, Choudhri, and Schwartz (1995) and McCallum (1990) demonstrated how
following a Friedman style monetary rule would have avoided most of the Great Contraction.

Fiscal Dominance. In the recent financial crisis the Fed engaged in discount window policies
referred to by Goodfriend (2012) as credit policies. It also worked closely with the Treasury in
the bailouts of both financial and non-financial firms. These operations are examples of fiscal
rather than monetary policy. FS in AMH chapters 8 and 9 analyze the experience of the 1930s
and 1940s when the Fed lost its independence and the Fed followed a low interest rate policy at
the Treasury’s behest. The Fed became an engine of inflation which only ended when its
independence was restored after the 1951 Fed-Treasury Accord. There is concern that these
events may be repeated.

Expectations. There are many instances in AMH where the state of expectations is a key
determinant of economic outcomes. The best example is the analysis in chapter 3 of the impact
of the Free Silver Movement. The Bland Allison Act of 1878 and the Sherman Silver Purchase
Act of 1893 were feared by many to be precursors of inflation because the US would be forced
off the gold standard. The outcome according to FS was more deflation than would otherwise
have been the case triggered by capital flight. The FS analysis in this episode has resonance with
the peso problem in the literature on emerging market financial crises in the 1980s and 1990s
(See Hallwood, Marsh and Macdonald 2000).

Other Issues. Many important issues relevant to current policy are not covered in AMH
although they are treated by FS in later work. Chief among these issues are the Phillips Curve
Tradeoff which was the subject of Friedman’s famous 1968 AEA lecture and the distinction
3
 FS did not explicitly discuss unconventional monetary policy action. Friedman’s (1969)
discussion of a helicopter dropping money has been used to justify such actions (Bernanke
2002a).
                                                11
between nominal and real interest rates which had a prominent place in Monetary Trends.
Friedman’s case against the gold standard is also not dealt with directly in AMH but was in A
Program for Monetary Stability (1959) and in his essay on ”Real Versus Pseudo Gold
Standards” (1961).The issue of free banking versus central banking is also not explicitly
discussed by FS in AMH but appeared in their 1986 JME article. Friedman’s case against
Keynesian economics, which is largely based on the evidence in AMH, is also developed later in
his work with David Meiselman (1965) and in his debate with his critics in Gordon (1974). Thus,
in many respects AMH, and subsequent work by FS based on AMH, are like the Bible. If you
look hard enough you can find insightful references to most of the salient issues in modern
macroeconomics.

                                          III. Conclusion

AMH is a classic whose reputation has grown with age. It was written as part of a research
program which involved several other major books and journal articles. All of the other
publications have been virtually forgotten. Why has AMH endured? We think the answer is that
AMH is based on narrative and not an explicit model. It was designed to provide evidence for the
modern quantity theory of money. The principle lessons of the modern quantity theory of the
long run neutrality of money, the transitory effects of monetary policy on real activity, and the
importance of stable money and of monetary rules have all been absorbed in modern macro
models. Indeed the narrative methodology pioneered by FS and the beautifully written story still
capture the imaginations of new generations of economists. Its lessons, especially in chapter 7,
have also influenced modern central bankers. As Lucas (1994, 8) said “If I ever go to
Washington for some other reason than viewing cherry blossoms, I will pack my copy of AMH
and leave the rest of my library—well most of it—at home”. In the recent crisis it seems that
many of our policy makers followed his advice but not fully.
