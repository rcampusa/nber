                                               ABSTRACT

Economic variables are known to move asymmetrically over the business cycle: quickly and sharply
during crises, but slowly and gradually during recoveries. Not known is the fact that this asymmetry
is stronger in countries with less-developed financial systems. This new fact is documented using cross-country
data on loan interest rates, investment, and output. The fact is then explained using a learning model
with endogenous flows of information about economic conditions. Asymmetry is shown to be stronger
in less-developed countries because these countries have greater financial frictions, which are captured
in the model by higher monitoring and bankruptcy costs. These greater frictions magnify the crisis
reactions of lending rates and economic activity to shocks and then delay their recovery by restricting
the generation of information after the crisis. Empirical evidence and a quantitative exploration of
the model show that this explanation is consistent with the data.

1    Introduction

Economic variables are known to move asymmetrically during the bad and good phases of a
business cycle: quickly and sharply during recessions, but slowly and gradually during recov-
eries. Interest rates on loans, for example, tend to rise quickly during a crisis, but fall slowly
and gradually during a recovery; investment and output tend to move in the opposite direc-
tions, but with the same asymmetry – falling sharply during a crisis and recovering slowly.
This asymmetry has been observed worldwide in most business cycles. In Mexico’s 1994-95
crisis, for example, real lending rates rose 70 percentage points in just four months and invest-
ment and output per capita dropped 35% and 17%, respectively, in three quarters. Recovery of
these variables took much longer: lending rates did not reach pre-crisis levels for 30 months;
investment, for two years; and output, for almost three years.1

Understanding the sources of this asymmetry would seem critical to minimizing lengthy pro-
cesses of financial distress and the inefficient resource allocation inherent to lengthly recover-
ies.2 Not surprisingly, then, many studies have offered explanations for this asymmetry.3

No one, however, has yet systematically examined how this business cycle asymmetry differs
across countries. I do that here using standard datasets and discover a new fact: the asymmet-
ric movements of lending rates, investment and output are stronger in less-developed coun-
tries, those with weaker financial systems. I also propose an explanation for this new fact: The
stronger asymmetry in less-developed countries stems from their greater financial frictions,
which restrict the flow of information in an economy, delaying recoveries.

I introduce a form of these frictions into a learning model with endogenous flows of informa-
tion. Commonly in such models, the degree of precision of observed information depends on
the level of economic activity, which varies in good and bad times, thus generating asymmet-
ric lending rates (Veldkamp (2005)) and asymmetric economic activity (Van Nieuwerburgh and
    1
      There are many other examples. In Brazil, just in October 1997, real lending rates rose from 71% to 98%, taking
10 months to return to pre-crisis levels. The first quarter of 1998, investment and GDP per capita declined 9% and
8% respectively, taking more than 2 years to return to pre-crisis levels. In Indonesia, the 8 months following the
Asian crisis witnessed a rise in real lending rates from 18% to 35%, taking 24 months to recover. In that case, both
investment and GDP per capita declined almost 50% in 1998, recovering in more than 8 years. In Russia, during
April and May of 1998, real lending rates rose from 30% to 150%, taking 27 months to recover, while GDP per capita
declined 12% in one quarter, recovering in more than 2 years.
    2
      The negative impact of lengthy recoveries in terms of misallocations has been discussed by Bergoeing, Loayza,
and Repetto (2004), while the sizable macroeconomic effects of those misallocations have been estimated by Hsieh
and Klenow (2009) and calibrated by Restuccia and Rogerson (2008) and Buera, Kaboski, and Shin (2011).
    3
      Veldkamp (2005) studies asymmetries of lending rates while Van Nieuwerburgh and Veldkamp (2006) and
Jovanovic (2006) focus on asymmetries of real activity. The bulk of the literature, however, has focused on expla-
nations of asymmetries in stock markets. Banerjee (1992), Welch (1992) and Banerjee and Newman (1993) explain
crashes as the result of herd behavior and information cascades. Jacklin, Kleidon, and Pfleiderer (1992) use a port-
folio insurance model of stock market crashes. Allen, Morris, and Shin (2006) study information-based bubbles.
Finally, Zeira (1994, 1999) proposes an informational overshooting to explain booms and crashes in stock prices.

Veldkamp (2006)). These models, however, assume frictionless environments in which lenders
and borrowers have symmetric information about both aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks. In
my model, I assume asymmetric information about idiosyncratic shocks; they are observable
to borrowers for free and observable to lenders only at a cost. I show that the financial frictions
created by this costly state verification increase the asymmetry in the movements of lending
rates, investment, and output.

The basic setting of my model is straightforward: entrepreneurs can start a venture only if
they borrow funds. Whether they borrow or not, and how much they borrow, depend on
prevailing lending rates, which are set by lenders based on their overall expectations about
ventures succeeding and entrepreneurs repaying. These expectations depend on signals from
previous ventures: if many have succeeded, then the economy is more likely to be in good
times, or in a state in which entrepreneurs have low probability of defaulting on their loans.

In a standard setting like this, without financial frictions, whether a venture succeeds or fails is
perfectly observed. When lenders think the state is good, they charge low rates, entrepreneurs
borrow to start a lot of ventures, and thus, as loans are repaid, a lot of signals about the state
of the economy are generated. When the state changes to bad, so that ventures have a lower
probability of success, the signals of many failed ventures allow lenders to easily infer that
conditions have changed, and they raise rates quickly, to account for the higher probability of
default. Thus, in bad times, rates are high, and there is not much borrowing. When the state
changes back to good, therefore, the limited number of existing ventures offers few signals
about the switch; lenders learn about it slowly and reduce rates only gradually. This endoge-
nous learning process is what generates asymmetric movements of lending rates, translating
into asymmetric movements of investment and output.

To study the role of financial frictions on this asymmetry, I replace the standard assumption
of symmetric information with an assumption of asymmetric information. I assume that bor-
rowers know the result of a venture, but lenders can learn about it only by incurring positive
costs. This asymmetric information induces borrowers to falsely renege on their loans, or to
report successful ventures as failures. To motivate borrower truth-telling, lenders must spend
resources to verify reports of failures and pursue defaults to bankruptcy. These monitoring
and bankruptcy costs represent measures of how costly it is to overcome financial frictions.

The addition of these extra costs is reflected in the greater asymmetry in environments with
frictions. The monitoring and bankruptcy costs increase lending rates, especially when the
economy is moving from good times to bad. As this happens, reported failures increase, so
lenders raise rates to take account of the larger probability of default. The higher expected
monitoring and bankruptcy costs, that is, magnify the rate rise compared to that in a friction-
less setting, depressing economic activity even further. Thus, as times turn good again, fewer

                                                 2
signals about conditions are generated, and the learning that fuels recoveries is slower. The
larger rise in lending rates combined with their slower recovery means greater asymmetry in
the movements of lending rates and economic activity in economies with frictions.

I reach these conclusions by exploring the role of financial frictions on asymmetry in two ver-
sion of the model. First I construct a simple partial equilibrium model with exogenous default
rates, an exogenous price of capital, exogenous loan sizes, and no consumption-smoothing.
My purpose here is primarily to illustrate the learning mechanism I have described. Yet I find
that a calibrated version of this model is quantitatively consistent with my documented new
fact: reasonable levels of monitoring and bankruptcy costs roughly predict the empirical cross-
country differences in asymmetry.

In order to better assess the quantitative implications of my explanation, I extend the simple
partial equilibrium version of the model into a general equilibrium version. I impose risk shocks
to the cross-sectional variance of productivity; endogenize default rates, capital prices, and
loans; and allow for consumption-smoothing. A calibrated version of this extended model
does a better job than the simple model in predicting the empirical cross-country differences
in asymmetry. It also better matches second moments of lending rates and economic activity.

A natural alternative view of the cross-country asymmetry I have documented is that exoge-
nous shocks are simply more asymmetric in less-developed countries. However, the data do
not support that view. Using data on default rates for different regions and countries, I docu-
ment that their movements are, in fact, symmetric across crises and recoveries.

In contrast, the data do support my learning explanation. Using data on stock volatility for
many countries, I show that uncertainty, a proxy for information precision in the economy, is
asymmetric: uncertainty increases suddenly during crises and declines gradually thereafter.
Furthermore, I document a significant positive correlation between the asymmetry of uncer-
tainty and the asymmetry of lending rates across countries. This implies that while shocks are
symmetric, information is asymmetric. Thus the asymmetry of lending rates, investment, and
output is not a reflection just of asymmetric fundamentals, but of asymmetric learning.4

Still, my paper does not contradict recent work which suggests that the nature of shocks differs
across countries. Aguiar and Gopinath (2007), for example, exploit data on consumption and
net exports to disentangle permanent from transitory productivity shocks. They find that the
primary sources of fluctuations in underdeveloped economies are shocks to the trend of pro-
ductivity, rather than transitory fluctuations around a stable trend that characterize developed
economies. My work complements these findings by providing a model with frictions that are
   4
   As additional evidence, Cook and Speight (2006) find statistically significant time irreversibility for the output
growth of 15 developed countries and evidence that this time irreversibility can be better accommodated by an
underlying nonlinear model with symmetric shocks, rather than a linear model with asymmetric shocks.

reflected in the persistency of the Solow residuals Aguiar and Gopinath identify. Rather than
imposing the feature that shocks are exogenously different in underdeveloped economies, I
start from the premise that shocks are symmetric and identical across countries, but that differ-
ences in the magnitude of financial frictions generate differences in the asymmetry of endoge-
nous variables – lending rates, investment, and output – that translate into differences in the
persistency of Solow residuals.

My paper is also related to more recent work on the relevance of credit markets for economic
fluctuations. Gilchrist, Yankov, and Zakrajsek (2009) study a data set of corporate bonds trad-
ing in the secondary market and find that credit market shocks have contributed significantly
to US economic fluctuations during the 1990–2008 period. Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) con-
struct an index of credit spread and show that innovations to the component that is orthogonal
to the current state of the economy lead to significant declines in economic activity. These
finding are consistent with my results; movements in credit spreads that do not reflect the cur-
rent state of the economy because of learning frictions have the quantitative potential to drive
economic activity non-trivially.

Finally, my paper complements the recent work of Christiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2012).
They show the quantitative relevance of risk shocks to capture crises and recoveries and match
moments of financial variables, such as the counter-cyclicality of lending rates. In contrast
to their work, mine focuses on a standard real business cycle model, allows for learning and
asymmetries, and compares the performance of the model across countries.

Overall, therefore, my study is an empirical (Section 2), theoretical and quantitative (Sections
3 and 4) investigation of the effects of financial frictions on the asymmetric movements of
lending rates, investment, and output. Section 5 provides empirical support of my explanation
and Section 6 concludes.



2   Financially Underdeveloped Countries are More Asymmetric

I begin by showing empirically that movements of real lending rates, investment and output
per capita are more asymmetric in less developed countries, and in particular, countries with
less developed financial systems. This finding, that I will denote the main finding through-
out the rest of the paper, is robust to many different measures of financial development. Even
though in this section I just document a correlation between asymmetry and development, not
a causal relation, in the next sections I propose a learning mechanism where financial develop-
ment reduces asymmetry, providing evidence that supports the mechanism empirically.

As the measure of unconditional asymmetry I use the skewness of log changes over time. If, for

                                               4
example, lending rates in a country are more likely to experience large jumps rather than large
reductions of the same magnitude, the skewness of their log changes is positive. Furthermore,
a stronger asymmetry is captured by a larger positive skewness. Similarly, we expect negative
skewness for investment and output per capita.

I use International Monetary Fund (IMF) monthly data on real lending rates and quarterly data
on investment and real GDP per capita, from 1960 to 2008, for 100 countries. An exhaustive
description of the data and the complete list of countries in the sample, their individual levels
of skewness, and their classifications is in Appendix A.1.


2.1      General Measures of Financial Development

I start analyzing the relation between asymmetries and standard measures of financial devel-
opment. First, for each country, I use the sample average of credit to private sector as a per-
centage of GDP from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. The
first panel of Table 1 shows simple regressions between this variable and the skewness of lend-
ing rates, investment and output.5 The second panel shows simple regressions just for lending
rates, considering different sample periods (1960-1985 and 1985-2008) and different sample
countries (all countries and non-African countries).6 Since in average the skewness of lending
rates is positive and the skewness of economic activity is negative, the coefficients show a sta-
tistically significant negative relationship between financial development and the magnitude
of asymmetry in all cases.

To provide a better sense of the cross-country differences in asymmetry, I classify countries
into groups that, according to Levine (1997), strongly correlate with financial development.
The countries that belong to each group are listed in Appendix A.1. Groups are defined by:

       • Level of domestic income per capita. I use the World Bank’s WDI classification, where
         the richest countries belong to group 1 and the poorest countries belong to group 4.

       • Membership or not to the OECD.
   5
      In Appendix A.2, I follow three additional approaches to measure skewness of lending rates, alternative to the
skewness of their log changes. First, I obtain skewness of log deviations from trend. Second, I obtain skewness in
log changes of lending spreads, computed as the difference between lending rates and domestic 3-month Treasury
bills, as a measure of risk-free interest rates. Finally, I obtain skewness in log changes of lending spreads, but com-
puted with respect to U.S. 3-month Treasury bills. The relation between these alternative measures of asymmetry
and financial development are consistent with those presented here.
    6
      Since many African countries have high skewness levels, I restrict the sample in this particular way to confirm
the relation is not just driven by African fixed effects. The analysis of these subsamples for investment and output
is very noisy because data is quarterly and restricted to less countries.

evidence reinforces the initial conclusion of a negative relation between financial development
and the asymmetry of lending rates, investment and output.

How to interpret these differences in skewness? Consider a variable that changes 1% in one
period (lending rates rise or economic activity drops) and then it recovers to previous levels in
subsequent periods. Skewness measures the speed of such a recovery. A lending rate skewness
of 0.28 (for the richest countries in the period 1985-2008) implies that a 1% increase in lending
rates in one month is compensated in average with a decline of 0.85% during the next month.
At the other extreme, a lending rate skewness of 2.91 (for the poorest countries in the period
1985-2008) implies that a 1% increase in lending rates in one month is compensated in average
with a gradual decline during the next 10 months.

Similarly, for economic activity, an investment skewness of −0.14 (for the richest countries)
implies that a 1% decline in investment in one quarter is compensated in average with an
increase of 0.93% during the next quarter. At the other extreme, an investment skewness of
−1.09 (for the poorest countries) implies that a 1% decline in investment in one quarter is
compensated in average with a gradual increase during the next 2-3 quarters.

I can use this exercise to interpret the economic significance of the coefficients in Table 1 as
well. The credit to private sector as a percentage of GDP in the poorest income group is in av-
erage 13%. Using the coefficient from the first regression, a one standard deviation increase in
financial development (32%) would reduce skewness by 1.15 (roughly the difference in skew-
ness between income groups 3 and 4 during 1985-2008). This difference implies that recoveries
happen in average 6 months faster, taking in average 4 months instead of 10 months.

                                                          7
In Appendix A.9 I repeat these regressions controlling for other, potentially relevant, variables
such as GDP per capita, volatility of GDP and inflation. For lending rates, conclusions are
roughly the same. For investment and output, the differences in skewness seem to be more
related to the level of economic development (measured by GDP per capita) than to the level
of financial development.

Still, as I show in Table 3, the quarterly asymmetry of economic activity is strongly corre-
lated with the quarterly asymmetry of lending rates – an increase of 1 standard deviation of
skewness in lending rates imply an increase of 1 standard deviation in the skewness of both
investment and output. Moreover, these positive correlations remain significant even when
controlling for the mentioned proxies of economic development. This is an important finding
– the asymmetry in the cost of borrowing and economic activity are strongly and significantly
correlated, both economically and statistically.

2.2   Specific Measures of Financial Development: Financial Frictions

Now I study the correlation between the asymmetry of lending rates, investment and output
with more specific measures of financial development that capture a particular financial fric-
tion – asymmetric information in credit markets. I perform this analysis both across countries
for a given period and over time for a given country.




                                                           8
2.2.1    Financial Frictions Across Countries

The financial friction I consider is the asymmetric ex-post information about repayment pos-
sibilities – borrowers tend to know more about their income than lenders. A measure of the
severity of this friction is the cost for lenders to verify such information, which under standard
debt contracts is given by the cost of taking a defaulting borrower to bankruptcy.

Data on bankruptcy costs that are comparable across countries are taken from Djankov et al.
(2008) who, based on a standardized case study of an insolvent firm called Mirage, compute
estimates of how difficult it is for lenders to go through bankruptcy procedures.8


a) Bankruptcy costs (Djankov et al. (2008))

    • Cost of bankruptcy: Estimated cost of debt enforcement proceedings for Mirage, re-
        ported as a percentage of the value of the estate, borne by all parties; costs include
        court/bankruptcy authority costs, attorney fees, bankruptcy administrator fees, accoun-
        tant fees, notification and publication fees, assessor or inspector fees, asset storage and
        preservation costs, auctioneer fees, government levies, and other associated insolvency
        costs.

    • Time for bankruptcy: Estimated duration, in years, of the time to resolve the insolvency
        case of Mirage; measures the duration from the moment of Mirage’s default to the point
        at which the fate of Mirage is determined.

    • Recovery rate: A measure of foreclosure efficiency. The recovery rate shows how many
        cents on the dollar claimants (creditors, tax authorities, and employees) recover from an
        insolvent firm. The calculation takes into account whether the business is kept as a going
        concern during the proceeding, the discounted value due to the time spent closing down,
        court costs, attorneys, and so on (equation (3) in Djankov et al. (2008)).

Table 4 shows the results of simple regressions between these measures and skewness of lend-
ing rates, investment and output. The positive relationship between bankruptcy costs and
asymmetry is captured by positive coefficients for cost and time of bankruptcy and negative
for recovery rate for lending rates, and the opposite sign for investment and output. All coef-
ficient have the expected sign and are statistically significant in almost all cases.
   8
     When information was not available from Djankov et al. (2008), I completed it with data from Doing Business,
Djankov et al. (2005). Two caveats are in order. First, these variables are measured in 2004, ends of our sample
period. Second, they are constructed based on surveys to insolvency practitioners in different countries, not by
direct measures. Hence, these variables should be interpreted merely as a guidance about financial frictions that
involve costly state verification.

I also use a second set of variables to proxy directly the level of asymmetric information in
financial relations. These come from Porter et al. (1999), who study the performance of financial
and banking systems to improve information access and quality.

b) Monitoring costs (Porter et al. (1999)) (Index that ranges from 1 (worst) to 7 (best))

      • Legal protection for financial assets

      • Sophistication of financial markets

      • Availability of Internet banking

      • Health of banking systems

Tables 5 and 6 show the results of running simple regressions of skewness of lending rates
and economic activity on these variables. Coefficient for lending rates are negative and sta-
tistically significant, while coefficients for investment and output are positive and statistically
significant in almost all cases. The general conclusion is, again, that larger financial frictions –

                                                          10
costly bankruptcy procedures and slow information flows in financial markets – induce larger
asymmetries of movements in lending rates, investment and output.

2.2.2   Financial Frictions Over Time

Given the high correlation across countries between the development of financial systems and
the development in other sectors of the economy, more asymmetries may be related to less de-
velopment in those other sectors. The regressions that control for economic development in the
Appendix show that general development does not reduce the significance of financial devel-
opment in predicting differences in lending rates asymmetries. As expected, though, general
development does reduce the predicting power of financial development on the asymmetry of
investment and output, for which financial markets is only a fraction of what determines their
performance.

Here I exploit time series differences in financial frictions to test the robustness of the spe-
cific relation between financial development and skewness in lending rates. Why only lending
rates? Because data on lending rates is monthly, which allows to compute meaningful skew-
ness during relatively small sub-periods. Unfortunately I cannot exploit this dimension for
investment and output, based on less frequent, quarterly, information.

First, technology improvements are closely related to financial system developments, since
informational frictions, and the efficiency to deal with them, are based on the ease of sharing
and transmitting information and on the efficiency of auditing accounts. That is, a highly
developed technology in a country, such as computers and telecommunications, translates into
low monitoring and bankruptcy costs within its financial sector, as highlighted by Merton
(1987). Information technologies have improved significantly and continuously since 1960.
Table 2 shows that, for all classification groups, asymmetry in lending rates decreases over
time, maintaining the ranking among them. A plausible interpretation is that technological
improvements reduce financial frictions and asymmetry over time in all countries.

Second, we compare skewness in a given country before and after a financial liberalization
process. Liberalization is a shock that abruptly opens the economy to competition and induces
the adoption of modern and more efficient practices, a better enforcement of contracts, and
easier flow of information, hence reducing informational frictions, as well as the monitoring
and bankruptcy costs needed to deal with those frictions.

Data on financial liberalization are obtained from Kaminsky and Schmukler (2008) for 16 coun-
tries during the period 1973 – 2005. In Appendix A.3 I describe the data and show a comparison
of lending rates skewness for each country before and after the main financial liberalization
event. In all countries, except Ireland, lending rate skewness decline after their main liber-
alization event. I also show a comparison of skewness for each country before and after its
whole financial liberalization process, and also before and after a financial restriction process.
Of the 16 countries, only Korea did not experience a reduction in skewness after liberalization.

                                               12
In contrast, the three countries that restricted the financial system during the sample period
(Chile, Indonesia and Thailand) experienced an increase in skewness after that process. This
test, too, supports the new finding of negative relation between asymmetry on lending rates
and financial development.


To conclude, regardless of which indicator is examined as a measure of financial development
– standard such as credit to the private sector as a percentage of GDP and enforcement of con-
tracts, or more specific measures of financial frictions, both across countries or over time, such
as bankruptcy costs, monitoring costs, health or sophistication of financial markets, the histori-
cal evolution of technology for all countries, or financial liberalization processes – the indicator
supports the documented negative relationship between the degree of financial development
and asymmetries on lending rates, investment and output.



3     A Partial Equilibrium Model

I provide now a model that captures both theoretically and quantitatively the negative rela-
tion between financial development and asymmetries. In particular I show that large financial
frictions, modeled as large bankruptcy costs that turn difficult to overcome asymmetric infor-
mation between borrowers and lenders, induce highly asymmetric movements of lending rates
as a response to symmetric shocks to fundamentals. Furthermore, more asymmetric lending
rates translates into more asymmetric investment and output.

In this section I develop a simple partial equilibrium model that introduces financial frictions
into a setting with endogenous information flows, and discuss the mechanism behind the neg-
ative relation between financial development and asymmetries. In the next section I extend
this simple partial equilibrium model into a general equilibrium model that endogenizes de-
fault rates, loan sizes and the price of capital, in a setting with infinitely lived households who
smooth consumption and learn about aggregate fundamentals. The extension to a general
equilibrium setting does not add any theoretical insight but allows to better match the data
quantitatively in several dimensions.


3.1   An Overview

I embed financial frictions into the frictionless Veldkamp’s (2005) partial equilibrium model,
where entrepreneurs should borrow to invest in a risky venture. Without frictions, the cost of
borrowing is based on lenders’ expectations about an unobservable state of the economy that
determines failure probabilities, where a ”good state” is one with low failure probabilites, and

                                                13
hence low default rates. This expectation is constructed from observing previous ventures’
results. When lenders think the state of the economy is good, lending rates are low and there is
a large number of ventures in the economy, which generates a large number of signals about the
good state. When the state changes to bad, all those signals allow lenders to easily recognize
that conditions have changed, so lending rates rise quickly and sharply to account for the
higher failure probability. In contrast, when the state is bad and changes to good, the limited
number of existing ventures generates few signals about the change, so lenders learn about it
slowly, and lending rates drop just gradually.

Into this setup, I introduce an informational friction: asymmetric information between bor-
rowers and lenders about the ventures’ results. To motivate borrowers’ truth-telling, lenders
should sometimes spend resources to verify the result of defaulting ventures by taking them to
bankruptcy. Hence monitoring and bankruptcy costs constitute a measure of how costly it is to
overcome informational frictions. For simplicity we will refer to all these costs as bankruptcy
costs.

Bankruptcy costs have two effects. First, they increase lending rates and reduce economic ac-
tivity, which reduce the number of signals available in the economy. However, this effect is not
symmetric across economic states. In times with high failure probabilities, bankruptcy is more
common, lending rates are higher, economic activity is lower and there are less signals that
lenders can use to learn from. In contrast, in times with low failure probabilities, bankruptcy
costs become irrelevant for the level of economic activity. This implies that bankruptcy costs
slow the learning that fuels recoveries from crises but not the information that sustains crises.
Second, bankruptcy costs induce large jumps in lending rates when failure rates increase,
which magnifies crises relative to recoveries. Together, these two effects result in quicker,
sharper rises and slower, more gradual falls in lending rates, hence more asymmetry in coun-
tries with larger frictions. Since in this simple model there is a direct mapping between lending
rates and investment and output, the economic activity of countries with larger frictions is also
more asymmetric.


3.2      Formal Description

The economy has a credit market with a finite number N of entrepreneurs without funds on
their own and M > N perfectly competitive investors, each with one unit of indivisible capital.
Both entrepreneurs and investors are risk-neutral and live for a single period. Since some
entrepreneurs will borrow to start a venture, some investors effectively will become lenders.
Unlike Veldkamp’s model, my model has ex-post asymmetric information between borrowers
and lenders about the repayment possibilities of borrowers, which I refer as financial friction.


                                                 14
At the beginning of a period t, each entrepreneur i observes a business opportunity that pays
vit at the end of the period in case of success and zero otherwise. The payoffs vit are drawn
from a support (v; v).9 All ventures require the same initial investment (normalized to 1). If
entrepreneurs decide to undertake the venture, they must borrow the money. If they decide
not to borrow, their only option is to work for an exogenously fixed wage w. Investors can
either lend the indivisible unit of capital to entrepreneurs or invest it in a riskless bond that
pays an exogenous and constant rate, 1 + r.

In this economy, the probability of success is the same for all ventures in period t, θg in good
times (G) and θb in bad times (B), where θg > θb and G and B are the only two possible states
of an aggregate variable that follows a Markov process with persistence 1 − λ. I assume that
neither borrowers nor lenders can observe the state of the economy when negotiating a loan,
but both try to infer it from observations of venture realizations in previous periods.

More explicitly, the expected probability of success of a venture in period t + 1 is determined
in the following way. From the nt funded ventures in period t, agents observe a number of
successes (st ) and form posterior beliefs µ0t , using Bayes’ rule and a prior µt = P r(G)t 10


                                                            θgst (1 − θg )nt −st µt
                 µ0t = Pr(G|nt , st )t =                                                            .      (1)
                                           θgst (1 − θg )nt −st µt + θbst (1 − θb )nt −st (1 − µt )

Adjusting these posteriors by the probability of a state change, the probability of being in a
good state in t + 1 is
                               µt+1 = Pr(G)t+1 = (1 − λ)µ0t + λ(1 − µ0t ).                                 (2)

And finally, the expected probability of success of a given venture in t + 1 is

                               θt+1 = Pr(s)t+1 = µt+1 θg + (1 − µt+1 )θb .                                 (3)


When a loan is negotiated between an entrepreneur i and an investor j at the beginning of
period t, both observe the venture’s potential payoff vi,t and agree on the expected probability
of success θt , updated as above based on information from t − 1. Ex-post, however only the
entrepreneur can observe for free whether the project was successful or not, while the lender
can only verify it at a positive cost γ. Since initial investment for each venture was normalized
to 1, a verifying cost of γ = 0.3, for example, represents a cost of 30% of the initial investment.
   9
     These bounds are chosen such that an entrepreneur with a business opportunity with payoffs under v would
never start the venture and an entrepreneur with a business opportunity with payoffs above v would always start
the venture, for all plausible lending rates given the parameters in the economy.
  10
     Recall that Csn = Cn−s
                         n
                             = n!/[(n − s)!s!] and then Csn drops from the equation.




                                                        15
At the end of the period, borrowers may pay the stipulated lending rate to lender j, which I
refer as (1+ρjt ), or default. In case of default the lender can take the borrower to bankruptcy at
a cost γ. Bankruptcy is the procedure under which the lender verifies the failure of the project
and seizes the payoff vit in case of finding out the project was indeed successful.11 Follow-
ing the costly state verification literature, initiated by Townsend (1979), I assume γ is the cost
of all activities involved in verification and bankruptcy, including judiciary costs and delays,
accountant and attorney fees, assets storage, preservation and liquidation costs, restructuring
and seniority restrictions, etc. This cost γ is intimately related to the degree of financial devel-
opment in a country and it is the main parameter in the model.

Finally, I assume there is full commitment to the loan contract (lenders cannot renege from
taking a borrower to bankruptcy in case of default) and pure bankruptcy strategies.12

In summary, the timing of the model in each period t is as follows:

   1. Entrepreneurs and investors agree on their beliefs of being in a good state (µt ).

   2. Investors offer loan contracts, taking into account the potential bankruptcy costs γ. En-
       trepreneurs decide whether or not to borrow and start a venture given those contracts. A
       borrower who is indifferent between loan contracts is randomly assigned to the investors
       offering those contracts. Entrepreneurs who do not borrow work at an exogenous wage
       w. Investors who do not lend invest in a riskless bond that pays 1 + r.

   3. Production occurs. A borrower receives cash flows when its venture is successful.

   4. Borrowers report the result of their ventures to lenders, and contracts are fulfilled. En-
       trepreneurs and investors consume and die. All reports and verification results are pub-
       licly available to the next cohort of agents.

   5. The new cohort of entrepreneurs and investors use the public information above to up-
       date beliefs (µt+1 ). The state changes with a probability λ.


3.3    Equilibrium Outcomes

Here I define and characterize the equilibrium. Even though there is an analytical solution
in each period, it is not possible to write the dynamics of the model explicitly. However, the
  11
      Since borrowers are short-lived and limited liable, the maximum penalty that can be imposed in case of default
is seizing all current assets.
   12
      I focus on non-stochastic bankruptcy just for expositional purposes. In Appendix A.4, I describe the optimal
financial contract with stochastic bankruptcy and discuss why the results in terms of asymmetry are sustained.
Even when I prove stochastic bankruptcy is preferred when there is full commitment, Krasa and Villamil (2000)
show that the optimal contract is again one with bankruptcy in pure strategies when there is no commitment.


                                                        16
nature of the equilibrium sheds light on the effect of financial frictions on the asymmetry of
lending rates, investment and output.

Definition 1 A subgame perfect Nash equilibrium (SPNE), for an initial belief µ0 , is given by time
sequences of borrowing (bit ) and payment decisions in case of success (zit ) by each entrepreneur i,
lending rates (ρijt ) and monitoring decisions (πjt ) by each investor j, and Bayesian beliefs about the
probability of being in a good state µt , such that the following problems are solved in each period t:

   • Each entrepreneur i maximizes expected utility:

                      max                     bit θt {zit [vit − (1 + ρijt )] + (1 − zit )(1 − πjt )vit } + (1 − bit )w,
         bit ∈{0,1};zit ∈[0,1];j∈{1,...,M }


      where θt = µt θg + (1 − µt )θb is the expected probability of a successful venture, which depends
      on the expected state of the economy.

   • Each investor j maximizes expected profits:

            max            Ijt θt {zit (1 + ρijt ) + (1 − zit )πjt (vit − γ)} − Ijt πjt (1 − θt )γ + (1 − Ijt )(1 + r),
      ρijt ∈R,πjt ∈{0,1}


      where Ijt = 1 if some borrower decides to take a loan from this investor j in period t.

   • Beliefs are updated using Bayes’ rule, following equations (1), (2), and (3), where the total number
     of ventures funded is nt = N
                                P
                                   i=1 bit .


Since the size of every project is fixed, also is the size of the loans. Since there are more potential
lenders than potential borrowers, borrowers have all the bargaining power and then there
is a random assignment of borrowers to lenders conditional on borrowing. The following
proposition characterizes the unique SPNE with nonstochastic monitoring, which takes the
form of an optimal standard debt contract.

                                                                                                    1+r       (1−θt )
Proposition 1 In each period t, all investors j set the same lending rate 1 + ρt =                   θt   +     θt γ    to all
borrowers i and monitor every default (πjt = 1). All entrepreneurs i borrow (bit = 1) randomly from
                                              1
an investor j whenever vit ≥ νet =            θt [1 + r   + w + (1 − θt )γ]. All borrowers report the truth (zit = 1).

Proof. I solve the equilibrium backwards.

Step 1: Entrepreneurs’ ex-post decisions

If lenders take defaulting borrowers to bankruptcy, then successful borrowers prefer to repay
the loan (zit = 1), obtaining νit − (1 + ρt ) > 0 rather than 0 if defaulting. If lender do not

                                                                17
take defaulting borrowers to bankruptcy, then successful borrowers always default (zit = 0).
Unsuccessful borrowers always default.

Step 2: Investors’ decisions

As in Townsend (1979) and Gale and Hellwig (1985), here the standard debt contract is optimal.
In my setting, this result is even more trivial because cash flows in case of success are known
and only failure is not. If lenders do not monitor a default, borrowers always default and
lenders never lend. Hence, lenders prefer to monitor (πjt = 1), borrowers always report the
truth and there are no payoffs to seize in case of default. Since investors are competitive (M >
N ), expected profits from lending equalize expected profits from the riskless bond.

                                 (1 − θt )(−γ) + θt (1 + ρijt ) = 1 + r.

Since the expected probability of success is the same for all ventures and the above condition
is independent of the cash flow of a given venture vit , all investors j choose to charge the same
lending rate to all entrepreneurs i (that is, ρijt = ρt for all i and all j).

                                                       1 + r (1 − θt )
                                     (1 + ρt ) =            +          γ.                      (4)
                                                         θt     θt

Step 3: Entrepreneur’s ex-ante decisions

Since all lenders offer the same lending rate, borrowers are indifferent of taking the loan from
any lender, and then they are assigned randomly to investors. The only choice left to obtain
in equilibrium is whether entrepreneurs borrow or not (that is, bit ∈ {0, 1}). This choice is
given by a cutoff value over vit such that an entrepreneur i borrows in period t whenever
θt [vit − (1 + ρt )] ≥ w. From equation (4) it is clear that bit = 1 if

                                                1
                                 vit ≥ νet =       [1 + r + w + (1 − θt )γ].                   (5)
                                                θt


A key variable is the number of ventures nt funded in the economy, which in this simple model
is also the total investment per period, which also determines the number of signals available
for agents to update beliefs. In equilibrium this number is given by the sum of entrepreneurs
who borrow in period t.

                                                               θt

where 1 is an indicator function that adopts the number 1 when the condition in brackets
(equation 5) is fulfilled and 0 otherwise.

The number of ventures depends positively on the probability of success θt in two ways: a
higher θt increases expected profits; and a higher θt decreases market lending rates ρ, directly
by decreasing the probability of default and indirectly by reducing expected monitoring costs.
                ∂e
                 νt
Formally,       ∂θt   = −(1 + r + w + γ)/θt2 < 0.13 More interestingly, since θt increases with the
probability of being in a good state µt ,

                                   ∂e
                                    νt                 [1 + r + w + γ]
                                       = −(θg − θb )                         < 0.
                                   ∂µt               (µt θg + (1 − µt )θb )2

This is important for the determination of signals in the economy. When µt is high, θt is also
high, the borrowing cutoff value νet is low and the number of funded ventures is large.

What are the specific effects of bankruptcy costs γ? First, when it is costless for lenders to mon-
itor ventures’ results (γ = 0), the solution coincides with Veldkamp’s model, which provides
a useful benchmark. Second, when monitoring costs γ are positive, they increase lending rate
levels and cutoffs νet , thus reducing the number of funded ventures in all states. Formally,

                                           ∂e
                                            νt   ∂(1 + ρt )   1 − θt
                                               =            =        > 0.                                           (7)
                                           ∂γ       ∂γ          θt

Third, this reduction in ventures is not constant across states – the derivative above depends
on beliefs θt . Furthermore, θt affects lending rates non-linearly – as θt varies, γ is scaled by a
double effect in the numerator (1 − θt ) and the denominator (θt ).

For given bankruptcy costs, the relation between lending rates (1 + ρt ) and the expected prob-
ability of success (θt ) is non-linear. When the market believes the probability of success is very
high, lenders assign a low probability of having to spend on bankruptcy at the end of the pe-
riod, then its costs do not impose serious restrictions on lending rates and signals. Contrarily,
when the market believes the probability of success is low, lenders assign a high probability to
spending on bankruptcy at the end of the period, and its costs have a critical role on lending
rates, investment and hence, the number of signals.

Finally, output in this model yt depends both on beliefs about the probability of success (through
the number of ventures) and on real probability of success (though the number of those ven-
tures that succeed).

       A smaller νet strictly implies higher nt whenever the density function has mass at all points vi ∈ (v; v).

3.4    Implications for Asymmetry

Since the number of signals is changing continuously, writing an explicit analytical solution
of the dynamic evolution of lending rates, investment and output is intractable. Despite this
shortcoming, I can still show analytically that financial frictions tend to hinder the flow of
information more after crises than before crises, inducing stronger asymmetries. Later I pro-
vide an illustration of the dynamic evolution of lending rates and economic activity by using
a calibrated model and Monte Carlo simulations.

The following proposition shows the conditions for bankruptcy costs to make lending rates,
investment and output more asymmetric. First, I sketch out why endogenous information
generates asymmetry in the first place, by making beliefs time-irreversible.14 Then, I introduce
frictions and show their effects on asymmetries.15


Proposition 2 In an endogenous information economy, the asymmetries of lending rates and economic
activity increase with bankruptcy costs if bad news depresses economic activity relatively more the larger
the bankruptcy costs. Specifically the sufficient condition is
                                                                      n
                                                                  θb
                                                      R>                    .                                  (9)
                                                                  θg

                                       f (ν1 )
where R = minν1 ∈[ν2 ,ν],ν2 ∈[ν,ν1 ]   f (ν2 )   is the minimum ratio of densities in the support [ν, ν] and n is
the lowest possible number of ventures (nt when beliefs are θb ).


This Proposition is proved in Appendix A.5. The asymmetry of lending rates and economic ac-
tivity tends to increase with bankruptcy costs, but there are limits to this result, which are char-
acterized by condition (9) – the decline in activity after bad news is more severe in countries
with higher bankruptcy costs. What is the intuition for this condition? If the initial economic
activity is already very low, the effect of a large increase in lending rates is not very notice-
able, and the number of signals does not drop much further. In the extreme, when bankruptcy
  14
   Veldkamp (2005) contains the full-fledged formal proof of belief time-irreversibility in a frictionless economy.
  15
   The link between time irreversibility and skewness depends on distributional assumptions, so we leave for the
quantitative exercise the discussion of whether the model is able to match cross-country differences in skewness.


                                                                 20
 costs are so large that they prevent economic activity almost completely. In this case more pes-
 simistic beliefs does not have any effect on restricting activity even further, not having a large
 effect on fluctuations and asymmetries. The condition avoids this possibility. In the quantita-
 tive section I show that for the empirically relevant range of bankruptcy costs, the condition is
 fulfilled and financial frictions do increase asymmetries.

 The intuition for this result is captured in Figure 1. The first panel shows the crisis magnifica-
 tion force of bankruptcy costs. A given decrease in the expected probability of success gener-
 ates a greater jump of lending rates in countries with higher bankruptcy costs (the increase in
 lending rates for a country with high bankruptcy cost ρH
                                                        t is larger than the increase in lending
 rates for a country with low bankruptcy cost ρL
                                               t , when both start from the same beliefs about
 the aggregate state). Condition (9) guarantees this larger increase in lending rates translates
 into a larger reduction in economic activity and number of signals.

 The second panel of Figure 1 shows the recovery delaying force of bankruptcy costs. The
 gap between lending rates in countries with different monitoring costs widens as the expected
 probability of success decreases (the difference ρH    L
                                                   t − ρt when the probability of success is low
 is larger than when the probability of success is high). This implies that the speed of recoveries
 after bad times differs between the two countries more than the speed of crises after good
 times. This is the key for having more asymmetry.

             1+ r                                                                 1+ r

 In essence, bankruptcy costs increase both the level and the slope of lending rates. First,
 bankruptcy costs increase the level of lending rates for a given θ, reducing economic activity
 and the number of signals. This is what I call a “level effect”. Less signals generate an envi-
 ronment that overall manages less information, increasing asymmetry because it takes more

                                                                  21
time to learn and recover from bad times. Second, bankruptcy costs also increase the slope for
a given θ, implying that the reduction of signals is more prominent during bad times. This
is what I call a“slope effect”. Bankruptcy costs magnify the reduction of signals when facing
a lower θ, inducing larger crises and lengthier recoveries, on top of the mechanic increase in
asymmetry through less signals.

The “level effect” has been explored by Veldkamp (2005), who shows that adding exogenous
signals, independent of the true state of the economy, reduces asymmetry. In this paper I am
not only endogeneizing the “level effect” as a function of financial frictions, but also, as I show
in the next section, the “slope effect” is quantitatively relevant in explaining the cross-country
differences in asymmetry of lending rates, investment, and output.


3.5     A Quantitative Assessment

Now I perform a quantitative assessment of the simple partial equilibrium model. I calibrate
and simulate the model to show that, with some limitations, it roughly matches the observed
cross-country differences in skewness for reasonable levels of bankruptcy costs.


3.5.1   Parameters

I calibrate the model monthly for a country with average levels of financial development (such
as Argentina, Mexico or Indonesia). Probabilities of success (θg and θb ) are calibrated using
corporate bond default rates listed by Moody’s for 1970 - 2008. Since long time series of default
rates for emerging market bonds is unavailable, I use information on U.S. speculative grade
bonds, which are riskier than typical U.S. corporate bonds and investment grade bonds. Good
and bad times are defined using NBER business cycle dates. Monthly default in good times is
0.35% (θg = 0.9965) and in bad times is 0.85% (θb = 0.9915), which is consistent with yearly
default rates of 3% and 5% in good and bad times used in Veldkamp (2005).16

The probability of a state transition λ = 0.027 is obtained using world GDP from the Penn
World Tables. As in Veldkamp (2005) booms and busts are defined for each country as years
with positive and negative growth of real GDP per capita. Since there is an average of 36.5
months between state changes, there is a 2.7% probability of transition per month.

The parameter N is critical for the speed at which the economy learns about the aggregate state,
but it does not have a clear empirical counterpart because it is the maximum possible number
of independent pieces of information, not the number of projects. In the model these are the
  16
     For developed countries, I perform the exercise using information on ”all corporate” bonds, when yearly prob-
abilities of default are 2% and 3% in good and bad times, respectively. Results are very similar.


                                                       22
same because I assume uncorrelated projects, but if they were highly correlated, a large number
of projects would still generate a small number of independent signals. At the other extreme,
if every firm in a country generates an independent signal, forecast errors for macroeconomic
aggregates would be negligible, which suggests that in fact the information content of total
economic activity is restricted, and correlation among projects is large.
Given this logic, I calibrate N to match the skewness of lending rates for countries of income
group 3 (1.77) using their average level of bankruptcy costs from Djankov et al. (2008) (16.6%),
which delivers N = 41. This number is also consistent with the number of independent signals
N = 25 that Veldkamp (2005) computed by measuring the speed of price adjustments in the
United States. With N = 25, the skewness of lending rates when c = 16.6% is 1.97, and results
are quantitatively very similar.
                                                                                                         1+w+r
Finally, I assume venture payoffs are distributed uniformly in [v, v], where v =                           θg    and
        1+w+r
v=        θb ,   with θg the most optimistic probability of success and θb the most pessimistic one.17
Finally, parameters r and w only affect the scale of lending rates, and skewness is invariant in
scale.18
Using these parameters, I simulate lending rates for 600 periods (recall we compute skew-
ness using monthly data over 50 years) and compute the unconditional skewness of their log
changes. I repeat this simulation 10,000 times, obtaining Montecarlo standard deviations. For
expositional purposes I use the same parameters for all countries and compare their asymme-
try purely from modifying a single parameter, bankruptcy costs, γ.


3.5.2      Implications for Asymmetry

Table 7 compares the empirical skewness of lending rates, investment and output with their
model counterparts. In the model, the only difference across countries comes from different
bankruptcy costs, from Djankov et al. (2008). The partial equilibrium model reproduces the
positive relation between bankruptcy costs and asymmetries, but not its sensitiveness. By
construction the skewness 1.77 of lending rates for income group 3 is targeted to calibrate N ,
but the model generates larger levels of skewness for lower levels of bankruptcy costs and
smaller levels of skewness for higher levels of bankruptcy costs. Even when the model gener-
ates higher levels of skewness for investment and output, it is surprisingly successful consider-
ing the very reduced definition of investment and output and that I do not target any moment
of investment or output. The fit of the model can improve considerably by introducing addi-
tional differences in default probabilities and exogenous signals. However this contaminates
the exercise of identifying the contribution of bankruptcy costs in asymmetry.
  17
       Results assuming a normal distribution with 95% in [v, v] are similar, with slightly higher skewness.
  18
       Skewness is independent of r and w because the support for the distribution of vi is [v, v].

Now I assess the importance of bankruptcy costs for asymmetry in the model. First, even when
the model does not match the empirical asymmetries perfectly, it requires plausible levels of
bankruptcy cost to do it. For example, a skewness of 2.91 (for income group 4) is consistent
with bankruptcy costs of around 38%, rather than 24.4% as provided by Djankov et al. (2008).19
In contrast, the change of other parameters needed to match a skewness of 2.91 in a frictionless
environment (γ = 0), seems implausible.20

       • Very stable states, λ = 0.002 (states change every 42 years).

       • Very persistent bad times. If P r(B|G) = λ = 0.027, then P r(B|B) = 0.996 (bad states last
         20 years in average).

       • Clearer and extreme signals: If annual θg = 0.97, then θb = 0.72 (in bad times 28% of firms
         default). If annual θb = 0.95, then θg = 0.995 (in good times the probability of default is
         almost 0, much less than in developed countries).

Second, we can decompose quantitatively the “level” and “slope” components of bankruptcy
costs I discussed at the end of Section 3.4 above. At least 30% of the difference in skewness be-
tween the poorest countries and the benchmark countries of income group 3 can be attributed
  19
      There is still debate in the literature about the right measurement of monitoring and bankruptcy costs. One
of the first attempts to estimate bankruptcy costs was Warner (1977) who, considering only direct costs for the
railroad industry, estimated a cost of around 4% of the firm’s total assets. Altman (1984) raised the estimation to
20% by including indirect costs (such as lost sales and lost profits). Finally Alderson and Betker (1995) compared
the value of the firm as a going concern with the liquidation value of the firm, raising the estimation even further
to approximately 36%. We use Djankov et al. (2008) since it is the only paper with a clean comparison of these costs
across countries.
   20
      These are conditions similar to those Veldkamp (2005) identified to match a skewness of 2.9 for the 13 emerging
countries in her frictionless environment.


                                                                 24
to the “slope effect”. From the simulations, skewness is 1.77 when γ = 0.16 and 2.91 when
γ = 0.38. However, since the average number of signals when γ = 0.16 is four times higher
than when γ = 0.38, a natural question is the following: is just this difference in the level of
economic activity what creates the difference in skewness? By holding constant monitoring
costs at γ = 0.16 and imposing a four times less informative environment (i.e., N = 10), it is
only possible to generate a skewness of 2.55, which explains 70% of the empirical difference in
skewness between these two groups.

Finally, to illustrate the nature of the mechanism I show an example of the model’s lending rate
dynamics under the same shock realizations but different levels of bankruptcy costs. Figure 2
displays the paths of lending rates over 100 simulated periods (out of 600 periods) of 1 simu-
lation (out of 10,000 simulations) for three economies with different levels of bankruptcy costs,
γ = 0, γ = 0.25, and γ = 0.5. There are three clear patterns that stand out

   • Lending rates are higher in economies with higher monitoring and bankruptcy costs.

   • When the economy moves from good times (G) to bad times (B), lending rates jump
     everywhere, but more in countries with higher costs.

   • When the economy moves from bad times (B) to good times (G), lending rates decline
     everywhere, but faster in countries with lower costs.


This figure illustrates the main forces behind the positive relation between asymmetries and
bankruptcy costs. High bankruptcy costs induce high levels of lending rates and low levels

                                                                         25
of real activity, magnify crises, and delay the generation of signals that fuel recoveries. This
simple model captures this relationship both qualitatively and quantitatively.

How about other moments for lending rates, investment and output? In Appendix A.6 I show
the predictions of the model in terms of levels and volatilities of lending rates, investment and
output are also consistent with the data, but with limitations I address in the next extension.

Caveats What are the limits of the model? The model fails to explain the very low levels of
lending rates skewness among the richest countries. Even imposing γ = 0, the model delivers
a skewness of 1.4 and the data shows skewness of 0.28 during the period 1985-2008. One inter-
pretation is that the conditions calibrated for countries in the income group 3 in recent years
are roughly the average conditions that characterized developed countries in previous years
– average skewness for the richest countries in the period 1960-2008 was 1.54. An alternative
way to accomodate the low skewness of the richest countries is to impose their empirical levels
of default (θg − 0.98 in good times and θb = 0.97 in bad times) and to assume there is a large
fraction of economic activity that does not require external financing.

The model also underestimates the very large levels of skewness among the poorest coun-
tries. However this can be easily accommodated with plausible levels of bankruptcy costs (as
discussed above, in the order of 40% rather than the 25% reported by Djankov et al. (2008)).
This caveat also begs the question of which additional channels may restrict information flows
during recessions in less developed countries.

The most important caveat arise from the partial equilibrium nature of the results for economic
activity. In this model, investment and output are very simplified and roughly the same object,
and then are difficult to compare with data. In the next section I relax this assumption and
develop a general equilibrium model with a more realistic counterpart in terms of economic
activity.



4    A General Equilibrium Model

In this section I show that the positive relation between bankruptcy costs and the asymmetries
of lending rates, investment and output emerges quantitatively in a full general equilibrium
model as well. There are several important extensions to the simple partial equilibrium model
discussed in the previous section. First, the size of investment is not assumed exogenous and
normalized to one, but endogenously chosen by entrepreneurs when obtaining a loan. Second,
the price of capital is endogenous, which plays a critical role in determining the level of invest-
ment and the effects of financial frictions. Third, there are still two types of agents (borrowers
and lenders), but lenders are infinitely lived and smooth consumption, which has implications

                                                26
for the link between investment and output. Finally I do not impose an exogenous shock to
the probability of default, but to the variance of entrepreneurial returns, which endogenously
determines the probability of default in the economy.

Methodologically, I extend the model of Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997) by adding a sophisti-
cated information structure that resembles the learning mechanism above. In this extension,
a boom is interpreted as a period of low ”risk” (cross-sectional variance of entrepreneurial
productivity), which endogenously generates low default and high output, while a recession
is a period of high ”risk”, hence high default and low output. First, this is consistent with the
findings of Bloom (2009), of a negative relation between uncertainty and output, but our expla-
nation hinges on financial markets and not on investment irreversibilites. Second, I introduce
a ”risk shock” instead of a ”productivity shock” mainly to tackle one of the main drawbacks of
Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997), which is the procyclicality of risk premia. In contrast, my exten-
sion generates, as in the data, countercyclical risk premia. The quantitative potential of ”risk
shocks” to be the most important drivers of business cycles, has been documented by Chris-
tiano, Motto, and Rostagno (2012) with a DSGE model that incorporates a financial accelerator
mechanism.

To study the quantitative implications of this extension for the asymmetry of lending rates,
investment and output, I calibrate the model along the lines of the previous section. Since
learning is a critical addition, the simulation of the model requires a global solution and hence
the use of projection methods. A local solution, as in Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997), is not suit-
able for our purposes because perturbing the model around a steady state impedes to match
the sudden and large jumps in default rates and the large cross-country differences in skewness
we observe in the data.

In summary, in a full general equilibrium model, with endogenous default, endogenous invest-
ment, endogenous price of capital, consumption smoothing and an optimal financial contract
with learning, bankruptcy costs have the potential to explain quantitatively the differences in
skewness across countries.


4.1   The Model

Economy Structure The economy is inhabited by a mass 1 − η of infinitely lived risk-averse
households, with discount rate β and utility function U (c), where U 0 (c) > 0 and U 00 (c) < 0,
and a mass η of short-lived risk-neutral entrepreneurs.

At the beginning of each period, both households and entrepreneurs supply work inelastically,
at wages wth and wte respectively, and households rent their capital, at rate rt , to a representative


                                                 27
firm that produces aggregate output in units of consumption goods according to an aggregate
production function
                                       Yt = F (Kt , Ht , Hte )                              (10)

where Kt is the aggregate capital in the economy, which is produced by entrepreneurs, Ht is
the labor supply of households and Hte is the labor supply of entrepreneurs.

In the middle of the period, after the production of consumption goods and payments to the
inputs, households make consumption and investment choices. For each unit of investment
that a household wishes to purchase, it should give qt units of consumption goods to a risk
neutral intermediary, capital mutual fund (CMF), in exchange for capital goods at the end of
the period.

Entrepreneurs have access to a technology that transforms consumption goods into investment
goods stochastically. The CMF uses the resources obtained from households to provide loans
to entrepreneurs, who may require funds to increase their scale of production. As in the simple
model, I assume symmetric information between entrepreneurs and the CMF at the time of the
loan and asymmetric information ex-post, with costly state verification. I will formally show
that a version of standard debt contracts is optimal in this setting.

At the end of the period, stochastic production is realized. Entrepreneurs with high enough
production repay and consume the residual. Entrepreneurs with low enough production de-
fault and are monitored by the CMF. Since the CMF lends to a continuum of entrepreneurs, it
diversifies their idiosyncratic risk, providing a risk-free saving opportunity to households.

The assumption of one period lived entrepreneurs make their problem static and constrain
them from accumulating net worth. Net worth accumulation is an interesting possibility that
has been explored by Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997). However, as I discuss later, this choice crit-
ically complicates the computation of the model, without adding much to the learning mecha-
nism as a source of asymmetries.


Information Structure An entrepreneur who invests i gets a stochastic return equal to ωi in
terms of capital goods, where ω is idiosyncratic to each entrepreneur. I assume ω is distributed

only differ on their means, such that MH > ML .21 These two distributions characterize two
possible aggregate states of the economy, that I call a recession or bad times if ΨH and an
expansion or good times if ΨL , for reasons that will become apparent later. As in the simple
model, the aggregate state of the economy follows a Markov process with persistence 1 − λ.

At the beginning of each period, households and newborn entrepreneurs cannot observe the
aggregate state, but they try to infer it using the total output and the fraction of defaulting
entrepreneurs in the past: if the number of defaults was high, then agents assign a high prob-
ability the aggregate state was a recession, ΨH during the previous period.

The speed of updating is given by a time varying σσ,t

which depends on two exogenous parameters φ and σσ2 . Later, I will calibrate these two pa-
rameters in the same way I calibrated the maximum possible number of independent signals,
N , in the simple model. The intuition is again that a higher volume of investment generates
a larger number of signals, which makes the fraction of observed defaults more informative
about the aggregate state of the economy.

To be more specific, agents at the beginning of period t+1 observe the fraction of entrepreneurs
                                                                                2 ) and the total

  21
     It is important to assume two distributions rather than two variances. Otherwise, since agents observe total
production and there is a continuum of entrepreneurs, they would learn immediate the true state of the economy.

These two equations are just a different version of equations (1) and (2).


Timing

   1. Entrepreneurs and households agree on their beliefs of being in a good state (µt ).

   2. A representative firm that produces consumption goods Yt hires labor and rent capital
      from households and entrepreneurs.

   3. Households decide how much of their income to consume and how much to use to pur-
      chase investment goods from the CMF (claims on capital goods at the end of the period),
      at a price qt per unit of investment un terms of consumption goods.

   4. The CMF uses the resources from households to lend to entrepreneurs using an optimal
      financial contract and diversifying idiosyncratic risk.

   5. Entrepreneurs borrow consumption goods from the CMF to transform i units of con-
      sumption goods into stochastic ωi units of capital goods.
                                               2 is realized. Production happens, financial
   6. The aggregate state and the variance of σω,t
      contracts are fulfilled and entrepreneurs consume.

   7. Households and the new cohort of entrepreneurs use public information about it and
       2 to update beliefs (µ
      σω,t                    t+1 ). The state changes with a probability λ.


Optimal Financial Contract As in the simple model, the financial friction comes from ex-post
asymmetric information between the entrepreneur and the CMF. Even when the contract still
takes the form of a standard debt contract, entrepreneurs here also choose the size of the loan i.
Since production is linear in i and entrepreneurs would like to borrow infinite, their net worth
is critical to restrict the size of the loan. Since entrepreneurs are short lived, their net worth is
simply the labor wage received at the beginning of the period,

                                                nt = wte .                                      (15)

Costly state verification implies that, even when entrepreneurs observe their production ωit
for free, it costs γit to the CMF to observe and seize the entrepreneur’s production. Under
the optimal contract, each entrepreneur borrows (it − nt ) from the CMF and agrees to repay
(1 + rtk )(it − nt ) capital goods at the end of the period. The entrepreneur defaults if production
is not enough to cover the debt, i.e if ω < ω̄t , where

                                              (1 + rtk )(it − nt )
                                      ω̄t ≡                        .                            (16)

                                                   30
Since the price of capital in period t is qt , the lending rate in units of consumption is

                                              (1 + ρt ) = qt (1 + rtk )                                  (17)


This is an expanded version of equation (4). In the simple model we assumed qt = 1, it = 1
and nt = 0. Then (1 + ρt ) = ω̄t , and the entrepreneur defaults if payoffs are lower than (1 + ρt ).

Finally, assuming commitment, the CMF monitors the project and seizes all the production
only if the entrepreneur defaults, paying the bankruptcy cost γ per unit of investment. This
optimal contract is summarized in the next Proposition and proved in Appendix A.7.


Proposition 3 The optimal financial contract is characterized by it and ω̄t that solve the problem

                              max qt it f (ω̄t , µt ) s.t. qt it g(ω̄t , µt ) ≥ (it − nt )               (18)

where nt = wte , f (ω̄t , µt ) is the fraction of the expected net capital output received by the entrepreneur
and g(ω̄t , µt ) is the fraction of the expected net capital output received by the lender. The solution is
characterized by the first order conditions

                                {it } : qt f (ω̄t , µt ) + λt [qt g(ω̄t , µt ) − 1] = 0                  (19)

where fω and gω are the respective derivatives f (ω̄t , µt ) and g(ω̄t , µt ) with respect to ω̄.


As in the simple model, the optimal level of investment, it , changes the speed of updating, but
entrepreneurs do not internalize this positive effect when choosing the size of the loan, and
each single entrepreneur takes it as given when solving his contracting problem. The speed
of updating will then be determined in equilibrium by consistency with each entrepreneur’s
choice. This is the critical externality that introduces inefficiencies in the model. There is a
non-internalized gain from having more investment in bad times and speed up recoveries.


Agents Optimization Problem In order to solve the agents’ problems we first need to consider
the law of motion of aggregate capital in the hand of households, which agents take as given
when solving their maximization problem. On the one hand, given the linearity of the problem,
the distribution of wealth does not enter as a state variable when aggregating. On the other
hand, exactly as in the simple model (equation 8) capital depends both on the true variance of
    2 and on the expectation that agents have about the true variance through the financial

The households’ problem is dynamic, with budget constraint

                                  ct + qt (kt+1 − (1 − δ)kt ) ≤ wtl + kt rt                         (22)

Market Clearing We have four markets to consider in the economy: two labor markets, the
capital-goods market and the consumption-goods market (the numeraire good). Competition

                                                         32
in the factor market implies that wage and rental rates in terms of capital are equal to their
respective marginal products in the production of consumption goods:

                                rt = F1 (t)           wtl = F2 (t)           wte = F3 (t)                              (26)


The expected supply of capital goods is given by the expectation of equation (21), which
depends on µt and the financial contract ω̄t . How the expected supply depends on qt ? En-
trepreneurs maximize (18), which can be rewritten as the maximization of
                                                   h                                    i
                                                               2 (ω̄t )γ − g(ω̄t , µt )
                              it f (ω̄t , µt ) = it mω − Eµt Υσω,t

Since an increase in qt relaxes the constraint of the lender’s return, it f (ω̄t , µt ) is increasing
in qt . Since it g(ω̄t , µt ) is also increasing in qt , the previous equation implies that it [mω −
      2 (ω̄t )γ] increases in expectation, and from equation (21), the expected supply of capital
Eµt Υσω,t
goods is increasing in qt . The demand of capital is given by the lenders Euler equation, which
is decreasing in qt . Market clearing happens when households decide how much money to put
in the CMF, and determines qt .

The conditions to clear the other three markets read as follows

                                                      Ht = 1 − η                                                       (27)

                                                         Hte = η                                                       (28)

                                       ct + cet + ηit = Yt = F (Kt , Ht , Hte )                                        (29)


Definition 2 Recursive Equilibrium

A recursive equilibrium is a set of decision rules Kt+1 , it , ω̄t , ct , cet , prices rt , wtl , wte , qt and belief µt+1 ,
which are expressed as functions of the two states of the economy (Kt and µt ) such that, lenders maximize
their utility subject to information and budget constraints (problem (23)), entrepreneurs maximize their
utility subject to their budget constraints (25), financial contracts are optimal (Proposition 3), beliefs
are updated using Bayes rule (equations (13) and (14)) and markets clear (equations (26), (27), (28) and
(29)).


The challenge in solving this equilibrium is the need for a global solution. In Appendix A.8
I discuss how to compute the model using projection methods. A local solution, as the log
linearization that Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997) use is not suitable for our purposes, since a
steady state does not exist for one of our state variables, beliefs µ. In fact we are interested in
the model dynamics when beliefs are allowed to vary widely over the whole support [0, 1] in

                                                            33
order to capture the levels of asymmetries observed in the data. When the model is perturbed
around a fixed µ it is not able to match the sudden and large jumps in empirical default rates.
The next Section discussed the calibration and the simulation results and implications.


4.2     A Quantitative Assessment

4.2.1   Parameters

I calibrate the model to monthly data. As in Carlstrom and Fuerst (1997), I assume a utility
function u(c) = log(c), a production function F (K, H, H e ) = K α H ψ (H e )1−α−ψ . The monthly
discount rate is set to β = 0.9959, which correspond to a 5% yearly risk-free interest rate, the
depreciation rate is set to 2%, the production function parameters are α = 0.3 and ψ = 0.6275.
Finally, the fraction of entrepreneurs η is just a normalization.

The parameters that are specific to our model are φ = 10.7 σσ2 = 4.1e-014, MH = 0.17 and
ML = 0.14. I calibrate them to match monthly default rates, both in good and bad times (0.35%
and 0.85% respectively), the time-series standard deviation of defaults during bad times (0.5%)
and the skewness of lending rates among emerging markets since 1985 (1.77) for their average
bankruptcy costs (16.6%), as I did to compute N in the partial equilibrium model. Intuitively,
MH pins down default in bad times, ML pins down default in good times, while φ and σσ2
pin down the skewness of lending rates and the time-series variance of defaults during bad
times. It is worthwhile to note that even though I do not target the standard deviation of
defaults during good times, which is 0.3%, the calibrated model generates 0.25%, showing the
calibration of ”risk shocks” accommodates well the process of default over time.


4.2.2   Implications for Asymmetry

The general equilibrium model improves the ability of the model to match the cross-country
differences in lending rates asymmetry, in particular for developed countries. It also matches
better investment skewness and its relation with output skewness – investment is more asym-
metric than output, but still both investment and output are more negatively skewed when
bankruptcy costs are larger.

Figure 3 is a graphical comparison of how well the general and partial equilibrium models
perform in matching the empirical relation between bankruptcy costs and skewness. Each
point represents the skewness of a classification group in Table 2. The general equilibrium
model delivers levels of asymmetry for developed countries that are more in line with those
observed in the data. Intuitively, the calibrated parameter φ induces a stronger reaction of


                                                34
the variance and precision of signals to lending rates. This makes skewness more sensitive to
economic activity and then to bankruptcy costs.

             Figure 3: Models’ Performance on the Asymmetry of Lending Rates




Figure 4 shows the performance of both models in matching the asymmetry of economic activ-
ity. First, both models are successful in replicating the negative relation between bankruptcy
costs and the skewness of investment and output. Second, the general equilibrium model is
more successful in matching the observed skewness in investment than the partial equilibrium
counterpart, even when no moment of investment has been targeted. Finally, the general equi-
librium model is more successful in breaking the link between investment and output in the
direction suggested by the data. When the economy moves to bad times, investment and out-
put declines. However, since households prefer to smooth consumption, the decline in output
is not as large as the decline in investment, moderating its asymmetry.
Why is the skewness of output positive? In the model depreciation hardwires an artificial pos-
itive level of skewness. To gain intuition, assume investment is symmetric. When investment
suddenly declines, capital declines gradually depending on depreciation, and output does not
drop one for one with investment. In contrast, when investment suddenly increases, capital
and output increases one for one with investment. In this example, output has positive skew-
ness even though investment is symmetric. Conditional on this positive bias, the skewness of
output declines when γ increases, with a slope similar to the empirical one.
In Appendix A.6 I show that the general equilibrium model improves in matching the volatil-
ity of lending rates, investment and output with respect to the partial equilibrium model. I
also discuss in the Appendix that the general equilibrium model is particularly successful in

                                              35
           Figure 4: Models’ Performance on the Asymmetry of Economic Activity




matching the cross-country differences in skewness and the volatility levels of lending rates
and investment when default rates are slightly larger than the ones calibrated using specula-
tive grade U.S. bonds – specifically, 0.5% in good times and 3% in bad times. First, these higher
levels of default rates seem consistent with evidence from crises in emerging markets. Second,
the quantitative relevance of ”risk shocks” in driving large crises is consistent with the recent
work of Gilchrist, Yankov, and Zakrajsek (2009), Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2012) and Christiano,
Motto, and Rostagno (2012).


Caveats An important caveat of the model is the absence of net worth accumulation that may

                                               36
allow entrepreneurs to rely less on external finance over time. Here I argue that net worth
accumulation is unlikely to have an important effect for asymmetry, but it introduces important
complications in terms of tractability, given the needs to find a global solution for the problem.
In essence, net worth accumulation introduces a new state variable, namely entrepreneurs
capital, increasing substantially the dimensionality of the vector of coefficients to find, both
directly, through the addition of a new state variable, and indirectly, through the addition of
an additional function to be approximated. I discuss in detail the modeling choices and the
difficulties of adding net worth in Appendix A.8.

Still, to get a sense of the potential effects of net worth on asymmetry, I computed the global
solution of a version of the model with net worth accumulation but without learning, which
remains tractable. In the original setting, the maximum deviation of capital from the mean is
2%. Imposing the same capital shock in the version without learning induces a change of net
worth of 2.8%, and skewness of lending rates equal to 0.14. Hence, net worth alone does not
generate enough asymmetry to explain the large empirical differences across countries.



5   Plausibility of Endogenous Learning Mechanisms

Here I bring together two independent pieces of evidence to illustrate the plausibility of the
mechanism and to answer the following questions. First, do lending rates just replicate asym-
metric fundamentals, in this case default probabilities? The answer is no. Changes in default
are in fact negatively, not positively, skewed. Then, if lenders learn fast about default, lending
rates would reflect them closely and would also be negatively skewed. Second, if learning
is the right story, does the precision of learning really recover slowly after a sudden decline?
The answer is yes. Uncertainty, interpreted as the inverse of precision and measured by the
volatility of the stock market, is positively skewed (it increases fast and recovers slowly). The
first answer reveals the economic relevance of asymmetries, since they may be the reflection of
inefficiencies. The second answer reveals the potential relevance of learning as the mechanism
behind asymmetries.

Default Rates To compute true default probabilities I use data on Moody’s monthly trailing
12-month issuer default rates for different regions and samples with available data. Table 8
shows the specific samples and types of bonds considered. In all cases, default rates is either
symmetric or negatively skewed, which implies that declines in default are in fact larger than
increases. If lending rates were just reflecting true default, their decline would be larger than
their increase, and then they would be negatively skewed, or symmetric at most.

Uncertainty Following Baker and Bloom (2012), I use quarterly stock market volatility as a
measure of uncertainty. From the 40 countries in our sample, only four exhibit uncertainty with

negative skewness, with only Brazil showing a significant degree of negative asymmetry. In
Figure 5 I show the relation between the skewness of uncertainty and the skewness of quarterly
real lending rates. The relation is clearly positive and, if not considering the extreme case of
Brazil, the coefficient is also statistically significant, such that an increase of 1 in the skewness
of uncertainty induces an increase of 0.83 in the skewness of lending rates.

All these results are consistent with the model. After a sudden increase in lending rates, invest-


                                                                                  38
ment declines and takes time for it to recover (negative skewness), making the uncertainty in
the economy and lending rates’ decline also slow (positive skewness). Since this asymmetric
pattern of movements in lending rates does not reflect the evolution of real default probabil-
ities, which are in fact negatively skewed, it generates an inefficient reallocation of resources
out of productive activities during periods of time where default probabilities are in fact low,
but lenders keep learning and charging high rates in the meantime.



6   Concluding Remarks

Business cycle movements in lending rates, investment, and output are usually asymmetric:
sudden and sharp during recessions, but slow and gradual during recoveries. Understanding
this well-known fact matters for policymakers interested in ameliorating the financial distress
and inefficient resource allocation that result from large crises and lengthy recoveries. I have
documented and offered an explanation for a new, related fact: the well-known asymmetry
is stronger in countries with less-developed financial systems, or those with larger financial
frictions. These are countries in which financial distress and inefficient allocation of resources
seem more frequent and more extreme.

I explain the new cross-country fact using a learning model with endogenous flows of infor-
mation. In these models, monitoring and bankruptcy costs represent the costs of overcoming
financial frictions. I show that financial frictions not only magnify crises but also restrict the
generation of information after crises, which leads to slower, more gradual recoveries in less-
developed countries. Calibrations of partial and general equilibrium versions of the model suc-
cessfully match quantitatively the observed cross-country differences in asymmetry of lending
rates, investment, and output.

My analysis has some nontrivial policy implications. It uncovers new gains from reducing
financial frictions directly or improving mechanisms that are used to deal with those frictions.
Policies that reduce financial frictions include inducing relationship lending and enhancing
the operation of bureaus that offer public information about the credit standing of borrowers.
Policies that improve mechanisms to deal with financial frictions include reductions in the
complexity of bankruptcy procedures and financial liberalizations, which improve competition
and the efficiency of improvements in bankruptcy courts and codes.

This analysis also has a more subtle policy implication. My work here assumes that starting
a venture has a positive externality, that of providing information about economic conditions,
which is not internalized when an entrepreneur decides to borrow. Therefore, my work im-
plies that countercyclical Pigouvian subsidies to borrowing can potentially align incentives,
inducing more activity and faster learning during recoveries.

                                               39
At least three possible extensions to my work seem worth mentioning. One is to expand the
study beyond overall country data into data on individual industries. That may prove to be
a very rich source of heterogeneity with which to test the relationship between bankruptcy
costs and the asymmetry of lending rates and economic activity. Another reasonable extension
is to add to the model other sources of information, for example, additional public signals
or private signals that induce dispersed information. Even though such an extension should
not overcome my results, which depend purely on the speed of information generation, it
may uncover some policy implications. A third extension is to expand the sources of shocks.
Here I have explored shocks to default rates, which makes the model self-contained; defaults
determine lending rates, through both credit risk and expected bankruptcy costs, which feed
back into investment and information. In my general equilibrium model, I have explored risk
shocks as well. Also worth studying may be other sources of shocks, such as sudden stops,
shocks to aggregate demand, and productivity shocks.

A note about the timing of my data. I have focused here on the period that precedes the re-
cent financial turmoil in developed countries, which started with the subprime crisis in the
United States and was followed by the sovereign crises in the Euro area. I excluded data on
these events for two main reasons. One is methodological; the data are not complete because
countries have not experienced full recovery yet. My other reason is conceptual; recently-
developed highly-structured financial products seem more difficult to evaluate than credit
products, which have more accumulated know-how. This implies that the information en-
vironment for these newer assets may be characterized by high monitoring costs, as is true
for credit products in developing countries today. Hence, including data on the recent crises
in developed economies would have confused different financial products and contaminated
cross-country comparisons.

Recent financial developments do, however, suggest other extensions of this paper; to accom-
modate learning about default rates of newly structured products and to study their implica-
tions for economic activity, crises, and recoveries. Gorton and Souleles (2006) and Ordonez
(2012), for example, argue that important components of the so-called shadow banking, such
as special purpose vehicles (SPVs), have been created to circumvent bankruptcy costs. If this
is correct, then bankruptcy costs may discontinuously start to matter after crises, which would
induce even larger asymmetries. Additional efforts to uncover the effects of the new financial
landscape on the asymmetry of economic activity are likely fruitful future endeavors.

A.1   Data on Skewness and Sample of Countries

To measure unconditional asymmetry, I compute the unconditional skewness of log changes.
First, I construct the distribution of log changes for real lending rates, real investment and real
GDP per capita in each country. Then I compute the unconditional skewness for each one of
these distributions,                                   T              
                                              √                      3
                                                         P
                                                            (xt − x)
                                             T T − 1 t=1
                              Skewness =                              32 ,                    (30)
                                              T − 2 P  T
                                                           (xt − x)2
                                                        t=1

where T is the number of observations (number of months or quarters in the sample), xt =
ln(Xt ) − ln(Xt−1 ), Xt is the variable measured in period t and x is the sample mean of the time
series.
I use monthly data on real lending rates and quarterly data on investment and real GDP per
capita, for 100 counties and for the period 1960 - 2008, from the IMF’s International Financial
Statistics (IFS). I obtain real lending rates by subtracting the Hodrick-Prescott (HP) trend of
inflation (IFS figure 64P..ZF...) from nominal lending rates (IFS figure 60P..ZF...). The IMF
defines lending rate as ”the bank rate that usually meets the short- and medium-term financing
needs of the private sector. This rate is normally differentiated according to creditworthiness
of borrowers and objectives of financing”. Most available data is based on mortgage and firms’
loans rates applied to the private sector.
For real output I use Real GDP per capita (IFS figure 99B divided by population 99Z..ZF ).
For investment I use gross capital formation (IFS figure 93..ZF ) deflated by GDP deflator (IFS
figure 99BIIZF ). Unfortunately, comparable monthly data for these two real variables across
countries is not available, which makes skewness somewhat less informative – not only there
are less observations, but the lower frequency of data hides potential large changes, which are
relevant in measuring asymmetries.
Three caveats are relevant. First, I choose the HP filter to deflate nominal rates in order to
capture both backward and forward looking components in the formation of inflation expecta-
tions. The alternative use of ex-post real lending rates (using current inflation as a deflator) de-
livers similar results, but has the disadvantage of losing informative months with large shocks
in expected inflation when computing log changes. Second, even when the definition of lend-
ing rates is not exactly the same across countries, it is unlikely that differences in this definition
bias the measure of skewness, which is based on changes over time for a given country.
Finally I only use data up to the first half of 2008 to avoid capturing the recent global crisis.
Otherwise very large crises would appear in the sample, but not their respective recoveries,
biasing the estimates towards even larger skewness levels. Furthermore, the unprecedented
intervention of governments and the large role of recently developed structured financial prod-
ucts would likely contaminate the comparison with countries in previous years and the results.
I leave for research in the near future the study of the asymmetric effects of recent financial in-

A.2     Robustness on the Skewness Definition

In the main text, I analyze cross-country differences in skewness of real lending rates log
changes. Here, I extend the analysis using three alternative approaches to measure skewness.
First, I compute skewness on the distribution of log deviations from a real lending rate trend.
For each month, I obtain the difference between the log of real lending rates and the log of the
Hodrick-Prescott trend, and compute the skewness of such distribution.
Second, the model can be interpreted as a model of skewness in lending spreads rather than a
   Tables'Alternative'Measures'of'LR'
model   of skewness in lending rates, since I consider exogenous risk-free interest rates. What is
   !
a good   approximation of risk-free rates? I use two approaches here. First, I compute spreads

  Notes: Deviations of Lending Rates are obtained from the distribution of log changes in monthly lending rates in deviations
  from Hodrick-Prescott trend. Spreads with domestic T-Bills are measured as the difference between real lending rates and
  3-month T-Bill rates for the same country, from the Global Financial Dataset. Spreads with US T-Bills are measured as the
  difference between real lending rates and 3-month T-Bill rates for the United States,

It is important to highlight two features of the data that are consistent with the model. First,
Figure 6 shows a strong positive correlation between the skewness of real lending rates and
the skewness of T-Bills. This implies that effectively sovereign debt inherits some of the risk
from bad economic conditions. Furthermore, learning about these economic conditions affect
sovereign and internal lending rates similarly. Still, it seems that the skewness of spreads mea-


                                                             48
sured vis-a-vis domestic T-Bills also increase with bankruptcy costs, which suggests learning
about ventures’ default probabilities is more restrictive than learning about sovereign risk.

The second important feature, is that the relation between spreads computed vis-a-vis U.S.
T-Bills (which are probably a better measure of risk-free rate in light of the previous results)
and different proxies for financial frictions remain highly significant, both economically and
statistically. This is summarized in Table 13.

A.3     Data on Financial Liberalization and Tables for Section 2.2.2

Data on financial liberalization are obtained from Kaminsky and Schmukler (2008) for the pe-
riod 1973 – 2005. Their work includes information on liberalization along three dimensions:
capital accounts, domestic financial sectors, and stock market capitalization. Capital account
liberalization refers to an increased ability of corporations to borrow abroad and fewer con-
trols on exchange rate mechanisms and other sorts of capital. Domestic financial liberalization
refers to a loosening of interest rate controls (lending and deposits) and other restrictions, such
as directed credit policies or limitations on foreign currency deposits. Stock market liberal-
ization refers to an increase in the degree to which foreigners are allowed to own domestic
equity and a decrease in restrictions to repatriate capital, dividends, and interests. I focus on
16 countries for which I have enough data to reliably measure skewness before and after major
liberalization events (more than 47 continuous observations before and after).
The main financial liberalization event is defined as occurring in the month in which the max-
imum number of liberalization changes have been introduced into the financial system. Fi-
nancial liberalization and restriction processes are defined as the time frame between the first
liberalization change and the last one during the sample 1973-2005.

A.4   Optimal Equilibrium with Stochastic Monitoring

Proposition 4 In the optimal equilibrium with stochastic monitoring (πt ∈ [0, 1]) borrowers never lie
(zit = 1) and monitoring probabilities and lending rates are, for all lenders j at time t
                             (
                                    1                   if vit < 1+r+(1−θ θt
                                                                               t )γ

                       πit =          1+r                                                       (31)
                               θt vit −(1−θt )γ           otherwise

                               ( 1+r+(1−θ
                                            t )γ
                                         θt              if vit < 1+r+(1−θ
                                                                      θt
                                                                          t )γ

                (1 + ρit ) =         (1+r)vit                                                      (32)
                                 θt vit −(1−θt )γ         otherwise

Entrepreneurs i borrow (bit = 1) from any lender j whenever
                                       p
             1 + r + w + (1 − θt )γ      (1 + r + w)2 + (1 − θt )γ[2(1 + r − w) + (1 − θt )γ]
 vit ≥ νet =                         +                                                        (33)
                      2θt                                       2θt

Proof. As in the main text, we assume full commitment, which means the lender commits to
follow the random strategy πit . Note that the standard debt contract, where πit = 1 regardless
of vit , is also an equilibrium. However, when vit is high enough, it is not necessary πit = 1
to achieve truth–telling. A lower monitoring probability reduces lending rates maintaining
incentives to pay back, which is naturally preferred by borrowers. Borrowers tell the truth if
vit − (1 + ρt ) > (1 − πt )vit , subject to πit ≤ 1. The solution is πit = min{ (1+ρ it )
                                                                                  vit , 1}.

From perfect competition, the previous πit implies that, θt (1 + ρit ) − (1 − θt )γ (1+ρ
                                                                                      vit
                                                                                          it )
                                                                                               = 1 + r.
Solving first for 1 + ρit and then for πit , gives equations
                                                    h        (31) andi (32). Given this contract
                                                                   1+r
conditional on vit , entrepreneurs borrow if θit vit 1 −    θt vit −(1−θt )γ   ≥ w. From this equation,
comes the cutoff in equation (33). .

Four features of this equilibrium are worth noting. First, νet > 1+r+(1−θ θt
                                                                              t )γ
                                                                                   for all monitoring
costs γ ≥ 0. This means that, effectively, borrowers have a level of vit such that monitoring
                                1+r
costs are given by πit = θt vit −(1−θt )γ
                                          , from equation (31), and lending rates are given by (1 +
ρit ) = θt v(1+r)v it
            it −(1−θt )γ
                         , from equation (32). Second, if γ = 0 or θt = 1 the unique equilibrium
is the standard debt contract with non-stochastic monitoring. Third, cutoffs in the optimal
equilibrium are smaller than those under a standard debt contract since lending rates are lower.
Finally, the optimal equilibrium generates the same asymmetry implications as the standard
debt contract. Monitoring costs still magnify crashes (γ increases levels of lending rates), and
beliefs still follow a time-irreversible process that delays recoveries. This proof follows the
same logic as the one for Proposition 2.
It is also worthwhile to highlight that, even when I prove stochastic bankruptcy is preferred
when there is full commitment, Krasa and Villamil (2000) show that the optimal contract is
again one with bankruptcy in pure strategies when there is no commitment to the conditions
and previsions of the contract originally signed.

A.5       Proof of Proposition 2

The proof proceeds in three steps. First, I introduce the concept of time-reversibility and ex-
plain the symmetric nature of lending rates and investment in a constant information economy.
Second, I sketch out why lending rates and investment are time-irreversible and asymmetric in
an endogenous information economy. Finally, I show that bankruptcy costs make lending rates
and investment more asymmetric if bad news depresses economic activity relatively more the
larger the bankruptcy costs.
Step 1: Time-reversibility in a constant information economy
Time-reversibility is defined as the property of a stochastic process under which it is not pos-
sible to determine, given the states at a number of points in time after running the stochastic
process, which states came first and which states arrived later. In our case beliefs of being in
good times are time reversible if their increase when all signals are positive has the same mag-
nitude as their decrease when all signals are negative. Assume that the prior of a good state
is µt = x. If all nt ventures fail (st = 0), then µt+1 = y < x. If in the next period all nt+1
ventures succeed (st+1 = nt+1 ) and the process is time-reversible, then µt+2 = z = x and it is
not possible to tell whether successes preceded or proceeded failures.
In a constant information economy, the number of signals n is given exogenously. Without loss
of generality, assume the economy has equally informative signals (θ = θg = 1 − θb > 21 ) and
no state change (λ = 0).22 If initial beliefs in period t are µt = x and all n signals fail (s = 0),
then from equations (1) and (2) we know that

                                                           (1 − θ)n x
                                      µt+1 = y =                             .                                 (34)
                                                     (1 − θ)n x + θn (1 − x)

If in the next period t + 1 all n signals are successful (s = n), then

                                                               θn y
                                      µt+2 = z =                             .                                 (35)
                                                     θn y + (1 − θ)n (1 − y)

Replacing (34) into (35), gives µt+2 = z = x. Hence, in a constant information economy, beliefs
follow a time-reversible stochastic process.
Step 2: Time-irreversibility in an endogenous information economy
In an endogenous information economy, the number of signals depends on the beliefs of being
in a good state. A higher probability of being in good times µt represents a lower cutoff νet
and more signals nt . In this framework, beliefs are no longer time-reversible. Assume that in
period t, µt = x and all nxt signals fail (st = 0). The subscript t is now necessary because n
varies with time and the superscript x because nt depends on beliefs µt = x. Then
                                                                     x
                                                       (1 − θ)nt x
                                     µt+1   =y=         x        x        .                                    (36)
                                                (1 − θ)nt x + θnt (1 − x)
  22
       As shown by Veldkamp (2005), the proof extends to signals that are not equally informative and λ > 0.



                                                         54
Now, given that y < x, agents are less confident about being in good times, which reduces
the number of ventures, nyt+1 < nxt . Assume that in the following period, all nyt+1 signals are
successful (st+1 = nyt+1 ). Then
                                                                   y
                                                                 θnt+1 y
                                    µt+2 = z =      y                      y            .       (37)
                                                  θnt+1 y + (1 − θ)nt+1 (1 − y)

Now replacing (36) into (37) gives
                                                       y

It is straightforward to check that z < x when θ > 12 and nyt+1 < nxt .23 This implies that the
greatest possible decrease in beliefs (from x to y) is more likely than an increase of the same
magnitude (since beliefs just go from y to z).
Given equation (4), the greatest possible increase in lending rates is more likely than a de-
crease of the same magnitude, which is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence
of positive unconditional asymmetry in lending rates. Hence, in an endogenous information
economy, beliefs follow a time-irreversible stochastic process that translates into a positive
asymmetry in lending rates changes.
Given equation (5), the time-irreversibility of lending rates translates into time-irreversibility of
cutoffs νe linearly, and given equation (6) translates into time-irreversibility of investment and
output, since n(e            ν (x)), but in a degree that depends on the shape of the distribution
                  ν (z)) < n(e
of payoffs νit . In the extreme, for example, if there is no density mass between νe(z) and νe(x)
then there is no time-irreversibility in such a range of beliefs.
Step 3: The effects of bankruptcy costs on asymmetry
Now we study the degree of irreversibility of beliefs for two countries with different levels of
bankruptcy costs, γL < γH . We can rewrite equations (36) and (37) as,
                                             "                        nxt i #−1

                                       yi = 1 +                                     ,           (39)

       The same conclusion is obtained when reversing the order of successes and failures.

It is straightforward from equation (40) that zL > zH when

Since, from equation (39),

then, zL > zH , and hence the degree of irreversibility is larger with higher costs, when

where f (ν) is the density of the business opportunities’ payoffs νit . However this is the condi-
tion for an arbitrary initial belief x. Define R = minν1 ∈[ν2 ,ν],ν2 ∈[ν,ν1 ] ff (ν 1)          θb
                                                                                 (ν2 ) and n = nt . Then, a
condition for time-irreversibility of beliefs, for all possible beliefs, is

                                                  1−θ n

                                          R>               .                                           (43)
                                                    θ

Since θ > 0.5, the right hand side of this condition is less than 1, and then it is trivially fulfilled
when the distribution is uniform (since the densities are constant evaluated at any ν and then
R = 1) or when the cumulative distribution is a convex function of ν (since the densities are

                                                    56
increasing in ν in the relevant support ν ∈ [ν, ν] and then R > 1). More importantly, this
condition is more easily fulfilled when θ is large or when the number of firms financed under
the most pessimistic beliefs n is also large.
Time-irreversibility of beliefs that increases with bankruptcy costs immediately translates into
asymmetry of lending rates that increases with bankruptcy costs. Since lending rates are both
increasing in bankruptcy costs and decreasing in beliefs, through equation (4) and assuming
the same starting belief x, then ρt+2 (z|γL ) − ρt (x|γL ) < ρt+2 (z|γH ) − ρt (x|γH )
The same reasoning can be applied for investment and output. The asymmetry of economy
activity also increase with bankruptcy costs, given equations (5) and (6). This is because the
differences in lending rates translate into a difference in cutoffs that is larger for γH than γL .
Since we assume the distribution of payoffs νit has mass in all its points, it implies the differ-
ence in activity is larger for γH than for γL .
To grasp the intuition, assume θ is close to 1, such that nxt H = nxt L . Then, from equation (39),
yH = yL , νet+1 (y|γH ) > νet+1 (y|γL ) and nyt+1
                                               H
                                                  < nyt+1
                                                       L
                                                          . This implies that lending rates increase
more in a country with γH than in a country with γL , making crises more severe. Finally,
from equation (40), zH < zL , beliefs are less reversible in a country with γH , delaying the
recovery. These two effects combined make large increases in lending rates more likely and
large decreases less likely in countries with high bankruptcy costs, and then lending rates,
investment and output more asymmetric.

A.6     Performance of the Models for Levels and Volatilities

A.6.1    Levels of Lending Rate Spreads

I decompose lending rates in the model (equation 4) into three terms: a risk-free rate, a risk
premium (the risk-free rate adjusted by default probabilities), and the expected bankruptcy
costs needed to solve the frictions imposed by asymmetric information,

                                             (1 − θt )           (1 − θt )
                                  ρt = r +             (1 + r) +           γ.                               (44)
                                                θt                  θt

                                                   t −r)
Lending spreads are defined as (ρt − r). Since ∂(ρ∂γ     = (1 − θt )/θt > 0, spreads increase with
monitoring and bankruptcy costs. Here I show that this is a robust empirical prediction and
that the calibrated version of the models can quantitatively explain spread differences across
countries.

a. Monitoring Costs Increase Lending Spreads
I construct lending spreads by calculating the monthly difference between real lending rates
and domestic three-month Treasury bill yields for each country.24 I then calculate the average
spread for each country in the sample period 1985–2005.
Table 17 shows the results of running regressions between average levels of lending spreads
and my general and specific measures of financial development. All coefficients have the ex-
pected sign and are statistically significant. An important drawback is that, unlike regressions
to explain skewness, level comparisons may be capturing important differences in method-
ologies and definitions across countries. Despite that drawback, results are robust to many
sample restrictions and seem consistent with the prediction that monitoring and bankruptcy
costs increase lending spreads.

b. Monitoring Costs Are Quantitatively Important
Here I show that differences in monitoring costs are also quantitatively important to explain
differences of lending spreads across countries.
The first column of Table 18 shows the average real lending rates for the country classifica-
tions defined earlier, and the second column shows average lending spreads. While real lend-
ing rates among the poorest countries roughly double those among the richest countries, the
spreads are more than double. The third column shows simulated spreads from the calibrated
version of the model. In the fourth and fifth columns spreads are decomposed between risk
premium (based on three-month Treasury bill yields for each country in the sample) and fi-
nancial frictions costs (based on the estimated monitoring and bankruptcy costs from Djankov
et al. (2008)) as specified in equation (44).
  24
     The data on three-month Treasury bill yields was obtained from the Global Financial Database (GFD) (2008). I
have monthly data for 63 countries from 1960 to 2005.

Two conclusions can be drawn from Table 18. First, a comparison of the data and simulated
spreads (the second and third columns) shows that the partial equilibrium model matches
spreads observed in developed countries and underestimates spreads in less-developed coun-
tries. However, the spread differences are significant, with spreads in the poorest countries
double those in the richest countries. Second, as shown in the last column, monitoring costs
account for almost 20% of spreads in developing countries (income group 4) and less than 5%
in developed ones (income group 1).
Similar results are obtained from the general equilibrium model. By construction, I match
the default rates observed in the data. The effects of monitoring and bankruptcy costs arise
from the product of the default rates and those costs, which is the deadweight loss of financial
frictions.

A.6.2   Volatilities

Now I study the ability of the models to capture the level and cross-country differences in
volatility of lending rates and economic activity. First, I compute the standard deviation of the
logarithm of lending rates, investment, and output per capita, for 1985–2008. The standard
deviation of log variables delivers a proxy of the coefficient of variation; hence, all standard
deviations should be interpreted as a percentage of the mean. First, I show the empirical re-
lation between volatility and financial development. Then, I discuss the performance of the
models to accommodate such a relation.
Table 19 shows that the volatilities of lending rates and economic activity decline significantly
with the level of financial development. In contrast, only investment seems to depend signif-
icantly on the level of monitoring and bankruptcy costs. The larger the level of bankruptcy
costs, the larger the volatility of investment. This is also illustrated in the first three columns
of Table 20. Even though the differences in volatility of lending rates and output are not large,
the investment of underdeveloped countries is twice as volatile as that of developed countries
(recall that income group 4 has just one observation, so it should be ignored).
Table 20 offers two main messages with respect to the performance of the models. First, it
shows that both models succeed in generating a positive relation between bankruptcy costs
and volatility, and in both cases, investment is the only variable showing a significant positive
relation. Second, neither model matches the level of volatility in the data. However, as I show
next, this result may be just the result of using data from the United States to calibrate default
rates in good and bad times.

times (0.5% rather than 0.35%) and in bad times (3% rather than 0.85%). Even though these de-
fault rates are chosen merely as an example, evidence of default in emerging countries during
crises suggests they are not implausible.25 As shown in Figures 7 and 8, which replicate Figures
3 and 4 in the main text, calibrating the model to these default rates critically improves its abil-
ity to accommodate the cross-country differences in skewness of lending rates and investment,
without affecting much the simulated skewness of output.
Table 21 shows that this calibration also improves critically the simulated levels of volatility.
Even though the relations between volatilities and bankruptcy costs maintain their sign – the
volatility of lending rates is insensitive to bankruptcy costs, while the volatility of economic

activity increases in bankruptcy costs – the levels of simulated volatilities are closer to those
in the data. Why this improvement? Intuition comes from the effect on the price of capital
from a larger difference in default between good and bad times. When the economy is in bad
times, the decline in the price of capital, qt , depresses investment and output. The drop in
investment introduces a limit to the increase in lending rates during bad times. Recall that
                                                                it
(1 + ρt ) = qt (1 + rtk ) (equation 17) and (1 + rtk ) = ω̄t it −n t
                                                                     (equation 16). A large decline in it
                            k
tends to increase (1 + rt ) (the interest rate in terms of capital), which is compensated for the
decline in qt (a cheaper capital price), which then moderates the volatility of lending rates.

between good and bad times.
Finally, note that, in the benchmark calibration, default rates are symmetric. However, in this
alternative calibration, default rates are negatively skewed and expected default rates are pos-
itively skewed, which is consistent with the findings in Section 5.

Following Townsend (1979) and Gale and Hellwig (1985), when commitment exists, the opti-
mal contract takes the form of a standard debt contract. Since the true value of the variance
 2 is unknown, the expected entrepreneurial income, given the beliefs about the true variance

Since the contract is determined in expectation with respect to beliefs of the agents and the true
variance of ω is unique, there is a unique realized capital output, that is either smaller or larger
then the expected one, which lead to learning in the next period.
The optimal contract is given by a pair (it , ω̄t ) that maximizes the entrepreneur’s expected
return subject to the CMF being indifferent between lending or not (recall that loans are in-
traperiod, so there is no opportunity cost of funds to take into account).

A.8   Computation of the General Equilibrium Model

The model is solved numerically using projection method. More specifically I use Chebychev
collocation and approximate the function ω̄(K, µ) with 5th order Chebychev basis for K and
3th order Chebychev basis for µ. These are chosen as the smallest orders to get a precision in
the projection of 1e − 5. In order to deal with the two dimensionality of the policy ω̄(K, µ) we
use the Tensor product.
To be more specific, given an approximated function ω̄(K, µ, ξ), where ξ is the vector of coef-
ficients of the Chebychev basis, we are able to derive all the other policies, as functions of K,
µ, ξ and thus we are able to compute residuals from the Euler equation (24). The vector ξ is
the solution of the system of 15 equations in 15 unknowns, where the 15 unknowns are the
coefficients of the Chebychev basis and the 15 equations are given by the Euler equation eval-
uated at the 15 collocation pairs (Ki , µi ). In order to compute expectations we use 10 points
quadratures.
To solve the model exploiting projection methods we need a functional restriction N (h) = 0
that is defined by the system of equilibrium equations. Using projections we find h̃ that approx-
imate h such that N (h) = 0. Knowledge of h̃ allows us to get all the policy functions. There are
potentially many different choices of h, we chose ω̄(K, µ) and use the dynamic Euler equation
(24) as the restriction N (·), since within the Euler equation are nested all the other equilibrium
conditions. The projection method specifically allows us to solve for an approximated function
ω̄(K, µ), that satisfies the restriction. There are 5 steps necessary to approximate the solution
by projection. Here I briefly outline how we dealt with each step.

Step 1 The first step is to choose a bounded state-space X ⊂ Rn and a family of functions
ϕi (x) : X → Y, i = 0, 1, ... that are the basis of the projection. We have two state variables,
K and µ, thus we choose the set X ⊂ R2 such that, during the solution of the model and the
simulations, the policy for capital never hit the closure. The evolution of beliefs is bounded by
definition. Hence we have X = [0, 1] × [Kmin , Kmax ]. We choose ϕi (K, µ) to be the terms of the
Tensor product of Chebychev basis of order 3 for µ and of order 5 for K.

Step 2 The second step requires to choose a degree of approximation p, and let
                                                   p
                                                   X
                                   ω̄(K, µ, ξ) =         ξi ϕi (K, µ)                          (46)
                                                   i=0

The choice of p is is driven by the trade-off between speed of computation and precision. We
choose p in order to have the Euler Equation unit free error to be smaller than 1e − 5 on the
whole support X. The resulting p is 15, that is given by Tensor product of the 3rd order poly-
nomium for µ and 5th order polynomium for K.

Step 3 The third step defines the residual function

                              R(ξ, x) ≡ R(ξ, K, µ) ≡ N (ω̄(K, µ, ξ))


                                                66
using the model restrictions. The residual function is calculated from the restriction that the
euler equation (24) is satisfied. Hence given a functional form ω̄(K, µ, ξ) and the equilibrium
equation we need to create a functional representation of the Euler equation. In order to do so
we proceed as follows

   1. For a given pair (K, µ) we get ω̄ = ω̄(K, µ, ξ)

   2. Given ω̄ and µ we can solve the contracting problem to get surplus shares f, g and the
      price of capital q. In order to calculate f and g we need to calculate the expected amount
      of default, that depends on the realized variance σω2 . In order to calculate the expectation
      we use 10 points quadratures.

   3. Given K we can solve for entrepreneurs wage, we , and net worth, n, using the production
      function

   4. Given n, g and q we can solve for investment i by the optimality condition of the contract.

   5. Using the budget constraint of the entrepreneur, that depends from q, n, f and g, we can
      get entrepreneur consumption ce

   6. Last by market clearing we get lenders consumption c

   7. Given the equilibrium investment i we compute (K 0 , µ0 ). It is important to notice that K 0
      and µ0 both depends on the true variance of entrepreneurs projects, σω2 , thus we use two
      10 points quadratures, one centered at ML and one centered at MH , in order to calculate
      the expectations of the lender on the pairs (K 0 , µ0 ).26

   8. For each of the 20 quadratures pairs (K 0 , µ0 ) using steps 1-6 we calculate c0 , q 0 and r0 .

   9. Last we calculate the Euler equation errors using the quadrature points to take the expec-
      tation with respect to the current belief µ. For a generic x the expectation is approximated
      as follows
                                           X10                   10
                                                                 X
                                    0            0
                                E(x ) = µ      xi,L si + (1 − µ)    x0i,H si
                                                    i=1                    i=1

       where si are the quadrature weights, and            x0i,j
                                                      are the values of x0 calculated for the point
       i of quadrature centered at Mj , with j ∈ {L, H}.


Step 4 The fourth step requires to choose a projection function vi and a weighting function s to
solve for the unknown vector of coefficients ξ. ξ solves Vi = 0, i = 0, 1, .., p, where Vi is defined
as                                     Z
                                   Vi ≡ s(x)R(ξ, x)vi (x)dx
                                                X
  26
     Note that for each K 0 there exist a unique µ0 that is obtained using the observed signal (K 0 ) and the Bayesian
updating from equations (13) and (14).




                                                          67
We chose to use collocation method that exploits the Dirac delta function as the weighting
function                                 (
                                          0 if x 6= xi
                                 s(x) =
                                          1 if x = xi
and assigns vi = 1 ∀i. We last need to pick 15 collocation pairs xi = (Ki , µi ): we chose them to
be equal to the Tensor product of the zeros of the 3rd and 5th order Chebychev polynomia. In
order to solve for ξ we use a Newton-Raphson algorithm.

Step 5 The last step consist in verifying the quality of the approximation. We choose as a target
that the Euler equation unit free errors, as reported in Judd and Guu (1997), are smaller than
1e − 5.
