                                              ABSTRACT

This paper was prepared for a session of the 2009 American Economic Association meeting devoted
to examining the views of American economists about the euro and the European Economic and Monetary
Union on the tenth anniversary of the euro. I had written an article in 1992 in the Economist and subsequent
articles in the Journal of Economic Perspecties and in Foreign Affairs. I begin by reviewing the arguments
that I offered at that time about the claimed advantages of a single currency and about what I regarded
as the disadvantages. I then discuss my claims that the primary motivation for the creation of the euro
was political, not economic and that the creation of the euro could lead to increased conflict within
Europe and with the United States. I conclude with a discussion of the implications for the EMU of
the current recession and the likely future economic conditions in Europe.

      Reflections on Americans’ Views of the Euro Ex Ante


                                  Martin Feldstein∗




      I am pleased to participate in this session on the 10th anniversary

of the start of the Euro and the European Economic and Monetary

Union.


      There is much to celebrate on this occasion. The Economic and

Monetary Union achieved its goal of establishing a viable single

currency for its member nations. The European Central Bank has

focused successfully on its mandated goal of price stability. Although

today’s inflation rate of slightly higher than 3 percent exceeds the

official target rate, the ECB has succeeded in avoiding the high and

volatile inflation of some earlier years.


      But these 10 years have not been a particularly challenging time.

With no serious downturn, the ECB has been able to focus on the goal of

the euro ten years earlier.

price stability. Not all countries shared equally in these good times but

there was enough prosperity to avoid conflicts over economic policy.


      That may be about to change. We are now experiencing a major

global economic downturn and a global economic crisis. These

conditions are worse than any that I have experienced before. The

downturn in the United States is likely to be longer and more damaging

than any since the depression of the 1930s.


      Conditions in Europe are also deteriorating very rapidly. More

significantly, there are now substantial differences among the EMU

countries. While Germany has an unemployment rate of 7.5 percent,

the unemployment rate in Spain is 12.8 percent. The contrast is even

greater for the 12‐month change in industrial production – down 3.9

percent in Germany but down 11 percent in Spain. Even in France

industrial production is down 7.2 percent.


      There are also very large differences in the trade balances of the

individual countries. Germany had a trade surplus over the past 12

months of $280 billion while Spain has a trade deficit of $154 billion.

Even France has a trade deficit of $83 billion.




                                     2
        These differences in economic conditions call for differences in

monetary and fiscal policies. But the single currency implies that there

can be only one monetary policy for the entire eurozone. For fiscal

policy, the rules of the EMU limit the ability of individual countries to

have any significant countercyclical fiscal deficit. At the same time,

there is no mechanism for a common fiscal policy for the entire EMU.


        These restrictive conditions – these policy limits – and the fact

that the country with the strongest current performance is also the

largest and most influential member of the eurozone – suggest that

economic performance in the other countries will be worse than they

would otherwise have been and that some of those countries will be

unhappy and frustrated.


My Early Comments on EMU


        I owe my place on this panel to three articles that I wrote before

the start of EMU – a short piece in the Economist in 1992 and longer

articles in Foreign Affairs and in the Journal of Economic Perspectives in

1997.


        I welcome this opportunity to comment on what I said in those

three articles – and on what I did not say.

                                      3
      Let me begin with some things that I did not say there or

anywhere else but that some euroskeptics did say and that some people

have attributed to me as well.


      ‐ I never said that the Euro would not come into existence.


      ‐ I never said that the Monetary Union would inevitably collapse.


      ‐ And I never said that the Euro would lead to war within Europe

         or with the United States.


My articles emphasized three points:


      ‐ First, the economic advantages of a single currency in

         promoting trade and competition would be outweighed by a

         higher rate of unemployment and by the risk of higher long‐

         term inflation.


      ‐ Second, the primary motivation for the creation of the euro

         was political, not economic.


      ‐ Third, the creation of the euro could lead to increased conflict

         within Europe and with the United States.




                                      4
I continue to believe that all three positions are correct. I think the

current economic crisis may demonstrate that more clearly.


      I will now look at each of these three statements. I will then

come back to the implications of the current recession and of the

likely future economic conditions in Europe.


      My 1992 article in the Economist appeared roughly a year

after the Delors report of the Economic Commission which bore

the title “One Market, One Money.” The Delors report and others

argued that the common market in goods and services that had

been created by the European Union required a single currency to

be effective – thus “one market, one money.”


      These proponents of the single currency said that a single

currency was needed to facilitate trade and that a single currency

would promote efficiency by permitting price comparisons.


EMU advocates in Britain argued that these economic gains were

worth the political sacrifices – the loss of sovereignty over

monetary affairs and over other economic policies that would

result from joining the EMU.




                               5
      But Britain already had the free trade advantages of being a

member of the European Union. I argued that there were in effect

no net economic gains – more likely a net economic loss ‐‐ to

compensate Britain for the political costs of joining the Economic

and Monetary Union.


      Certainly there is nothing in economic theory or in historic

experience to suggest that international trade requires a single

currency. The argument that one market requires one money was

the kind of political slogan that frankly bothered me as an

economist.


      I was also not impressed by the idea that a single currency

would facilitate price competition that would improve market

efficiency. The housewife in Madrid buys her bread locally. So

knowing what bread costs in Berlin or Rome is irrelevant. The

industrial buyer who may already shop for steel or chemicals in

different national markets could easily compare prices stated in

different currencies with the help of a pocket calculator.




                              6
      In contrast, the economic costs of a single currency are very

real. A single currency means a single monetary policy and a

single exchange rate.


      A single monetary policy for a group of heterogeneous

countries that experience different shocks cannot be optimal – the

problem is that, when it comes to monetary policy, one size

cannot fit all. If monetary policy has to consider unemployment

as well as inflation, the average cyclical unemployment rate will

be higher with a single currency.


      A single currency also means that a country that

experiences an increased trade deficit caused by a reduced

demand for its export products cannot be helped by a natural – i.e.

automatic ‐‐ exchange rate adjustment.


Comparison with the United States


      A common reaction to these arguments by the single

currency advocates was that the U.S. is a large continental country

with diverse economic regions. Why, they asked, should a single

currency be good for the U.S. but not for Europe? Here’s the

answer.

                              7
        There are three important differences between the U.S. and

Europe that allow the U.S. to be more nearly an optimal currency

area.


        The first is mobility. In the United States, when demand

falls in one region people move out of that area and others do not

move in as readily. When New England lost its shoe industry to

foreign producers, the population in the New England states fell

relative to that in other parts of the country.


        In Europe that does not happen to nearly the same extent

for at least three reasons. Language is the most obvious. While

elite executives and academics move among countries, the

average citizen does not have the language skill to make that

move. Cultural traditions also militate against mobility.

Americans are movers with a tradition of immigration to the U.S.

and movement from the east coast to populate the rest of the

country. Europeans are much less likely to move even within their

own country. A third reason is national loyalty. A Frenchman is a

Frenchman and a Spaniard is a Spaniard in ways that do not apply

to someone from Connecticut or Arizona.



                               8
      So the greater mobility in the U.S. helps to stabilize national

unemployment when there are idiosyncratic regional shocks to

demand.


      Second, the greater wage flexibility in the United States also

helps to offset local demand shocks. When demand falls in a U.S.

region, wages rise more slowly in that area, inducing movements

in location and in production. European wages are much less

flexible as a result of custom, legal rules, and union power.


      The third condition that allows the U.S. to operate

successfully with a single currency is that Washington offsets

about one‐third of any local fall in incomes by reduced collection

of federal taxes and increased unemployment benefits. There is

nothing comparable at the European level where fiscal authorities

are national.


The Political Motivation for EMU


At a certain point after writing my 1992 Economist article I began

to think that European leaders might also understand that the

economic case for EMU was very weak or non‐existent. Perhaps

they made arguments like “one‐market needs one money” and

                               9
ignored the adverse effects because they wanted the single

currency for another reason.


      That brought me to the second idea that I emphasized in my

writing: that the primary motivation for EMU was political – to

create eventually a political union, a federal state with

responsibility for domestic and international affairs. I explored

that idea in the Journal of Economic Perspectives and in Foreign

Affairs.


      European political leaders since Jean Monet made it clear

that they wanted a political union. Some of them saw this as a way

of avoiding another intra‐European war like the Franco‐Prussian

war and World Wars one and two. Thus, German Chancellor

Helmut Kohl was very clear when he spoke of “containing a

potentially dangerous Germany within Europe.”


      But other political leaders spoke of developing a strong

European entity as a counterbalance to the United States. The

French were particularly fond of making this argument.


      Helmut Schlesinger, the long‐time head of the German

Bundesbank, wrote the following in 1994: “the final goal is a

                               10
political one in which the economic union is an important vehicle

to reach this target. Since 1952, since the beginning of the

European community, the final goal was and is to reach a type of

political union in Europe, a federation of states, an association of

states or even a stronger form of union. The political target has

been guiding Germany since the beginning and will continue to do

so in the future.”


      So it couldn’t be clearer. The economic arguments were not

the real reason for the EMU. They were a way of selling the

political union to a public not yet ready for political union as

something very different. But to the political leaders, EMU was a

step toward political union.


      If the people throughout Europe carried euros in their

pockets, they would feel more like Europeans and less like

Belgians or Italians. Even the choice of the name for the currency

–the euro ‐ underlined this purpose.


      If each national central bank lost power to a European

Central Bank in Frankfurt, people would realize that a powerful

political union was being created.


                               11
      The political leaders had many different reasons to want a

political union. As I already noted, some of the idealists thought it

would prevent a return to war in Europe. That was the view

stressed by Kohl. But was that his real reason – or like the

specious economic arguments of others – just part of selling the

EMU and ultimately political union to the people of Europe?


      In my Foreign Affairs article I noted that a political union

with a single currency had not prevented the United States from

having a terrible civil war. That comment led the editors of

Foreign Affairs to put the caption “EMU and War” on the cover of

that issue, attracting attention to my article but also leading many

who didn’t actually read the article to believe that I was saying

that EMU would lead to a European civil war.


      But preventing war by (in Helmut Kohl’s words) “containing

a potentially dangerous Germany within Europe” might not be the

only or even the dominant reason why Germany had political

union as its goal. Germany is the largest economy and has the

largest population. It is now the geographic center of Europe.




                              12
Germany might well expect that it would become the dominant

force within any future political union.


      The French had a different view of the way that power

would evolve. As I explained in those articles, the French saw a

political union as a way of achieving equality with Germany – and

perhaps even the leading role in the field of foreign policy. The

Bundesbank had been the dominant force in monetary affairs

before the EMU but with the creation of the EMU the French

would be equal to the Germans at the ECB. If Britain could be

persuaded to join, the Bank of England would no longer be an

independent player in monetary affairs.


      The contrast between German expectations of a hegemonic

role and the French expectation of at least equal influence is but

one example of the potential for conflict within the EMU.


Potential Conflicts


      Such potential conflicts are the subject of the third theme

that I explored – conflicts between Germany and France, conflicts

between those two dominant countries and the other members of

the EMU, and conflict with the United States.

                              13
      Conflict does not mean war. Rather it can be the failure to

cooperate and the attempt to undermine the goals and influence

of other countries.


      We certainly saw this in the behavior of France with respect

to US policy in Iraq and the French attempt to block US actions at

the UN Security Council. We see it now in the coordinated

European policies with respect to Iran – where the European

economic interests cause it to refuse tough sanctions against Iran.

And we see it in the coordinated European policy with respect to

the Palestinians.


      In the article in The Journal of Economic Perspectives I put

the potential conflict between a more unified Europe and the

United States into historic perspective by recalling what

happened in 1956 when the United States forced England and

France to abandon their attack on the Suez Canal. Conrad

Adenauer, the German chancellor, was in Paris on that day and

said this to the leaders of the British and French governments:

“France and England will never be powers comparable to the

United States and the Soviet Union. Nor Germany, either. There



                             14
remains only one way of playing a decisive role in the world, that

is to unite to make Europe. … We have no time to waste: Europe

will be your revenge.”


      We as economists may not think about “playing a decisive

role in the world” as a key goal of government actions but the

elected officials who guide long‐run political strategy do.


Current Economic Conditions in Europe


      The very negative current economic conditions in Europe

may cause substantial economic policy disagreements among the

EMU countries.


      Germany is still resisting any substantial fiscal deficits and

the ECB has a much higher interest rate than the Federal Reserve

or the Bank of Japan. Spain with a 13 percent unemployment rate

and a trade deficit of 10 percent of GDP must want a more

expansive monetary and fiscal policy than Germany. Smaller

countries may now feel that they have lost control over their

economic future.




                              15
      In these circumstances, it is possible that one or more

countries might actually withdraw from the EMU. It is clear why

some national political leaders – or would be leaders ‐‐ might

consider such an option.


      Doing so would allow their reinstated national central bank

to choose an easier monetary policy. The national central bank

could also create the currency needed to act as a lender of last

resort to national commercial banks. The country’s fiscal

authority would no longer be bound by the restrictions of the

Stability and Growth Pact and could therefore pursue a large fiscal

stimulus. The international value of the currency could adjust to

make local products more competitive.


      A country might threaten to leave the EMU unless policy

became more expansive. If policy did not change, it might face the

difficult choice between leaving the EMU and losing face by

backing down from its threatened action.


      If this happens, how would the remaining members of the

EMU respond? The Maastricht Treaty has no provision for a




                              16
county to leave the EMU, just as the US constitution has no

provision for a state to secede.


      Would a country that left the EMU be forced out of the

European Union as well, thereby losing the free trade advantages

of the EU?


      The next few years will clearly be an important testing time

for the European Monetary Union and for the Euro.
