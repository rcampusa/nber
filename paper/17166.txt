How Do Mortgage Subsidies Affect Home Ownership? Evidence from the Mid-century GI

                                              ABSTRACT

The largest 20th-century increase in U.S. home ownership occurred between 1940 and 1960, associated
largely with declining age at first ownership. I shed light on the contribution of coincident government
mortgage market interventions by examining home loan benefits granted under the World War II and
Korean War GI Bills. The impact of veterans' housing benefits on home ownership is positive for
young men, and declines with age. Veterans' benefits increased aggregate home ownership rates primarily
by shifting purchase earlier in life, explaining 7.4 percent of the overall 1940-60 increase and 25 percent
of the increase for affected cohorts. A rough extrapolation suggests that broader changes in mortgage
terms may explain 40 percent of the 1940-60 increase.

1       Introduction

The primary focus of federal housing policy over the last eighty years has been intervention in

mortgage markets. In part, the goal of these policies has been to extend home ownership to

marginal home buyers, and many observers have argued that the mortgage policies born of the

Great Depression and World War II are responsible for the dramatic transformation in United

States housing markets and home ownership in the mid-20th century.1 But surprisingly, neither

the effect of these policies on historical rates of home ownership, nor the set of factors driving

changes in housing markets during and after World War II, is well understood. The recent crisis and

debate over the government’s role in housing finance makes evidence on these questions particularly

timely.2

    Of the interventions that began in the 1930’s and 1940’s, the mortgage insurance and guarantees

provided through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Veterans Administration (VA)

were among the largest in scale. The establishment of these programs coincided with the most

striking changes in home ownership in the last century. Between 1940 and 1960, the rate of home

ownership increased sharply from 44 to 62 percent, as younger individuals became home owners at

unprecedented rates. The profile of home ownership by age was nearly linear up to age 60 in every

Census year from 1900 to 1940, but by 1960 had taken the concave shape that persists today.3

    This paper sheds light on the role of these mortgage market interventions – and by extension,

on the role of changes in mortgage terms more broadly – by providing estimates of the contribution

of the VA home loan program to increased rates of home ownership. Past work, such as Jackson

(1985), Green and Wachter (2005), and Vigdor (2006), has discussed the potential role of the FHA
    1
      Examples are Jackson (1985) and Schwartz (2010).
    2
      The specific type of intervention discussed here – mortgage insurance and guarantees – remains central to housing
policy. For example, at the end of Fiscal Year 2011, the amount of outstanding principal guaranteed by the Federal
Housing Administration was $1.097 trillion (U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, 2011). Policies
meant to encourage home ownership are often based on the argument that it has social benefits; Haurin, Dietz and
Weinberg (2003) provide a review of the academic literature on this issue. I do not take up this question here, but the
potential for such spillovers is one motivation for examining whether, and how, these programs affect home ownership.
    3
      Figure 2 depicts the changing age structure of ownership in the United States over the 20th century. Explaining
the change in the age profile of ownership has not been the direct focus of earlier research, but Aaron (1972) discusses
the particularly large increases in home ownership for younger age groups over this period, Chevan (1989) shows that
the age at which the median individual in a cohort became a home owner fell, and Collins and Margo (2001) note an
increase in the concavity of the age-ownership profile in their study of racial differences in home ownership over the
20th century.

and VA in explaining the observed changes in housing markets over the 20th century.4,5 However,

a number of other major changes over the same period could have driven the increase in home

ownership. The favorable tax treatment of owner-occupied housing became more important during

World War II as marginal tax rates rose (Aaron, 1972; Rosen and Rosen, 1980; Rosen, Rosen and

Holtz-Eakin, 1984). Rising real incomes and savings rates during World War II and afterwards

may have increased demand for housing (Chevan, 1989; Chambers, Garriga and Schlagenhauf,

2011); increased rates of family formation after the war may have done so as well.6 Decreased

transportation costs in the postwar era (Baum-Snow, 2007) may have increased home ownership

by lowering the cost of suburban residence.7 Finally, even if changes in housing finance played an

important role, the extent to which federal credit aids were themselves a major factor is an open

question, for which we lack rigorous quantitative estimates.

    My empirical design attempts to hold these other factors constant, and, motivated by the

increased concavity of the age-home ownership profile, allows the estimated effects of terms on

home finance to vary with a person’s age.8 I use the home loan benefits provided to veterans

under the World War II and Korean War GI Bills as variation in the mortgage terms available

to an individual. Because of selection into military service during World War II and the Korean

War, direct comparisons of veterans to non-veterans are problematic.9 However, the smoothness

of home ownership rates in age motivates between-cohort comparisons in the spirit of a regression

discontinuity design; this variation is similar to that used in previous work on the GI Bill, such as
    4
       An older literature focused on the effects of federal loan insurance on the supply of credit and the volume of
residential construction: examples include Break (1961), Grebler (1960), and Klaman (1961).
     5
       A large body of work provides evidence on the impact of borrowing constraints on home purchase in more recent
periods. Examples include Linneman and Wachter (1989), Duca and Rosenthal (1994), Haurin, Hendershott and
Wachter (1997), and Linneman et al. (1997). Chiuri and Jappelli (2003) compare age-ownership profiles across coun-
tries and argue that the terms of mortgage finance, and down-payments in particular, are an important determinant
of the distribution of home ownership across age groups.
     6
       For detailed data series on savings rates, see Carter et al., eds (2006).
     7
       This may be the case if, for example, a lower price of land more distant from city centers facilitates construction
of larger, single-family detached dwellings, and for agency reasons these tend to be owner-occupied more often than
multi-family structures (Glaeser and Shapiro, 2003).
     8
       As discussed in Section 3, heterogeneity of effects by age is a prediction of a standard life-cycle model of tenure
choice, in which relaxing liquidity constraints may primarily serve to induce earlier home purchase.
     9
       Note that positive selection into the military does not necessarily imply that naive comparisons of veterans to non-
veterans would yield upwardly-biased estimates. For example, positively selected individuals may make investments
that delay first home purchase. A comparison of age-ownership profiles for college and high school graduates suggests
that over this period, college graduates were less likely to own early in life, and more likely to own later in life.

Bound and Turner (2002). The probability of military service by date of birth fell steeply with the

declines in inductions under the draft at the end of World War II and the Korean War. Comparison

between, rather than within, cohorts alleviates concerns that differences in later life outcomes are

due to pre-existing differences in characteristics between veterans and non-veterans.10 The presence

of two ‘breaks’ – one associated with the end of World War II and one with the end of the Korean

War – gives estimates at two ages in each Census year. Testing for differences at each break in each

Census from 1960 to 1980, I estimate the impact of veteran status at multiple ages and points in

time.

    The results of the analysis are consistent with effects of easier housing finance that decline with

age. I find large effects of veteran status on the probability of home ownership in 1960 at both

breaks. In 1960, men born at the World War II break were 32 years old, and about 53 percent

owned their homes. I estimate an effect of 13 percentage points for men who were induced into

military service at the break as a result of their date of birth. Men at the Korean War break were

26 years old in 1960, and about 28 percent were home owners. For these men, the analogous effect

was 18 percentage points. Consistent with effects that decline with age, the 1960 Korean War

estimate is larger than the World War II estimate in both percent and percentage point terms, and

I find no evidence for positive effects of veteran status on home ownership at either break in 1970

or 1980, when a person born at either break would have been at least 36 years old. In other words,

mortgage subsidies appear to have increased aggregate rates of home ownership by shifting home

purchase earlier in life, rather than by shifting those who never would have purchased into home

ownership.11

    The GI Bills provided several other benefits as well, such as support for education, and military

service itself also may have influenced an individual’s demand for housing. I present several pieces

of evidence suggesting that the observed effects of veteran status on home ownership are not due

primarily to non-housing benefits or direct impacts of military service. First, to address possible
   10
      This research design does not address the issue that service itself may have direct impacts on later outcomes, a
potential confound I address in Section 5.
   11
      It is also possible that benefits increased the amount of housing consumed. A similar strategy applied to various
measures of housing consumption give estimates with broadly similar trends, but which tend to be imprecisely
estimated. In the paper I focus on the tenure decision; I discuss results for housing consumption in Appendix 4.




                                                          3
differences in education or income, I note that there is evidence of higher income in 1960 only

for veterans at the Korean War break, and estimates of the impact of veteran status on home

ownership change little after controlling for income and education directly. Second, the housing

outcomes of World War I veterans, who received some benefits but no national housing benefits,

suggest that ‘service effects’ were not the driving force behind veterans’ higher rates of ownership:

World War I veterans at age 23 in 1920 and age 33 in 1930 appear no more likely to have owned

their homes than similar non-veterans. Finally, over the decade following World War II, veterans’

rates of home purchase responded significantly to plausibly exogenous year-to-year changes in the

availability and generosity of the home loan benefit.

    I use the baseline estimates to calculate a counterfactual age-ownership profile in 1960, which

can be used to assess the contribution of VA home loan benefits to the overall increase in home

ownership from 1940 to 1960.12 The estimates suggest that about 39 percent of the increase for

men of age 26, and about 26 percent of the increase for men of age 32, can be attributed to VA

home loan benefits. I extrapolate from these age-specific estimates to calculate the share of the

overall increase that can be attributed to the VA mortgage program. I find that the program can

explain about 7.4 percent of the overall increase in home ownership from 1940 to 1960, and about

25 percent of the increase for men of the ages affected by the program. To the extent that the VA

program increased house prices, as argued by Vigdor (2006), it is possible that this figure may be

an overestimate, reflecting crowd-out of non-veterans rather than net increases in home ownership.

However, investigation of cross-state variation in the veteran share of the population turns up little

evidence that the estimates are driven by crowd-out: across a variety of controls and specifications,

a greater veteran presence is, if anything, positively associated with non-veterans’ rates of home

ownership. Hence, these estimates are likely to be a lower bound on the impact of the VA program.

Moreover, they also serve as a lower bound on the overall impact of changes in home finance in the

mid-century rise in home ownership: a rough calculation suggests that broader trends in mortgage

terms may explain about 40 percent of the 1940-1960 increase.

    This paper provides a rigorous empirical link between the aggregate mid-century increase in
   12
        Of course 1940 need not be the base year – the counterfactual 1960 age profile can be compared to any Census
year.

home ownership, the transformation in the age structure of ownership, and contemporaneous

changes in mortgage terms that may have relaxed liquidity constraints. In addition to shedding

new light on the role of interventions in mortgage markets in the 1940’s and 1950’s, this paper

complements work on the impacts of veterans’ education benefits (Bound and Turner, 2002; Stan-

ley, 2003; Page, 2006) by investigating the effects of other major benefits provided under the GI

Bills. A similar paper to this one is Yamashita (2008), who examines discontinuities in home own-

ership around the World War II break in 1960 and 1980 and finds similar results; Yamashita does

not examine the Korean War break, which is what allows estimation of a counterfactual 1960 age

profile here.13 In a study of population loss from central cities in the postwar period, Boustan and

Shertzer (forthcoming) investigate the impact of World War II veteran status on suburban resi-

dence (although not home ownership). As noted above, Vigdor (2006) also examines the VA home

loan program, but focuses primarily on whether it affected house prices: in doing so he provides an

estimate of the effect of VA eligibility on home ownership as of 1970, based on direct comparisons

of veterans to non-veterans. I compare his findings to my own for 1960 below.



2        Background

2.1      Trends in housing tenure and mortgage terms over the 20th century

In the history of living arrangements in the United States over the 20th century, the period from

1940 to 1960 was distinctive in terms of the large overall increase in home ownership. Figure 1 shows

the share of occupied dwelling units that were owner-occupied, the measure of ‘home ownership’ for

which the most complete time series data exist.14 Home ownership rose from 44 percent in 1940 to

62 percent in 1960. A fact that has gone unrecognized in much of the recent economics literature
    13
      I became aware of Yamashita’s unpublished work after completing the main analysis and a draft of this paper.
In addition to differences in implementation and my examination of the Korean War break, I do more to rule out
direct effects of military service as a driving factor. Yamashita offers a discussion of the effects of the program by
race, which I do not examine here.
   14
      The data from the Decennial Census are available at http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/census/
historic/owner.html. The figures for 1944, 1945, and 1947 are estimates, from supplements to the October 1944,
November 1945, and April 1947 sample surveys for the Monthly Report on the Labor Force (U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1945, 1946, 1947). The figure for 1956 is from the National Housing Inventory (U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1958).




                                                          5
is that more than half of the overall increase over these two decades took place by the end of 1945.

Since the VA home loan program gave out relatively few loans before the end of World War II,

ideally one would be able to measure the contribution of the VA to the increase in home ownership

after 1945. My empirical analysis, however, focuses on home ownership at the level of the individual

rather than that of the dwelling unit, and therefore provides an estimate of the counterfactual 1960

home ownership rate at the individual level. Since 1940 is the last year before the creation of the

VA home loan program for which microdata are available for calculating an individual-level home

ownership rate, my discussion emphasizes the change from that year.

    In the following descriptive statistics and the analysis below, I restrict the sample to US-born

men 18 years old and above, and classify an individual as a home owner if he was the household

head or spouse of the head in an owner-occupied dwelling.15 By this measure, the increase in home

ownership was also most striking from 1940 to 1960, increasing from 27 to 53 percent.16

    The crucial characteristic of the mid-century increase in home ownership was that it largely

represented a change in the age pattern of ownership. This is evident in Figure 2, which shows

ownership rates for men 18 and above, by age, in Censuses from 1900 to 1980.17 The age profile of

home ownership was stable in every year up to 1940, and nearly linear up to age 60, but from 1960

onwards became strikingly more concave. Home ownership rates for men in their early 30’s more

than doubled, while home ownership among older age groups increased substantially less in these

two decades.18 A natural interpretation is that the increase in ownership in the 1940’s and 1950’s

largely represented earlier purchases among individuals who would have otherwise purchased later

in life.
   15
      Individual-level data on home ownership come from IPUMS Census microdata (Ruggles et al., 2008). The
microdata list a single head and tenure status for each household. In addition to identifying owners in this way,
I classify an individual as a renter if he is the head or the spouse of the head in a renter-occupied unit, or is a
boarder in a dwelling owned by someone else, and as ‘living with relatives’ if he is otherwise related to the head.
The remainder, always under 8 percent, encompasses group quarters, such as military barracks or rooming houses;
domestic employees; and other arrangements that could not be classified. Microdata from the 1950 Census of Housing
were destroyed after tabulation (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1984), so in these statistics and the analysis below no
information is given on living arrangements in 1950.
   16
      Aggregate trends in individual-level living arrangements are shown in Appendix Figure A3.1.
   17
      For visual clarity in interpreting the 1940-60 change, 1990 and 2000 are not shown. In these years, the age profile
was somewhat less steep but its basic concavity persisted.
   18
      Conditioning on household head status gives, as one might expect, higher home ownership rates for both the
youngest and the oldest age groups, and a nearly linear age profile of home ownership well beyond age 60 in 1940
and earlier.



                                                           6
    The observed decrease in the age at first home ownership suggests that changes in finance played

a central role in changes in housing markets between 1940 and 1960. Table 1 shows observed loan

terms on the stock of first mortgages in 1950, 1960 and 1970, from the Census Residential Finance

Survey, and compares these terms to ‘typical’ loan terms of the 1920’s.19 It also compares VA loans

to those of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which provided insurance on somewhat less

generous terms than VA loans, and to ‘conventional’ loans that had no government insurance.

    Down-payments fell substantially between 1920 and 1960, as reflected by increases in the median

loan-to-value ratio (LTV). In 1920 a down-payment of 40 to 50 percent would have been needed,

but by 1960 the median down-payment in the stock of first mortgages was about 20 percent. The

lower down-payments were concentrated in the government-insured market: VA-guaranteed loans

typically had the lowest down-payments, with a median of about 9 percent, followed by FHA with

a median of about 17 percent. A well-known feature of VA loans is that they were often available

with no down-payment: between one-fifth and one-third of the stock of VA loans in each Census

year from 1950 to 1970 had LTV’s of 100 percent or more.

    Lower down-payments were accompanied by lengthening loan maturities. Maturities lengthened

in all sectors of the market. As a result, monthly payments remained more or less stable as loan-

to-value ratios increased. The median term was similar for VA and FHA loans, while conventional

loans had substantially shorter maturities. Government-insured mortgages also typically had lower

interest rates than conventional loans, due in part to interest rate ceilings on government loans:

VA interest rates, for example, were initially capped at 4 percent.


2.2     The VA home loan guaranty program

The easier terms observed for VA mortgages were associated with a home loan guarantee program

that was initially authorized under the Servicemen’s Readjustment Act of 1944, better known as

the GI Bill. The main VA home loan program, under Section 501, was not a loan directly from the
   19
     Figures for the 1920’s come from Aaron (1972), and originally from the NBER’s Urban Real Estate Finance
Project; Morton (1956) provides a description of the results and sample. As discussed there, the sample may not
be entirely representative of the population of loans in the 1920’s, so these figures should be interpreted with some
caution. A full picture of lending in the 1920’s would also require discussion of junior mortgages and the arrangements
offered by Building and Loan associations (Snowden, 2010).




                                                          7
government, but rather a guarantee to lenders against losses on home loans that had been approved

by the VA, up to a specified amount.20 The guarantee eliminated much of the risk to the lender,

allowing easier terms for borrowers. Eligibility for this loan guarantee was one of several benefits

extended to veterans, with the broad aim of speeding readjustment to civilian life.21 Eligibility for

the veterans’ housing benefit was determined by dates of service: an individual was eligible under

the 1944 GI Bill if he or she had served for at least 90 days, with some service occurring between

September 16, 1940 and the official termination of the war, later determined to be July 25, 1947.

The program was initially intended to last only a few years, but was later extended and re-extended

several times before becoming permanent. Subsequent GI Bills covered veterans of other periods

– the Korean War GI Bill (passed in 1952) covered individuals who served between June 17, 1950

and January 31, 1955, and the ‘Cold War’ GI Bill (passed in 1966) ultimately covered individuals

who began service after January 1955, although slightly less generously.22

    In order to scale the effects of VA-eligibility on home ownership that I discuss below, it is useful

to clarify the size of the financial advantage conferred by the program. My discussion emphasizes

differences in down-payments between VA and alternative terms. Interest rates were typically

slightly lower for VA loans, which tended to attenuate the increase in monthly payments when

down-payments were reduced, holding the loan term constant. But based on the terms actually

observed for different loan types, VA loans may not have had the lowest monthly payments.23

    Herzog and Earley (1970) provide data on terms for VA and FHA loans originated in each year

from 1946 to 1967, giving some indication as to how much eligibility would have relaxed liquidity

constraints for veterans at different points in time. I present some of their data in Appendix
  20
      If a borrower became delinquent, the mortgagee would typically be expected to foreclose and convey the property
to the VA, which would compensate the lender for losses incurred. As of 1945, the guarantee was limited to 50 percent
of the outstanding loan amount at any point in the life of the loan, up to a maximum of $4,000, but the limit was
relaxed in later years.
   21
      The following discussion of the VA home loan program follows ORC Macro (2004) and Aaron (1972).
   22
      Active-duty servicemembers were made eligible under the Veterans’ Housing Amendments Act of 1976.
   23
      Consider, for example, purchasing a $7,500 house in 1950 under VA and FHA loan terms. (The median self-
reported value of one-unit owner-occupied structures in 1950 was $7,354. Median house values reported in this section
come from http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/census/historic/values.html.) Using the median terms
given in Table 1, a 20-year VA loan with a 10 percent down-payment and 4 percent interest rate, used to purchase a
$7,500 house, would have a monthly payment of about $41. The monthly payment for a 20-year FHA loan with a 20
percent down-payment and a 4.5 percent interest rate used to purchase the same house would have a lower monthly
payment, about $38. (If the VA loan had a 20 percent down-payment but other terms were the same, the monthly
payment would be a little more than $36.)



                                                         8
Table A3.1. Over the 1950’s, average loan-to-value ratios for VA loans typically exceeded those

for FHA loans by about 5 to 10 percentage points. For loans originated in 1960, the average

LTV for VA loans was slightly over 95 percent and that for FHA slightly under 91 percent.24 On

average, by 1960 those who borrowed under the VA program were probably riskier than FHA

borrowers,25 so the differences in average terms are likely to understate the gap between the terms

the same individual would receive under the VA and the FHA. To a first approximation, then, it

seems reasonable to scale the 1960 results by supposing that VA eligibility would have reduced the

required down-payment by about 10 percentage points. Between 1960 and 1970, LTV’s rose for

both VA and FHA loans, but the difference between them remained similar. By 1967, LTV’s for

VA loans averaged about 97.5 percent and for FHA loans about 93 percent. Hence, in terms of

down-payment requirements, a veteran’s alternative option improved over the 1960’s, although not

by a great deal.26

    A large share of veterans used the housing benefit, and loans granted under the VA program

represented a substantial portion of the mortgage market in the postwar period. Estimates from

the 1977 National Survey of Veterans suggest that of about 17 million male veterans of World War

II and the Korean War living at the time, roughly 6.3 million had used a VA loan, and 5.5 million

had used a VA loan for their first home (Hammond, 1980). Widespread use of the benefit made

VA loans a substantial share of the overall market: over the period from 1946 through 1960, VA

loans composed about 16 percent of the total dollar volume of all nonfarm mortgage recordings of

$20,000 or less, and about 12 percent of the total number.27

    Responses from the 1977 Survey of Veterans also suggest that the availability of VA loans

induced earlier home purchase, or purchase of a more expensive house, for a large segment of the
  24
      The data in Herzog and Earley (1970) separate loans for new and existing houses; I weight these by the share
of VA and FHA loans for each type, using data from Federal Home Loan Bank Board (1961).
   25
      In 1960, FHA borrowers had incomes 25 to 30 percent higher than the median nonfarm family income, while
VA borrowers had incomes only about 9 percent higher than the median (Herzog and Earley, 1970).
   26
      An alternative scaling that incorporates other terms of the loan is to take the difference in present discounted
values of loans with the average VA and average FHA terms. Doing so with the 1960 average terms (VA: 95 percent
LTV, 5.25 percent interest rate, 27-year maturity; FHA: 91 percent LTV, 5.75 percent interest rate, 27-year maturity)
for the median house – $11,900 in 1960 USD; $58,600 in 2000 USD – gives a difference of about $2900 in 2000 USD,
using a discount rate of 4 percent.
   27
      These figures are my calculations using data from Housing and Home Finance Agency (1961). FHA was of
comparable magnitude, making up about 13 percent of the total dollar volume between 1946 and 1960.

veteran population.28 For veterans who reported using a VA loan for their first home, the 1977

survey asked if they would have been able to purchase the home without the VA loan. About 61

percent of World War II and Korean War veterans who had used a VA loan for their first home

reported that they would not have had a sufficient down-payment for the house without the VA

loan; an additional 6 percent said that they would have purchased a less expensive house. About

30 percent said they could have purchased the home anyway (the remainder gave either multiple

answers or no answer).

     Given their scale, the VA and FHA programs almost certainly influenced terms in conventional

lending. Aaron (1972), for example, argues that the VA and FHA led to more liberal terms in

conventional markets by demonstrating that smaller down-payments and longer maturities would

not increase risk as much as lenders had anticipated. More concretely, the FHA in particular was

credited with standardizing the analysis of mortgage lending risk, and its creation in 1934 with the

intent of providing fully amortized, high-LTV mortgages also necessitated the modification of laws

in many states that restricted state-regulated financial institutions from investing in mortgages

with LTV’s of more than 50 or 60 percent (Semer et al., 1976). The indirect effects of the FHA

and VA were surely important, but in this paper I focus on the direct effect of the VA.



3         Conceptual framework

The theoretical literature embedding tenure choice in life-cycle models (e.g., Artle and Varaiya

(1978)) clarifies the impact of a reduction in down-payments on home ownership rates of different

age groups. This literature typically assumes that all individuals prefer to own, either because

of ‘pride of ownership,’ or because favorable tax treatment or the elimination of agency problems

between the landlord and tenant makes owner-occupied housing less costly than equivalent rental

housing. If a down-payment is necessary to obtain financing for the purchase of housing, young

people without sufficient assets for a down-payment may depress consumption early in life in order

to have greater consumption later. Under these conditions, relaxing the down-payment constraint

can induce earlier purchase as the burden of reduced consumption in the beginning phase of the life
    28
         The following estimates are based on the tabulations in Appendix E of Hammond (1980).


                                                          10
cycle is alleviated. Broadly speaking, since young individuals with few assets are most likely to face

this constraint, they see larger increases in ownership from a relaxation of down-payments than

do older individuals, who are likely to have already accumulated assets. However, if the required

down-payment is not reduced to zero, the largest effects may not be for the youngest individuals,

who still need to save for the smaller but positive down-payment. It is also possible that under a

high down-payment regime some individuals never choose to reduce their consumption enough to

purchase a home, so that a reduction in down-payments may shift them from never owning into

owning at some point. Hence, it is not obvious theoretically that the only effect of easier finance

would be to shift purchase earlier.

    Simulations such as those in Hayashi, Ito and Slemrod (1988) and Sheiner (1995) have calibrated

such models to fit recent periods, and have found evidence that these constraints are quantitatively

important.29 In Appendix 2, I present a simple model of asset accumulation and tenure choice,

and calibrate it using characteristics of the 1960 housing market. For the ages I examine and the

differences between VA and alternative terms, this calibration suggests that I should find larger

effects at younger ages.



4     Effects of Service and Benefits on Home Ownership

4.1    Data and Empirical Design

The main empirical analysis is based on IPUMS Census microdata in 1960, 1970, and 1980 (Ruggles

et al., 2008). I use the 1960 1 percent sample, an aggregation of the three 1 percent 1970 Form 2

samples, and a 3 percent sample drawn from the 1980 5 percent State sample. I use the remainder

of the 1980 5 percent State sample, in addition to four remaining 1% samples from the 1980

Census, for the break searches described below (I refer to this sample as the 1980 ‘break’ sample, to

distinguish it from the ‘analysis’ samples). I restrict the sample to men born in the United States

within the relevant bandwidth: for the pilot bandwidth, this includes men born from 1925 to 1936.
  29
     Ortalo-Magné and Rady (1999) emphasize the differential effects of reduced down-payments by age groups in a
more general model with overlapping generations and supply constraints, with a similar finding that easier terms on
housing finance leads to a shift towards ownership at younger ages.




                                                        11
Other sample restrictions are discussed in Appendix 1.

    The steep declines in military service by date of birth for men coming of age at the end of

World War II and the Korean War are evident in Figure 3, which shows the share of men in the

1960 Census who reported being veterans of the World War II or Korean War periods.30 The two

steep declines in the probability of military service were associated with cohorts coming of age

for military service just as inductions fell at the end of hostilities in World War II in 1945, and

similarly in the Korean War in 1953. Throughout this discussion, I will refer to the first break,

associated with the decline in inductions in 1945, as the “World War II break” and to the second,

corresponding to the decline in 1953, as the “Korean War break.”

    To estimate the effect of service and benefits on home ownership or other outcomes, ideally each

break would have some marginal date of birth at which the probability of military service exhibits

a discrete shift, to which a regression discontinuity design could be applied directly. As is evident

in Figure 3, however, at the national level the decline occurred rapidly but not at a single marginal

date of birth. As I discuss in section 4.3, the absence of a national cutoff was due in part to local

variation in the implementation of the draft; even if states or localities followed draft rules with

marginal dates of birth, to the extent that these marginal dates are different, the national series

will show more continuity of service levels by birth cohort. I lack the data to exploit this local

variation fully, but explore it as a robustness check below.31

    The main estimates, in the spirit of a regression discontinuity design, address heterogeneity in

age by estimating local polynomial regressions at each break. Without a single marginal date of

birth for military service at the national level, determining a specific cutoff at which to estimate a

discontinuity is a challenge in implementing this approach. I do so using structural break estimation

techniques in the ‘break’ sample, as described below. Given the cutoffs estimated in the break
   30
      As noted above, veterans’ benefits were not extended to veterans of other periods until 1966. I identify a veteran
as an ‘eligible veteran’ in 1960 if he reports having served during the World War II or Korean War periods, and as
an eligible veteran in 1970 and 1980 if he reports having served during any period. Appendix Figure A3.2 shows the
share of the same cohorts that reported being veterans of any conflict in the later Census years.
   31
      This discussion has focused on variation in the share veteran by birth cohort primarily relating to the propensity
to be drafted, rather than the propensity to volunteer. There may have been some men who would have volunteered
under a ‘high’ military manpower need regime but not under a ‘low’ one, inducing discontinuous variation in volun-
teering rates. To the extent that this is the case, these men are included among the ‘compliers,’ but the estimates
can still be regarded as causal.




                                                          12
sample, I apply a regression discontinuity framework in the analysis sample to estimate the size

of the decline in the probability of military service at each cutoff. The estimate is the difference

between two counterfactuals: one predicting the probability of military service for an individual at

the cutoff based on the cohorts immediately preceding him, and one predicting his probability of

service based on the cohorts following him. Implementing the same approach with housing or other

outcomes as the dependent variable, I then follow standard practice in fuzzy RD designs and scale

the reduced form estimate by the estimate of the discontinuity in veteran status. In practice, the

implementation uses a two-stage least squares estimator, in which I use birth before the cutoff as

an instrument for veteran status.

    The pilot bandwidth for the analysis is three years on either side of each break.32 In the baseline

specification, I follow Imbens and Lemieux (2008) and estimate a local linear regression within this

bandwidth in the three Census cross-sections:33


 yit = αt +βt 1(yqobit < c)+γt (yqobit −c)1(yqobit < c)+δt (yqobit −c)1(yqobit > c)+λ0t Xit +εit , (1)


for individual i observed in year t ∈ {1960, 1970, 1980}, where c represents the relevant cutoff,

yqobit his year and quarter of birth, 1(yqobit < c) indicates that he was born before the cutoff,

1(yqobit > c) indicates birth after the cutoff, and (yqobit − c) represents the time in quarters

between his date of birth and the cutoff. Xit is a vector of controls, including fixed effects for the

quarter of the year in which an individual was born, fixed effects for state of birth, and an indicator

for nonwhites. Coarse measurement of date of birth suggests clustering standard errors by year and

quarter of birth (Lee and Card, 2008), but conventional heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors

are typically of similar magnitude or larger: in the tables that follow I present the latter.34

    To determine the cutoffs, I apply the structural break estimation techniques used in, for example,
   32
       A cross-validation procedure following Imbens and Lemieux (2008), applied to both the first stage and the
reduced form, suggests a bandwidth of 3 or 4 years for housing outcomes; the cross-validation criterion is relatively
flat for the first stage but suggests that a shorter bandwidth would be better. I choose the 3-year bandwidth, and
present specifications with shorter bandwidths in Appendix Table A3.2.
    33
       The t subscripts indicate that coefficients are allowed to vary by Census year, and that individuals are not
necessarily followed over time.
    34
       Another issue is accounting for estimation of the location of the break in the standard errors; but as discussed
by Card et al. (2008), if a break does exist, the estimator of its location is n-consistent, and variance estimators that
treat the location of the break as known are consistent.


                                                           13
Chay et al. (2005) and Card et al. (2008). To determine a location for the World War II cutoff, I use

the 1980 break sample, and limit the sample to men born between 1925 and 1930. I then estimate

separate models with candidate cutoffs placed between each pair of neighboring birth cohorts from

1926 to 1929, and choose the cutoff that gives the highest R2 in a regression with flexible linear

trends. In the search for the Korean War cutoff, I restrict the sample to men born between 1931

and 1936, and consider candidate cutoffs between 1932 and 1935. Applied to either the probability

of being a veteran of the World War II or Korean War period, or to being a veteran of any period,

this technique places the World War II cutoff between 1927q4 and 1928q1 (which I will refer to as

a cutoff of January 1, 1928) and the Korean War cutoff between 1933q3 and 1933q4 (which I refer

to as October 1, 1933). Comfortingly, a visual inspection of the first stage suggests these cutoffs

are reasonable.


4.2   Results

Table 2 presents means of key variables for the two cohorts around each break in each Census

year, to aid in the interpretation of magnitudes of the effects estimated below. Men at the World

War II break were 32 years old at the time of the 1960 Census. Slightly more than half owned

their homes in 1960. The share rose to 73 percent in 1970, and to 80 percent in 1980. The men

around the Korean War break were 26 in the 1960 Census, and 28 percent owned their homes.

This increased to 66 percent in 1970, and to 79 percent in 1980. In the 1960 data, therefore, one

observes these cohorts as they transition rapidly into home ownership; subsequent changes between

decades reflected a leveling of the age-ownership profile.

   Table 3 presents estimates of equation (1), and Figure 3 shows the corresponding means by

cohort and estimated trends for both the first stage and reduced form. First-stage estimates of the

decline in the probability of being a benefits-eligible veteran in 1960 are large and highly significant

at each break: men on the earlier side of the World War II break were 11 percentage points more

likely to be eligible than those born slightly later. The corresponding estimate of the Korean War

break is 16 percentage points.

   The IV estimates in columns (3) and (6) suggest that being an eligible veteran led to large



                                                  14
increases in the probability of owning one’s home in 1960. For individuals coming of age at the end

of World War II, the estimated treatment effect of service and benefits is 13 percentage points. The

predicted probability of home ownership for a comparable non-veteran at the break is 44 percent,

suggesting that service and benefits increased the rate of ownership at the World War II break

by about 30 percent. For individuals coming of age at the end of the Korean War, the estimated

treatment effect in 1960 is larger, at 18 percentage points.35 The predicted probability of home

ownership for comparable non-veterans is 22 percent at the break, giving an 80 percent increase in

the probability of home ownership at the Korean War break.

    Section 3 suggested that effects of easier terms on housing finance should decline as individuals

age and accumulate assets. One implication is that tracing the same cohorts over time, the size

of the estimated difference in home ownership at each cutoff should decline. Indeed, the results

for home ownership in 1970 and 1980 give no evidence of significantly higher ownership in either

of the later years, at either break.36 Point estimates are negative, statistically indistinguishable

from zero, and significantly different from the 1960 coefficients. A natural interpretation of this

finding is that the VA program did not induce home ownership among individuals who never would

have purchased otherwise, but rather increased aggregate home ownership rates by shifting home

purchase earlier in life.

    A useful aspect of this empirical setting is that there is an alternative test for heterogeneity of

effects by age, which is to compare the World War II and Korean War estimates within a single

Census year. Doing so is helpful to the extent that convergence at the cutoffs over time could have

been associated with improvements in terms on non-VA loans over the 1960’s. Table 1 suggests
  35
       The use of educational deferments during the Korean War somewhat complicates interpretation of the IV esti-
mates at the Korean War break, but if there is a bias, it is likely to be negative rather than positive. As emphasized
in the literature on the Vietnam-era draft (e.g., Card and Lemieux (2001)), men at risk of being drafted may have
entered college as a way to avoid military service. Given that deferments were not introduced until 1951, after the
Korean War had begun, this is likely to be more of an issue in interpreting the estimate at the Korean War break. I
cannot definitively say how much of the reduced-form difference should be attributed to greater educational attain-
ment among non-veterans in the cohorts at higher risk of being drafted. But in my 1960 analysis sample, a simple
difference suggests that at age 26, college completion was associated with a lower probability of home ownership,
by about 4.5 percentage points. If higher risk of being drafted increased rates of college completion, and if the true
effect of college completion on home ownership at age 26 is negative, it suggests that my estimate at the Korean War
break is biased downward.
    36
       The magnitude of the first stage declines at the Korean War break between 1960 and 1970; this is due to a
change in the definition of ‘benefits-eligible’ veteran from being a veteran of the World War II or Korean War period
to being a veteran of any period, as described in Section 2.



                                                         15
that VA loans were still available on easier terms than FHA loans in 1970, but at a level different

from earlier years, which could have driven convergence even in the absence of heterogeneity by

age. But comparing the results for 1960 in columns (3) and (6) of Table 3, estimates of the veteran

effect for the younger men at the Korean War break are larger in both percent and percentage

point terms. The estimated differences between the breaks within Census years are not statistically

significant, but the general pattern of effects is consistent with the prediction that the effects of the

VA program should decline with age.37 Moreover, the estimates at the two ages in 1960 can be used

to assess whether or not the fade-out by age 36, as suggested by the 1970 results, is reasonable. As

I discuss in Section 6, a linear extrapolation of the percent effects from 1960 suggests that I should

not observe effects of the VA program by age 36.38


4.3     Robustness

Given the absence of a national date-of-birth cutoff for the draft, it is useful to show robustness

of the main results to alternative ways of exploiting the variation in military service across birth

cohorts. A first alternative that removes some cohorts with ‘intermediate’ levels of treatment is

to drop the birth cohort that immediately precedes each cutoff and the cohort that immediately

follows it, thus extending the extrapolation to the cutoff by an additional quarter. Doing so has

little effect on the World War II estimate – it increases to 13.6 percentage points (an effect of 31

percent relative to a predicted probability of ownership for comparable non-veterans of 44 percent),

and remains significant at the 10 percent level. The Korean War estimate falls to 13 percentage

points (a 54 percent effect relative to a corresponding predicted value of 24 percent), but is of

broadly similar magnitude and still significant at the 1 percent level. A full set of results are shown

in Appendix Table A3.4.
   37
       Just as a comparison of estimates at the same break over time may confound an ‘age’ effect with a ‘time’ effect, a
comparison of estimates at the two breaks within the same cross section may confound an ‘age’ effect with a ‘cohort’
effect. If the characteristics of compliers are different at the two breaks, for example, comparison within a single
Census year is a comparison of local average treatment effects for two different populations. Neither comparison is
entirely satisfactory, but by exploiting the presence of two breaks to make both comparisons, I am able to provide at
least some degree of cross-validation.
    38
       To the extent that these estimates overstate the true speed of fade-out of the effects by age in 1960, the estimates
of the impact of veterans’ benefits on the aggregate rate of home ownership, presented below, are likely to be an
understatement of their true effect.




                                                            16
    A second alternative is to estimate a ‘cohort-trend’ model similar to that used in much of

the previous literature on the GI Bill.39 This approach rests on the assumption that within the

range of cohorts included in the sample, the share of each cohort that served in the military was

driven by military manpower needs and not by other between-cohort differences. In each Census

cross-section, I regress the average outcome for a birth cohort on the share of men who were

benefits-eligible veterans in the cohort, controlling for an underlying trend. That is, in a single

cross-section from year t, I estimate


                                     y ct = αt + βt V ct + γt (c) + λ0t Xct + εct                                   (2)


where c indexes cohorts, V ct is the share of men who were benefits-eligible veterans in birth cohort

c in year t, γt (c) is either a linear or a quadratic cohort trend, and Xct is a vector of controls. This

model has the benefit that it does not require a discrete shift in the probability of veteran status

at a single date of birth. As a main specification, however, it is less natural for examining effects

that may be heterogeneous in age, since it estimates an effect of veteran status over all the ages in

the sample, rather than one at a clear cutoff. In my estimation of the model, I attempt to address

heterogeneity of treatment effects by estimating the equation in narrow windows around the two

periods of decline.40

    I present estimates of the cohort-trend model of equation (2) in Table 4.41 With controls, the

cohort-trend model gives estimates of 15 percentage points at the World War II break and 19

percentage points at the Korean War break.42 The Korean War estimates are significant at the
   39
      Examples are Bound and Turner (2002), Page (2006), and Bedard and Deschênes (2006). Angrist and Krueger
(1994) use a slightly different form of variation that exploits within-year-of-birth differences in call-up rates.
   40
      Following Page (2006) and Bound and Turner (2002), I have also explored models that assume a parametric
form of heterogeneity, interacting the veteran share with a linear or quadratic trend. With home ownership as an
outcome, I found the results to be sensitive to different specifications of the underlying trend. Un-interacted versions
within narrow windows are substantially more stable across specifications.
   41
      Estimates over a wider bandwidth and with alternative specifications of the underlying trend are shown in
Appendix Table A3.3.
   42
      Note that the World War II and Korean War veteran shares are not entered separately in equation (2). At the
World War II break, where those on the earlier side mostly served in World War II, and those on the later side mostly
served in the Korean War, this model imposes the restriction that the effects of military service and benefits in the
two conflicts are the same as of year t (1960 or later). Justifications for doing so are that the housing benefits were
very similar for the two conflicts, and that by 1960 men on both sides of the World War II break would have been
back for several years. If the ‘true’ World War II effect as of 1960 was larger than the corresponding ‘true’ Korean
War effect, my estimate at the World War II break is likely an overestimate; conversely, if the ‘true’ World War II


                                                          17
5 percent level using conventional standard errors; the World War II estimates are not. It is also

notable that there is no evidence for a positive effect of veteran status on home ownership at either

break in 1970 or 1980.43

    A final alternative is to estimate ‘re-centered’ specifications that exploit the local character of

the draft. For the decline in service rates associated with the end of hostilities in Korea, for example,

the absence of a single, discrete shift in the national series is due in part to a local component of the

draft: men were liable to be drafted from age 18 12 , but there was a general policy of drafting older

men first, and in particular to exhaust the supply of men 19 and above in the local draft board

area before drafting younger men (U.S. Selective Service System, 1953). Even if the decision rule of

each local draft board entailed a discrete shift in the probability of being drafted at some marginal

date of birth, when averaged over all draft boards the actual share veteran by cohort could exhibit

a more gradual decline.

    Figure 4 depicts the rate of military service by date of birth for men born in Ohio and California,

and provides evidence both that local variation in the draft may explain the non-discrete shift in

the national series, and also that state of birth, in some cases, provides a reasonable proxy for an

individual’s local draft board regime. In both states discontinuities in the probability of military

service are visually evident, but the location of the breaks differs between the two states.44 I apply

the structural break technique described above to estimate state-specific breaks in the 1980 break

sample. I then ‘re-center’ by generating a new running variable for each individual that represents

the distance between his quarter of birth and the cutoff estimated for his state of birth. To address

possible recall bias, or differences in the surviving veteran population in 1980 relative to 1960, I also

estimate state breaks in the 1960 analysis sample (referred to below as ‘1960 breaks’ to distinguish

them from the ‘1980 breaks’), but given the potential biases arising from using the same sample
effect was smaller then my estimate is probably an underestimate. With home ownership as an outcome, the results
when both are entered separately are unstable across alternative specifications. Men at the Korean War break would
have been too young to serve in World War II, so this caveat does not apply there.
    43
       In 1970 the estimate at the Korean War break with controls is, in fact, significant and negative, although this
is not the case in the local linear estimates discussed above.
    44
       Other states do not always exhibit discontinuities as visually evident as these, presumably because of more
heterogeneity across draft boards within the states, marginal dates of birth falling in the middle of a birth quarter,
or application of a different decision rule by draft boards. A full set of state graphs, with the corresponding break
points, are shown at the end of Appendix 3.




                                                         18
for both the break search and analysis, I treat these results as supplementary.

    Re-centered local linear specifications present further evidence supporting the main estimates.

Figure 5 shows the means and estimated trends at each break in 1960, and Table 5 presents the

corresponding estimates. Downward shifts in the probability of home ownership are perhaps more

visually evident in these graphs than in the un-recentered versions, but the point estimates are

quite similar. Using the 1980 breaks gives estimates of 15 percentage points for each break in 1960,

very similar to the main specifications. These correspond to 36 and 67 percent increases relative

to comparable non-veterans at the World War II and Korean War breaks, respectively. The 1960

breaks also give an estimate of 15 percentage points at the World War II break in 1960 (a 35

percent increase), and 10 percentage points at the Korean War break (a 38 percent increase). All

of the estimates of the veteran effect on home ownership in 1960 are statistically significant at

conventional levels.

    The estimated effects of service and benefits on home ownership are quite stable across specifi-

cations: the alternative approaches all provide evidence of large, positive effects of veteran status

on home ownership early in life, and attenuation of the effect of veteran status in later years.

Generalizing the results to mortgage subsidies that are not bundled with other benefits or military

service itself, however, requires disentangling the different aspects of the ‘veteran treatment’; this

is the task of the next section.



5    Evaluating alternative explanations

The results presented above answer the question of what impact the combination of an individual’s

military service and eligibility for veterans’ benefits had on his housing outcomes, but does not

necessarily isolate the effect of easier mortgage financing. It is not immediately obvious whether

one should expect service or other benefits to have had a positive or negative effect on the probability

of home ownership. Military service may have reduced rates of ownership on return to civilian life if

separation from the labor market lowered earnings. On the other hand, service may have increased

the probability of ownership if temporary separation from civilian life led to preferences for earlier

household formation, or lower desired mobility, after service was complete. Education benefits may

                                                  19
have increased ownership rates either through higher permanent income or other complementarities

with home ownership; other benefits, such as job training, may have also increased earnings. To

the extent that higher education benefits increased desired mobility during college attendance,45

they could have instead reduced the probability of home ownership at younger ages. In three

complementary analyses below, I assess the potential importance of these other factors.


5.1    Possible impacts of other benefits

There are several reasons to think it unlikely that veterans’ eligibility for education and training

benefits explains the positive effects on home ownership that I find in 1960. Past work on the

draft and educational benefits on educational attainment, such as Stanley (2003), has emphasized

that the World War II GI Bill was largely compensatory in its effects, making up for the large

disruptive effects of military service on education. At the Korean War break, the ownership effects

in 1960 are likely too early to be due to Korean War veterans taking advantage of their education

benefits. I find that a similar application of the regression discontinuity design estimates a net

positive effect of service and benefits on various measures of educational attainment in 1970, in

line with the findings of Bound and Turner (2002). Yet the same type of estimate also suggests

that high school completion rates were lower for earlier cohorts at the World War II break in all

three Census years, and provides no evidence for greater educational attainment for veterans at the

Korean War break in 1960. Moreover, even to the extent that education benefits under the GI Bills

more than compensated for the disruption of education during military service, the costs of service

also included forgone labor market experience, which likely depressed wages (Angrist, 1990).

   In the absence of complementarities between education and ownership as a form of housing

tenure, the natural argument for a positive effect of education benefits on home ownership in 1960

is through increased income. More broadly, other benefits, such as on-the-job training or preferences

in hiring, may have increased income for veterans as well. As a rough summary measure of the

possible effects of education or other benefits, it is therefore natural to test for discontinuities in

income across cohorts. However, the rapidly changing curvature of the income profile for these age
  45
    Studying the Vietnam draft, Malamud and Wozniak (forthcoming) suggest that one channel through which
education may increase mobility is through attending college in a different state.


                                                  20
groups makes an application of the RD framework somewhat more problematic.46 Nevertheless, I

test for discontinuities in the log of total personal income, conditional on positive income, using

the same approach as the main estimates in Section 4.2. I present the estimates in Table 6.47

There is little evidence based on these specifications that income could be driving the results for

the World War II break: I find a negative estimate, not significant at conventional levels. For the

Korean War break, the estimate suggests higher income for veterans, although it is worth noting

that the estimate declines in both size and significance when estimated using a shorter bandwidth,

as suggested by a cross-validation procedure.

    To explore further whether or not the documented effects of veteran status on home ownership

could be due to increased income or other effects of educational benefits, in columns (4) and (5)

of Table 6 I re-estimate the main specification adding log income and college completion as right-

hand-side variables. Controlling for these leads to a small increase in the estimate at the World

War II break and a small decrease in the estimate at the Korean War break, but the estimates

remain positive, statistically significant, and comparable in magnitude. These results, of course,

do not imply that other benefits played no role in higher home ownership rates for veterans, but

they do suggest that other benefits were not the primary cause.


5.2    Estimating service effects: World War I veterans

No national program of home loan benefits existed for veterans of the First World War. A similar

regression discontinuity analysis gives an estimate of the possible direct effects of service in World

War I that one may consider in evaluating the relevance of service effects to explaining the observed

differences in home ownership at the World War II and Korean War breaks. Due to state and

national veterans’ benefits that did exist after World War I, the estimates I present are likely an

upper bound on possible direct effects of service. These benefits included a generous national bonus

and slightly smaller bonuses in 21 states, as well as home loan benefits in four states.48
  46
      Indeed, a cross-validation procedure suggests using a shorter bandwidth for income than for home ownership.
  47
      As is evident in Table 2, almost all men at the cutoff earned positive income by 1960. I find no evidence of a
discontinuity in the probability of positive income at either break.
   48
      Dillingham (1952) provides a review of the national bonus, which was to be paid out in full in 1945 but which
could be used as a security for borrowing as early as 1925; the full amount of the bonus was eventually paid out in
1936. A survey of all state veterans’ benefits provided after World War I is given in U.S. House of Representatives


                                                        21
    I use IPUMS data from the 1920 and 1930 Censuses. These Censuses do not record year

or quarter of birth, only age in years. I calculate an approximate year of birth assuming each

individual’s birthday fell after the day of the Census. Because the 1920 Census did not ask about

veteran status, I report only reduced form estimates for 1920, but I report both reduced form and

IV estimates for 1930.49

    The upper panel of Figure 6 shows the share of each birth cohort reporting service in World

War I in the 1930 Census. Applying the same break search procedure as in the main analysis, I

locate a break between 1896 and 1897.50 A cross-validation procedure applied to both the first

stage and reduced form suggests a bandwidth of 5 years; the results below are not sensitive to the

choice of bandwidth.

    The results in Table 7 and the lower panel of Figure 6 offer no evidence that service in World

War I led to earlier home purchase. Although the first stage is large and significant, reduced form

coefficients in both 1920 and 1930 are very close to zero and fairly precise, as is the scaled estimate

for 1930. Moreover, to the extent that the benefits that were extended to World War I veterans

raised their rates of home ownership relative to non-veterans, it suggests that on net, the direct

effects of service were negative, not positive. The experience of World War I veterans thus weighs

against the notion that direct effects of service can explain the observed discontinuities for veterans

of World War II and the Korean War in 1960.


5.3    Further evidence on service effects: timing of purchase

The timing of use of the VA housing benefit, and home purchase for veterans, provides comple-

mentary evidence that the effects of veteran status on home ownership in 1960 were not driven

by service-induced preferences for earlier household formation. While the government provided

a guarantee to lenders, obtaining a loan still required that a private lender was willing to give a

veteran a loan on VA terms. An analysis of the timing of veterans’ home purchase relative to
(1945).
   49
      As shall be seen, the reduced form results in 1920 show little that would merit a two-sample IV procedure.
   50
      In particular, I limit the sample to men born from 1891 to 1902, place candidate cutoffs between each pair of
neighboring years of birth from 1892 to 1900, and estimate a piecewise linear model allowing flexible trends on either
side of each candidate cutoff. The break between 1896 and 1897 yields the model with the highest R2 .




                                                         22
non-veterans suggests that in periods when VA loans became more appealing to suppliers of funds,

and available at lower down-payments, veterans were differentially more likely to purchase homes.

    In the decade following World War II, the number and volume of VA loans exhibited large swings

from year to year. The year-to-year volatility in VA lending is evident in the upper panel of Figure

7, in which the bold line shows the number of VA loans closed, by quarter, from 1946 through 1956.

While the number peaked soon after World War II and again after the Korean War, the latter

peak appears not to be due solely to the return of Korean War veterans. I use annual figures on

the share of loans made under the World War II entitlement (U.S. Veterans Administration, 1962)

to estimate the number of loans to World War II veterans from 1952 onwards. The large share

of World War II veterans in the 1955 peak suggests that it was not driven solely by the return of

veterans from the Korean War.

    Given the presence of three large spikes in use of the benefit among World War II veterans, a

natural question is what drove these fluctuations, if not veteran demand shocks. An explanation

given by many contemporary observers, such as Klaman (1961) and the Veterans Administration

itself (e.g., U.S. Veterans Administration (1948)), was that they were driven in large part by

lenders’ willingness to supply loans on VA terms. In particular, the interest rate ceiling on VA

loans discussed in Section 2 meant that as yields on alternative investments increased, the market

could adjust only by reducing the supply of funds for VA mortgages and changing other terms

of the loans, such as down-payments.51 Conventional loans, on the other hand, had no interest

rate ceiling, while FHA loans had an interest rate ceiling that was higher than that on VA loans

and tended to be less binding.52 As a result, non-VA loans did not exhibit the same degree of

year-to-year volatility over this period that VA loans did.53 The lower panel of Figure 7 shows the

difference between the maximum interest rate for VA loans and the annualized yield on lowest-risk

corporate bonds. It is unmistakable that over this period rises and declines in the number of VA
  51
      Grebler (1960) noted that trading VA mortgages at prices below par was seen as having an “aura of ‘unethical’
practice,” and hence that mortgage discounts failed to adjust the yield on VA mortgages.
   52
      In the 1950 Residential Finance Survey, over 99 percent of the stock of VA mortgages had an interest rate of
4%, precisely at the cap, while roughly 25 percent of the stock of FHA mortgages had interest rates below the FHA
cap of 4.5% that was in place prior to 1950. In 1950, this cap was lowered to 4.25%.
   53
      Conventional loans did exhibit more pronounced seasonality than VA loans did, probably for reasons having to
do with the institutional structure of the market: see Klaman (1961), page 123.




                                                        23
loans track similar changes in the difference between VA rates and the yield on corporate bonds,

while any similar trend for non-VA loans appears much more muted.

    Rationing VA loans through higher down-payments may have been one way that markets ad-

justed.54 The top panel of Figure 8 shows the difference between the average LTV for VA loans

and that for FHA loans originated in each year for existing homes, and the bottom panel shows the

annual mean of the difference between the VA cap and the yield on corporate bonds. In years when

VA loans would have been more (less) appealing to suppliers of funds, the difference in average

loan-to-value ratios between VA and FHA loans was greater (smaller).

    To the extent that the increases in the number of VA loans reflect the supply of funds rather

than demand shocks, it is informative to ask whether periods when VA loans were available on easier

terms, relative to the alternatives, saw differentially greater rates of home purchase by veterans.

The early years of the Survey of Consumer Finances, which was carried out annually beginning in

1947, provide a rare source of data to do so. The SCF did not ask about entry into home ownership

consistently over time, but did ask reasonably consistently about purchase of a home the previous

year, and collected data on whether the head of each ‘spending unit’ was a veteran up through the

1957 survey.55 To focus on the age group most likely to be entering home ownership, in each year

I limit the sample to spending units whose heads were between 25 and 34 years old.56

    From the middle panel of Figure 8, it appears that in years when veterans had differentially

greater increases in access to credit, they also purchased homes at differentially higher rates. Spend-

ing units with World War II veterans were more likely to purchase than those without veterans in

each year.57 But the difference was greater in years when the top and bottom panels would sug-
   54
       Potentially amplifying this tendency were explicit minimum downpayment requirements for VA loans from late
1950 until April 1953 and from July 1955 to April 1958. These requirements were around 4 percent in the earlier
period (lower for less expensive and higher for more expensive houses) and 2 percent in the later period. Minimum
downpayments were raised for FHA loans in both periods as well. Grebler (1960), Klaman (1961), and Herzog and
Earley (1970) provide details.
    55
       The spending unit is the basic unit of observation in the SCF. It is defined as a group of related individuals
living in the same dwelling who pool their incomes for major items of expense. A married couple is always grouped
together, and an individual who does not earn an income over a certain threshold cannot form a separate spending
unit. Between 1947 and 1957, there were about 3,000 spending units interviewed in each year.
    56
       Unfortunately age is measured quite coarsely in the SCF, making it impossible to control for age more finely.
Hence, in any year the average age of veterans is likely to be different from non-veterans. From patterns of military
service by birth cohort, one can infer that for this age group, non-veterans would tend to be older than veterans up
until the last two or three years.
    57
       In this figure I exclude spending units with Korean War veterans, to de-emphasize any effects driven by purchase



                                                          24
gest that VA loans would be easier to obtain, or available with differentially lower down-payments.

Table 8 presents a quantitative estimate of this result: column (1) implies that an increase of 0.1

in the difference between the VA rate and the corporate bond yield is associated with an increase

in the rate of house purchase that is greater by 0.008 for veterans, a little more than 10 percent of

the average share of spending units buying a house each year.

    It is possible that these patterns simply reflect a situation in which military service induces

preferences for earlier home purchase, and in which veterans do not face liquidity constraints but

rather simply delay or accelerate their purchase to occur when VA loans are more available. But

these results seem more supportive of the hypothesis that eligibility for housing benefits led to earlier

purchase by relaxing borrowing constraints, and less supportive of the hypothesis that military

service itself drives the results shown in Section 4.2.



6    Discussion: Aggregate effects

What role did veterans’ housing benefits, and changes in mortgage terms more generally, play

in the mid-century increase in home ownership? I address these broader questions by using the

estimates provided above to predict the counterfactual home ownership rate at each age in 1960 in

the absence of veterans’ service and benefits. Since, as I have argued, the positive effects of veteran

status on home ownership seem to be driven primarily by housing benefits, in this section I will

refer to them more simply as the effects of housing benefits. In addition to assuming homogeneity

of treatment effects at a given age, the calculations in this section also assume that the estimates

of the effect of changing an individual’s eligibility can be applied to the thought experiment of

changing the eligibility of a large portion of the population. I attempt to shed some empirical light

on the magnitude and direction of possible general equilibrium effects below, and find suggestive

evidence that extrapolating from the partial equilibrium estimates could understate the effect of

the VA program.
immediately after a veteran’s return from war. Including them leads to no obvious difference in the graph.




                                                        25
6.1   How much of the time series can the VA explain?

As a first step, I focus on the specific ages to which the estimates apply directly. The main estimate

of the effect of veteran status at the World War II break, in Table 3, is 13 percentage points. In

1960, 69 percent of 32-year-old men were benefits-eligible veterans. These figures imply that home

ownership would have been about 9 percentage points lower in the absence of housing benefits,

about 26 percent of the 1940-60 change for 32-year old men (from 19 to 53 percent). Of 26-year-old

men in 1960, 44 percent were eligible veterans; the main estimate of the effect of veteran status for

these men is 18 percentage points. The same calculation suggests that the home ownership rate

for 26-year-old men would have been about 8 percentage points lower in the absence of housing

benefits, about 40 percent of the increase from 1940 to 1960 (from 9 to 29 percent).

   To estimate how much lower the overall rate of home ownership would have been in the absence

of veterans’ housing benefits, I must extrapolate from the effects I estimate directly to the effects

at other ages. Given only two points, I assume a linear decline in the percent effect with age.

Doing so yields the counterfactual age-home ownership profile illustrated in Figure 9, in which I

also show a counterfactual profile under the case in which all men were treated. The assumption

of linearly declining effects in percent terms implies a zero effect of the VA at ages 36 and above,

so both profiles are the same as the actual one for ages 36 and above (consistent with the finding

of no discontinuity in home ownership at the Korean War cutoff in 1970 and later, when these

individuals were 36 and older). As might be expected from age requirements for service during the

Korean War period, no men 22 or below are recorded as being benefits-eligible veterans in 1960.

Hence, the counterfactual profile with none eligible for benefits is the same as the actual profile for

ages 22 and below. Note that the two counterfactual age profiles provide some indication of how

much earlier veterans entered home ownership because they were veterans. The profile in which no

one is eligible crosses the 50 percent mark at about age 34; the profile in which all are eligible does

so at about age 29. A comparison suggests that VA benefits, had they been extended to all, would

have lowered the age at which the median individual was a home owner by about five years.

   The results imply that VA home loan benefits can explain a substantial share of the aggregate

trend in home ownership from 1940 to 1960. Using the observed share veteran and home ownership


                                                  26
rates in 1960, along with the extrapolated effects on home ownership, I calculate the increase in

aggregate ownership due to the VA as 35
                                       P
                                         g=23 wg60 β̂g Pr(vet)g60 , where g indexes ages, wg60 gives

the share of men 18 and above that were of age g in 1960, and β̂g is the estimated percentage point

effect for men of age g. This calculation suggests that the rate of home ownership for men 18 and

above would have been about 1.9 percentage points lower in 1960 in the absence of the VA program.

This amount is about 7.4 percent of the overall 1940 to 1960 increase from 27 to 53 percent. A

similar calculation shows that the VA can explain about 25 percent of the 1940-60 increase for the

‘affected’ ages (from 13 to 41 percent).

    A point estimate of a 1.9 percentage point difference in the 1960 home ownership rate appears

reasonable in the context of veterans’ survey responses in the 1977 National Survey of Veterans

(discussed in Section 2.2). The results of the 1977 Survey suggest that there were approximately

3.23 million veterans in 1977 who had used a VA loan for their first home but would not have

had a sufficient downpayment for it without their VA eligibility. A plausible interpretation of this

figure is that roughly this many individuals would have delayed home ownership if they had been

ineligible for the VA program. This number is not directly comparable to my estimates, which

instead represent how many veterans were home owners in 1960 but would not have been without

the VA benefit. However, the 1979 Survey of Veterans (SOV-II), while not asking about whether

veterans could have purchased without a VA loan, did ask about the year of first home purchase.

I calculate the share of veterans from the 1979 survey who used a VA loan for their first home and

first bought between 1955 and 1960, and, given the five-year difference in age at first ownership

described above, assume that roughly this fraction of the 3.23 million veterans would not have

been home owners in 1960 in the absence of VA eligibility. This calculation suggests that the

home ownership rate would have been about 1.6 percentage points lower in the absence of the VA,

reasonably close to my point estimate of 1.9 percentage points.58 Using instead the share first
  58
      The details of the calculation are as follows. About 3.233 million veterans of World War II and/or the Korean
War, but not of later conflicts, reported in 1977 that they would have had an insufficient down-payment for their
first home without the VA loan. Data from the 1979 Survey of Veterans suggests that about 26 percent of that
group first purchased a home between 1955 and 1960. For comparison with the counterfactual estimate from my
main analysis, I then multiply by the share of World War II and Korean War veterans in 1960 who were US-born
(0.972), since my calculations from the Census use only native-born men. The resulting estimate of the number of
men who were owners in 1960 but who would not have been if they were ineligible for the VA program is 817,043, or
about 1.6 percent of the number of native-born men of age 18 and above in 1960 (51,125,748, from the 1960 Census



                                                        27
buying between 1956 and 1960, the estimate would instead be 1.2 percentage points; using the

share buying between 1954 and 1960 it would be 2.0 percentage points.

    Vigdor (2006) also provides an estimate of the impact of the VA program on home ownership,

calculating that about 20 percent of the increase from 1940 to 1970 was due to veterans’ home loan

benefits. This result is based on a direct comparison of veterans to non-veterans that controls for

a variety of characteristics, including age. My estimates suggest smaller effects, with the difference

likely due to characteristics of selection into military service during World War II and Korea. As

emphasized in the literature on the education benefits of the GI Bill (Bound and Turner, 2002;

Page, 2006; Stanley, 2003), non-veterans who were of the right age to have served in World War II

were likely strongly negatively selected, and thus less likely to own in 1970 for other reasons.


6.2    Are the estimates driven by crowd-out of non-veterans?

To the extent that the VA mortgage program affected house prices or the demand for home owner-

ship among non-veterans, these estimates may over- or understate the aggregate effect of the VA.

It is natural to suppose that the relaxation of liquidity constraints increased prices for all prospec-

tive buyers, as suggested by Shiller (2005) and Vigdor (2006), and hence that the estimates above

could partly reflect crowd-out of non-veteran owners as well as net additions to the stock of home

owners. On the other hand, it is also easy to imagine that general equilibrium effects may have

been positive on net. It was noted above that federal lending programs may have led to a more

general relaxation of mortgage terms; they may have also have had positive spillovers in the housing

market by encouraging the construction of large-scale housing developments.59 Here I attempt to

shed some empirical light on the probable direction of these effects, focusing primarily on whether

the estimates are likely to be overstated as a result of crowd-out of non-veterans.

    If the VA benefit did not add to the stock of owners, but rather shifted ownership from non-

veterans to veterans, then all else equal, we should observe that in housing markets with a greater
of population).
   59
      Saulnier et al. (1958), for example, argued that federal insurance programs such as the FHA and VA encouraged
these projects, and that “[l]arge projects...have made possible the application of methods of production organization
that have doubtless lowered costs in the building industry.”




                                                         28
presence of veterans, non-veterans were less likely to own their homes.60 A regression discontinuity

framework, as used above, is of little use here. The approach I take instead is to compare non-

veterans’ probability of home ownership in states with a greater or lesser presence of World War II

and Korean War veterans in the market, both in a 1960 cross-section and in a panel specification

using the 1940 and 1960 IPUMS samples.61

    To take into account confounding factors that could be correlated both with the propensity to

own and the state’s share veteran in 1960, I rely on work by Acemoglu, Autor and Lyle (2004),

which argues that the variation in state mobilization rates for World War II can be understood

as a combination of ‘economic’ factors (share farmers, average education, and share non-white),

‘non-economic’ factors (the age structure of the population and the share German-born), and other

variation that cannot be explained by existing data, such as idiosyncratic behavior of local draft

boards. In the regressions I present below I attempt to isolate the last source of variation by

controlling for this set of state characteristics, as well as the urban share of the population in 1940.

    Even if the state veteran shares are orthogonal to omitted determinants of home ownership in

1960 once these state characteristics are held constant, there is an additional complication that in

states with more veterans, the characteristics of the marginal (and hence the average) non-veteran

may be different. To alleviate this concern, I include specifications that restrict the sample to men

who were born too late to serve in WWII, and compare their propensity to own across states with

more or fewer WWII veterans, while controlling for the state’s Korean War veteran share.

    Column (1) of Table 9 presents a comparison of non-veterans across states in a 1960 cross-

section that controls only for individual-level characteristics. Column (3) presents analogous panel

specifications, with fixed effects for year and state of residence, that use IPUMS samples from

1940 and 1960 and define all men as ‘non-veterans’ in 1940. The coefficient on the variable of

interest – the share of men 18 and above in the state who were eligible for benefits in 1960 –

is not significantly different from zero in either specification.62 Columns (2) and (4) control for
   60
      It could also be that a greater presence of veterans in a housing market changed veterans’ propensity to own,
but since this is not a necessary implication of the crowd-out story, I do not examine it here.
   61
      A state is admittedly somewhat coarse as a representation of a housing market, but no finer level of geographical
information is currently available in the 1960 IPUMS.
   62
      The share of all men 18 and above who were World War II or Korean War veterans may not be the relevant
measure of benefits-eligible veterans in the housing market. But defining the veteran presence instead as, for example,


                                                          29
1940 state characteristics and Census division fixed effects, interacted with time dummies in the

panel specification. Inclusion of these characteristics appears to alleviate a downward bias in

the coefficient on the state veteran share.63 The cross-section specification in column (2) gives a

coefficient estimate of 0.791, suggesting that for non-veterans aged 23-35 in 1960, those living in a

state with a veteran share greater by 5 percentage points were about 4 percentage points more likely

to own their homes in 1960. The panel specification in column (4) gives a very similar coefficient

estimate of 0.794. The cross-section and panel estimates are significantly different from zero at the

10 and 5 percent levels, respectively.

    As discussed above, even if the specifications in Panel A adequately control for all relevant

characteristics correlated with the state’s veteran share, it may be that the observed differences are

driven by the link between a state’s veteran share and the characteristics of the marginal veteran.

For men too young to have served in World War II, however, once we control for the Korean War

veteran share, in principle the World War II veteran share should have no relationship with the

characteristics of the marginal veteran. In Panel B, I present similar specifications that limit the

sample to men aged 23-29 in 1960. The coefficient of interest is the share of men who were World

War II veterans. The coefficient estimates in the cross-section and panel specifications are similar,

at 0.874 and 0.750, respectively, both significant at the 5 percent level. In states with a greater

presence of eligible veterans, non-veterans appear to have been more likely to own in 1960.

    The finding of a positive relationship between the share veteran in a market and the probability

of home ownership for non-veterans is in line with the findings of Vigdor (2006). While emphasizing

that veterans’ benefits may have increased prices relative to rents, Vigdor also finds that controlling

for an individual’s veteran status, the probability of home ownership in a 1970 cross-section is higher

in metropolitan areas with more veterans – although the difference is smaller (but still positive)

for individuals of low SES.

    Isolating fully transparent variation in states’ veteran shares in 1960 is beyond the scope of
the share of men aged 18 to 45 (or 18 to 35, 18 to 55, or 18 to 65) gives qualitatively similar estimates.
   63
      This appears to be driven largely by the variables correlated with agricultural activity in 1940: the share of men
who were farmers and the urban share of the population. Due to agricultural exemptions in the World War II draft,
rural states tended to have lower mobilization rates; at the same time, they had both high levels of home ownership
and large increases between 1940 and 1960.

this paper, so the conclusions we may draw from these results are necessarily more speculative

than for the RD estimates presented above. The finding of a significant, positive relationship

between veteran shares and non-veterans’ probability of home ownership, however, weighs against

an interpretation of the RD results as reflecting crowd-out of non-veterans rather than net additions

to the set of home owners.


6.3   How much of the time series can broader changes in mortgage terms ex-
      plain?

As discussed in Section 2, housing benefits extended to veterans were merely one factor in a far

broader change in mortgage terms in the mid-20th century. The estimate of the overall impact

of the VA is surely a lower bound for the broader effects of finance, but it is not straightforward

to extrapolate from the estimates to the effects of these broader changes. However, I can use the

estimates of the effect of the VA to validate an alternative approach.

   The 1960 Survey of Consumer Finances, the structure of which was similar to the earlier years

discussed above, asked respondents about home ownership, the dollar value of their home and of

their equity in the home, the dollar amount of their liquid assets, and the value of their other assets;

further details are provided in the data appendix. With ‘representative’ loan-to-value ratios in the

50 to 60 percent range in the 1920’s (as in Table 1), a rough pass at this broader question is to ask

what share of the population were home owners in 1960 but would have lacked the assets to make

a 40 to 50 percent down-payment on their home. The results suggest if all had needed to make

a 40 percent downpayment on their house, the home ownership rate would have been about 7.77

percentage points lower (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 6.81 to 8.74 percentage points).

If all had needed to make a 50 percent downpayment, home ownership would have been lower by

11 percentage points (with a 95 percent confidence interval of 9.91 to 12.16 percentage points).

By way of comparison, 11 percentage points is a little over 40 percent of the overall increase from

1940 to 1960 and about 46 percent of the increase from 1920 to 1960 (which may be the more

relevant comparison, given that the low home ownership rate of 1940 was partly associated with

the aftermath of the Great Depression).


                                                  31
    Such a calculation ignores many complicating factors, of course, but applying this method to

estimate how much lower home ownership would have been in the absence of the VA provides some

measure of reassurance. In particular, it suggests that requiring everyone to be able to make a 10

percent downpayment on their own home – roughly the average for FHA loans originated in 1960

and a reasonable no-VA counterfactual – would have lowered the overall home ownership rate by

1.7 percentage points (with a 95 percent confidence interval of about 1.2 to 2.2 percentage points),

reassuringly close to the estimate above of 1.9 percentage points.



7    Conclusion

What role did government interventions in mortgage markets play in the mid-century increase in

home ownership? The change in the age profile of home ownership from 1940 to 1960 suggests that

much of the increase was associated with a decrease in the age at entry into ownership, for which

one natural explanation would be a trend towards easier terms in mortgage borrowing. Yet the

many concurrent changes in housing markets over this period make it difficult to isolate the effect

of government mortgage market interventions.

    To shed light on this question, this paper uses steep declines in the probability of military service

by birth cohort, for men coming of age at the end of hostilities in World War II and the Korean War,

to estimate the effect of veterans’ home loan benefits on the probability of home ownership from

1960 to 1980. Men more likely to have served by merit of their date of birth had significantly higher

rates of home ownership in 1960, with larger effects at younger ages. At the same time, the positive

effect diminished as the affected cohorts aged. These findings are consistent with the prediction

that relaxing borrowing constraints should have the largest effects on younger individuals. Other

veterans’ benefits and service itself appear not to explain the observed differences, leaving veterans’

housing benefits as the most likely explanation for the effect of veteran status.

    The estimates suggest that in the absence of the VA, the rate of home ownership would have

been about 1.9 percentage points lower in 1960. This suggests that VA housing benefits may explain

about 7.4 percent of the overall change in home ownership for men 18 and above from 1940 to 1960,

and 25 percent of the change for the affected cohorts. These estimates serve as a lower bound for

                                                   32
the impact of broader changes in mortgage terms over this period: a rough calculation suggests

that these changes may explain 40 percent of the overall change from 1940 to 1960.

   The results underscore the idea that programs subsidizing borrowing, to the extent that they

raise home ownership rates, are likely to do so primarily by shifting purchase earlier rather than

by leading to home ownership for individuals who would never have purchased otherwise. In this

respect these results are in line with arguments in more recent periods that FHA financing primarily

serves to accelerate ownership (Goodman and Nichols, 1997).

   This paper presents evidence that changes in mortgage markets played a critical role in the

observed increase in home ownership in the mid-20th century. But it is noteworthy that much

of the 1940 to 1960 increase occurred before the end of World War II, when construction of new

housing was severely curtailed. The dramatic rate of increase in home ownership from 1940 to 1945

suggests that further research into changes in housing markets during World War II is necessary to

understand the mid-20th century increase in home ownership more fully.

     Notes: Top panels show share of each birth cohort that reported being a veteran of the World War II or Korean War period in the 1960 Census, relative
     to estimated state-level breaks in probability of veteran status. ‘1960 breaks’ are those estimated on the full 1960 sample, and ‘1980 breaks’ are those
     estimated on a partial sample from the 1980 Census, as discussed in Section 3. Bottom panels show share of each cohort owning home. Solid and dashed
     lines show linear fits that estimate the regression function at the boundary point. Solid lines are estimated using 1960 breaks; dashed lines use 1980 breaks.

Notes: Figure shows number of VA and non-VA loans closed each quarter, the estimated number closed under the
World War II entitlement for 1952 onwards, and the difference between the maximum VA interest rate and yields on
AAA-rated corporate bonds. Data on number of VA loans from Housing and Home Finance Agency (1961), share
under WWII entitlement from U.S. Veterans Administration (1962). Corporate bond yields are from NBER series
m13035, at http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/chapter13.html.

of birth is calculated as (Census year-reported age-1). Bandwidth includes men born in the US between 1892 and
1901. Difference in number of observations between column (2) and columns (1) and (3) is due to missing data on

farmers, share nonwhite, average years of education, share aged 13-24, share aged 25-34, and share German-born
among men aged 13-44 in the 1940 IPUMS. 1940 state characteristics also include share of the total 1940 population

Appendix 1: Data
Census Data
   The data for all of the empirical analysis, except for Sections 5.3 and 6.3, are drawn from IPUMS
Census microdata (Ruggles et al., 2008). I use the 1% samples from 1900 to 1960, a combination of
the State, Neighborhood, and Metro 1% Form 2 samples from 1970, the 5% State sample and the
four 1% samples from 1980, and the unweighted 1% samples from 1990 and 2000. In all analyses,
the sample contains only men born in the United States who were 18 years or older at the time
of the Census. In Section 2, in cases where allocation flags are available, I drop any observation
whose age, sex, place of birth, group quarters status, or home ownership status was allocated by
the Census Bureau. In all other sections, in addition to these restrictions I also drop men whose
veteran status was allocated; in the 1960 sample I also drop men for whom total personal income
was allocated.
   I categorize living arrangements into the mutually exclusive categories of owning, renting, living
with relatives, and a residual category. I classify men who were listed as the household head or the
spouse of the head in an owner-occupied dwelling as home owners. Renters include household heads,
or spouses of heads, in dwellings identified as renter-occupied; I also classify as a renter anyone listed
as a roomer, boarder, or lodger. Men ‘living with relatives’ are those who are otherwise related
to the household head. The remainder consist mostly of men in group quarters – for example,
institutions and military quarters – and household servants.
   State veteran shares in Section 6.2 are calculated from the 1960 IPUMS sample using the same
data allocation restrictions as for the main 1960 analysis sample. All controls are calculated from
IPUMS data, except the urban share of each state, which is from Census counts (Haines, 2010).


Survey of Consumer Finances
   Data on the timing of veterans’ house purchase in Section 5.3 are drawn from the Survey of
Consumer Finances from 1947 to 1957 (Economic Behavior Program, Survey Research Center,
University of Michigan, 1973). As discussed in the main text of the paper, the unit of observation
in the SCF is a spending unit, defined as a group of related people living in the same dwelling
who pool their incomes for major items of expense. For example, an adult son living with his
parents would be classified as a separate spending unit if he does not pool his income with that
of his parents, but otherwise would be part of the same spending unit. Spending units are further
grouped into ‘family units’ of related individuals, with a single ‘primary’ spending unit and other
‘secondary’ spending units. Housing tenure is not reported consistently for spending units living on
farms, so these are excluded from the analysis. I keep only spending units whose head was between
25 and 34 years old in the survey year, and also omit spending units missing data on veteran status.
   There was some variation in questions asked each year, requiring adjustment for consistency
over time. For the 1947 sample I define a ‘veteran’ spending unit as one with at least one veteran;


                                                   52
from 1948 to 1953 as one whose head reported being a veteran, and from 1954 onwards as one
whose head reported being a veteran of World War II (or similarly for the Korean War). I classify
a spending unit as purchasing a house in the previous year if it reported buying any real estate in
the previous year (1947), buying a house in the previous year (1948), or buying its current home
in the previous calendar year (1949 to 1957). Secondary spending units who do not report any
information on having bought a home the previous year are classified as not having purchased a
home.
   Section 6 uses the entire sample from the 1960 survey. Spending units are defined similarly in
that year. I calculate the value of a spending unit’s liquid assets, home equity, and other assets
as a share of its home value and calculate the share of spending units that owned a home in 1960
for which this proportion was (for example) less than 40 percent. As mentioned in the text, the
1960 survey reports dollar values for the value of the spending unit’s home and for their equity in
the home, as well as the dollar value of their liquid assets. Included in my measure of their assets
is an estimate of the value of their stocks. The value of stock ownership is reported only in bins;
I use the midpoint of each bin (and $25,000 for the top code, which corresponded to a value of
$25,000 and above). The survey also contains information on the value of real estate that the unit
owns other than the home, but not information on the value of their equity in it. The values are
similarly reported in bins, for which I use the midpoints and the top code in a similar manner.
Assuming that the spending unit has 100 percent equity in its non-home real estate would lower the
estimates of reductions in home ownership slightly. The reduction in home ownership associated
with a 10 percent downpayment would be 1.55 percentage points instead of 1.68 percentage points;
the estimate for a 40 percent downpayment would be a reduction of 6.86 percentage points instead
of 7.77 percentage points; and the estimate for a 50 percent downpayment would be a reduction of
9.52 percentage points instead of 11.04 percentage points.

Appendix 2: Tenure choice model and calibration
A simple model of asset accumulation and tenure choice, calibrated using characteristics of housing
markets in 1960, clarifies the predictions of the life-cycle tenure choice framework at the ages
I examine in the empirical analysis. Consider the infinite-horizon optimization problem of an
individual with discount rate r, whose per-period utility U (Ct , Ht ) is defined over a composite
consumption good Ct and housing Ht . All individuals begin life as renters, with no assets, but may
purchase a house at T ∈ (0, ∞) subject to a down-payment constraint. I follow Hayashi, Ito and
Slemrod (1988) in assuming that U (Ct , Ht ) = α log Ct + (1 − α) log Ht . For simplicity, I impose the
condition that housing is available only in a fixed quantity HR for renters, and HO for owners, and
capture the idea that ‘pride of ownership’ may give greater utility from owning a given amount of
housing rather than renting it by supposing that for an owner, Ht = γHO , where γ ≥ 1.
   An individual has income yt each period. She may save only for home purchase, at an interest
rate ρ, and chooses an amount of savings st in each period for which she is a renter. Normalizing
the price of the consumption good to 1, the price of a unit of rental housing is R, and the analogous
price of owner-occupied housing is P . Finally, φ is a constant that converts the amount P HO into
a per-period payment φP HO . As discussed in the previous section, since maturities increased at
the same time as down-payments fell, I will assume that changes in down-payments do not affect
the per-period payment.
   If an individual chooses to buy at some finite T , she solves

   I will consider the simple case in which income is constant at y and ρ = r. Under these
conditions, the savings rate is constant, and reductions in down-payments lead to earlier home
purchase. To calibrate the model, I assume that rented and owned housing are identical and deliver
a single unit of housing services, or HR = HO = 1, but that owned housing gives greater utility
than the same amount of rented housing, with γ = 1.5. I set α = .8. Other parameters are meant
to correspond specifically to housing market conditions in 1960. In particular, I set the annual rent
at $700 and the house price at $12,000. I assume that the interest rate ρ and the monthly payment


                                                              54
conversion factor φ are both .05. The latter condition implies that per-period housing costs are
lower for an owner than for a renter. Heterogeneity in the simulation comes from variation in
income. I draw income from a truncated lognormal distribution with mean 8 (corresponding to an
income of $3,000), standard deviation 1, and a minimum income that allows everyone to afford the
$700 annual rent. Each person then chooses the optimal time of home purchase (or, equivalently,
per-period savings).
    The simulation results in Figure A2.1, shown for down-payments of 10 and 20 percent, confirm
that reductions in down-payments are likely to have especially large effects on younger individu-
als.64 The age-ownership profiles themselves, tracing the share of a cohort that owns over time, are
somewhat more concave than those found in the data. However, the increases in home ownership
at each age that result from reducing the down-payment from 20 to 10 percent reflect the differen-
tially large impacts of lower down-payments on younger individuals. Importantly, there are some
individuals who never choose to own under certain down-payment regimes, and lower barriers to
ownership induce some of these individuals to become owners at some point. It is therefore possible
in principle that one would observe long-lasting effects of eligibility for lower down-payments on
home ownership. However, the main result that I will bring forward into the analysis is that at the
ages I examine, differences in home ownership between individuals facing different down-payments
are likely to be larger when they are younger than when they are older.

Notes: Figure shows home ownership rates by age calculated in the simulation described in Section 3, for down-
payments of 10% (δ = .1) and 20% (δ = .2). Heavy line shows difference between home ownership in low down-
payment and high down-payment regime at each age.

      These terms correspond roughly to the median terms on the stock of VA and FHA mortgages in 1960. Since VA
loans originated in 1960 had even lower down-payments, it is even more likely that in the analysis I should observe
larger effects at younger ages.

Notes: Table reports estimated discontinuities at the cutoffs in probability of being an eligible veteran (columns 1
and 4), home ownership (columns 2 and 5), and scaled estimates of the impact of veteran status on home ownership
(columns 3 and 6). ‘Eligible veteran’ is defined as being a veteran of the WWII or Korean War period in 1960, and
being a veteran of any period in 1970 and 1980. Bandwidth for all specifications is 12 quarters. Heteroskedasticity-
robust standard errors are in parentheses. All specifications include fixed effects for season (quarter) of birth, race
(white/non-white), and state of birth. ***: p < .01, **: p < .05, *: p < .1.

Appendix 4: Results for housing consumption
I have not emphasized the possible effects of subsidized borrowing on the characteristics of housing
consumed, but the estimation strategy used in the paper can be applied to a number of other related
outcomes. In Appendix Table A4.1, I present estimates from the un-recentered RD design (with
no omitted cohorts) of the effect of veteran status on various outcomes measuring size, quality, and
location of housing, as well as a rough measure of migration.
   Few of the estimates are significantly different from zero, but several are suggestive that veteran
status increased the quantity or quality of housing in 1960. Estimates of the effect of service on
the number of rooms in one’s dwelling are small and positive (here all individuals are included in
the sample, with the number of rooms defined as zero for those living in group quarters). At the
Korean War break, veteran status is associated with a 9 percentage point higher probability of
having complete plumbing, significant at the 5 percent level (having ‘complete plumbing’ means
that the dwelling unit has running hot and cold water, a flush toilet, and a bathtub or shower within
the structure, as explained in Ruggles et al. (2008)). Conditional on home ownership, self-reported
house value was also positively associated with veteran status, although it is of course difficult to
interpret this relationship given the discontinuities in home ownership at the two breaks. Turning to
locational outcomes, veteran status at both breaks was positively associated with living in a suburb
in 1960 (a coefficient of 0.058 at the World War II break, and 0.075 at the Korean War break).
Boustan and Shertzer (forthcoming) use a slightly different empirical design to estimate the effect
of World War II veteran status on the probability of living in a central city, conditional on living
in a metropolitan area; despite the difference in empirical design and the estimated parameter, my
estimate is in line with theirs. Finally, as a measure of migration I test whether veteran status is
associated with differences in the probability of living in one’s state of birth. I find no statistically
significant differences, although the point estimate at the World War II break is positive and of
meaningful magnitude.
   Fort the most part, the estimates decline in magnitude in 1970 and 1980. An exception is the
estimate for house value at the World War II break in 1970, which is negative and statistically
significant; such a relationship is not evident in 1980.
