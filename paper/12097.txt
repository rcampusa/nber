                                          ABSTRACT

This study examines data drawn from the game show Friend or Foe?, which is similar to the classic

prisoner’s dilemma tale: partnerships are endogenously determined, players work together to earn

money, after which, they play a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma game over large stakes: varying from

$200 to (potentially) more than $22,000. If one were to conduct such an experiment in the

laboratory, the cost to gather the data would be well over $350,000. The data reveal several

interesting insights; perhaps most provocatively, they suggest that even though the game is played

in front of an audience of millions of viewers, there is some evidence consistent with a model of

discrimination. The observed patterns of social discrimination are unanticipated, however. For

example, there is evidence consistent with the notion that certain populations have a general

“distaste” for older participants.

          The prisoner’s dilemma has become the classic example of the theory of strategy

and its implication for predicting the behavior of players. The equilibrium concept has

been used in many disparate strategic applications, including economic, social, political,

and biological competitions. Indeed, its influence has extended well beyond scholarly

circles, as people who have never been formally introduced to game theory typically are

familiar with the basic story underlying the game: two people form a team and rob a

bank. They are subsequently apprehended by the police and brought to the precinct

under the suspicion that they were conspirators in the bank robbery. Detectives explain

to each suspect that even if neither confesses they are both looking at jail time (e.g., 2

years) for the robbery. If one confesses, however, the confessor goes free and the other

serves substantial jail time (e.g., 10 years). If both confess, then jail terms will be

negotiated down (e.g., 5 years). A simple transformation of this story produces many

realistic economic circumstances, including oligopoly pricing, international trade

negotiations, and labor arbitration.

          Ever since the initial theoretical conjectures of Nash, economists have used the

prisoner’s dilemma game as a basis for testing the predictions of noncooperative game

theory. Yet almost all of this evidence comes from laboratory experiments that involve

small or imaginary stakes.1 In this study, I provide an initial exploration of strategic

behavior in a natural prisoner’s dilemma experiment by examining individual decisions

from the game show Friend or Foe? The game show provides a simple and sharp form

of the dilemma and parallels the classic prisoner’s dilemma tale: teams are endogenously

determined, players work together to earn money, after which the agents play a one-shot

prisoner’s dilemma game over large stakes—varying from $200 to (potentially) more

than $22,000. An added advantage of these data is that they provide a test of whether,

and to what extent, social discrimination is practiced.2

        Several interesting findings emerge.            First, in the series of observed shows,

thousands of dollars were literally left on the table: in nearly 25 percent of the 117

games, both players chose not to cooperate, resulting in a net loss of nearly $100,000. Of

the remaining teams, in roughly 25 percent of the cases both players cooperated. Second,

stakes are not found to be a significant determinant of play, lending evidence consistent

with the notion that the low stakes typically used in laboratory experiments are not

problematic due solely to stakes considerations.              Third, while an empirical analysis

examining the determinants of individual cooperation rates suggest little social

discrimination exists, since teams are formed endogenously the data also permit an

exploration of whether players exhibit discrimination when choosing their partners. The

data suggest that, in general, players use proper backward induction when selecting

partners; but one anomalous finding is that in the partner selection process agents are

biased against older participants. The observed pattern of partner choices is consistent

with a model of social discrimination wherein certain populations have a general

“distaste” for older participants in the Becker (1975) sense.

        The remainder of this study proceeds as follows. Section II discusses the Friend

or Foe? gameshow and describes important caveats associated with using such data to

draw inferences. Section III summarizes the empirical results. Section IV concludes.

II. The Natural Experiment


2Independently, Oberholzer-Gee et al. (2005) have used Friend of Foe? data to explore social learning and
coordination but do not examine discrimination or other questions addressed herein.


                                                   2
       As previous studies have noted, television game shows provide a natural avenue

to observe real decisions in an environment with high stakes. For example, Berk et al.

(1996) study contestants’ behavior on The Price is Right to investigate rational decision

theory. Gertner (1993) and Beetsma and Schotman (2001) make use of data from Card

Sharks and Lingo, respectively, to examine individual risk preferences. Finally, Metrick,

uses data from Jeopardy! to analyze behavior under uncertainty and players’ ability to

choose strategic best-responses. Each of these studies has provided a fresh look at

important economic phenomena over large stakes that, short of a large experimental

budget or having an experimental laboratory in an underdeveloped country, would be

difficult to investigate outside of a gameshow environment.

       Data used in this paper are taken from original Friend or Foe? programs. The

game show Friend or Foe? premiered on June 3, 2002. Importantly, all of these shows

were taped in Santa Monica, CA, prior to the show’s television premiere. I observed 39

shows, each of which consists of six strangers, who at the beginning of the show are

randomly split into two groups of three: group 1 and group 2. Each group 1 agent

privately selects one player from group 2 to be his or her partner. This first stage can

therefore proceed in one of three ways: 1) all three group 1 agents select different

partners. The partnerships are then formed by these choices and the pairs proceed to the

next stage of the show; 2) two group 1 agents select the same group 2 agent. First, the

group 1 agent whose choice did not coincide with another’s choice is paired with his or

her group 2 selection. Second, the group 2 agent who was chosen by two group 1 agents

selects one of those group 1 agents to be his or her partner. The remaining pair is then

matched; or 3) all three group 1 agents choose the same group 2 agent. In this case, the




                                            3
selected group 2 agent chooses one of the group 1 agents. The remaining group 1 agents

privately select one of the remaining group 2 agents. If they again select the same

person, he or she chooses one of the group 1 agents. The remaining pair is then matched.

       Teams are therefore determined endogenously: the six strangers become three

groups of two via this selection process. Each team is then separated into “isolation

chambers” where trivia rounds are played. The newly formed teams work together and

agree on answers to trivia questions in order to build a “trust fund” potentially over three

rounds. In the first (second) round, four trivia questions are posed worth $500 ($1000)

each. In the third round, up to ten questions are asked, each worth $500. Given that each

team is initially endowed with $200, a team’s “trust fund” can range from $200 to

$22,200; however, in practice, the largest trivia earnings in these data is $16,400.

       At the end of each round (there are 3 rounds in total) the lowest scoring team is

eliminated. Before the team is dismissed from the game show, the players must decide

how their winnings are divided. In making a decision, each player has a button, which no

one else can see. The division of winnings depends on whether the player depresses his

or her button. There are three possible outcomes: 1) “Friend-Friend” (i.e., cooperate-

cooperate)—if both players choose “friend” (do not depress the button), then the total

winnings are divided equally between the two; 2) “Friend-Foe” (i.e., cooperate-not

cooperate)—if only one player depresses the button, he or she receives the entire amount,

leaving the other player with nothing; 3) “Foe-Foe” (i.e., not cooperate-not cooperate)—

if both players press the button, then both players walk away with nothing.

       Thus, this final stage of the game naturally sets up a prisoner’s dilemma with a

weakly dominant strategy: each player has an incentive to play “Foe” because she is




                                              4
never worse-off monetarily when playing “Foe.” To my knowledge, little has been done

empirically on non-cooperative games in such high-stakes setting.

Caveats

       Before proceeding to the discussion of results, it is important to summarize

potentially important caveats associated with using game show data for such an exercise.

First, the contestant pool may not be a representative sample of the underlying

population. Second, play takes place in front of a large television audience, potentially

attenuating certain behaviors. For example, it is possible that contestants recognize that

they are playing a repeated game with members of the audience and therefore future

financial impacts might well be an important consideration when determining whether to

cooperate or defect on the gameshow. Indeed, one would expect that the more closely an

individual’s actions are being scrutinized (e.g., the act is being televised or is taking place

in front of one’s children), fairness concerns are likely to receive increased emphasis.

Thus, defecting on a television show might very well have very negative consequences,

even if the agent has no social preferences.3

       Besides plausibility, such intuition has empirical support. For example, the effect

of decreasing anonymity or confidentiality in classic linear public goods experiments

leads to increased cooperative behavior (see, e.g., Masclet et al., 2003; Rege and Telle,

2004). And, List et al. (2004) report evidence that social isolation has important effects

on stated preferences for environmental goods. Perhaps making this overarching point

most clearly are the data in List (2006). List (2006) uses a series of laboratory and field

experiments to explore the nature of social preferences among real market players in

naturally occurring environments. He reports that while agents drawn from a well-




                                                5
functioning marketplace reveal strong social preferences in tightly controlled laboratory

experiments, when they are not aware that they are being observed, behavior in their

naturally-occurring environment approaches what is predicted by self-interest theory.

           Third, the title of the game show, in and of itself, is suggestive, as is the oral

introduction that the game show host, Kennedy, uses in every show: you will “work

together to build a trust fund….and ultimately decide to share as friends or fight over as

foes.”      One aspect of the show that does resemble certain characteristics of many

naturally-occurring environments is the fact that agents endogenously select into the

market (the show) and select with whom to interact.                      In many parallel laboratory

experiments, such variables are determined exogenously.

                                                    III. Results

           The top panel of Table 1 provides summary statistics at the individual level. Of

the 234 players, 49 percent were men and 78 percent were white. The gameshow, which

is taped in California, attracted 38 percent of its contestant pool from California and the

contestants were from a broad age group: from 18 to 61, with an average age of 31. This

mixture of subjects provides important variation to examine whether participant-specific

characteristics influence behavior in prisoner’s dilemma games.

           The bottom panel of Table 1 presents an overview of monies earned in the trivia

portion of the game, cooperation rates, and take-home earnings across a few broad

classes of agents. These figures show that, on average, teams earned $3,705 during the

trivia portion of the game, indicating that the average prisoner’s dilemma game was

played over $3,705. On average, men earned the most in the trivia portion of the game

($4,247), while non-whites earned the least ($2,825). There is no discernible difference

3   Thanks to the Editor, Daron Acemoglu, and both reviewers for urging me to explore this line of thought.

                                                      6
across earnings profiles of young ($3,603) and older ($3,839) agents when I split the

players along the first moment of the age variable.

       In terms of overall cooperation rates, 50 percent of subjects chose to cooperate.

This figure is larger than cooperation rates observed in laboratory one-shot prisoner’s

dilemma experiments, which are typically around 33 percent (Shafir and Tversky, 1992).

As previously noted, there are several potential explanations for such a disparity to exist,

including subject pool differences, television audience effects, the monies are jointly

earned, the stakes are large, partnerships are formed endogenously, and identities are not

anonymous. Combining trivia earnings with the cooperation rates maps into take-home

earnings, which were on average much larger for men (younger agents) than women

(more mature agents). Indeed, men took home almost 70 percent more than women.

This, of course, is due to two effects: higher cooperation rates among women and higher

trivia earnings among men.

       Constructing a simple matrix using gender, race, and age as cross-tab variables

yields Table 2. Table 2 provides team-level information pertaining to the level of trivia

earnings (denoted stakes), cooperation rates, average take-home earnings, and efficiency

rates (take-home earnings divided by trivia earnings). For example, insights contained in

Panel A complement Table 1, and suggest that women who are on all-female teams have

a 56 percent cooperation rate (row 2 column 2), whereas findings contained in row 1

column 1 suggest that men who are on all-male teams cooperate in only 48 percent of the

observations. This leads to a higher efficiency rate for all-female teams. Interestingly, in

mixed gender teams, cooperation rates are much different across men and women:

whereas men cooperate at a rate of 43 percent, women choose to cooperate at a rate of 55




                                             7
percent.   In this case, men are showing a slight discrimination against women,

cooperating slightly less (48 percent versus 43 percent) when paired with a female.

       Likewise, Panels B and C in Table 2 provide insights across race and age cohorts.

The overall picture is that white agents cooperate more than non-whites, regardless of

whether they are on all-white teams or inter-racial teams. And, older agents are found to

cooperate to a much greater degree than younger agents, regardless of the age of partner.

The distribution of earnings in the mixed age pairs as well as the efficiency rates across

the three cells highlights the considerable effects of such behavior.

       Rather than belabor the raw data further, to provide insights into team cooperation

rates, I make use of the inherent ordering of the outcomes by coding team outcomes as

equaling 0 if both players choose “not cooperate;” equaling 1 if one player chooses “not

cooperate” and the other chooses “cooperate;” and equaling 2 if both players choose

“cooperate,” and build a model around a latent regression of the form:

               Yi* = Xi′β + εi,                                            (1)

where Yi* is unobserved, Xi is a vector of team-specific variables, β is the estimated

response coefficient vector, and εi is the well-behaved random error component.

Although I do not directly observe Yi*, I do observe an approximation of Yi*:

               Yi =               0 if Yi* ≤ 0,                            (2)

                                  1 if 0 < Yi* ≤ φ1

                                  2 if φ1 < Yi* ≤ φ2.

       The φi are unknown parameters that are estimated jointly with β. A few aspects of

the estimation procedure merit further consideration.        First, since the φis are free

parameters, there is no significance to the unit distance between the set of observed



                                                  8
values of Y. In fact, the outcomes represent a “cooperation ranking” and therefore one-

unit changes are not directly comparable. Second, estimates of the marginal effects in the

ordered probability model are quite involved because there is no meaningful conditional

mean function. I therefore compute the effects of changes in the covariates on the j

probabilities:

                  ∂Prob[cell j]/∂Xi = [f(φj-1 - Xi′β) – f(φj - Xi′β)]*β,                    (3)

where f(•) is the standard normal density, and other variables are as defined above. By

definition, these effects must sum to zero since the probabilities sum to one.

Accordingly, I obtain threshold levels of cooperation rates by measuring how exogenous

variable vector Xi affects ranked responses, Yi*. Xi includes dichotomous team regressors

to explore the effects of team gender, race, age, and geographic residence on outcomes.

For example, “Team Male” (“Team White”) equals 1 if both team members are male

(white), 0 otherwise; “Team Mature” (“Team California”) equals 1 if both team members

are 31 years old or older (reside in California), 0 otherwise.4

         Vector Xi also includes two regressors to explore the potential importance of

endogenous partner selection. As aforementioned, in markets many times partners are

endogenously chosen and this factor might be important. The first variable indicates

whether the individual became a partner by choice in the first selection round: 1st Selected

= 1 for both team members if the group 1 agent was the only person who selected the

group 2 agent, 0 otherwise. The second variable, 1st Selected (Tie), equals 1 for both

group members if a group 2 agent was chosen by at least two group 1 agents and

subsequently was forced to choose his or her group 1 partner, 0 otherwise. Intuition


4 One rationale for including a control for whether the contestant resides in California is that this subset of
players might be experienced game show participants.


                                                      9
would suggest the reinforcement involved in the tie-breaking procedure would yield an

even stronger bond between partners. Finally, I include a variable that controls for

stakes, or the level of money at risk, in Xi.

        Estimation results are contained in Table 3. Column 1 contains the coefficient

estimates from the model, which is statistically significant at the p < .05 level. The

results corroborate insights gained from the raw data: older teams are more likely to

cooperate, and all white teams cooperate less than mixed racial teams. The results also

highlight the significance of allowing partners to be determined endogenously: those

who were selected by one another to be teammates cooperate to a much greater extent

than those who did not select to be teammates on the first attempt. Although these

coefficient estimates provide interesting insights, not much information beyond their

statistical significance can be used since they are not marginal effects.

        To amend this situation, I present marginal effects in columns 2-4 of Table 3.

The estimates can be read as follows: an all female team is 3 percent more likely to be in

cell 2 (both players cooperate) than a mixed gender team. Interestingly, the results show

that more mature (young) teams are 15% (15%) more (less) likely to fully cooperate than

mixed age teams. And, the importance of the selection process is notable as well, as

those teams that were formed by both agents choosing one another are 23 percent more

likely to fully cooperate.     Interestingly, while the effect of stakes was marginally

significant in column 1, its marginal effect is negligible.

        One can dig a level deeper into the individual decision process by exploring how

individuals play the game. In this spirit, I estimate the following regression model at the

individual level: cooperatei = g(α + βzZ), where cooperatei equals 1 if agent i chooses to




                                                10
cooperate, 0 otherwise; g(•) is the standard logistic function (results are similar if I

assume normally distributed errors); Z is identical to X but at the individual, rather than

the team, level.5 Since these results corroborate evidence from Tables 1-3, I suppress

them but note that individual-level attributes are correlated with cooperation rates: males

cooperate less than females, whites cooperate less than non-whites, older participants

cooperate less than younger participants, and participants from California cooperate less

than non-Californians. Again, stakes are found not to matter, but the partner selection

process does. Finally, when I augment Z with observable partner characteristics, they are

found to be statistically insignificant at conventional levels in the pooled data.

         Overall, from results in Tables 1-3 and the insights gained from the individual-

level model, I draw the following conclusions:

           Result 1: Stakes do not have an important effect on play.

           Result 2: Individual-level attributes are correlated with cooperation rates:
           women, whites, and older participants cooperate more than their peers.

           Result 3: Partner attributes do not influence play significantly.

           Result 4: How partners are determined influences play: players cooperate
           more if they are able to select each other as partners.

         Result 1 provides an important validity check on the number of laboratory

experiments that use low stakes. In this sense, these results are consonant with recent

results from dictator and ultimatum laboratory games that indicate the level of stakes has

been negligible on proposers’ behavior (see, e.g., Slonim and Roth, 1998; Cameron,



5 It would have been nice to also include a regressor that indicated whether, and to what extent, each player
contributed to the pool of earnings in the trivia stage. Given that each team of two must agree on an answer
before final submission (i.e., both team members must submit the same answer) and that the actual
television broadcast only included select parts of the discussion between teammates, I found it too
subjective to extrapolate information aired into construction of a “production variable.”



                                                     11
1999; Carpenter et al., 2005). In terms of trust and gift exchange games, the laboratory

evidence is mixed, as Fehr et al. (2005) report that fairness concerns play an important

role for both low and high stakes games whereas Parco et al. (2002) find that raising

financial incentives causes a breakdown in mutual trust in centipede games. In sum, the

data herein show that over much larger stakes variations than previously examined, play

is not considerably affected by changes in stakes.6

        Besides its empirical significance, Result 2 might also serve as an external

validity check of recent results from laboratory experiments. For example, two recent

studies that examine behavior in much different settings find similar results on gender

effects. Using laboratory experimental data, Andreoni and Vesterlund (2001) find that in

dictator games women are much more likely than men to be “equalitarians”: choosing a

division that gives equal payoffs. Likewise, Eckel and Grossman (1998) eliminate all

factors other than gender-related differences in selfishness and find that women are less

selfish than men in dictator games.

        Results 3 and 4 are interesting in the sense that Result 4 highlights the importance

of partner determination, a factor that is not often discussed and manipulated in

laboratory experiments. Result 3 indicates that partner attributes do not influence play.

This result is inconsistent with previous laboratory results that suggests trusting behavior

and trustworthiness rise with social connection (see, e.g., Glaeser et al., 2000; Fershtman

and Gneezy, 2001; Andreoni and Petrie, 2004). Indeed, Andreoni and Petrie (2004, pg.

6) note that “working with familiar others can reduce transactions costs, as familiarity can


6 The interested reader should see the excellent surveys on stakes effects in laboratory games in Camerer
and Hogarth (1999) and Hertwig and Ortmann (2001). Note that this result does not speak to the
comparison between hypothetical and real stakes. For a discussion of this comparison please see List
(2001).


                                                   12
enhance trust.” Yet, this finding is consistent with players not discriminating against

other players due to the “television” effect, which makes sense since discriminatory

behavior should be attenuated in the game show environment because the agent’s actions

are observed literally by millions of viewers.

        Nevertheless, it is clear from Result 4 that partner selection is crucial in

determining play. And, while discrimination is not observed at the level of the dilemma,

the data are sufficiently rich to allow an exploration of whether discrimination is evident

in the partner selection process. In particular, I can analyze whether players accurately

take into account the observable information of fellow players when choosing their

partners or if they systematically bias their choices in a manner that is consistent with

models of discrimination.

        To begin the examination, I estimate an earnings function of the following form:

        Earningsi = δ′Xj + εij,                                                         (4)

where Earningsi equals the amount person i would have earned had he played the strategy

that maximizes his own payoff function for this single game: trivia earnings*cooperate;

cooperate equals 1 if the individual’s partner cooperated, 0 otherwise.7 In Xj, I follow the

empirical analysis above and include observable characteristics for person j: gender,

race, age, and whether the person was a Californian. Summary statistics in Table 1 and

empirical estimates discussed above suggest that each of these characteristics influences

trivia earnings and the propensity to cooperate.

7 In the discussion below I take “proper” backward induction as representing choices that maximize one’s
own payoff function for this single game. It should be noted that backward induction for a conditional
cooperator may lead to a different result than for such a player (a conditional cooperator is an agent who
prefers to cooperate with those who cooperate and prefers to punish those who do not cooperate). And,
given the caveats in Section II, I ignore that proper backward induction should account for the unobserved
“larger game” that is taking place between the gameshow participants and members of the audience. In



                                                   13
        Thus, estimation of equation (4) provides insights into the effects of a partner’s

characteristics on the earnings of an agent who does not cooperate. I present marginal

effects estimates from the Tobit earnings model in column 1 of Table 4. The results

suggest a first finding:

           Result 5: Partner attributes influence players’ profits: white, older, and non-
           Californian partners increase earnings

These estimates also suggest an economically significant effect of these attributes. For

example, being paired with a white participant increases expected earnings by nearly

$900; and, at the overall sample means, an additional year of age for your partner maps

into a nearly $100 larger expected earnings.

        These estimates suggest that individual-specific observables matter, but the

necessary next step is to model the partnership selection process. In doing so, I take a

structural modeling approach and assume that person i selects person j if expected

payoffs, πij, exceed the expected payoffs, πik, for all alternative K persons.                    This

structural approach models the payoff for person i choosing person j as

        πij = β′Xj + µij ,                                                      (5)

where Xj is a vector of observable person-specific characteristics that potentially affect

payoffs, which include variables that measure expected trivia earnings and “willingness

to cooperate” in the prisoner’s dilemma game.




such a case, proper backward induction would include consideration of future financial impacts.



                                                    14
        A well-known property of equation (5) is that if the µij follow a Weibull

distribution and are independently and identically distributed, the probability that person i

will select person j is given by:8
                             K
        Pij = exp(β′Xj)/ ∑ exp (β′Xk),                                          (6)
                             k =1



where K is the number of alternatives (the three group 2 agents), and parameters, β, are

estimated using maximum likelihood techniques.

        Empirical results from estimating this discrete choice model are contained in

columns 2-6 of Table 4. I present estimates from a pooled model, and then delineate by

gender and age.9 Empirical estimates suggest the following insight:

        Result 6: There is evidence that agents statistically discriminate.

Estimates in column 2 of Table 4 suggest that women, whites, and non-Californians tend

to be chosen as partners more often than their counterparts. The empirical result that

women are preferred to men is ubiquitous: across every specification, but one, this result

is significant at better than the p < .10 level. A similar finding occurs for white agents:

every cohort prefers their partner to be a white participant. And, a similar result follows

for agents not from California.

        These empirical results are consistent with the view that agents have correct

beliefs about the empirical results from the earnings equation in column 1 of Table 4 and


8 The strong assumption that the error terms (µij) are independently and identically distributed imposes the
“Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives” (IIA) restriction on the predicted values. This assumption poses
problems since it stretches the bounds of credulity to assume that, for example, a person’s decision not to
choose one player is independent of her decision to reject another player. I tested for IIA via Hausman and
McFadden’s (1984) specification test and found that the maintained assumption of independence of the
stochastic terms in the utility function was valid in those cases where the Hessian did not become singular.
9 I suppress discussion of empirical estimates from other groupings of the data (e.g., whites, non-whites,
Californians, non-Californians, etc.), as they are similar to the broader group of empirical estimates
presented in Table 4.


                                                    15
correctly choose their partners. Such evidence is consistent with the notion that agents

use observable characteristics to make statistical inference about their prospective

partners in the Arrow (1972) and Phelps (1972) sense (statistical discrimination). In this

spirit, these results are consistent with participants using individual observables in an

effort to maximize their own earnings. In light of the literature that suggests people are

not well calibrated in their probability judgments (see, e.g., Camerer, 1995), these results

are quite surprising. Perhaps even more surprising is that participants perform this well

considering that all of the shows were taped prior to the television premiere.

        As well as agents statistically discriminate along certain observables, one result at

odds with this insight is:

       Result 7: Agents do not properly anticipate the effects of their partner’s age
on potential earnings.

This finding can be gleaned from empirical estimates in Table 4. Column 1 of Table 4

shows that older partners provide higher expected profits than younger agents provide, an

effect that is statistically significant at the p < .05 level. As Tables 1 and 2 highlight, this

result is entirely due to older agents cooperating more than younger agents, rather than

superior performance in the trivia questions.

        Column 2-6 in Table 4 illustrate that these higher earnings are generally not

reflected in partner choices. For example, in every specification, except for the case

when mature participants are choosing, younger agents are preferred. For women and

younger agent selectors, the coefficients are statistically significant at conventional

levels. The pattern of choices causes agents to lose thousands of dollars in earnings.

        Overall, Table 4 shows that agents typically perform quite well in using

observables to select partners to maximize their earnings. Yet, when it comes to drawing



                                              16
inference from prospective partners’ ages, all agents, except for the older agents,

miscalculate the attractiveness of partnering with more mature players. Indeed, selectors,

particular women and younger agents, even favor younger agents in the partner selection

process. This behavior is consistent with several underlying models, one of which is a

“taste” for discrimination in the Becker (1975) sense: economic actors are willing to pay

a financial price to avoid interacting with older agents. Yet, much like many empirical

studies in the literature on discrimination, while these findings appear to be more

consistent with some agent types having a general “distaste” for others, selectors

incorrectly applying statistical inference about partners, for example, cannot be ruled

out.10   However, as Levitt (2004; p. 431) points out, a simple model of incorrect

stereotyping, while perhaps descriptively valid, is “not a very satisfying economic model

because it implies that individuals are making systematic errors.”

                                      IV. Concluding Comments

         Adam Smith’s invisible hand property—if each individual acts in a manner that

maximizes his or her own profit, the total profit for the community will be maximized—

remains an important influence within the behavioral sciences. Yet game theorists have

proposed a simple situation in which promotion of self-interest does not unequivocally

lead to globally optimal solutions: the prisoner’s dilemma game. Every year thousands

of new undergraduate and graduate students are introduced to noncooperative game

theory via simple illustrations and examples of the classic prisoner’s dilemma game. To




10 Yet, using gameshow data from the Weakest Link, Levitt (2004) also finds evidence of taste-based
discrimination against the older players. One way to parse these theories is to use a series of field
experiments wherein beliefs are elicited (List, 2004).



                                                 17
my best knowledge, however, there does not exist an empirical examination of behavior

in a high stakes game that mirrors the classic prisoner’s dilemma tale.

       This study fills this gap by examining data drawn from a game show that is

stunningly similar to the classic example. If one were to conduct such an experiment in

the laboratory, the cost to gather the data would be well over $350,000. The results

suggest a few major themes: in a one-shot prisoner’s dilemma game over high stakes,

play is not unduly influenced by the level of stakes. Indeed, at every level of monetary

stakes thousands of dollars are literally left on the table by agents playing the weakly

dominant strategy of not cooperating.        A further insight concerns discriminatory

behavior, which is indicated in the data. For example, there is evidence that agents use

observable characteristics to make statistical inference about their prospective partners.

In this spirit, while participants make proper use of variables such as race, gender, and

geographic residence in an effort to maximize their own earnings, they tend to under-

select older participants.   Such behavior is consistent with agents having a general

“distaste” for such players. While these findings have important implications, I view it

apropos to highlight that any interpretation of results should keep in mind the various

caveats discussed in Section II.

Notes:
a
  “Team” variables are dichotomous and equal 1 for whether the team is composed as such and 0
otherwise. For example, “Team Male” equals one if both players on the team are male, 0
otherwise.
b
  Marginal effects are calculated as changes in the covariates on the j probabilities: ∂Prob[cell
j]/∂Xi = [f(φj-1 - Xi′β) – f(φj - Xi′β)]*β
c
  *Significant at the p < .05 level; #Significant at the p < .10 level.

Notes:
   1) Column 1 estimates are obtained via a Tobit model and reveal how a partner’s
       characteristics influence the take-home earnings of a Nash player. Thus, the dependent
       variable equals: trivia earnings*cooperate, where cooperate equals 1 if the partner
       cooperated, 0 otherwise. Columns 2-6 present empirical estimates are from a discrete
       choice logit model. Parameter estimates reveal how characteristics of group 2 agents
       influence group 1 agents’ selections. “Young” (“Mature”) are choosers who are less than
       (greater than or equal to) 31 years old.
   2) Figures in parentheses are standard errors; *Significant at the p < .05 level; #Significant at
       the p < .10 level.
