                                              ABSTRACT

This descriptive paper documents how segregation between blacks and whites across colleges in the
United States has evolved since the 1960s. It also explores potential channels through which changes
are occurring, and it uses recent data to study the issue of segregation within colleges. The main findings
are as follows: (1) White exposure to blacks has been rising since the 1960s, whereas black exposure
to whites increased sharply in the late 1960s and early 1970s and has fluctuated since then. Meanwhile,
black-white dissimilarity and the Theil index fell sharply in the late 1960s and early 1970s and have
fallen more gradually since. (2) There has been regional convergence, although colleges in the South
remain more segregated than those in any other region when measured by dissimilarity, by the Theil
index, or by black exposure to whites. (3) A major channel for the decline in segregation is the declining
share of blacks attending historically black colleges and universities. (4) Although there is segregation
within universities, most segregation across major × university cells occurs across universities.

I. Introduction

       In the early twentieth century, Southern states operated dual systems of higher education,

and universities in other regions of the country enrolled very few African-American students.

But then several important Supreme Court rulings held that the separate higher education

accommodations provided to blacks were in fact unequal (Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada in

1938, Sipuel v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma in 1948, and Sweatt v. Painter

and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education in 1950), which helped set the

stage for the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education ruling that separate can never be equal. Some

states took longer than others to integrate their colleges, but U.S. colleges today are open to

students of all races. But as evidenced by affirmative action bans in several states, recent court

rulings, ongoing college desegregation litigation, and the fact that the Supreme Court recently

heard the affirmative action cases Fisher v. University of Texas and Schuette v. Coalition to

Defend Affirmative Action, issues of race and higher education are still high on the public policy

agenda. Further, colleges today are less segregated than they were a century ago, but students of

different races still have differing enrollment patterns.

       The main purpose of this descriptive paper is to document how racial segregation

between blacks and whites has evolved across four-year colleges in the United States since the

1960s and to consider some potential channels through which changes are occurring. Although

little is known about racial segregation at the college level, research on K-12 schools has found

negative effects of racial segregation on students and has found positive effects of desegregation

plans (Guryan 2004; Johnson 2010, 2011; Reber 2010; Weiner, Lutz, and Ludwig 2009).

Moreover, the Supreme Court has taken the view in two important affirmative action cases,

1978’s Regents of the University of California v. Bakke and 2003’s Grutter v. Bollinger, that



                                                  2
affirmative action is constitutional on the grounds that there are educational benefits to racial

diversity. Furthermore, racial segregation across colleges may have important implications for

social networks, job networks, and housing patterns. This may in turn affect incomes, economic

inequality, and social cohesion. But even though little is certain about the consequences of racial

segregation in higher education, documenting its extent and considering some explanations for

its trends should be a worthwhile step toward a more complete understanding of racial

segregation at the college level. Because there is so little existing evidence even about the extent

of racial segregation at the college level, a study that thoroughly addresses this topic has the

potential to uncover important facts that will help guide future research.

       In showing how the level of racial segregation has changed over the years, I utilize data

on the racial composition of nearly every college in the continental 48 states and the District of

Columbia in the even years between 1968 and 1988 and every year between 1990 and 2011. I

also make use of data on the racial compositions of public universities in the South every year

from 1960 to 1967. I employ standard measures of segregation such as the index of white

exposure to blacks, the index of black exposure to whites, the black-white dissimilarity index,

and the Theil index to study how segregation has evolved nationally. I also examine differences

by geographic region and public/private control, and I explore potential channels for changes in

segregation over time. At the end of the paper I use data from 2011 to study the issue of

segregation across majors within colleges. The main results are:

       (1) White exposure to blacks has been rising since the 1960s, whereas black exposure to

           whites increased sharply in the late 1960s and early 1970s and has fluctuated since

           then. Meanwhile, black-white dissimilarity and the Theil index fell sharply in the late

           1960s and early 1970s and have fallen more gradually since.



                                                  3
       (2) There has been regional convergence, although colleges in the South remain more

           segregated than those in any other region when measured by dissimilarity or by black

           exposure to whites.

       (3) A major channel for the decline in segregation, especially in the South, is the

           declining share of blacks attending historically black colleges and universities.

       (4) Although there is segregation within universities, most segregation across major ×

           university cells occurs across universities.

The next section of this paper discusses previous related research, and the following section

discusses the data. The next three sections show results for segregation across colleges. After

that, I consider the issue of segregation within colleges, and I conclude by summarizing the

results and discussing possible directions for future research.



II. Previous Research

       There has been a large amount of research on racial segregation in contexts other than

higher education in recent years, especially in the context of elementary and secondary schools.

This work on elementary and secondary schools includes descriptive work (Clotfelter 2004;

Cascio et al. 2008; Rivkin and Welch 2006) and research on the impact of financial incentives on

desegregation (Cascio et al. 2010). It also includes work on the effects of K-12 desegregation

policy on segregation levels (Reber 2005), school district finances (Reber 2011), housing prices

(Boustan 2012), residential and school choices (Baum-Snow and Lutz 2011), educational

outcomes (Guryan 2004; Reber 2010; Johnson 2011), economic outcomes (Johnson 2011),




                                                 4
health (Johnson 2010, 2011), and crime (Weiner, Lutz, and Ludwig 2009; Johnson 2011). 1

Clotfelter, Vigdor, and Ladd (2006); Lutz (2011); and Reardon et al. (2012) have studied

whether there is “resegregation” now that desegregation plans are being lifted. Billings, Deming,

and Rockoff (2014) study the effects of ending a desegregation plan on academic outcomes and

crime. Apart from the study of schools, other areas of recent research interest include residential

segregation (Ananat 2011; Ananat and Washington 2009; Boustan 2011; Card, Mas, and

Rothstein 2008; Card and Rothstein 2007; La Ferrara and Mele 2007); labor market segregation

(Hellerstein and Neumark 2008; Hellerstein, Neumark, and McInerney 2008); and hospital

desegregation (Almond, Chay, and Greenstone 2006; Chay, Guryan, and Mazumder 2009).

         Although racial segregation in other contexts has been thoroughly studied, there is very

little research on segregation at the college level. A notable exception is Clotfelter (2004, Ch. 6),

who documents segregation levels at U.S. colleges and universities in 1976, 1986, and 1998. 2

Clotfelter (2004, Ch. 6) also makes use of selected pre-1976 data by reporting racial

compositions of a set of 28 selective institutions in 1951, 1967, and 1970; showing the exposure

rate of whites to nonwhites for a sample of 175 institutions for 1970 as well as the four-year

private institutions among them for 1967; and reporting a segregation index for four-year public

institutions in the South in 1961, 1965, and 1970. This paper adds to Clotfelter (2004, Ch. 6) by

taking the full sample of universities farther back in time, going farther forward in time, and

exploring the dynamics of segregation over shorter intervals (every other year from 1968 to 1988

and year-to-year from 1990 to 2011). I also consider some explanations for the observed trends,

  Rivkin and Welch (2006) provide useful background information and a review of earlier research on elementary
and secondary school desegregation. For another overview, see Vigdor (2011). For a recent cross-country study of
segregation, see Alesina and Zhuravskaya (2011).
2
  Another piece about racial segregation at the college level, albeit not about segregation in the overall student body,
is Goff, McCormick, and Tollison (2002). That paper finds that winning Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC)
basketball teams integrated first and that doing so further improved their records. Additionally, see Arcidiacono
(2005), Arcidiacono et al. (2014), Hinrichs (2012, 2014), Howell (2010), and Long (2004) on the issue of race-based
affirmative action.

show the full distribution of exposure in addition to showing the average, and consider

segregation across majors within colleges. To the extent that it is possible to compare, the results

in Clotfelter (2004, Ch. 6) and this paper are broadly consistent. However, some important

results emerge from using the additional data, including the fact that there was a large decline in

segregation between 1968 and 1972, the trends in segregation since 1998, and the fact that

changes in segregation are generally more gradual than episodic.



III. Data

       The data I use in most of the analysis are data on fall full-time undergraduate enrollment

by race for nearly every four-year college in the continental United States. These data exist for

the even years from 1968 to 1988 and for every year from 1990 to 2011. The data since 1986

come from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS), data from 1976-1984

come from the Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS), and data for the earlier

years come from surveys conducted by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) whose results I

digitized (U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare Office for Civil Rights 1969,

1972, 1974, 1976).

       Although other racial groups have played an increasingly prominent role in American

higher education over the years, there are several reasons why this paper focuses on segregation

between blacks and whites. First, much of the history of race relations in the United States

centers around blacks and whites. Second, as seen in Figure 1, representation of other racial

groups at U.S. colleges and universities was limited until recently. Third, although the results

are not reported here, the overall trends in segregation between underrepresented minorities

collectively (i.e., combining blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans into one group) and whites



                                                 6
and also between non-whites and whites are similar to the trends in segregation between blacks

and whites. Many of the same trends are also evident when examining particular minority

groups other than blacks, as well.

          A few additional points about the data are in order. First, I exclude Alaska and Hawaii

from the analysis because these states do not appear in the data I employ until 1976. However,

the main results are not sensitive to the exclusion or inclusion of colleges in these states. 3

Second, I focus on four-year colleges. But although not shown here, many of the trends with

two-year colleges are similar. One difference, though, is that black-white dissimilarity fluctuates

more across two-year colleges than across four-year colleges, even though in both cases the

general trend is toward less segregation. Third, although again the results are not shown here,

the same general trends in segregation are seen when limiting the data to a balanced panel of

universities that appear in the data set in each year. However, entry and exit of colleges may be

an important channel through which changes in segregation occur, which is why the results

shown in this paper include the full sample available in each year. Fourth, due to the nature of

the data, my calculations of segregation by region are based on region of college attendance

rather than region of residence. However, most students attend college in their home census

region. For example, according to my calculations from the 2011 IPEDS Residence and

Migration survey, 89.5% of four-year college students in 2011 attended a college in their home

region. 4 It is also worth noting that, to the extent that college students live near their college

after they exit, studying college racial segregation by the census region of college attendance

may provide some information about later residential segregation or segregation of friendship

groups.

3
  On the other hand, I keep data from West Virginia even though data from that state are missing in 1970. But
again, the main results are not sensitive to this decision.
4
  The data do not permit breaking this figure down by race.

                                                         7
        To help put the later results on segregation in context, Figure 1 shows how the racial

composition of colleges overall has evolved. The figure reveals that colleges in the U.S. have

become less white and more black over time. The figure also shows that representation of other

racial groups was limited until recently. Although not shown here, analysis of data from the

October Current Population Survey education supplements from 1968 to 2010 suggests that the

rising ratio of blacks to whites in four-year colleges comes about at least in part because of a

rising ratio of blacks to whites in the college-aged population. Trends in the black-white relative

four-year college attendance rate are more difficult to discern with the CPS data, although blacks

in recent years do seem to be attending college at a relatively higher rate compared to whites

than they did in the earlier years.



IV. Exposure

        One way of conceptualizing segregation is as isolation, which can lead to methods of

measuring segregation based on exposure indexes. The principle is to measure how much

contact students may potentially have with members of various races. I begin by showing the

extent to which whites are attending college with blacks by using the index of white exposure to

blacks. Suppose there are N colleges; that there are W white students overall; and that college i

enrolls wi white students, bi black students, hi Hispanic students, ai Asian students, and ni

Native American students. Then the exposure index of whites to blacks is defined as

            N
        1                        bi
100 ×
        W
            ∑w
            i =1
                   i
                       wi + bi + hi + ai + ni
                                              . This measures the percentage of students at the average


white student’s university who are black. Lower values of this index correspond to higher levels

of segregation.



                                                        8
         Figure 2 shows that white exposure to blacks has been rising almost continuously over

time. 5 In 1968, the typical white student attended a college that was 2.3% black. By 2011, this

had risen to 10.2%. This increase may be partly attributed to the rising share of blacks amongst

four-year college students seen in Figure 1. Black representation overall rose from 5.5% to

13.9% over this period. However, the magnitude of the increase in exposure in proportional

terms is much larger than the increase in black composition overall, which suggests that changes

in choices of which colleges to attend may also be partly responsible for the increase in

exposure. Figure 2 also reveals that at one time whites were more exposed to blacks at public

universities but now are at private universities. Table 1 shows that the states with the lowest

exposure of whites to blacks in both 1968 and 2011 were Western states with low black

populations. There have, however, been some changes in the states with the greatest exposure of

blacks to whites. In 1968 these tended to be Midwestern states such as Michigan and Illinois,

whereas in 2011 they were Southern states with large black populations such as Mississippi and

Georgia. It is also worth noting that exposure of whites to blacks increased dramatically at the

higher end. The highest value in 1968 was 6.0% in the District of Columbia, whereas the highest

value in 2011 was Mississippi’s 25.9%. Figure 3 further explores regional differences.

Exposure of whites to blacks has risen in each census region. The increase has been particularly

large in the South, although in recent years there has been a spike in white exposure to blacks in

the West. 6

         The exposure index of whites to blacks gives the percentage of students who are black at

the average white student’s university, but it may also be of interest to study the full distribution

5
 Although not shown here, the results are similar when calculating the denominator as simply wi+bi.
6
 This large increase in the West in recent years is in large part due to the University of Phoenix. If this institution is
dropped from the analysis, the increase in white exposure to blacks in the West in recent years becomes less
dramatic and Arizona is no longer one of the states with the highest exposure of whites to blacks. However, the
other results in the paper are substantively the same.

                                                            9
over which this average is taken. For example, one way in which an exposure index of 10 could

come about is through all white students attending colleges that are 10% black, but a different

way it could come about is through 90% of whites attending colleges that are 1% black and 10%

of whites attending colleges that are 91% black. These two distributions have very different

implications for the experience of the modal student. In order to investigate exposure in more

detail, Figure 4 plots the distribution for white students of the percentage of students who attend

their college who are black at four points in time: 1968, 1982, 1996, and 2011. The distribution

in 1968 has a very high peak at very low levels of percent black, showing that many white

students attended colleges enrolled very few blacks. This peak has fallen dramatically over time

as the distribution has shifted to the right, which shows that white students are not only on

average attending colleges that have greater black representation but that they are doing so

throughout the distribution.

           It is also useful to measure the extent to which blacks attend college with whites by using

the index of black exposure to whites. Using the same notation as before and letting B refer to

                                                                                 1 N             wi
the total number of black college students, this is defined as 100 ×               ∑   bi
                                                                                 B i =1 wi + bi + hi + ai + ni
                                                                                                               .


This measures the percentage of white students at the average black student’s college. The index

of black exposure to whites need not reveal the same trends in segregation as the index of white

exposure to blacks if, as is actually the case, the racial composition of the overall pool of

students is changing over time.

           Figure 5 shows that black exposure to whites increased sharply in the late 1960s and

early 1970s but has fluctuated since then. 7 In 1968, the typical black student attended a college

that was 38.6% white. By 1972, this had risen to 51.2%. In 2011, this figure stood at 48.7%.

7
    Although not shown here, the results are again similar when calculating the denominator as simply wi+bi.

                                                          10
The figure also reveals that blacks have greater exposure to whites at public universities,

although the trends over time are similar between publics and privates. Table 2 shows which

states had the highest and lowest black exposure to whites in 1968 and 2011. In both years,

Western and New England states with large white populations were the ones with the highest

exposure of blacks to whites. Southern states are heavily represented amongst those with the

lowest exposure in both years. However, the table also shows that there was a large increase in

exposure at the lower end between 1968 and 2011. For example, only 3.6% of students at the

college of the average black student in North Carolina were white in 1968, but this had risen to

35.0% by 2011. Figure 6 shows trends by census region over time. The most striking result here

is the regional convergence. The South had much lower exposure of blacks to whites than the

other regions in 1968, but exposure of blacks to whites there has risen over time. There was an

especially large increase in the 1970s. Meanwhile, exposure of blacks to whites has fallen in the

other regions. This falling exposure is surely in large part due to the declining white

representation overall observed in Figure 1, but it is also worth noting that it comes at a time

when inequality in the labor market, for example, is generally rising (Autor, Katz, and Kearney

2008).

         Figure 7 shows the full distribution of percent white for black students in 1968, 1982,

1996, and 2011. In 1968 the distribution was bimodal, with a large peak near 0 and a substantial

amount of mass at very high levels of percent white. Black students of this time period thus

experienced polar opposite college racial compositions. But the distribution of percent white for

black students has become much more uniform over time. There still are black students who

enroll at colleges that enroll few whites, although this is much less common than before. It is




                                                 11
also much more common for black students to attend colleges that enroll intermediate

percentages of white students.



V. Black-White Dissimilarity

         Changes in exposure come about through both changes in the overall representation of

the various racial groups and changes in how evenly those groups are distributed across colleges.

It may be useful to isolate the changes in how evenly students of different racial groups are

distributed across different colleges in a way that is not sensitive to the overall sizes of the

groups. One way to do so is with the black-white dissimilarity index, which is defined as

        1 N bi wi
100 ×     ∑ − . This measures the percentage of members of one racial group who would
        2 i =1 B W

need to switch colleges in order for all colleges to have the same ratio of white to black students

as one another. Higher values of the dissimilarity index correspond to greater segregation.

         Figure 8 reveals that black-white dissimilarity fell sharply in the late 1960s and early

1970s and has fallen gradually since then. In 1968, 63.9% of whites (or 63.9% of blacks) would

have needed to move to a different university in order for all universities to have the same ratio

of white to black students as one another. This figure had dropped to 52.5% by 1972 and to

48.0% by 2011. Figure 8 also reveals that the private sector is more segregated than the public

sector when segregation is measured by the black-white dissimilarity index. A similarity

between Figures 2, 5, and 8 is the large decline in segregation between 1968 and 1972. To put

the magnitudes of the black-white dissimilarity index in higher education in perspective, Rivkin

and Welch (2006) report that the black-white dissimilarity index in elementary and secondary

schools in the United States was 81.2% in 1968 and 68.7% in 2000. Thus, the higher education

sector is less segregated than the K-12 sector when measured by black-white dissimilarity. In

                                                  12
fact, K-12 schools were more segregated in 2000 than colleges and universities were in 1968.

However, one point to keep in mind when comparing segregation at the college level to

segregation at the elementary and secondary level is that college attendance is not compulsory,

and so the results do not necessarily measure the extent of segregation experienced by all

individuals of college age in their daily lives. Furthermore, if college attendance rates change,

the results may be sensitive to the type of college attended by the marginal student. But despite

this caveat, the results should still be valid as a measure of segregation amongst those students

who are enrolled in college.

       Table 3 shows which states were the most and least segregated according to the black-

white dissimilarity index in 1968 and 2011. The states with the lowest dissimilarity indexes tend

to be Western states, especially in 2011 but also to a lesser extent in 1968. The list of the most

segregated states in 1968 includes Deep South states like Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi. In

2011, these states are missing from the list, but the list includes the border states Maryland and

Delaware, as well as the District of Columbia. It is also noteworthy that the most segregated

states in 2011 were much less segregated than the most segregated states in 1968. For example,

in Virginia in 1968, nearly 97% of students of one race would have needed to switch colleges in

order for all colleges to have the same ratio of white to black students as one another. North

Carolina appears in a similar slot in the two lists, but the dissimilarity index had fallen by nearly

35 percentage points between 1968 and 2011.

       Figure 9 shows trends by region over time. This figure clearly demonstrates regional

convergence. Segregation has fallen dramatically over time in the South, and it has increased in

the other regions. But despite this regional convergence and dramatic decline in segregation in

the South, colleges in the South have consistently remained more segregated than those in any



                                                 13
other region when measured by dissimilarity or by black exposure to whites. This is in contrast

to the case of K-12 schools, in which, at least from 1972 to 2000, schools in the South were

actually less segregated than those in other regions (Clotfelter 2004, Table 2.1; Rivkin and

Welch 2006, Table 4). 8 A simple explanation for the lower K-12 segregation but higher college

segregation in the South is that it may be more difficult to desegregate colleges than elementary

and secondary schools. For example, college attendance is not compulsory, and students

generally have more choice of which college to attend than which high school to attend. It is

more common to move away for college than it is for high school, and the private sector, which

is less subject to government oversight than the public sector, is larger for colleges than for K-12.

Although parents choose elementary and secondary schools through residential location choices,

there is no analog of “forced busing” or “attendance zones” in higher education. This high level

of choice in higher education may facilitate racial segregation at the college level. On the other

hand, since colleges generally have wider catchment areas than elementary and secondary school

districts, college desegregation policy is not limited by residential segregation to the extent that

elementary and secondary desegregation policy is.

         Figure 10 gives evidence of the decline in segregation in South over a longer time period

by using data on Southern public universities going back to 1960. The pre-1968 data consist of

information from a Chronicle of Higher Education article that published results from an Office

for Civil Rights survey on the racial compositions of colleges enrolling 500 students or more in

1967, as well as reports from the Southern Education Reporting Service (SERS) on the racial

compositions of public universities in the South from 1960-1966 (Southern Education Reporting


8
 Additionally, when compared to the results for elementary and secondary schools presented by Rivkin and Welch
(2006), elementary and secondary schools in the South show a similar level of segregation to colleges and
universities in that region over the years. In other regions, however, K-12 schools are more segregated than colleges
are.

Education 1968). Contrary to the case of the other data sources used in this study, there is a fair

amount of missing data in the SERS reports. But taking the results at face value, Figure 10

reveals that the decline in black-white dissimilarity in the South is even more dramatic when

viewed over a longer period of time. Furthermore, the public university systems in Alabama,

Mississippi, and South Carolina were completely segregated at the beginning of the time period I

examine, and the university systems in all the Southern states were completely segregated in the

beginning part of the twentieth century. Thus, extrapolating the results in Figure 10 back in time

would make the decline in segregation appear yet more dramatic. 9



VI. Theil Index

            A strength of the dissimilarity index as a measure of unevenness is that its magnitudes

have a natural interpretation as the percentage of members of one group who would need to

switch colleges in order for colleges to be racially balanced. A weakness, however, is that the

dissimilarity index does not allow one to partition segregation into different components in order

to take a closer look at why segregation exists (Reardon, Yun, and Eitle 2000). I thus turn to an

alternative index, the Theil index, which does allow for such decompositions.

                                                                                           B
            The Theil index is built up from a measure of entropy. Letting P =                and
                                                                                         B +W

    pi =           , the overall entropy is defined as E = P ⋅ ln + (1 − P ) ⋅ ln      and the entropy at

 However, one caveat is that, as Wallenstein (2009) points out, blacks attended the University of South Carolina as
undergraduates during Reconstruction, so references to “the first black student to attend a white university in the
South” often actually refer to the first student to do so in the twentieth century. Furthermore, the University of
Alabama had briefly enrolled a black student in 1956, but public institutions in Alabama were completely segregated
again after that.

college i is defined as Ei = pi ⋅ ln      + (1 − pi ) ⋅ ln        . Although magnitudes of entropy are
                                       pi                  1 − pi

difficult to interpret, these functions are maximized at and are also symmetric about P = .5 and

pi = .5 . They are thus measures of racial imbalance. The Theil index, defined as

            N
                  bi + wi E − Ei
H = 100 × ∑ (            )(      ) , is an enrollment-weighted average of how the entropy at
           i =1   B +W      E

particular colleges differs from overall entropy.

       Higher values of the Theil index correspond to higher levels of segregation. Comparing

Figure 11, Figure 12, and Table 4 to Figure 8, Figure 9, and Table 3 shows that trends in

segregation as measured by the Theil index are similar to trends in segregation as measured by

the dissimilarity index. However, unlike the dissimilarity index, the Theil index allows for

decompositions that partition segregation additively into different components. These

decompositions are an accounting exercise and do not necessarily answer any specific causal

question. However, they may still be useful for identifying channels through which changes in

segregation occur and for ruling out other channels.

       I first partition segregation into a within-state component and an across-state component.

One potential reason why there is segregation between blacks and whites is that blacks and

whites live in different states from one another, or at least choose to attend colleges in different

states from one another. On the other hand, there may be substantial segregation within states.

Letting H S refer to the quantity obtained when aggregating the data up to the state level and

calculating the Theil index across the 48 states in the data and the District of Columbia, H s refer

to the Theil index within state s , E s refer to the entropy within state s , Bs refer to the number

of blacks attending college within state s , and Ws refer to the number of whites attending college

on the right-hand side is the cross-state component, and the second term is the within-state

component. 10 Figure 13 displays the results when performing this decomposition for each year

of the data. The results show that the within-state component is much larger than the between-

state component and also that, at least in an accounting sense, the overall Theil index has been

falling primarily because the within-state component is falling. This leaves open the question of

why the within-state component has been falling, but it suggests that differences in the states in

which whites and blacks attend college are not the major contributor to segregation or to its

decline over time.

            A potential channel through which the decline in racial segregation over time is occurring

is the large decline in the share of black college students who are attending historically black

colleges and universities (HBCUs). HBCUs are higher education institutions that were created

prior to 1964 with the goal of educating black Americans, and the vast majority of them are

located in the South. Private HBCUs were primarily founded in the latter half of the nineteenth

century by Northern missionaries and philanthropists, and many of the public HBCUs are the

consequence of the 1890 Second Morrill Act, which prohibited federal land grant funding from

going to states that operated universities intended for students of one race unless they also

                                                              17
operated universities for students of other races. Over 100 HBCUs still exist today, the large

majority of which are four-year institutions.

       Figure 14 shows that as recently as 1970 over half of black college students enrolled in a

four-year college were enrolled in an HBCU. That share is now down to less than 20%.

Meanwhile, although whites are eligible to attend HBCUs, Figure 14 shows that a very small

fraction of white college students choose to do so. Figure 15 reveals that, whereas non-HBCUs

enroll a mix of racial groups, HBCUs continue to have a largely black student body. This figure

may even give the impression that there are more whites at the typical HBCU than there actually

are, since a large share of the white HBCU attendance is concentrated at a small number of

HBCUs that have large white representations. Two HBCUs in West Virginia, Bluefield State

College and West Virginia State University, were 87.2% and 78.7% white in 2011. Lincoln

University in Missouri was over half white at one point and was 41.9% white in 2011. These

three institutions combined enrolled 34.4% of the whites enrolled at HBCUs in 2011. On the

opposite extreme are institutions such as Lane College, a private HBCU in Tennessee that was

100% black in 2011, and Spelman College, which was 99.5% black in 2011 and enrolled no

whites. The median HBCU in 2011 was 96.6% black. Because HBCUs have a predominantly

black enrollment and non-HBCUs do not, as seen in Figure 15, the shift in black enrollment from

HBCUs to non-HBCUs observed in Figure 14 would presumably decrease measured segregation.

       To study the relationship between HBCU attendance and racial segregation across

colleges more formally, I divide colleges into two sectors: HBCUs and traditionally white

institutions (TWIs, or non-HBCUs). Figure 16 presents results from decomposing the Theil

index into a between-sector component and a within-sector component. The results suggest that

in the earlier part of the time period I study, most segregation was attributable to the fact that a



                                                  18
large share of blacks attended HBCUs but very few whites did. However, the amount of

segregation attributable to the between-sector component has been falling over time, whereas the

within-sector component has actually been rising. This trend has occurred to such a large extent

that the within-sector component of segregation now outweighs the between-sector component.

         Although it appears that the decline in HBCU enrollment has resulted in a lower level of

segregation, the effect of HBCUs on segregation levels is just one factor that should be taken

into account when evaluating the merits of HBCUs. 11 For example, it is well known that

HBCUs have a long history of being a training ground for black leaders. They may provide a

welcoming atmosphere for black students and remedial education opportunities for

underprepared students. Mykerezi and Mills (2008) find that HBCUs led to higher wage growth

for black males using the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Fryer and Greenstone

(2010) find that the returns to attending an HBCU were positive in the 1970s, but they do find

that the returns were negative in the 1990s.

         Fryer and Greenstone’s findings may be useful in explaining the declining HBCU

attendance seen in Figure 14 and the accompanying reduction in segregation seen in Figure 16,

or vice versa. On the one hand, the lower return to attending an HBCU may cause an enrollment

shift away from HBCUs and toward non-HBCUs. On the other hand, the lower return may be a

consequence of the enrollment shift if, for example, lower enrollments made HBCUs less

efficient or if high-ability black students (or faculty) left HBCUs for non-HBCUs and left the

remaining students in a lesser position to benefit from peer effects. A third possibility, however,

is that declining black HBCU enrollment is somewhat mechanical. The number of HBCUs

presumably will not increase over time, since they are carryovers of an earlier era when Southern

11
  In addition, to the extent that HBCUs are drawing in students who would not attend college otherwise, it is not
clear that it should be cause for concern that HBCUs are increasing racial segregation amongst those who are
enrolled in college.

                                                         19
states operated dual systems of higher education and higher education opportunities for blacks

were extremely limited. In fact, federal legislation defines HBCUs as having existed prior to

1964. Thus, under this definition, any increase in HBCU enrollment would need to come about

through increases in enrollment at existing HBCUs rather than through entry of new HBCUs. To

the extent that the existing HBCUs have limited capacity to expand, it is natural that a smaller

share of black college students will be attending HBCUs over time as the number of black

college students rises. In fact, in results not shown here, I find that the count of black students

enrolled at HBCUs has actually risen over time but that this increase has not been as large as the

increase in the number of black college students overall.



VII. Segregation within Colleges

       Even if blacks and whites are attending the same colleges as one another, this does not

mean that they are friends with one another or that they are taking the same courses, participating

in the same activities outside of the classroom, or living near each other. Segregation across

friendship groups, courses, extracurricular activities, and residential location within colleges may

be just as important as - or even more important than - segregation across colleges.

       Data for studying segregation across the entire country at a finer level than the college

level are limited, but I attempt to shed some light on the issue by measuring segregation in

earned degrees across all major × university combinations using data from the 2011 IPEDS

Completions survey. This data set provides university-level information on the number of

students of each race who received a bachelor’s degree by two-digit, four-digit, and six-digit

Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) major codes. To give an example of these major

codes, the six-digit code 450601 is “Economics, General,” the four-digit code 4506 combines



                                                 20
“Economics, General” with related categories like “Econometrics and Quantitative Economics”

and “International Economics,” and the two-digit code 45 combines the various economics

majors with majors in other social sciences such as political science and sociology.

       This data set provides some information about the extent to which students are in the

same classroom with students of a different race and possibly about the extent to which members

of different racial groups are interacting with one another, but there are also several limitations to

using these data to study segregation at the college level. First, since not every college student

goes on to graduate, there are many students who attended college but are not included in the

data. Second, major choice is only one measure of interaction. Course selection within the

major, extracurricular activities, living groups, and friendship groups may be important as well.

But even though the data are not ideal and the evidence is admittedly limited, the results should

still be valid as measures of segregation across majors amongst college graduates.

       The results using the within-college data are presented in Table 5. The first column

aggregates the major data up to the university level to examine segregation across colleges only

for those who graduated with a bachelor’s degree. The results in this column are somewhat

similar to those presented in Figures 2, 5, 8, and 11 for segregation across colleges for all

enrolled students in recent years. However, comparing the results in the first column of Table 5

to the earlier figures suggests that there is lower white exposure to blacks amongst bachelor’s

recipients than there is amongst all undergraduate students at four-year colleges, but there is less

segregation amongst bachelor’s recipients by the other measures. As the table moves across

columns, it measures segregation across smaller units. Students would presumably have more

interaction in the classroom with those at their university with whom they share the same six-

digit major code than they would with the average student at the university, and they would



                                                 21
presumably also have more interaction with those at their university with whom they share a

two-digit or four-digit major code than they would with those with whom they only share a six-

digit major code.

       Interestingly, when moving across columns from the university level to eventually the

two-digit major level at the university, the results do not change a great deal. For example, 7.9%

of the graduates at the typical white graduate’s university are black, and 7.2% of the graduates at

the typical white graduate’s university sharing the same six-digit major code are black. This

suggests that, although there is segregation within colleges, much of the segregation observed in

higher education is segregation across colleges rather than segregation within colleges across

majors. The row giving results for the Theil index provides information required to show this

more formally in a decomposition of segregation across major × university combinations into a

cross-university component and a within-university component. For example, the Theil index of

34.3 across six-digit major × university combinations can be decomposed into the 25.0 shown in

the first column attributable to segregation across universities and the remaining 9.3 (34.3 –

25.0) attributable to segregation within universities. Segregation across four-digit and two-digit

major × university combinations can be decomposed in a similar way, and in each case the

across-university component is substantially larger than the within-university component.

       Table 5 also shows decompositions of segregation into within- and between-state

components and within- and across-HBCU/TWI sector components. Consistent with the results

in Figures 13 and 16 for all students in recent years, the results in the first column show that most

segregation across colleges for college graduates in 2011 was attributable to the within-state

component and to the within-HBCU/TWI component. The other columns of Table 5 show that

the within-state component and the within-HBCU/TWI component are even larger when



                                                 22
studying major × university combinations, although this is true mechanically because the

“across” components are the same and the “within” component cannot fall when studying

segregation at a finer level.



VIII. Conclusion

        The results of this paper suggest that, by several different measures, segregation at the

college level has declined over the years. Black-white dissimilarity and the Theil index have

fallen, whites have been increasingly exposed to blacks, and black exposure to whites is higher

than it was in 1970 even though it has fluctuated since then. The trend of blacks attending

HBCUs at a lower rate may be decreasing segregation, although on the other hand segregation is

rising within traditionally white institutions. Further, in three of four census regions, the index of

black exposure to whites, the black-white dissimilarity index, and the Theil index all point to

greater segregation over time. Additionally, based on the results of this paper, substantially

increasing the amount of interaction between blacks and whites in the classroom would seem to

necessitate students attending different colleges rather than changing students’ choices of field of

study within colleges. When viewed as a whole, the results of this paper may suggest some

successes but also some cause for concern for those who are concerned about racial segregation

in higher education.

        This paper represents a step toward understanding racial segregation at the college level

by documenting how it has evolved over time and considering some channels through which

changes in segregation are occurring. A useful avenue for future research would be to estimate

the impact of higher education segregation on social networks, job networks, housing patterns,

educational outcomes, earnings, income inequality, and other outcomes. It may also be fruitful



                                                 23
to study the effects on segregation of other factors, such as college tuition policy. It is also worth

noting that policies and events that coincide with declining segregation, including falling

enrollment at HBCUs, may come along with other costs or benefits. Understanding these costs

and benefits would be useful as well. There are many difficult issues involved in making

policies related to issues of race in higher education; but the effects of policies on segregation

levels and other outcomes, as well as the effects of segregation, are factors that should be taken

into account when thinking about which policies to enact.
