                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper we consider how the dental industry responded to the addition of fluoride to public drinking
water. We take advantage of the staggered introduction of fluoridation throughout the country to analyze
the changes in numbers of within-county dentists relative to physicians in the years surrounding the
change in fluoridation status. We find a significant decrease in the number of dental establishments
and an even larger reduction in the number of employees per firm following fluoridation. We also
find that fluoridation in neighboring markets was associated with an increase in own-market dental
supply, suggesting that dentists responded to the demand shock by moving from fluoridated areas
to close-by markets. Further analysis suggests that some dentists may have retrained as specialists
rather than moving geographically. Our estimates imply that the 8 percentage point change in exposure
to water fluoridation from 1974 to 1992 may have led to the loss of as many as 0.6 percent of dental
establishments and 2.1 percent of dental employees, suggesting a substantial net impact of this public
good on the dental profession since its inception.

1. Introduction

        Shortly after researchers found that communities with higher rates of naturally occurring

fluoride had lower rates of tooth decay (Dean, 1938), public water systems began adding fluoride

to public drinking water. 1 As a result, the incidence of tooth decay fell dramatically in

fluoridated communities (Burt and Eklund, 1999) 2 , leading to a period of widespread adoption of

community water fluoridation. By 2006, nearly 70% of the U.S. population served by public

water systems received fluoridated water (CDC, 2008). Given the significant reduction in tooth

decay, extremely low incidence of side-effects, and low costs to provide 3 , community water

fluoridation (CWF) has been called “one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the

20th century” (CDC, 1999).

        Fluoridation can be viewed as a public good that substitutes for a private good: once

added to the water supply, all consumers in the area are provided with a perfect substitute for

privately available dietary fluoride supplements. 4 The equilibrium impacts of this public good,

however, likely extend far beyond the market for fluoride. Prior to the availability of dietary

fluoride, formal dental care was the primary method for treating tooth decay. Since CWF lowers

the incidence of tooth decay, it serves as a partial substitute for dental care. By lowering the

demand for formal dental care, CWF may also impact the number of practicing dentists. 5

Furthermore, since the dental profession offers a wide range of services in addition to treating

tooth decay, dentists may respond to this reduced demand by shifting into other closely related

  The first community to add fluoride to drinking water was Grand Rapids, MI in 1945,

  However, some sources dispute this. See Section 5 for a discussion.

  The estimated costs of fluoridation per person per year are $0.50 for communities with greater than 20,000 people,
$1 for communities with 10-20,00 people, $1.50 for communities with 5-10,000 people, and $3 if fewer than 5,000
people (Griffin et al., 2001)
4
  CWF may be not a public good if a water shortage makes it rivalrous, but this is extremely uncommon in our
sample.

  Interestingly, despite the potential consequences on the industry, dentists generally support community water
fluoridation (http://www.ada.org/public/topics/fluoride/index.asp)

occupations within the industry not impacted by CWF, such as orthodontics or cosmetics. The

high reported success and widespread adoption of water fluoridation suggests the technological

impact from this simple public good may have dramatically transformed the dental industry.

        In this paper we use several administrative files at the county-level to explore how the

dental industry changed in response to the provision of fluoridated water in the 1970s – 1990s.

We take advantage of the staggered introduction of fluoridation throughout the country to

compare the changes in numbers of within-county dentists in the years surrounding the change in

fluoridation status. Since decisions regarding water fluoridation may be endogeneous, we

include data on physicians – a comparably skilled group affected by local public health policies

but unaffected by water fluoridation – as a control group to estimate difference in differences

models. 6 We assume that changes in fluoridation status are exogenous to other factors that may

have affected dental supply differentially from physician supply. The adoption of water

fluoridation can therefore be used to identify the causal affect of fluoridation on the number of

dentists.

        We find substantial evidence of a response. First, using data from the County Business

Patterns, we uncover a statistically significant decrease in the number of dental establishments,

but an even more substantial decrease in the number of dental employees and payroll. A move

from 0 to 100% fluoridation is associated with a 9% reduction in the number of establishments

compared to a nearly 25% reduction in the average number of employees per firm. Second, we

find that fluoridation in neighboring markets increases own-market dental supply, supporting the

hypothesis that dentists moved from fluoridated areas to close-by markets that had not yet been

affected by this negative demand shock. Several robustness checks support the validity of these

6
 This control group is invalid if dentists switched to being a physician in response to CWF. Of the 322 dentists and
1359 physicians identified in the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and followed for roughly the same time period,
none switched between the two professions, suggesting this is an unlikely response.


                                                         3
                                                                                                                       .


findings. Our estimates imply that the 8 percentage point change in exposure to water

fluoridation from 1974 to 1992 may have led to the loss of as many as 0.6 percent of dental

establishments and 2.1 percent of dental employees. Given current fluoridation rates of 70

percent, this suggests that community water fluoridation has had a substantial overall impact on

the dental profession.

         Although our main results indicate that some dentists changed geographic location by

moving to a neighboring market, the effect on neighbors is smaller in magnitude than the own-

county effect, suggesting that some dentists responded to fluoridation by leaving the profession

or retraining as specialists. We probe this using data from the Area Resource File, which

contains details on the composition of dentists. We find that the proportion of general

practitioners – dentists most affected by fluoridation – declined relative to specialists after

fluoridation, supporting the idea that general practitioners were more likely to leave the market

or retrain in dental specialties where demand did not fall. Although not statistically significant,

we also find that the exit was concentrated among younger dentists, a notion consistent with

retraining in response to technological change since younger workers have a longer time horizon

to reap its benefits (Bartel and Sicherman, 1993). While not definitive, this evidence supports

the hypothesis that the widespread adoption of water fluoridation is partially responsible for the

recent growth in dental specialties: the significant reduction in tooth decay led to a fundamental

shift in the demand for dentists, which forced dentists to retrain in other areas of dentistry where

sufficient demand exists. 7

         In addition to understanding the equilibrium effects of a public good, we also relate our

findings to two additional areas. First, these results relate to the literature on industry structure

7
  This finding also potentially relates to supplier-induced demand: the retraining of out of work dentists increased
the supply of specialists, which may have increased the demand for specialty services beyond what patients may
have demanded themselves.

                                                                                                                      .


dynamics. Numerous papers have investigated the flows of employment across firms and sectors

over time, comparing the changes in the average size and number of firms in response to demand

or cost shocks. Most of the literature relates to the manufacturing industry, where substantial

evidence indicates that changes at surviving producers (such as plant expansions and

contractions) dominate changes in the number of plants or firms. 8 In contrast, evidence on the

retail industry finds that the number of stores generally responds more than the average size of

each store (Campbell and Lapham, 2004). Our results shed some light on dynamics in the

service industry, a sector that has experienced considerable change in recent years but has not

been considered in detail by this literature. We find that dentists behave similarly to

manufacturers, rather than retailers, in their response to aggregate shifts in demand. These

results will assist in evaluating policies that attempt to either move employment from declining

to growing industries or encourage new firm creation.

        Second, our results provide evidence that dentists respond to economic incentives.

Numerous models of firm entry and exit in the industrial organization literature predict that firms

should enter markets that, all else equal, have small numbers of competitors and high demand for

their services, and exit markets where the opposite is true. 9 Whether these predictions hold true

in health care markets is unclear both because of inefficiencies, such as those caused by moral

hazard, adverse selection, insurance distortions, and physician-induced demand, and because

employees in health fields may maximize something other than a simple profit function

(Lakdawala and Philipson, 1998; Newhouse, 1970). A number of previous papers generally find

  See Dunne, Roberts and Samuelson (1989a, 1989b) and Armington and Odle (1982) for evidence of job creation
and destruction for U.S. manufacturers. Other relevant papers in this literature include Campbell and Hubbard
(2008) which considers the impact of the construction of the Interstate Highway System in the U.S. on the supply of
highway service stations. Theoretical papers such as Hopenhayn (1992) and Fishman and Rob (2003) develop
models of firm size, entry and exit that are motivated by observations of frequent entry and exit in many U.S.
industries.

evidence of rational responses to incentives, but typically focus on the intensive margin, such as

responses to changes in prices (Cutler, 1990, 1995; Dafny, 2005) and contracts (Rebitzer and

Taylor, 2004). Our paper instead considers the extensive margin, analyzing dentists’ responses

to changes in demand in terms of market entry and exit. This addresses mounting policy

concerns regarding shortages in supply of health care professionals that are expected to worsen

as baby boomers continue to age and place an increased demand on the health care system

(Buerhaus, Staiger, and Auerbach, 2009; Iglehart, 2008).

2. Data

2.a. Data on CWF

        The 1992 Water Fluoridation Census compiled by the CDC contains detailed information

on the fluoridation status of every public water system in the United States. Each state provided

information to the CDC for each water system within the state, including the date fluoridation

began, whether the fluoride was naturally occurring or chemically adjusted, the county served,

and the population served by the water system within the county as of 1990. 10

        To derive a panel of fluoridation rates at the county level, we first compute the percent of

each county in the U.S. with access to fluoridated water. To do this, we merge the Fluoridation

Census data with total population estimates of each county from the 1990 Census of Population

and Housing to compute the percent of the county with fluoridated water in 1990. To determine

county fluoridation rates for prior years, absent any alternative data source we must assume the

percent of the population served by each water system is constant over time. Using the date

fluoridation began, we then assign this same percent fluoridated to the county for all years after

fluoridation began and zero to all years prior to fluoridation. If there are multiple fluoridating


10
 If the water system served multiple counties, information for each county served was separately recorded.
Multiple water systems within a county were also separately reported.

                                                                                                       .


water districts within a county, as is often the case, we average the percent fluoridated using the

population served by each district as weights. This leaves us with a county-year panel of

fluoridation rates.

           To clarify this measure, consider a county with only one water district that fluoridates,

which began doing so in 1980. As of 1990, this water district served 1000 people within the

county and the total population of the county was 5000, suggesting a fluoridation rate of 0.2

(=1000/5000) in 1990. We assign a fluoridation rate of 0.2 to all years from 1980-1990 and

assign a fluoridation rate of 0 for years prior to 1980.

2.b. County Business Patterns

           We measure the supply of dentists in each county over time using data from the county

business patterns (CBP), maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau. It is an annual series that

contains counts of the total number of establishments and total number of employees (as of mid-

March) as well as first-quarter total payroll for each industry at the county level.11 Variables are

derived from the Economic Censuses, Annual Survey of Manufacturers, and Internal Revenue

Service. The industry is identified using the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), which

provides separate categories for “offices and clinics of dentists” (802) and “offices and clinics of

medical doctors” (801). We use the latter as control group. These categories include all

individuals employed within the establishment, so “offices and clinics of dentists” includes

dentists, hygienists, and receptionists. While there is no missing data on establishment numbers,

the total number of employees and payroll are missing for roughly 30 percent of observations.

Whenever this arises, however, a categorical breakdown of the number of employees is

available. For example, in a county where we know how many establishments there are but not



11
     We adjust payroll data by the consumer price index.


                                                           7
                                                                                                                   .


the number of employees, we do know how many establishments have 1-4 employees. 12 We use

these categories along with three lags and leads of employment to impute missing values to

preserve sample size. We do not impute payroll since there are no categorical counterparts. We

use data from the years 1974-1992 since CBP data prior to 1974 are often missing and 1992 is

the last year for which we have fluoridation rates.

2.c. Other Data Sources

        We use the Bureau of Health Professions Area Resource File (ARF), maintained by the

Health Resources and Services Administration within the United States Department of Health

and Human Services, as a source of data on changes within the dental industry. The ARF is a

county-based data file summarizing secondary data from a wide variety of sources. In focusing

on dentists, we use variables summarized from the American Dental Association “Distribution of

Dentists in the U.S.” report, which is census of all dentists in the U.S., available in 1981 and

1987 at the county level. Relevant variables for our analysis include the total number of

practicing dentists, the number of dentists in general practice and pediatric dentistry versus a

specialty, the number of dentists practicing full- versus part-time, the age distribution of dentists

(in five year intervals), and the number of dentists employed in public agencies or private

practice.

        We add a number of county level variables to our regressions to account for other

changes over time that may be correlated with fluoridation status and affect the number of

dentists. To account for potential shifts in dental supply because of changes in local labor

market composition, we use the County Business Patterns data on the percent of workforce



12
  The categorical breakdown report the number of employees in each of the following categories: 1-4, 5-9, 10-19,
20-49, 50-99, 100-249, 250-499, 500-999, and 1000+. 94.6% had less than 10 employees and 99.5% had less than
20.

employed in each of the major SIC categories. 13 To account for possible changes in the demand

for dental services due to income shocks or changes in local public expenditures that may be

correlated with CWF changes, we also include county level data from the 1974-1992 Bureau of

Economic Analysis (BEA) Regional Economic Information System. Finally we account for

possible shifts in the demand for dental care due to population changes by including population

data taken from the U.S. Census Bureau. 14

         In addition to the county-year panel, we also utilize cross-sectional data from the CDC’s

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for 1999, the first year when all relevant

data were collected. This is used in a separate analysis to investigate the relationship between

community water fluoridation and the frequency of preventative dental visits; see below for

details. The BRFSS is an annual survey designed to elicit prevalence of major behavioral risks

among adults. It contains data on the last time each individual had their teeth cleaned by a

dentist or dental hygienist, with the following categorical responses: within the past year (72.8

percent of respondents), 1 to 2 years ago (11.8 percent), 2 to 5 years ago (7.5 percent), and 5 or

more years ago (8.0 percent). It also includes county of residence, which we use to merge with

CWF data and with data from the 2000 City and County Data Books to account for possible

confounding factors, including population density, median age, percent race/ethnicity

breakdown, persons per household, death rate, infant mortality rate, percent HS grads, percents

college grades, median HH income, percent poverty, unemployment rate, and the social security

collection rate.

        Table 1 shows time trends in our key variables for counties included in the final sample

used in our analysis. Our final sample covers over 96 percent of all US counties and over 97

percent of the US population, with less than 100 percent coverage largely due to missing data

from the fluoridation census for Arkansas, which contains 2 percent of all counties and 1 percent

of the population. Several features are worth highlighting. One, the number of dental

establishments did not increase considerably over time, with roughly one establishment per 3,900

people in 1974 and one per 3,100 in 1992. The number of employees, however, nearly doubled

over time from 1 employee per 1,250 people in 1974 to 1 per 570 in 1992, and payroll tripled

(inflation adjusted). This suggests that while this industry has grown over time, it has also

experienced important changes in market structure over time. Third, growth rates of physicians

followed comparable patterns to dentists, suggesting the plausibility of using physicians as a

control group. Finally, the change in fluoridation rates over time is fairly small, going from 45%

of the population with access to CWF in 1974 to 53% in 1992 (current rates are around 67%).

However, we shall see that this had a substantial effect on the number of dentists.

2. Econometric model

3.a. Main model

        To infer the impact of CWF, we use a difference in difference strategy that compares how

the number of dentists responds to changes in the fluoridation rate relative to physicians within

counties over time. We account for the possibility that counties that fluoridated earlier or to

differing degrees differed from those that fluoridated later, for example, due to concurrent

expansions in other public health programs, by using physicians as a control group. 15 We reason

that these expansions are likely to affect the supply of all health professionals, including

15
  Note that this differs from the assumption of Glied and Neidell (2009), who argue fluoridation decisions were
exogenous. This difference is due to our focus on a later time period (they focused on 1957-64) and different
outcome (they focused on earnings).

physicians as well as dentists. Our key assumption is that, absent CWF, the trends in physician

and dentist supply would have been identical. Importantly, however, the demand for physicians

is not affected by water fluoridation.

         We estimate the following econometric model:

(1) Yctd = β1*dentd + β2*CWFct + β3*dentd*CWFct + δ1*Xit + δ1*dentd*Xit + ηt + dentd*ηt + αc +

εct

where the subscript c is the county, t is the year, and d is the profession (dentist or physician). Y

is a measure of supply, described in more detail below. The variable dentd is an indicator for

whether Y corresponds to dentists or physicians. CWFct is the contemporaneous measure of

water fluoridation in the county, which ranges from 0 to 1. dentd*CWFct is the key parameter of

interest: it measures the differential impact of CWF on dentists relative to physicians. Xit are a

large set of time-varying county level covariates that may affect dentists or physicians, and

dentd*Xit allows these covariates to have a differential impact on dentists. 16 ηt is a year fixed

effect to absorb annual trends common across all counties, and is also interacted with dentd to

allow for separate annual trends for dentists. αc is a county fixed effect to absorb all time-

invariant characteristics of the county.

         We begin by examining the net impact of CWF on supply and payroll, defining the

dependent variables as the number of establishments, number of employees, and quarterly

payroll (in $1 million), with all three reported in per 1000 capita. To explore industry dynamics,

  The covariates included in Xit are the percent of workforce employed in each of the major SIC categories, the total
population and the percent of population within each of five age categories (0-19, 20-39, 40-59, 60-79, and 80 and

we also examine the impact of CWF on employees per establishment, payroll per establishment,

and payroll per employee.

3.b. Accounting for neighboring CWF

        As previously mentioned, the industrial organization literature on firm entry and exit

leads us to expect neighboring counties’ CWF to have a positive impact on own-county dentist

supply. We therefore also extend this model by including neighboring county fluoridation status.

(2) Ycc’td = β1*dentd + β2*CWFct + β3*dentd*CWFct + β4*CWFc’t + β5*dent*CWFc’t

+ δ1*Xit + δ1*dentd*Xit + ηt + dentd*ηt + αc + εct

where c’ is the neighboring county.

        Rather than limit neighboring counties to those that share a border, we define a

neighboring county as one whose population weighted centroid is within a certain distance from

the population weighted centroid of the reference county. This allows for a more realistic setting

whereby dentists care about the physical distance between possible locations rather than whether

they share a political border. Such a distinction may arise in urban areas where counties have

small land areas, and much of our analysis focus on urban areas because of the returns to scale in

providing CWF. For this analysis we focus on counties that have a neighboring county within 40

miles, though results are generally insensitive to this choice.

        Since each county varies in the number of neighbors, we use two different measures of

neighbor fluoridation status: first we use CWF of closest neighbor and second we separately

include the CWF of all neighbors. 17 We estimate these models using the same dependent

variables as in section 3.a.

3.c. Changes within the industry

17
  Note that including data on all neighbors increases our sample size by the average number of neighboring
counties, so we cluster by the reference county to account for this larger sample size. We also estimated models
using the average CWF of neighbors and found very similar results.


                                                        12
                                                                                                     .


       To further explore changes within the dental industry, we use the ARF data on dentists by

specialty. We estimate a variant of equation (1), focusing on dentists only:

(3) Yct = β*CWFct + δ*Xit + ηt + αc + αc*t + εct

We include only dentists in this equation, rather than considering their response compared to

physicians, for two reasons. First we wish to explore changes in the composition of the dentist

category, rather than analyzing changes in levels. Second, the variables we consider do not have

identical meanings for physicians.

       We specify the dependent variable as the rate of dentists who are: 1) in general practice

or pediatric dentistry; 2) full-time; 3) age < 44; and 4) in private practice. Our rationale for

focusing on these four outcomes is the following. Since tooth decay is a topic of concern to

general practitioners, CWF should reduce the number of dentists in general practice relative to

those in specialty areas, either by shifting general practitioners into specialties or by moving

them out of the profession entirely. Some of the losses in employment in the dental industry may

be observed as shifts from full-time to part-time employment rather than as market exit.

Younger dentists may be more willing to leave the market and retrain themselves since they have

a longer time horizon to earn profits from entering a new market. For these three outcomes, we

expect to estimate a negative coefficient on CWF. Last, we focus on dentists in private practice

as a specification check for our model. If areas that fluoridated also increased spending on

additional programs to improve oral health, this could have decreased the demand for dentists

relative to physicians and therefore confounded our identification strategy. In that case we might

expect to see an increase in the number of dentists practicing at public agencies (which were




                                                 13

bolstered by the local areas’ increased spending). We therefore hope for a negative or

insignificant coefficient in this regression. 18

4. Results

         Table 2 presents our main results. We find strong evidence of a decrease in dental supply

in response to the adoption of community water fluoridation. Column (1) shows that adopting

CWF is associated with a statistically significant decrease of .026 dental establishments per 1000

people. Given the baseline of roughly 0.3 establishments per 1000 people, this implies a 9%

reduction for a change from 0 to 100% of the population with access to fluoridated water, or a

0.7 percent reduction for the 8 percentage point change in fluoridation we observe in our sample.

Column (2) shows a statistically significant drop of 0.5 employees per 1000 people, which

corresponds to a 37 percent decrease going from 0 to 100% fluoridation or 3 percent decrease for

the 8 percentage point change in fluoridation rates in our sample. This suggests a much higher

impact on employees per establishment than on establishments 19 . The impact of CWF on

quarterly payroll is also statistically significant, though the impact of a less than 1 percent

decrease is much smaller than the loss in employment. Overall, these results suggest statistically

significant declines in the supply of dentists.

         In the second panel of Table 2 we explore the robustness of our results by allowing for

county specific linear time trends. 20 If areas that fluoridate experience other trends specific to

that county this may bias our baseline results and lead this robustness test to have different

results from the main analysis. However, we find that adding these county time trends has

virtually no impact on our results.


18
   Since our dependent variable is a rate, we weight these regressions by the numerator since counties with a larger
number of dentists provide more precise estimates of the rate.
19
   There are approximately 4.5 employees per establishment.
   This amounts to adding αc*t to equation 1.


                                                         14
                                                                                                       .


       In Table 3 we explore the impacts of CWF on industry dynamics in more detail by

examining rate of employees per establishment. Consistent with a larger impact on employees,

we find a statistically significant, negative coefficient on CWF using employees per

establishment as the dependent variable. The coefficient of -1.23 suggests a nearly 25 percent

decline in the size of remaining establishments. We also find statistically significant decreases in

payroll per establishment or employee, suggesting that in addition to firms and employees

leaving average wage rates fell.

       In Table 4, we include information on neighboring counties’ fluoridation status. As

expected we find that fluoridation in neighboring counties has a positive effect on own-county

dental supply, suggesting dentists relocate to nearby markets where fluoridation rates are lower.

These estimates are insensitive to whether we measure neighbor CWF using all neighbors within

40 miles (panel A) or the physically closest neighbor (panel B). The results from this Table also

provide two additional robustness checks of our model. First, the coefficients on own CWF

remains largely unchanged, suggesting that spatial patterns in CWF rates are not an important

confounder in our analysis. Second, the coefficient on neighboring county CWF is smaller than

the coefficient on own, as we would expect given that dentists can relocate to other counties or

leave the industry entirely. These findings lend support to the validity of our model.

       In Table 5, we present results that further probe changes within the industry by

examining the composition of dentists using data from the ARF. In column (1), we find a

statistically significant decrease in the proportion of dentists who are general practitioners. This

supports the hypothesis that, since general practitioners are more likely than specialists to see a

decrease in demand because of fluoridation, they are more likely to exit the market. Although

not statistically significant, column (2) shows a decrease in the proportion of full-time




                                                 15
                                                                                                         .


employees, evidence consistent with a shift towards more part-time employment. We also see a

decrease in the proportion of dentists who are aged under 44, consistent with younger workers

having more time to earn from their retraining, but this too is not statistically significant. Lastly,

we find that CWF does not have a statistically significant association with the rate of dentists

employed in private practice, with a t-statistic less than 0.2. This specification check provides

some reassurance that local governments that fluoridated did not provide additional investments

that might have decreased demand for (and thus supply of) of dentists during our panel by

increasing the number of dentists at public agencies.

4.b. Compensatory behavior

        We conduct one further analysis to investigate possible welfare effects of CWF. While

the supply response to water fluoridation suggests that fluoride exposure leads to improved

dental health, there is one potential caveat to this interpretation of our results. If, as our results

indicate, dentists responded to the reduction in demand for their services by moving away from

the area, consumers may have found it more difficult to access dental care. As a result, some

aspects of dental health not impacted by fluoride, particularly periodontal health, may have

suffered.

        We test this hypothesis using the BRFSS data. We reason that, if the above story is

correct, we should observe a negative relationship between water fluoridation and periodontal

care. In fact we find, if anything, the opposite correlation. We estimate models using two

different dependent variables. First, we estimate a linear probability model for whether an

individual had a cleaning in the past year, focusing on this category because the American Dental

Association recommends dental cleanings twice a year. Second, we estimate an interval

regression model to exploit the full range of categorical responses; we interpret this estimate as




                                                   16
                                                                                                      .


the amount of time between dental cleanings. We include several demographic variables to

account for individuals’ socio-economic status and ability to afford care: race, education, marital

status, number of children, employment status and health insurance status. To account for an

individual’s initial health status and propensity to consume preventative care, we include body

mass index, diabetes status, mental health status, smoking status, and having blood pressure tests

and routine physician checkups. We also include the county level variables from the 2000 City

and County Data Books listed in Section 2e.

       As shown in Table 6, fluoridation status is associated with a statistically insignificant 1

percentage point increase in having a dental cleaning within the past year, from a baseline rate of

72%. The results of interval regressions indicate that fluoridation status is associated with

having a cleaning approximately 12 days sooner than if not fluoridated, though it is also

statistically insignificant. The results are insensitive to sequentially adding the demographic and

health behavior variables. Given that our results are already insensitive to numerous controls, it

is difficult to believe that including more confounding variables would make the coefficients

switch sign. This evidence therefore indicates that consumer demand for dental services, at least

on average, probably did not fall by more than the amount justified by water fluoridation.

5. Discussion and Conclusion

       Although fluoridation of community drinking water is a relatively simple government

program, in this paper we demonstrate substantial effects from this public good on the dental

industry. After the introduction of fluoridation to a local community, the number of dental

establishments and employees per establishment both fell significantly, with the latter falling

faster than the former. We also find that the number of own-county dentists increased with

neighboring fluoridation rates and that general practice dentists were more likely to leave the




                                                17
                                                                                                                   .


profession compared to specialists. The most likely interpretation of our results is that the public

provision of fluoridated water was effective in reducing demand for private substitutes, such as

dental services, and that supply responded to this negative demand shock. Our estimates suggest

the advent of water fluoridation significantly transformed the dental industry.

        Despite widespread support for water fluoridation by leading medical and public health

authorities, controversy surrounds water fluoridation, with disputes often centering on the

apparent benefits to oral health. The seminal fluoridation experiments conducted in Newburgh-

Kingston, NY, Grand Rapids-Muskegon, MI, Evanston-Oak Park, IL, and Brantford-Sarnia,

Ontario, Canada in the 1940s and 50s found fluoridation dramatically lowered the incidence of

dental caries by roughly 50-70 percent (Burt and Eklund, 1999), but more recent evidence

suggests the impact may be much smaller (Brunelle and Carlos, 1990; Newbrun, 1989) or non-

existent (Diesendorf, 1986; Yiamouyiannis, 1990). Without benefits from fluoride exposure,

however, dentists would have had little reason to move away from fluoridated areas towards

those not yet fluoridated. 21 The reduction in the number of dentists is therefore likely to have

been a response to actual changes in demand, suggesting community water fluoridation led to a

significant improvement in oral health. These improvements in oral health combined with

reduced expenditures on dental services no longer necessary suggests community water

fluoridation likely had a large, positive effect on social welfare.




21
  This is particularly clear given that consumers were often uninformed about whether fluoride had been added to
their water supply; disclosure of fluoride content was not made mandatory until the 1996 amendment to the Safe
Drinking Water Act.
