                                             ABSTRACT

Prior researchers have deployed the Vietnam-era draft lottery as an instrument to estimate causal effects
of military service on health and income. This research has shown that effects of veteran status on
mortality and earnings that appeared shortly after the war seem to have dissipated by 2000. While
these are important outcomes to economists, by focusing on them, researchers may be neglecting an
area of life that could be more sensitive to the psychological effects of military service: household
and family life. In the present study we use the same IV approach to model the causal impact of Vietnam-
era military service on four novel outcomes: residential stability, marital stability, housing tenure and
extended family living arrangements. In analysis of the 2000 U.S. Census and the 2005 American
Community Survey, we find that veteran status has no effect on housing tenure or residential stability.
However, in the ACS sample, being a veteran appears to lower the likelihood of marital disruption,
and results for extended family living arrangements appear to change signs across the two samples.
 Meanwhile, results tend to be strongest for whites.

Introduction

       Research into the impact of military service on important health and socio-

economic outcomes has yielded evidence to suggest that veterans differ significantly

from their non-veteran peers. Though much of the work on veterans has concentrated on

generations of male veterans from the World War II and Korean War eras, nearly all

veteran studies, regardless of war-time period, have been plagued by the problem of

persistent selection bias. Since entry into the military is typically far from random, the

men represented in the ranks of the armed forces may not be representative of the male

population as a whole, making identification of a treatment effect of military service

difficult at best. Specifically, unobserved differences between veterans and non-veterans,

which are lumped into the error term, may influence substantive outcomes directly

(educational attainment, mortality, marital stability and so on) and may therefore

contaminate efforts to estimate a treatment effect of military service or even an intent-to-

treat effect of exposure to conscription.

       In the present study, however, we exploit a natural experiment to estimate the

effects of Vietnam-era military service on long-term family and household outcomes.

Between December 1969 and February 1972, the United States Selective Service held

four Vietnam draft lotteries. Each of these draft lotteries randomly assigned men in

eligible birth cohorts order of induction numbers through a hand drawing of three

hundred sixty five birthdates (and 366 for the leap-year lottery for the 1950 birth cohort).

The draft lottery provides a unique opportunity to utilize the lottery’s random assignment

method as a ‘natural experiment’ using instrumental variable (IV) estimation. Building

on previous work by Angrist (1990) and Angrist and Chen (2008) in this vein, we use




                                                                                             3
data from the 2000 US Decennial Census and the 2005 American Community Survey to

produce estimates of the average treatment effect of military service on important family

and residential outcomes in the Vietnam-era military service cohort through an

instrumental variable estimation. While economists have pursued this same approach to

estimate military service effects on earnings (Angrist 1991; Angrist and Chen 2008),

disability status (Angrist and Chen 2008), and mortality (Hearst et al. 1986; Angrist and

Chen 2008; Conley and Heerwig 2011), they have neglected family and household

outcomes such at those we model here. This is an important lacuna since it is reasonable

to suspect that family live and household structure may be more sensitive to the

psychological effects of military service than the typical outcomes that have been studied

thus far. With this in mind we use a 2SLS estimation approach to model the impact of

veteran status on marital stability (likelihood of ever having divorced or separated,

conditional on marriage); household complexity (extended kin co-residence); housing

tenure (owning versus renting); and residential stability (likelihood of having moved in

previous five years).

       Previous empirical research on Vietnam veterans has most commonly dealt with

differences in income between the service and non-service populations. These studies

have emphasized the uniqueness of the Vietnam-era social and political climate in its

consequences for veterans. Some have suggested that, in fact, Vietnam service acted as a

negative screening device in the labor market as Americans reacted to an

incredibly unpopular war and common conceptions about drug-use among soldiers

(Angrist, 1991; Ruger, Wilson & Waddoups, 2002; Schwartz, 1986). So, while World

War II and Korean War veterans were shown to have slight educational and labor market




                                                                                            4
advantages vis-à-vis their non-veteran counterparts (Angrist & Krueger, 1994; Settersten,

2006; Schwartz, 1986), Vietnam veterans have lagged behind their non-veteran peers.

The size of the effect of Vietnam military service on income has varied considerably

among the studies—the differences largely dependent on the method used for

identification. Teachman (2004), for instance, concludes that there are significant income

losses for Vietnam veterans of 2.6% using a fixed effects framework. Similarly, Angrist

(1990) employs an instrumental variable (IV) regression using the draft lottery instrument

and finds significant earnings losses for the 1950-1952 birth cohorts for years 1969-1984

among white veterans (although not for nonwhite veterans). A follow-up to Angrist

(1990) by Angrist and Chen (2008) shows that, by the time of the Decennial Census, the

“adverse consequences of Vietnam-era military service appear to have faded” (25).

       While studying the impact of military service on income is important, Conley

(2001a) shows that wealth—specifically in the form of housing wealth, which makes up a

majority of family equity for the mode of households in the United States—may be a

crucial “material mechanism by which socio-economic and racial advantage is

transmitted from one generation to the next.” (264). For example, Conley (1999) shows

that after parental education, parental wealth level during childhood is the best predictor

of college enrollment and completion. Conley (2001b) also shows that wealth has an

analytically distinct effect on educational outcomes beyond the impact of income alone.

Thus, concentrating on income offers us only a partial picture of the possible material

disparities generated by military service. To date, there is only one study that tackles the

impact of military service on wealth accumulation. Fitzgerald (2006) uses data from the

Health and Retirement Study to estimate the impact of military service on wealth




                                                                                              5
accumulation and finds that, for Korea and Vietnam veterans, there is a substantial

penalty for each additional year of service on total net worth and on non-housing net

worth. Due to data limitations, however, Fitzgerald’s study is vulnerable to selection bias

and may be overestimating the military service effect.

        These are important outcomes of study both in their own right and because of

their potential association with socio-economic or health outcomes both for the veterans

themselves and their family members (particularly offspring). For example, recent

research in urban sociology highlights the possible impact of increased residential

mobility at both the individual- and community-level. Klinenberg (2003) documents how

the large-scale out-migration of family members left senior African Americans (primarily

men) in Chicago’s inner-city vulnerable to heat-related mortality during the 1995 heat

wave. Sampson (1988; 1991) finds that residential stability significantly increases one’s

total number of friends / acquaintances, participation in social activities, and

subsequently, one’s integration into the surrounding community, which may provide

support in times of need. Yet, little work has been done on the migration pattern of

Vietnam veterans. Cowper and Longino suggest that “veterans as a whole are more

mobile and move longer distances than the general population of the same age” (1992, p.

44), but do not provide information on the Vietnam veteran cohort in particular. Given

the strong relationship between residential stability and integration into one’s community,

we might expect increased migration among veterans to negatively influence quality of

life through social isolation.

        One might also expect that the stresses of military service have a negative impact

on the duration and health of intimate relationships. However, Ruger et al. (2002) found




                                                                                            6
that World War II veterans did not have higher marital dissolutions rates than their non-

veteran peers. At the same time, researchers have also shown that the effect of military

service on marital dissolution likely varies with period of service. For example, Ruger et

al. (ibid) showed that, when comparing martial stability for World War II veterans with

veterans of the Korean War, the differences were striking. Korean War veterans had

“more than twice the dissolution rate of the WWII veterans” (98). The exact reasons for

the divergence in dissolution rates between veterans of different conflicts are unclear.

The researchers put forth the “social interaction hypothesis”—the idea that “a social

milieu” that “a soldier comes home to.…may affect the durability of his marriage” (90).

If this does indeed turn out to be the explanation for the increased dissolution rates

among Korean veterans, we would certainly expect that marital dissolution rates among

Vietnam veterans to be high given the social climate to which these soldiers returned and

possible ongoing social stigma they may have experienced throughout their lives.

       In addition to modeling these new outcomes, we will also seek to discover

whether these effects vary by race (c.f. Phillips et al. 1992). There are adequate reasons to

think that for non-whites any negative effects of draft exposure may be mitigated or even

reversed. Angrist (1991), for example, uses the same draft lottery strategy we pursue

here and finds that there is no earnings penalty for non-white veterans in contrast to the

15 percent loss in lifetime earnings for white veterans of the Vietnam era. Likewise, with

respect to health and mortality, London and Wilmoth (2006) use a nationally

representative longitudinal dataset and find that African Americans without military

service were more likely to have died than comparable African Americans with no

military service over a ten-year period. Further, a military service premium for black men




                                                                                             7
does not appear to be limited to earnings and mortality outcomes. Sampson and Laub

(1996) find that recruits from economically disadvantaged backgrounds (where blacks are

overrepresented) benefit from overseas military service on later life indicators of socio-

economic status. Lundquist (2008) finds that attitudinal measures of job satisfaction also

reflect the perceived benefits of military life for minority groups. Black men and women

as well as Latinos and Latinas consistently rank themselves higher on self-reported

measures of quality of life and job satisfaction than do white males. However, other

research has documented that black veterans are more positively selected vis-à-vis their

non-veteran counterparts than are white veterans (Lundquist 2006) raising the possibility

that selection may be driving these results (though not Angrist’s). Evading this concern,

Brown (2006) examines the racial test score gap among the offspring of military

personnel and finds that among those who are educated on base in military schools, racial

disparities are significantly smaller than in military offspring sent to local civilian

schools, lending support to the notion that the mitigation of racial inequalities in the

military is not merely a consequence of differential selection into the armed forces. The

current study will further our understanding of whether military service has differential—

and perhaps inequality reducing—effects on blacks and whites net of selection into the

military. (Death rates during the war itself were similar for blacks and whites, mitigating

any concerns of differential wartime survival gradients [Rohlfs 2007].)

       Taken together, the proposed analyses provide a comprehensive study of the

effects—16 to 32 years post-War—of the draft lottery on family and household

processes. Understanding the long-term, later-life outcomes that result from military

service (and/or exposure to risk of conscription) in a time of war is key to designing




                                                                                             8
effective public health and social service interventions for this potentially vulnerable

population. Conversely, if the treatment reduces risks for some populations (such as

blacks) then the military deserves to be further investigated as a model for improving the

family conditions of certain civilian groups such as African Americans.

Methods

       Since for the 1969 draft lottery it has been demonstrated that the lottery was not

entirely random due to incomplete mixing of the balls that had been pre-sorted by birth

month (Feinberg 1971), we run a 2SLS model in which we control for a vector (X) that

includes indicator variables for month (and year) of birth. The first-stage regression (a

linear probability model) of this 2SLS approach is thus:

       veteranstat* = β0 + β1draftstatus + β2X + ε1                            (1)

Where veteranstat* is coded “1” for having served in the military and “0” otherwise and

where “draft status” is coded “1” for draft eligible males and “0” for draft ineligible men.

Next, we estimate the following second stage regression (2). Both stages deploy a linear

probability model (as does our “naïve” OLS approach for comparison) even though the

distribution is not normal for most of our outcomes; Heckman and Macurdy (1985) argue

that this is the ideal specification when faced with a set of simultaneous equations where

the instrument, the endogenous regressor, and the dependent measure are dichotomous:

       y = γ0 + γ 1veteranstat* + γ 2X + u1                                    (2)

where “veteranstat*” contains the predicted values generated by the first-stage regression,

X is our vector of month and year of birth dummies, and y is some outcome of interest. In

this regression, the coefficient on “veteranstat*” will yield the true or pure effect of

veteran status on our outcome, if the assumptions we have detailed earlier hold (along




                                                                                             9
with other standard assumptions of IV regression such as monotonicity and SUTVA).

Other than month of birth, we do not need to include another vector of control variables,

because our assumption is that draft status will be truly random and thus orthogonal to

standard socio-demographic variables (at the time of lottery), which we exclude due to

concerns of endogeneity. That is, any variation in, say, education or earnings related to

our instrument would likely be resulting from the treatment. Thus, we present a reduced

form equation that will not shed light on the extent to which these behavioral responses

are moderating or mediating our estimate of veteran status. However, they will be

interesting in their own right as a summative measure of the effect of exposure to draft

risk on the outcomes (as opposed to military service per se).

       The 2000 Decennial Census and American Community Survey 2005 enable us to

estimate the impact of military service via the draft on a variety of outcomes for the non-

institutionalized population. Both datasets include information on a respondent’s date of

birth and veteran status. Using the birth date information, we will first code all men in our

dataset with draft lottery numbers. Next, we will code all men either draft eligible or

ineligible based on the highest lottery number called to service for that particular draft

year. The 1953 birth cohort provides a counter-factual to detect the impact of other

behavioral mechanisms (short of conscription) on our outcomes of interest; these include

voluntary enlistment in the face of likely conscription as well as mechanisms to evade

conscription such as through medical decertification, flight from the United States, failure

to report for induction, conscientious objector status, to name a few.

Results




                                                                                             10
       For each set of outcomes detailed below, the final analyses included two-stage

least squares estimates of military service (i.e. causal estimates of military service using

the Vietnam-draft lottery as the instrumental variable) and ordinary least squares

estimates (i.e. naïve estimates). We also analyzed each outcome by race category.

       Marital Stability: We estimated the effect of military service on the probability of

divorce conditional on having been married (a comparison of currently married versus

divorced or separated). (We also modeled probability of ever marrying; these results

were not significant and are not shown.) We begin by describing our “naive” estimates

given by our OLS models and then proceed to discuss the causal estimates derived from

the IV regressions. For our first outcome (everdivorced), we estimate the effect of

military service on the probability of divorce conditional on having been married. This

outcome compares those who are currently divorced with the married and separated

samples, while those who have never been married or are widowed are excluded. In our

OLS models, the effect of veteran status has a strong and significant effect on the

probability of divorcing across all race categories. In particular, we find that veteran

status increases the probability of divorcing by as much as 3% for the full sample. The

same holds true for a slight variant of our first marital stability outcome (everseparated),

which includes those who have separated in the “divorced” category. The pattern appears

in both the Census and ACS samples, although the results for blacks and others in the

ACS sample are not significant, likely due to the smaller sample size.

       In our instrumental variable models the effect of veteran status disappears in the

Census sample. More interestingly, the IV results from the 2005 ACS actually suggest

that military service reduces the probability of divorce, with the effect concentrated




                                                                                           11
among white veterans. Again, since these estimates use random assignment through the

draft lottery, the effect is closer to a true causal effect of service on marital stability. It

should also be noted that, while not significant, the results do also suggest that the

direction of the effect is opposite for blacks. In other words, military service appears to

increase the probability of divorce for this population.

        Residential Stability: We estimated the effect of military service on the

probability of having moved at all in the past five years (both local and long-distance

moves). Although we had hypothesized that veterans may have significantly different

migration patterns than the non-service population, our preliminary analyses indicate that,

in fact, veterans are not more mobile than their non-service peers (as indicated by the

move variable). For both samples, the OLS estimates indicate a significant positive effect

for the combined sample. However, this effect once again vanishes in our IV regression

models for the 2000 Census. For the 2005 ACS, our results mirror those for marital

stability. The effect changes sign and approaches significance for the total sample, with

the most pronounced effect being concentrated among whites. For other races, sample

sizes likely inhibit detection of an effect of military service on residential stability.

        Housing Tenure: A third analysis highlighted the potential effect of military

service on the probability of owning the primary residence home versus renting. Since

homeownership among the veteran population has been heavily subsidized by

government programs such as the VA-Home Loan Program, this outcome has direct

implications for the evaluation of existing policies. As such, we compare men who own

their homes outright or with a mortgage with those who rent or do not pay rent

(ownshome). (If we restrict the analysis to heads of households, results do not change.)




                                                                                                  12
For both the Census and the ACS, our OLS models indicate that veteran status reduces

the probability of owning one's home. These effects are, again, concentrated among white

veterans (where our sample sizes are largest). In the IV models, however, the effect of

military service diminishes and no longer reaches statistical significance for the race

categories combined or separately. Given the vast subsidies to homeownership granted to

veterans, it is instructive that our OLS models are negative—suggesting that the service

population is still less likely to own a home—while our IV models suggest no causal

effect. In either case, it appears that these subsidies have not worked to boost

homeownership rates for veterans above the non-service population, although it could be

that, without such subsidies, veterans might lag far behind.

       Extended Family Living: As another indicator of financial or family instability,

we also modeled several novel outcomes that would shed light on the living situations of

the Vietnam-era population as it ages. In particular, we modeled the probability of living

with a non-spouse relative (including a parent, child, uncle, aunt, and so on). In addition,

we also modeled the probability of having an adult child (over the age of twenty-two) in

the residence, for Vietnam eligible males who were also heads-of-household (thus the

smaller sample size for this analysis given the restriction to heads-of-household).

       These models yielded some of the most intriguing findings. For the extended

family living outcome (withfamily), our OLS results suggest that, for the total sample,

veteran status reduces the probability of living with a non-spouse family member. The

effect is the same, although smaller, in the IV models. The effect, once again, appears to

be concentrated among whites, although the direction of the effect is the same for blacks.




                                                                                          13
For others, however, the 2005 ACS results indicate that military service significantly

increases the probability of living in an extended family household.

       Similar patterns emerge for the adult child (kidhome) outcome. This measures

something different than extended family residence since it may capture intergenerational

effects on SES attainment. Failure to leave the parental home in young adulthood in a

culture like that in the U.S. is seen in life course research as an indicator of poor

education or labor market outcomes. While the OLS estimates for the 2000 Census

suggest that military service may increase the chances of having an adult child in the

household, the IV results show the opposite valence, suggesting a significant decrease in

this probability. For the Census models, this effect is once again concentrated among

whites, although the sign on the veteran status instrument is the same for blacks. In the

2005 ACS, we find further evidence that the effect of military service differs by race—

for “others”, we find that military service increases the probability of having an adult

child in the household quite significantly—by 36 percentage points.

Discussion

       Prior researchers have deployed the Vietnam-era draft lottery as an instrument to

estimate causal effects of military service on health and income. This research has shown

that effects of veteran status on mortality and earnings that appeared shortly after the war

seem to have dissipated by 2000. While these are important outcomes to economists, by

focusing on them, researchers may be neglecting an area of life that could be more

sensitive to the psychological effects of military service: household and family life. In

the present study we use the same IV approach to model the causal impact of Vietnam-

era military service on four novel outcomes: residential stability, marital stability,

housing tenure and extended family living arrangements. In analysis of the 2000 U.S.


                                                                                            14
Census and the 2005 American Community Survey, we find that veteran status has no

effect on housing tenure or residential stability. However, in the ACS sample, being a

veteran appears to lower the likelihood of marital disruption. And results for extended

family living arrangements appear to change signs across the two samples. Meanwhile,

results tend to be strongest for whites.

        While we did demonstrate that there appear to be some—if limited—long term

effects of Vietnam era military service, these are modest at best, in line with an emerging

picture of dissipating effects 25 years plus after the end of combat. The most pronounced

effect is the decreased likelihood for white veterans to move, divorce or separate in the

2005 ACS sample (though not in the 2000 Census). This suggests a potentially positive

effect of military conscription on family and residential stability for this group that may

or may not be mediated by education (or military service directly). Most puzzling is the

different results that we obtain for the two samples: Besides residential and marital

stability, the effect of extended kin residence is, in fact, opposite (and significantly so) in

each sample. In the 2000 Census, the effect is negative for both having an adult child

living at home as well as for living with other extended kin. However, in the 2005 ACS,

the IV results are positive for adult child living at home; and for “other race” the

coefficient is particularly strong (.36) for this outcome as well as for extended family co-

residence (.22). These differences across samples may be a result of different points in

the business cycle or may be due to random fluctuation or may represent the result of

aging populations. Future researchers should examine future ACS samples to determine

whether or not effects shown in 2005 are sampling artifacts or emerging trends.
