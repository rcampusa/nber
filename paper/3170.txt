     UNDERSTANDING STOCK PRICE BEHAVIOR AROUND THE TIME OF EQUITY ISSUES


                                    ABSTRACT
         It is well-documented that stock prices rise significantly prior to an

  equity issue, and fall upon announcement of the issue.    We expand on earlier

  studies by using a large sample which includes OTC firms, by examining the

  cross-sectional properties of the price rise, and by using accounting data to

  track the pattern of debt ratios and Tobin's q around the time of equity

   issues.   We consider a number of explanations for our results, and conclude

  that the data is largely consistent with informational models in which

  managers are asymmetrically informed about the value of the firm.

  Surprisingly, debt ratios do not increase prior to equity issues, suggesting

  that strained debt capacity is not the main reason for equity issues.    The

  behavior of Tobin's q is consistent with equity issues being used to finance

  new investments.
