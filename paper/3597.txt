          ALEXANDER HANILTON'S MARKET BASED DEBT REDUCTION PLAN


                                ABSTRACT


      In 1790, Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the

Treasury of the United States, initiated a program to refund the
U.S. debt.      Debt that had sold at 75% discount two years earlier

would be refunded at par into new funded debt of the new federal

government,      All foreign indebtedness would be repaid.    I present
evidence that Hamilton's actual refunding policy did not differ

in nature from that envisioned under the recent Brady plan.            I

will show that the bond package for which the old debt exchanged

had   a   market value well below par.     Thus, a large part of the
face value of the debt was effectively written of f.        I compare

the Hamilton restructuring package to the recent Mexican

restructuring package to find points of similarity to the Brady

plan.

       In    1790,    Alexander Hamilton, the             frost Secretary         of the

Treasury of the United States, initiated a program to refund the
U.S.    debt    incurred     by    the      Continental      Congress        during    the

Revolutionary         War   end   the       interregnum     of        the   Articles    of

Confederation. Debt that had sold at 75% discount two years earlier
would be refunded at par into new funded debt of the new federal

government.      All foreign indebtedness would be repaid.

       The episode is remarkaole for Hamilton's impassioned defence
of the principle of payment in full of all sovereign obligations,

even those of a predecessor State.               It rs     'Jet.   sure     remarkable in

comparison with the prescriptions by the current Secretary of the
Treasury for dealing with the sovereign deot problems of less

developed countries.         Under the Brady plan, part of the large bank

debt    of     such    countries    would      be   eliminated          with     voluntary

conversions into more senior claims with reduced par value or

coupon interest payments.           Thus,     Hamilton's absolute prescription

of full repayment of sovereign debt seems to                  hve       crumbled in more

pragmatic hands.
       Notwithstanding this oppearanue,             I will present evidence that

Hamilton's actual refunding policy did rot differ in nature from

that envisioned under the Brady plan.               After the initial refunding

package, of course, Hamilton's principles traditionally ruled U.S.
finance; and to emphasize that hardly any contingency could shake

the                    directive,       I   will present         an    example    of   debt
       repayment

 repayment during the War of 1812.              I will,    however, dwell mainly on
discussing the nature of the U.S. debt prior to the Funding Act of

August, 1790, and the means by which it was refunded.         I will show

that, though the old debt wss indeed exchanged at par for a package

of new securities, the package had a market value wall below par.

Thus, a large part of the face value of the debt was affectively
written off. I will then briefly compare the Hamilton restruc-
turing package to the recant Mexican restructuring package to find
points of similarity to the Brady plan.

1. The Situation in 1790 and Homilton's Argument for Repayment
     During the Revolutionary War and under the Articles of
Confederation, Congress lacked the power to tax to raise revenues.
It had to depend on revenue quotas imposed on the states, but it
had no enforcement power if a otaue did not meet its quote. Aside
from debt issue, its only other source of revenue was the sale of
lard. Ao a result, the Congress had hardly enough revenue to pay
the operating cost of a minimal government; and          it
                                                         could not
service the debt, amounting to 31% of national income, cumulated
during the war and its aftermath.'
         untenability of the financial situation of the national
        The
government provided one impetus for the Constitutional Convention
of 1787. The new government, armed with a tax authority, began its
operation in 1789. In 1790, the Congress imposed tariffs and
excise taxes sufficient to operate the government, to pay interest
gn some debt, and to provide for the establishment and funding of

        1   This   is the estimate of Barro (1987), p. 373.
a sinking fund intended ultlmately to eliminate any class of debt

defined as funded            debt.2      Wh     all these measures might be

expected        to   have had   a positive impact on the market value of the

outstanding          debt, there was no direct     provision for the servicing
of this unfunded debt.

      Nevertheless, Hamilton was adamant that the debt should be

repaid     because he     believed that it was vital to a nation's survival
to avoid a reputation for default.                As Washington's aide-de—camp

during the Revolutionary War, Hamilton had witnessed the near
dissolution of the army at crucial moments because lack of credit

prevented the acquisition of supplies.                    From this experience,

Hamilton learned that credit was a key weapon of war that,                  like

other weapons, had to be prepared in time of peace.3                  Throughout
his voluminous writings on the public debt, the fostering of credit

for war is the most important reason that he presents in arguing

for debt repayment.              For example,     in the Second Report on the

Public      Credit of     January, l79    ,   Hamilton   stated, "There can be no

time,      no   state of things, in       which   Credit is not essential   to   a
Nation,      especially as       long   as nations in general continue to use

it,   as    a resource in war.

p.125.
       This sentiment was echoed even in          newspapers   that opposed the
full repayment of the debt,           For example, commenting on Hamilton's

refunding       plan,   one   writer    states,    "The   consequences   of   a

depreciated credit have been too recently felt to need a very

particular description. War is a complicanion of calamities to the
best appointed nation: To one destitute of finences and credit, it

is almost certain ruin.       "

2, aLApAl,psLFinancial            Rectitude: Servipino the Louisiana Debt

      Asserting the absolute necessity of debt repayment, Hamilton

argued   that creditors should be faithfully paid even if they             were
nationals of an enemy country in wartime:
     The right to seise        confiscate individual property in
                                  &
National Wars excludes all those cases where the individual  derives
his title from the enemy sovereign or netion'       a nation by the
very act of permitting the Citisen of a foreign country to acquire
property within its territory. . .tecitly engages to give protection
and security to that property.


         servicing of the Louisiana Stock illustrates the intense
        The
desire of Hamilton and his successors strictly to maincein the good
credit of the United States. This requirement stemmed from the
near fatal emberassments of the Revolutionary War, and the need to

avoid them in future conflicts.

        The Louisiana Six Percent Stock was issued in 1804 to finance

the payment of $11,250,000 to France for the Louisiana territory.

the issue in London that was eventaally 'Yiomestinated"                 or purchased

by U.S. residents.
        The possibility of a war between Greet Britain end the U.S.

became serious in 1811, and a large amount of this issue was sold

back to U.S.         residents in the newt year and a half.                 Even so,
almost $4 million of Looisiana Stock remained in London,

        In    the    War    of   1812,   the       U.S.   again    ewperienned greet
difficolties in borrowing. Though it did ecgoire substantial funds

by    selling   6   peroent bonds at well below per,          it   also has to resort
to some issues        of circulating Treasury notes, a praotioe that had
been considered poor financial poaroy since the oroietion of the
Continentals in the Revolution.                    To servtoe tne $4 million in

war.     Even in the midst of this war, the Treasury felt it vitally

necessary to continue interest payments on its obligations held by

foreigners,         including those tn London.               Through an intensive
British      naval blockade and the burning of the Treasury boilding in
1814 by British           troops,   the Treasury regularly remitted bills to

          The non—eooeptenoe of the bills as announoed in your
oommunioation of 8th October would at any time afford oause for
regret, but when it is oonsidered that this rircumstance is in some
measure indioetive of the fate of a much large remittance made to
you on the 23d August, I am apprehensive that unless you shall have
interposed your good offioes on the 0000asion by advanoing the
funds reguired to disoharge the dividends on the Louisiana Stook
payable on the first instanoe, the oredit of the United States in
Europe will be materially affected by the failure.'


3. Refunding the Foreign and Domestic Debts

The Debt in 1790

        In his Report on Public Credit of January 9, 1790, Hamilton
estimated the debt of the United States cc in Tables 2, 3, and   49
In addition, Hamilton estiosted rhe debt of the states at about

$2f.6 million.     This was relevenr bereuse of Hamilton's intention

to have the Federal government aesune the state debt.

Schedules B, C, and 0 of the report in American State Papers, Vol.
5, Finanoe, pp. 26—28 and in Datnight,   p. 20. In oaloulating the
dollar value of the prinoipel of the French loans, Hamilton
apparently used the exchange rate of .1815 $/livre, the relative
specie values. In converting the arrears to dollars, however, he
apparently used the rate .1851 $/livre The exchange rate for the
Dutch florin or guilder was .4 S/flnrin.

     The bulk of the debo inherloed by rho new state was incurred

in the Revolutionary Mar              n various refundings during the

1780's under the Articles of donfederation.                 The domestic debt
instruments were defined in terms of dollars, which typically meant

Spanish milled dollars.'°
     The foreign debt was denomrnated in terms of French livres

tournois or of Dutch guilders.            The value of the livre tournois

depreciated rapidly in the key period of refunding from 1790—95
with the introduction of the inflationary assignat."
The Domestic Debt

Inicial Funding of the War: The Continentals

      The Continental Congress, lacking a taxing power, funded the
initial phases of the war with the emission of Continental money

starting in 1775.      These notes bore a promise of exchange into

Spanish milled dollars in     :ur    it   stallrrnts beginning      in November,

1789 and ending in November, 1712.            Through 7S1,    the   face value of

these emissions totalled $36. millon,

     The value of the Continentals dprecratad rapidly. By the end

of 1776, they were discounted by SOs; and by March, 1780, the rate

     '° The information    in this    sectron     is   based on the history    of
the debt presented     in DeKnight    (1900)

        Spanish milled dollars contained 376 grains of fine silver.
Though those generally in circulation averaged about 372 grains.
Hamilton's Mint Act of 1792 set the silver dollar at 371.25 grains
of fine silver.

of 1781,   the axohange rate was 1000 Continentals to one silver

dollar; and the circulation of this ourranoy had substantially

ended.
     In 1780,   an attempt was made to atsort the old Continentals
with a new emission promising to pay Spanish milled dollars in 1786

along with 5 percent annual interest.       The public oould exchange
old Continentals for the new issue at a rate of forty to one,

approximately the exchange rate between Continentals and silver at
the time of the offer.    Bills of this new emission did not readily

circulate as money; and in spite       of the promised interest, its

market price in specie fell to 1/8 of its face value.
Other Domestic Debt Instruments

     In addition to the Continentals, Congress financed itself by

issuing    various   other    debt    instruments.         These     included

uertifiuates    issued   by   the    Regisrar   of   uhe    Treasury,     the

Commissioners of Loans of the States,       the Commissioners for the

adjustment of accounts of the Quartermaster, Commissary, Hospital,
Clothing and Marine Departments, the Paymaster Deneral, and the
Commissioner of Army Aocuunts.         In addition, interest on these

certifioates had often been paid in further certificates known as

"indents of interest".

     Hamilton    laboriously    oompiled    data     on     these     various

instruments to compute the value of the domestic debt and arrears


     13
        For a recent discussion of the Continental depreciation,
see Calomiris (1988)
in his First Report on the Tudor Credit of 1790.             Particularly
noteworthy are the Loan Off3ce certificates.            These issues were
entered at   specie value' in daermining their contribution to the
1790 debt.   Specie value meant the value in terms of specie at the
time of issue.   Since the pre—Septeniber,    1777 issues were issued at

par,   these are entered in Table     3   ' tneirface      value.   Issues

after March, 1778     ($59.8   mil1ijn on face value)       were severely

discounted to a value of $5.15 million.

       The issues from September, 1777 to March, 1778 were sold at a

discount, so their face value of $3.46 million is entered at the
discounted value of $2.54 million. Apparently, the new government

intended to repay only the origanal market prire as principal and

not the contractual face value.       Never'heiess, on the loans from
this period, interest of 61 was           allowed to accumulate on the

initial face value.       This led to a complication in the conversion

offer of 1790 holders of certoei:atea issued from September, 1777
to March, 1778 were reluctant no rojage in the conversion, feeling

that it disadvantaged them re1t1ve        '   other   claimants.

       Since the arrears of in'we             n t in turn earn interest,

the domestic debt     s   underotoei Sr o      rurrent viewpoint.11 For

example, if the arrears on the entire $o,00C,000 prinoipal had
started in 1782, the arrears would have cumuiated an additional


      " Using the pseudonym Civis, Hamilton stated that arrears of
interest did not bear interest until they were funded on January 1,
1791.   This policy continued for those certificates that were not
converted.    See Civis to Mercator for the National Gazette,
September 11, 1792, The Papers of Alexander Hamilton, Volume XII,
July-october, 1792.
                                    10
$1.37 million in interest by 1790, at 6% interest. This amounts to
3.4% of the principal plus arrears of the domestic.debt. Since the

indebtedness of the states was                 about $26.6 million             including
arrears, an       understatement         cf acrears       of     the   same    order   of

magnitude would have occurred.
The Foreicn Loans

       These loans were incurred during the wer by the Contintental

Congress and after the war under the Articles of Confederation to
fund    current    expenditures      of       the   government         and    to   refund

previously incurred debt.           The French and Spanish loans and the

Holland Loan of 1762 were war finance operations, with the lenders

acting from political snd not commercial motivations.
       The successive Holland loans were undertaken to cover U.S.

expenses in Europe or to meet interest payments falling due on

previous foreign loans.          These loans were commercially priced, and

their sale generally entailed             a    4.58 commission to the bankers.

The    terms   for   the    Holland       ben       of    1784    were       particularly
burdensome,       with     the    commissions,           bonuses,      lotteries       and

gratificetions raising the yield to 6.65%.                  Typically, these loens
carried a S percent annual interest peyment.                   The maturities of the

Holland loans generally were from ten                     to fifteen years, with

redemption to occur with severel eguel annual installments usually

spread over five years.          Thus,    mccc principel on the Holland loans

was due in the mid— to late 1790's.

       The French loans, made between 1777 end 1782, had maturities

that reguired repayment from 1785 to 1795.                     On several issues the


                                              11
U.S. failed to make timely payment on        bth        interest and principal,

and the foreign loans undertaken by         the   new    government   starting in
1790 were   aimed primarily at gain000 funds to           cy   off these earlier
loans.   The    $6.3 million worth of French loans represented 60% of
the foreign debt and generated almost all the arrears.                 The French
loans plus arrears also amounted to 14s of the debt of the U.S.

national government in 1790.

     In 1787, 1788,       and 1789,   the U.S. missed scheduled principal

repayments totalling 7.5 million lfvres                 ($1,388,888) on the 18
million and 10 million livre French loans, as well as the arrears

of interest.        Hamilton did not allow for any interact payments on
the arrears of interest, so arrears effectively constituted a free

loan to the     U.S      If arrears of interest had paId the 5% annual
interest    standard in these   contracts, the     US.     foreign indebtedness
on January     1,   1790 would have increased by $285,810, 2.3% of the

total. These arrears continued for severol years after the passage

of the funding act of 1790.



Refunding the Domestic Debt
      Hamilton's proposal in the First Report on the Public Credit

to   refund the domestic debt at par generated a major public

debate.15      Since much of the ectsting debt had been resold by

initial holders at heavy discount,          many argued that only the debt


         The proposals to fund tna foregn debt apparently raised
little controversy.   In the Frst Report on Public Credit (Hocks,
Volume 3, p. 7) , Hamilton clairceci     that
                                       there was general agreement
on paying the foreign debt on the precise terms of the contracts.

claimed the in any case there was never more that $3 million of

U.S.     debt   floating      in    the   stock   markets   and     that     it   was
guestionable whether as much as one—third of the debt was in the
hands of "elienees" when              Congress began to     deliberate on the

Funding Act of 179C."
        Coincident with the formation of the new government in 1789,

the First Report on the Public Credit in January, 1790, and its

implementation in the Funding Act of August, 1799, the market
values of U.S. domestic debt and state debts rose dramatically.
        Table 6 presents a series of market prices for Continental

Certificates and indents prior tu and after the refunding offer.

The certificates were "indented to December 31,                   1787," so they
carried     arrears     frnm       that   date.     In   January,       1788,     both
certificates and arrears carried bids of $11.67 per $190.                           By

         For example the Pennsylvania Cazette of January 13, 1790
argued for payment at market value.     It invoked the widows and
orphans of soldiers who had sold their claims below par and whom it
would then be unjust to tax at high levels to redeem the claims of
speculators at par. The Pennsylvania Jazette of January 27, 1790
also cites the Hew York Daily gazette as being in opposition to the
refunding proposal.

April,     1789,   certificates rose to              $23.33 and indents rose to

$15.00.       Throughout       1789,    certificate prices              rose     steadily,

reaching $35 at the promulgatIon of the First Report of Public
Credit in January, 1790. Indent prices simultaneously rose to $27.

At the time certificates carried two years arrears of interest,

which, at the current indent price would be worth about $3.00.

Evidently, the public in January, 1790 placed a 20% higher value on
a dollar of principal claims than on a dollar of interest claims.

At the time of the passage of the refunding act in August, 1790,

certificates       jumped to      $52.50, toeing         to       $o6.83    in October.

Indents rose suostantially less ro $33.33 in August, 1790 and to

$35.42 in October.         in summary, the series of every                  establishing

the new government and the passage               f   acts to   rube FuJurl         revenue

five and one—half times and one value of interest arrears by three
times.
      The Funding Act passed in August, 1790 provided that the
domestic debt could be converted to new issues of funded bonds.

Three new types of bonds would be issoed: 6. coupon bonds, deferred

6% coupon bonds, and 3% coupon bonds,                  ail   of   which paid interest

quarterly. The deferred 6% bonds would ray no interest until 1800,
after which they would be identical to the 6% coupon bonds.                         The 6'

and deferred        6% bonds were           redeemable at the            option     of   the

government;        but   the   sum     of   interest payments              and   principal

 repayments in any one year could not exceed $8 per $100 par value

 outstanding.       The 3% bonds were redeemable at               any   time.

      The conversion offer provided that a certicate of $1 principal

or par value could he converted into $1 of principal in the new
bonds, of which 2/3 was in the 6% coupon bonds and 1/3 was in the
deferred 6% coupon bonds. One dollar in interest due on the
domestic debt     or in indents of interest was convertible into $1 par

vslue of the 3% bonds.
      Holders of the domestic debt had one yoer to subscribe to the

new issues. The conversion was not compulsory! and non—subscribers

were promised that they would be paid interost on the principal of

their claims for 1791 as if they had subsoribed--6% on two-thirds

of their principal2
      Market prices for the new hoods are presented in Table 5.      The
first   data on   new bond   prices that I have found after the beginning
of   the conversion are for November 10, 1790.         On this date, the

converted value of the $100 rinnipe1 of dooestic debt was $55.42.

If all of the outstanding arrears were still attached to the

original certificates, the typical $100 of debt would also have
carried $47.60 of interest arrears.         Converted into an eguel per

value of 3% bonds with a price of $35.42,            the arrears on the

hypothetical $100 certificate would have been worth $16.80.
      The principal value plus arrears of $147.60 was then converted

into a package of funded bonds worth $72.28 on November 10, 1790.20

     19
        After 1791, however, no further provision was made to pay
interest to non-subscribers until 1795, when the subscription offer
was reopened for one year.
     20
        Hamilton himself stated thet et the time of the initial
offer the package wee worth 573. See Letter to Oeorge Neshington,
August 18, 1792, in The Papers of Alexander Nemilton, Vol. XII,
                                       15
Almost all the principal and arrears of the old debt was due and

payable before 1791.      While Hanilton's schene did        redeem   the old

debt    'at   par" through the exchar.ge, the value of this converted

package was only 49 cents on the dollar on November 10, 1790.              y
January 1791, the market value of the conversion package for this

hypothetical certificate rose to $92.73 or 63 cents per dollar of

principal plus arrears.
       In addition to the certificates, provision was made to convert

the Continental bills of credit, $100 of Continentals being treated

as $1 of specie principal in the conversion.           Again, this could be
subscribed for a package consistiog of 2/3 sir percent bonds and

1/3 deferred six percents with a v     auo    of   $.55 on November 10,   1790
and    $.72 on January 1, 1791.
         conversion package for state debt ua slightly different.
       The

If $100 principal or interest of state debt was subscribed, the
holder would receive a 3% coupon bono win a           fe
                                                 value of $3333.
The remaining $66.67 would be converted to     6 bond with a face

value of $44.44 (=4/9 x $100) and to a defarrej bond with a face
value of $22.22 (=2/9 x $100). The value of this package on
November 10, 1790 was $48.76, and its value at the beginning of

1791 was $62.50 per $100.         When the   conversion   of state debt was

implemented beginning in January 1792,     the package was worth
$90.73. In the 1790 conversion package, holders of the state debt
were offered a deal of about the same value as that offered to U.S.
debt   holders.

    Because     cf the natucs   cf the ccnversicn offer tc         state

security holders, the market price cf state debt after the cffer
should have been less than the value cf the conversion package.

Harsilten estimated that $26.6 millinn cf state debt was eligible

6cr conversion, but Congress authcrised only $21.5 million of new

bcnds 6cr the     ccnversicn package fcc state debts.           Thus, it

provided for funding only 61% of the state debt.           If all cf the

state debt had been subscribed        mr    ccnversion, the Funding Act

prescribed that the conversion would proceed on a prc—reta basis,
with $21.5 million of new bonds being exchanged for $26.5 million

of the old. Partial over—subscriptions would be treated similerly.

The authorized amount of new bonds was broken into quotas by state,
with over-subscriptions adjusted pro rate on a state by state

basis.     In the event, -all but three states undersubscribed the

conversion, so $100 par value of old stete debt was swapped for

$100 par value of the new bonds.       Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
South Carolina, however, oversubscribed their quotas by 12%, 72%,

and 16% respectively, so subscribers in these states received

proportionally less in per value of the new bonds for $100 par
value of old bonds.

        For comparison, from Table 6 the value of North and South

Caroline debt, which had been $10 per $100 of par value on Nay 22,

1790,    rose to $42.50 on December   4,   $62 by January 1, 1791, and $70

by August 3,     1791.   Table 7 presents the values of the various

state debts on Nay 22, 1700.

        Though the conversion offer expired after 1791, by January,

                                      17
1792, $10.6 million of the eliaibe U.S. domestic debt and arrears
had not been converted int tna funded debt.22 df this amount $6.8
million was in the furs.    regstered debt maonly in tne hands of
foreigners. Hamilton claimed that these holders wanted to convert
to the funded debt and had submitted extensive subscrintion orders
received after the expiration of the offer (and presumably after
they observed the rise n the value of the funded issues)
Hamilton      proposed      that    the   subscription   be   extended   though
September, 1792, and a sequence of acts extended the subscription
deadlines through the end of 1794.             Though no interest was paid on
the bulk of the remaining unregistered and unfunded debt,                there

still remained $2.7 million of onfondJ cio' plus arrears on
December 31,         1793   and $1.2 million       ($176,000 registered)    of

principal and $376,000 of arrears by December 31,              1794
     ' See "Loans,
                   January 23, 1392', in Hamilton's Wrks, pp. 286—
296. Apparently, much of the rersining unfunded dent consisted of
the Loan Office certificates issued between September, 1777 and
March, 1778, on which interest of had been promised on the face and
not the specie value. Hamilton stated that the promised interest
then ranged from 6.2- to 1047-, a potential yield that might
discourage conversion,

Expenditures of the United States for the Year 1793", The Papers of

     To provide for the elimina ion of the last of the unfunded
debt, Hamilton proposed in the Second Report on Public Credit,
January 16, 1795, that the subscription be reopened during the year
of 1795.   Loan Office issues bearing interest in nominal values
would be paid off in specie principal plus               arrears
                                                       of interest
immediately. For debt that remaIned unsuscriiad, prvcsion woold
be made to pay the interest due in 795 p_us 1/Ia S the arrears.
In response to this offer, an anditional $387,64 of princanal and
arrears was subscribed between January ann September, 1790,

        In the deliberations on the repeyment of the             13.5.   debt in
1790,   the foreign debt wee treeted cc senior to the domestic debt.
While there wee greet oontroversy oonoeroing tho rodemption value

ehould be fully repeid.      Among Dhe foreign isenee, the florin debt
inourred in Amsterdam wee in feot treeted cc most senior; this debt

wee     fully   serviced   even   in   the   period   of   the   Articles     of

Confederation, end no peyment wee missed.
        The debt to Frenre in livree tournois wee not serviced under

the Artiolee of Confederation. Arrears of up to cix full years of
intereet paymente had cumulated by 1790, end 7.5 million livree of

eoheduled principel paymente (of 34 million livree outetanding) had
not been made.

        When Hamilton reoeived authorieation to begin repaying the

French debt at the end of 1790,          he contracted a eeriee of         bane



      23
          Indeed, the florin debt did not sell at a large dieoount
relative to the bonde of other countries. At the start of a series
of ealee of new refunding florin bonds in Daoember, 1790, Hamilton
inguirad about the market prioee of U.S. debt in Ametardam. His
agent William Short roplied that 5% U.S. ooupon bonde traded at
prices between 99.5 and 100, oomparad to 102.5 for bonds of the
Emperor (of Austria), 99 to 90.3 for Russian bonds, and 90 to 97
for Swedieh bonds. Short also atataci that maw 5% issues oould be
marketed at par. See Latter from William Short, February 22, 1791,
in The Pagers of Alexander Hamilton, Volume VIII, February —July,

ccnverted     at   the   prevailing   euchange rates        into   livres    and

delivered to the French         Treasury from Deceroer, 1790 through

September, 1792.
        Simultaneous with the beginning of the U.S. debt repayment,

the French revolutionary government began to fund itself by issuing

essignats, which         were made    el        tender in   payment   of    livre

tournois indebtedness.         The U. J. agents in Paris and Amsterdam

responsible for contracting the coot issues and movement of funds,

guickly noting that the U.S.     game      1   frIm the essignat depreciation,

recommended that the U.S. accelerste the payments of principal end

arrears     on the French      debt bLiore the French         terminated      the

assignat inflation and redefineo the livce tournois.24
        Indeed,payments of overdue urincipol and dnterest arrears on
the   French debt were rapidly effectef starting in December, 1790.

        In a letter to Hamilton dated June 3, 1791, the U.S. agent
William Short wrote, 'As the exchange is becoming every day more

                                       ,

as possible in order to take advantage of the depreciation.
     The depreciation of the assignats so long as they continue to
be a circulating medium is an advantage to those who have debts to
pay to France by remittances from abroad. But this depreciation
has been such for some time past as to give serious apprehensions
that the time may come, that ere long, when it must be forced out

exchange        rate    at   specie   values   of   the   currencies     was   .454
florins/livre; but by Autumn,             1792,     it had   fallen to    .274,   a

depreciation of 40%.           The nearly 30 million livres repaid during

these two years represented 68% of the principal and cumulated

arrears of interest at the end of 1796.               With these payments, all
service payments on the French debt had been brought up to date.

        The payments, undertaken at an average exchange rate of .339

florins/livre, had a total dollar value of $4,629,000.                     If the

payments had occurred as scheduled at the pre—depreoiation exchange
rate of .454           florins/livre, their dollar value vould have been

$5,393,751.         Thus,    delaying the repayment beyond the contracted
time had saved the U.S. Treasury $1,364,751.                 This meant that in
dollar (specie)          terms, there was only a 75% repayment of a major

part (68%) of the French debt.

        Hamilton, however, resolved not to take advantage of the

assignet depreciation. In a letter to his agent, William Short, he
wrote,

     "Hr. Ternant, shortly afoer his srrivsl, made a representation
against the payment of monies due to France in its depreciated
paper or assignats. You will readily conclude that the answer to
such a representation could only be, that it was not the intention
of the United States to take advantage of the circumstance of
depreciation, and thet an equitable allowance would be made for
that circumstance in the final adjustment of payments which shell
have been made."25

   A     correspondence ensued         among   Hamilton, Short,       and Short's

successor, Governeur Morris             about the form       of the    "equitable
allowance" to be made.           Finally, the interchange converged to an

      It appears that no "equlleble allowance" foc the lacge scale

debt,    however, either payments or conversions were undertaken at

portion of the Frenoh debt was redeemed fully.
        Thus,    the promise to pay off the French debt on an equitable
basis applied only to the approximately 32% unpaid by the end of

1792.        The other 68% of the debt was paid at 75% of its specie

value.       The average unit of French debt was therefore redeemed nt
83% of its specie value.         Since interest lost on the many yenrs of
cumulated arrears was not added to the debt, the Frenoh                         lost
approximately an          additional     3%    on   the    delays   in   servicing.
Altogether, only about 80% of the French loans were repaid in

specie       value.      Nevertheless,        Hamilton     refused to tnke       tie
opportunity to pay even less.

4.   The Analogy         to   Current    Practice:       The   Mexican   Dank   Debt

Restructuring
        The Mexican bank debt restructuring provides an example to

compare Hamilton's debt reduction plan to the Brady plan, mnnounoed
in March, 1989, for restructuring debt using conditional funding by

third parties.          Under the Mexican plan,          $45.8 billion of Mexicen
debt to         banks would be    converted into new            securities.      The
remainder of the Mexican debt,                about $55 billion, consisted of
official credits, trade credits, and bond debt.29

        Banks had three options for converting the debt.                 First, they
could swap their $1 face value of bank debt for $.65 face value of

a 30 year bond "Debt Reduction Bond" carrying en interest rate of


        29
             These    date are from the Bulow end Rogoff (1990)

                                          23
LIBOR plus 13/16.    Second,   they could swap $1 face value of bank
debt for $1 of a 30 year "Debt Service Redoctron B nd' carrying a
fixed annual interest rate of 6.5%.       Finally, any part of the
original bank loans not exchanged for these bonds would remain an
obligation of the Mexican government, but the holders of these
claims had to lend new money to the Mewican government equal to 25%

of the remaining bank loans over three years.

     To provide guaranteed repayment for part of its obligations
under the Debt Roiuction and Debt Service Reduction Bonds, the

Mexican governmnt provided collateral of $7 oillion.        This was

partly converted inn
                                             rt
                            30-year '0S. Treasury discount bond that
                        a


covered the principal payments, with the         uaed to provide a
two-year rolling guarantee on interest payments. Fonda for the $7
billion guarantee were advanced mostly from the IMF, the World
Bank, and the Japanese govrnoant; and these loans added to the
official obligati n f inc lIa::Lcan governmant.
     Of the $46.8 biilin eligible for conversion, banks exchanged
$22.8 billion at par for the Debt Service Reducti n bonds and $10.7
billion for $12.1 billion of Debt Palcction Bonds. Banks with $4.3
billion of clair optel to lend nea money of $1.1 billion over the
next three years. Effectively, thio arounted to relending the
interest   on the remaining bank debt to MexIco.

     In April, 1990,   immediately after the conversion, the market

prices of the Debt Service Reduction Bond and the Debt Reduction
Bonds were 41.25 and 62.75, respectively.      Since $1 of bank debt

bought $.65 of Debt Reduction Bonds, exchanging $100 of debt under

                                   24
this option    was worth    $40.75;    so    the two    bond options      were

5.   Conolusion: Hamilton Compered to Brady

      The mechanics of the U.S. refunding of 1790 and the Mexirwn

refunding of    1990 are    similar in       all but    a   few   superficiel
dimensions.    These similarities are presented in Teble 9.

       In both oases, there were different seniorities of debt, with

different payoff rates.      In both oases, the most senior foreign

cleims were serviced according to rontrart with no interruptions.

Both the U.S. and Mexico added to the senior debt to refund or poy

off the more junior debt.        In the U.S.    case,    however, deleyn in
paying the principal and arrears of interest on the debt to Feoooe
resulted in a specie paymenc of only $80/dollar bersose of the

subsequent mssignst depreciation.
       In the case of the more jonior claims,           the U.S. offered oo

exchange package worth     $49   of U.S. debt and arrears in Movember,

1790 and $.€3 in January, 1791.             The initial exchange pookoqo

offered for state debt was worth 8.49/dollar in Movember, 1790 ood

$.63 in January, 1791;     but when it was effected in 1792,            price
rises in the bonds increased the package's value to $91/dollar.

The two bond deals offered in exchange for holders of Mexican bank

debt had a value of about 8.41/dollar.         Thus, the initial value of
the U.S. deal amounted to a discount from the face value of the



       30Salomon Brothers, Indicative Prices for Developing Country
Credits.

          51%
     The final optoor of oinpiy' rohawing the converaron by

retaining the original debt prerenos so apparent dafferenre in the
two schemes. The Mexican dccl required additional peymenta of "new

money" from those electing this option.              Effertively, this means
that little interest will artually be paid on the retained debt

before 1993.    Thus,    there io ao elereno of involuntariness in the

Mexican options.     Hamilton, on the other hand,               stressed that the

exchange had to be voluntary.             Hevertheleas, the refunding act

provided only for the payment of interest for 1791, the year of the
conversion, to     the    remaining       holders    of   the    old   debt.   Ho

additional future        raru-rt     a funir w a offered fur paying off

principal and cunuittu       on"      ,   1     r'               Ho provision was

made for paynen     'r   inture '0            ,e ira. Thus, the deal
                                     n;:r 'l,,t—'

offered by HamiJ an wffecniveiy roerreo noiders of the old debt
into accepting r"ro interest on arrears (1/3 of the debt) and on
1/3 of the prinoipal. Also, from the viewpoint of 1790, the deal
would possIbly forre further cumulations of arrears after 1791.
     There is then little differen 'c between Hamilton' a "voluntary"
package and the Mexican deal unoer the Brady plan. Ex post, of
course, successive U.S. Serretarieo of the Treasury adherd
rigorously to the contractual servicing arrangements f.r the U.S.
debt; but the below par pricing of the Of bonds in early 1791

indicated that this outcome was not certain in 1791.                     The still

greater discount on the restructured Mexican package indicates even

greater skepticism that Mexioo will pay off its debt as agreed on

are remarkably parallel.

*The Federal Gazette lists 'Continental Certificates Indented to
December 31, 1787'. I take this to mean that interest due through
the end of 1787 had been paid in indents.       Therefore, these
cerfificates carried cumulated interest from the beginning of
January, 1788.
**The Gazette of the United States, February 2, 1731,    dentifies
these as securities of North and South Caroline.
