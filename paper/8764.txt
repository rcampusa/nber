                                               ABSTRACT


        We study the investment analyses of 67 portfolio investments by 11 venture capital (VC) firms.
VCs consider the attractiveness and risks of the business, management, and deal terms as well as expected
post-investment monitoring. We then consider the relation of the analyses to the contractual terms.
Greater internal and external risks are associated with more VC cash flow rights, VC control rights;
greater internal risk, also with more contingencies for the entrepreneur; and greater complexity, with less
contingent compensation. Finally, expected VC monitoring and support are related to the contracts. We
interpret these results in relation to financial contracting theories.

       There is a large academic literature on the principal agent problem in financial

contracting. This literature focuses on the conflicts of interest between an agent, who is an

entrepreneur with a venture that needs financing, and a principal, who is the investor providing

the funds for the venture. Theory has identified a number of ways that the investor / principal

can mitigate these conflicts. First, the investor can engage in information collection before

deciding whether to invest, in order to screen out ex ante unprofitable projects and bad

entrepreneurs. Second, the investor can engage in information collection and monitoring once

the project is under way. Third, the financial contracts, i.e. the allocation of cash flow and

control rights, between the entrepreneur and investor can be designed to provide incentives for

the entrepreneur to behave optimally.

       In this paper, we focus empirically on the information collection process and on the

relation between that process and the ensuing financial contracts. We do so by studying a

sample of venture capital (VC) investments in portfolio companies. To help the VC partnership

evaluate an investment in a company, it is common for the individual venture capitalist who

sponsors the investment to prepare a detailed investment analysis or memorandum for the other

partners. In this paper, we analyze the investment memoranda from 11 VC partnerships for

investments in 67 companies. We complement our analysis with information from the company

business plans, data on the financial contracts from Kaplan and Strömberg (2001), and data on

the subsequent performance of the companies.

       While VCs are interesting in their own right, we think they also are interesting

theoretically in that they approximate investors assumed by theorists. VCs invest in

entrepreneurs who need financing to fund a promising venture. Although they are




                                                  1
intermediaries, VCs are sophisticated and have strong incentives to maximize value. At the same

time, they receive few or no private benefits of control.1

          Previous works has studied what venture capital partnerships (VCs) do and how they add

value. For example, Gorman and Sahlman (1989), Hellman and Puri (1998 and 2000), and

Lerner (1995) focus primarily on what VCs do after they have invested in a company. Kaplan

and Strömberg (2001) and Gompers (1995) focus on the nature of the financial contracts.

MacMillan, et al. (1985), MacMillan, et al. (1987), and Fried & Hisrich (1994) use evidence

from surveys of VCs to describe the characteristics of VC investments.

          We believe this paper makes two contributions. First, it adds to existing work by

describing the characteristics and risks that VCs consider in actual deals. Second, this paper is

novel in considering how those characteristics and risks relate to the financial contracts (cash

flow rights and control rights) and, in turn, how the contracts are related to subsequent

monitoring. We are able to utilize the VCs’ direct assessments rather than the indirect proxies

(for risk and monitoring) used in most previous research.

          First, we describe the VC analyses. These analyses include a set of investment theses or

rationales for making the investment and a discussion of the concomitant risks. Consistent with

academic and practitioner accounts, VCs explicitly consider the attractiveness of the opportunity

– the market size, the strategy, the technology, customer adoption, and competition – the

management team, and the deal terms.2 VCs also explicitly delineate the risks involved in the

investments. The risks typically relate to the same characteristics that the VCs evaluate for

attractiveness.

                                                        2
       Next, we present direct evidence on VC actions or monitoring. We rely on the

investment analyses at the time of the initial investment that describe actions that the VCs took

before investing and that the VCs expect to undertake conditional on investing. We confirm that

VCs play a significant role in shaping and recruiting the senior management team. In at least

half of the investments, the VC expects to play an important role in recruiting management. We

also find that in more than one-third of the investments, the VC expects to provide value-added

services such as strategic advice or customer introductions. Because the investment memoranda

vary in the detail they provide, these results likely understate the VCs’ activities in this area.

These results support and complement the results in Hellman and Puri (2000 and 2002).

       We then consider how the assessments in the VCs’ analyses interact with the design of

the financial contracts. We focus on the risks or uncertainties identified by the VCs in each

transaction, dividing them into risks that are: (1) associated with external uncertainty – the

relevant information is external to the firm and, we argue it is more likely that the VC and the

entrepreneur are equally informed; (2) associated with internal uncertainty – the relevant

information is internal to the firm and, we argue it is more likely that the VC is less informed

than the entrepreneur; and (3) associated with complexity. Greater external and internal risks are

associated with more VC ownership, more VC control, and more contingent compensation.

Greater internal risk is also associated with more contingent financing. Greater complexity is

associated with less contingent compensation. We interpret these results in relation to financial

contracting theories. For example, the relations between internal and external risk and control

are strongly consistent with the model in Dessein (2001). Similarly, the result for complexity

risk is consistent with theories like Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) that focus on the use of

incentives in the presence of multiple objectives.




                                                   3
       Finally, we relate the financial contracts to expected VC actions. VCs are more likely to

strengthen the management teams as VC control increases. This result is consistent with theories

such as Dewatripont and Tirole (1994) in which VC board control is necessary for management

intervention. VCs value-added services are increasingly likely as VC cash flow rights increase,

but are not related to VC board control. This is consistent with the double-sided moral hazard

theories, such as Casamatta (2000), Inderst and Muller (2001), and Repullo and Suarez (2000).

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section I describes our sample. Section II describes the

VC analyses. Section III examines the relation between the contracts and the VC analyses.

Section IV examines the relation between ex post monitoring and the contracts. Section V

summarizes our results and discusses their implications.



I.     Sample

       In this version of the paper, we analyze VC investments in 67 portfolio companies by

eleven venture capital partnerships. This represents a subsample of the investments described

and analyzed in Kaplan and Strömberg (2001).



       A.       Description

       We obtained the initial sample by asking VCs in fourteen VC partnerships to give us

detailed information on as many of their portfolio company investments as they were willing to

provide. For each of these companies, we asked the VC to provide the term sheet as well as the

stock purchase and security purchase agreements for each financing round in which they

participated. We also asked the VC to provide (if available) the portfolio company’s business




                                                4
plan at the time of the financing, the VC’s internal analysis of the investment, and the subsequent

portfolio company financial performance.

       Most VC partnerships have an investment process in which the partner (or partners)

responsible for the investment writes up an investment analysis or memorandum describing a

potential investment. The entire partnership group uses the memorandum as a guide in deciding

whether or not to make the investment. If the VC does in fact make the investment in a

company, the memorandum then serves as a guide for post-investment monitoring.

       VCs at eleven of the fourteen VC partnerships provided an investment memorandum /

VC analysis for at least one of their portfolio company investments. The investment memoranda

have varying degrees of detail. Some are brief two page write-ups while others are in-depth

descriptions and discussions exceeding twenty pages. A consequence of this is that our results

are certain to understate the extent of analyses that the VCs perform.

       Table 1 presents summary information for our sample. As mentioned above, panel A

indicates that we have data on investments in 67 portfolio companies by eleven VC firms. 25 of

these investments are pre-revenue (which we refer to as early stage) rounds. I.e., the firms

receiving financing either did not have revenues or were not yet operating. The remaining

investments are rounds in which the firms had revenues and were already operating. Also, in 44

cases, the sample includes the first investment any VC ever made in the portfolio company; in

the remaining 23 cases another VC fund had previously invested when our VC acquired a stake.

       Panel B shows that the sample companies / investments are relatively recent. All but 11

of the 67 companies were initially funded by the VCs between 1996 and 1999.




                                                 5
       Panel C shows that the sample represents a wide variety of industries. The largest group,

not surprisingly, is in information technology and software (24 observations, or 36%), but the

sample also includes biotech, telecom, healthcare, and retail ventures.

       Panel D shows that the portfolio companies were funded by 11 VC firms with no more

than 15 companies from any one VC.

       Panel E indicates the amounts of the sample financings. The VCs committed a median of

$6.0 million in equity in each financing round. A median of $4.8 million was disbursed on

closing with the rest contingent on milestones. Pre-revenue rounds in our sample tended to make

greater use of contingent funding.

       Finally, Panel F indicates that 17 of the 67 companies have subsequently gone public, ten

have been sold, and three have been liquidated. The remaining 37 companies are still private.



       B.      Sample selection issues

       In this section, we discuss potential selection issues concerning our sample. Our sample

of portfolio companies and financings is not a random sample in that we obtained the data from

venture capital firms with whom we have a relationship.

       One possible bias is that the VCs provided us with deals they thought were their better

investments. This is unlikely for two reasons. First, many of the investments the VCs provided

us were their most recent (as evidenced by the years in which the financings were completed).

Second, 6 of the 11 individual VCs who provided investment analyses provided all of their

individual investments in the relevant sample period. Even if the bias exists, it is unlikely to

affect the results. The results for the 6 VCs who provided all their analyses are similar to the

results for the entire sample.




                                                  6
          Another possible bias in our sample is that the VCs we study have above average ability.

This is true because we contacted only successful venture capitalists. We do not think this bias

(if it exists) is of much concern for many of our analyses because we are interested in

understanding how VCs choose and structure their investments rather than how well they

perform. If anything, a bias towards more successful VCs would be helpful because we are more

likely to have identified the methods used by sophisticated, value maximizing principals.

          A third possible bias is that the three VCs from our previous paper that did not provide

investment memoranda are somehow different from the others. However, the contractual

characteristics for the investments made by those three VCs are qualitatively similar to the

contractual characteristics for the investments made by the eleven other VCs.

          Finally, it is worth adding that the industry and geographic composition of the sample

portfolio companies is in line with the overall composition of all VC investments over the same

period.



II.       Description of VC investment analyses

          A.     Investment Theses

          As mentioned earlier, the VC analyses invariably include a set of investment theses or

rationales for making the investment. Such theses or arguments were present for all 67 portfolio

company investments in our sample.

          Table 2 summarizes the information in the investment theses. Following previous work

on VC company characteristics,3 we distinguish among factors that relate to the opportunity (the

company’s market, product / service / technology, strategy, and competition), to the management

team separate from the opportunity, to the deal terms, and to the financing environment.




                                                   7
           Panel A shows that factors relating to the opportunity are important considerations in a

VC investment. All but one of the investments included investment rationales based on such

factors. Consistent with academic and practitioner accounts, VCs are attracted to large and

growing markets. This was mentioned explicitly in 46 of the 67 portfolio company investments.

In at least one-third of the investments, VCs were attracted by the product / technology; by the

strategy / business model; by high likelihood of customer adoption; and by a favorable

competitive position.

           Panel B considers factors related to management. In over 60% of the investments, the

VCs explicitly cited the quality of management as a reason for investing. In 27% of the

investments, the VCs cited favorable performance to date.

           Panel C shows that the terms of the investment are also important. In particular, a low

valuation or low amount of capital at risk are each attractive in roughly 20% of the investments.



           B.      Investment Risks

           While the VC investments always include a number of positive elements, they also

typically involve risks and uncertainties. The VCs identified risks in 65 of the 67 portfolio

companies in our sample.

           Table 3 summarizes these risks. Panel A indicates that the VCs viewed the opportunity

as having significant uncertainties in 60 of 67 investments. In order of frequency, these

uncertainties included business model / strategy risks, competitive risks, market size risks,

product / technology risks, and adoption risks. Thus, while the VCs believed these opportunities

were attractive investments, the VCs did not believe the investments were without risk.

    See e.g. MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha (1985).


                                                        8
        Panel B indicates that the VCs viewed some aspect of management as risky in 61% of the

analyses. For example, one CEO was “difficult” while several management teams were

incomplete. Interestingly, this is roughly the same percentage as the 60% for which the quality of

management was one of the reasons for making the investment. It is easy to reconcile this by

observing that a VC might think very highly of the opportunity, but be uncertain as to whether

the founder can hire or build the rest of the management team.

        Panel C shows that VCs view deal terms as important risks in more than 37% of the

investments. These risks include high valuation (i.e., paying too much) in 19% of the

investments, an investment that exposes the VC to substantial downside risk in 13%, and high

monitoring costs in 15%. It is worth pointing out that the valuation is endogenous to the

contracts. We recognize this and do not include valuation as a risk in the regressions that follow.

        The risks of high monitoring costs or involvement costs are particularly interesting. In

several investments, the VC worried that the investment might require too much time. In two

cases, this involved the VC becoming chairman of the company. This indicates that while VCs

regularly play a monitoring and advisory role, they do not intend to become too involved in the

company. A plausible interpretation is that VCs do not want to be involved in the day-to-day

details of too many of their portfolio companies.

        In general, the strengths and risk factors we identify are similar to the ones emphasized in

the VC strategy and management literature, as well as from anecdotal accounts.4 In particular

the strong focus on management, both as a strength and as a risk, is consistent with the survey

results of MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha (1985). Also, similar to their findings,

market size and growth rank high among the factors VCs are concerned about. The biggest

(1987), and Quindlen (2000).


                                                    9
difference compared to their findings is the low ranking for exit conditions, both in the

investment thesis and as a risk factor. One potential explanation for this is that exit conditions

were not much of a concern due to the exceptionally strong IPO and M&A markets in the late

1990's, where the bulk of our sample is concentrated.


       C.      Financial forecasts

       The investment analyses often included financial forecasts provided by management, by

the VCs, or by both. Table 4 summarizes these forecasts. The table indicates that the companies

were expected to grow quickly. The median company had sales of $1.6 million in the year

before the investment, but was expected to have sales of over $80 million four years after the

investment. Not surprisingly, the management forecasts tend to be more optimistic than the VC

forecasts. By year 4, the median management forecast is for earning before interest and taxes

(EBIT) of $11.9 million versus a median VC forecast of $6.5 million.



       D.      Relation of strengths and risks to firm characteristics

       Table 5 relates the presence of different investment theses and risk factors to exogenous

firm characteristics. Most of the significant differences are found across different industries and

across different VC funds. The industry and the VC effects are hard to disentangle in our sample,

since VCs tend to concentrate in particular industries.5 The results are consistent, however, with

the finding of MacMillan, Siegel, and SubbaNarasimha (1985) that VCs tend to follow different

investment styles with respect to the criteria imposed in their screening process.

        Somewhat surprisingly, we identify very few significant differences in risks and

strengths across the stages of the investment. There seems to be more of a focus on the business




                                                 10
model and strategy for revenue-generating ventures, and more of a focus on a contractual

structure that mitigates VC downside risk for pre-revenue ventures. Competitive risk is more of a

concern for first VC rounds, while valuation is more often a risk for subsequent VC financings.

On the whole, however, our risk factors seem to be measuring risks that cannot simply be

captured by looking at the stage of the investment.



         E.       VC Actions

         A number of papers have studied the role of venture capitalists in assisting and

monitoring their portfolio companies. Gorman and Sahlman (1989), MacMillan, Kulow, and

Khoylian (1988), Ruhnka, Feldman, and Dean (1992), Sapienza (1992), and Sapienza, Manigart,

and Vermeir (1996) report results from surveys of venture capitalists, showing that VCs spend

substantial time and effort monitoring and supporting their investments. Using data provided by

start-up companies, Hellman and Puri (2000 and 2002) find that firms financed by venture

capitalists bring products to market more quickly and are more likely to professionalize their

human resource functions. Lerner (1995) finds evidence that VCs are involved in CEO

replacement decisions. These papers suggest that venture capitalists both assist / advise and

monitor their portfolio companies. The results, however, are either survey-based or indirect.

         In this section, we use the VC investment analyses to complement and corroborate that

previous work by reporting the actions that the VC took before investing and those actions the

VC expected to undertake conditional on investing.

         Table 6 confirms that VCs play a large role in shaping and recruiting the senior

management team. In 16% of the investments, the VC plays a role in shaping the management


5
 For example, all our retail deals come from one VC that specializes in retail deals, and the same is true for our
healthcare ventures.


                                                          11
team before investing. In 43% of the investments, the VC explicitly expects to play a role after

investing.

       The investment memoranda also provide evidence of other potential roles played by the

VCs. In 9% of the investments, the VCs are active in shaping strategy and the business model

before investing, and in 30% they are active in these areas after investing. These actions include

the design of employee compensation, development of business plans and budgets,

implementation of information and accounting systems, and assistance with mergers and

acquisitions.

       Table 7 relates the extent of VC actions to exogenous firm characteristics. Similar to our

results for investment theses and risks, the extent of VC actions varies much more across VCs

and industries than it does across the stage of the investment. This is consistent with survey

evidence from MacMillan, Kulow, and Khoylian (1988) and Ruhnka, Feldman, and Dean

(1992). Unlike Sapienza (1992) and Sapienza, Manigart, and Vermeir (1996), we do not find

that VCs are more involved in value-added activities for early stage ventures. On the contrary,

these actions are more frequent for post-revenue ventures and later VC investment rounds,

although differences are not statistically significant.

       Our results almost certainly understate the actions the VCs take because these are only

actions that the VC (a) decided to include in the report as important; and (b) had done or planned

at the time of the investment. Even so, they provide strong support for and complement the

results in Hellman and Puri (2000). In addition to actions traditionally associated with investor

monitoring, such as replacing management after poor performance, there is substantial evidence

of VCs assisting the founders in running and professionalizing the business, what Hellman &

Puri (2000b) term the supporting role of venture capital.




                                                  12
III.       The relationship between VC risk factors and contractual terms

          In this section, we investigate the relationship between the VCs risk assessments and the

design of the financial contracts for the ventures. Theoretically, financial contracts are designed

in order to mitigate conflicts of interest between the VC and the entrepreneur by allocating cash

flow and control rights between the two parties. In our earlier paper (Kaplan and Strömberg,

2001), we found the design of VC contracts corresponds fairly well to the types of contracts

predicted by theory. In particular, using measures to capture the extent of asymmetric

information and potential agency problems – such as whether the venture was generating

revenue – we found support for the classical principal-agent theories (e.g., Holmström (1979))

and for control theories (e.g., Aghion and Bolton (1991) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994)).

          One shortcoming with this approach is that the proxies used did not distinguish among

types of uncertainty. Most empirical work on agency and information problems in corporate

finance shares this problem. Such work typically uses the ratio of R&D to sales, the market to

book ratio, or the ratio of fixed to total assets as proxies for agency and information problems.6

          In this paper, we try to overcome these problems by using the VC investment memos to

construct more precise risk measures and relate these to financial contracts. This has at least two

advantages. First, it allows us to distinguish among sources of uncertainty that have different

theoretical predictions. Second, using actual risk assessments reduces measurement error and

noise because we are sure to identify uncertainties that truly concern the VCs.

           We focus on risks rather than on the investment theses for three reasons. First, previous

empirical work focuses on the risks. Second, the predictions from the theories tend to focus on

the risks. Finally, given our small sample size, the collinearity between some of the risks and

investment theses reduces the power of our tests. Our results are qualitatively similar when we

net the investment theses against the risks.



      A.       Description of Risk Measures

      To motivate studying the relation of risk to contractual terms, consider the predictions

from classical principal agent theories on the relationship between uncertainty and pay-

performance incentives. To the extent uncertainty comes from asymmetric information about

management quality and actions, pay-performance incentives should increase with uncertainty.

      On the other hand, the uncertainty might also be coming from external sources beyond

management’s control, such as uncertainty about market demand, or competition. Such

uncertainty tends to make pay-performance compensation more costly for a risk-averse manager,

and should lead to a negative relationship. However, Prendergast (2002) argues that there are

reasons why this relationship may be positive.

      Finally, the uncertainty could come from the fact that the firm’s operations are highly

complex, such as in a high-tech venture, in which case the optimal action space of the manager

might be very hard to specify. In such environments, performance-based pay also should be less

likely because compensation based on a signal correlated with a particular action will lead the

manager to put too much emphasis on that action. (E.g., see Holmström and Milgrom (1991)).

      We assign the risks identified in table 3 to three different categories. In the first category,

external risk, we include those risks that we view as external to the firm. We classify market

size, customer adoption, competition, and exit condition risks as external risks. Because these

risks are external to the firm and largely beyond the control of the management team, we believe




                                                 14
that the VC and the founder should be more or less equally informed about these risks. We

discuss this and other possible interpretations in connection with the results.

        In the second category, internal risk, we include risks that are internal to the firm. We

classify risks attributable to management quality, previous performance, capital at risk, negative

influence of other investors, and costly monitoring as internal risks. These risks are related to

management actions and/or the quality of the management team. We believe these risks are

more likely to be one-sided or subject to asymmetric information and moral hazard with respect

to the management team. Again, we discuss other interpretations in connection with the results.

        In the third category, complexity risk, we attempt to capture complexity and, therefore,

potential multi-tasking problems. We classify risks associated with product / technology,

business model / strategy as complexity risks.7

        We form a risk measure for each category by simply adding up the risk dummy variables

from table 3 for the risks in each category, and normalizing the measure to lie between zero and

one. While this measure may “throw away” information, it has the strong advantage that it

minimizes the amount of our own interpretation that we have to apply to the investment analyses.

As we noted earlier, we do not include valuation risk which may be endogenous to the contracts.



        B.        The effect of risk on the provision of founder cash flow incentives

        Table 8 investigates the relation of the risk measures to different measures for the

venture’s valuation. We use three different variables to capture the valuation. First, we calculate

the pre-money value of the company. This captures the value that the VCs placed on the pre-


7
  One potential criticism is that the risks we classify as complexity risks may also be subject to asymmetric
information. We believe that this is less likely to be the case, especially at the ex ante stage when the outcome of the
business strategy or the research and development is not known to all parties. To the extent that this is not correct,
however, this introduces noise in the measure.


                                                          15
financing equity of the company. We calculate this as the amount of VC financing committed in

the round divided by the fraction of equity acquired by the VC in the round. For the calculations,

we assume that the company meets any performance milestones in the contracts, and that all the

founder and employee stock vests fully. This measure will tend to overstate the true valuation,

since performance milestones and vesting provide the VC with additional option values that

might be substantial.8 Another problem with this measure is that it is not normalized or scaled.

To control for scale, we include the expected sales for the year following the financing in the

pre-money valuation regressions.9

       The second and third measures are the fully diluted equity stakes of the VC and founder,

respectively, again assuming full vesting and that all performance benchmarks are met. This is

simply capturing how the value of the venture will be split between investors and founders if the

venture turns out to be successful.

       The regressions also include a number of control variables: industry dummies, VC

dummies10, and dummies for whether the round is the first VC financing, whether the venture is

not yet revenue generating, and whether any of the founders have previously founded a venture

that was take public or sold to another public company.

       The multivariate results in table 8 indicate that both external and internal risk make the

investment less attractive to the VC. As a result, pre-money valuations increase while the

fraction of the company that the founder is allowed to keep decreases. The results for

complexity risk are more ambiguous and generally insignificant. One possible reason is that


8
  I.e., in a worst case scenario, the VC will potentially only provide part of the funds committed and get an
additional fraction of the equity of the company, effectively lowering the valuation.
9
  Since sales are zero for a substantial fraction of ventures, we cannot simply divide the valuation by sales.
10
   Since we only have a few observations for some of the VCs, we only include a VC dummy if the fund has more
than 4 investments represented in the sample, which amounts to 5 of the 11 VCs. Moreover, two of these five VC
dummies are perfectly collinear with the industry dummies and have to be dropped. In particular, all our healthcare
deals come from one VC, who only provided healthcare deals, and the same was true for our retail deals.


                                                         16
while complexity risk might be unattractive to the VC, it also indicates that the founder’s human

capital is more crucial, thus allowing the founder to capture more of the value of the venture.

       In Kaplan and Strömberg (2001), we document that the provision of founder cash flow

incentives in VC financings is largely consistent with the principal-agent theories of Holmström

(1979), Lazear (1986), and others. VCs change the entrepreneur's equity compensation function

in response to uncertainty, making it more sensitive to performance in ventures that are not yet

generating revenues and in early VC rounds, and less sensitive in ventures run by repeat

entrepreneurs. With the exception of repeat entrepreneurs, however, these variables may proxy

for external uncertainty, rather than asymmetric information or uncertainty about the manager’s

incentives. As argued above, only the latter type of “internal” uncertainty should be positively

related to founder pay-performance incentives. Moreover, the repeat entrepreneur variable is

also potentially problematic in that it might be correlated with founder wealth, as well as with

higher bargaining power of the entrepreneur.

       To shed more light on this issue, we regress founder pay-performance incentives on our

three risk measures. Table 9 reports the results. We distinguish the pay performance sensitivity

that is due to explicit performance benchmarks from the sensitivity induced by time vesting of

the founders’ shares. With time vesting, the founder’s compensation is contingent on the board’s

decision to retain the founder, rather than on explicit benchmarks. Hence, one possible

interpretation of time vesting is as a form of subjective performance evaluation. This is arguably

beneficial when explicit benchmarks are too noisy and / or could lead to multi-tasking problems.

       The first three regressions in table 9 investigate the use of explicit benchmarks in equity

compensation. The dependent variable is calculated as: the fraction of founder equity if

benchmarks are met less the fraction of founder equity if no benchmarks are met but full time




                                                17
vesting occurs all divided by the fraction of founder equity if no benchmarks are met but full

time vesting occurs.

        We find that that the use of explicit benchmarks is higher in first VC rounds, higher for

pre-revenue ventures, and lower for repeat entrepreneurs. When we add the three risk measures

in the second regression, however, only the pre-revenue variable remains significant. Consistent

with principal-agent and screening theories, we find that the use of benchmark compensation is

significantly positively related to the degree of internal risk in the venture. Moreover, the degree

of complexity risk is negatively related to benchmark compensation, consistent with multi-

tasking theories of Holmström and Milgrom (1991) and Baker (1992).

        In the third regression, we add industry and VC-fund fixed effects, and the results remain

qualitatively similar, although the negative relationship with complexity risk is weaker and no

longer statistically significant.

        The results for internal risk and complexity risk are in accordance with existing principal-

agent theory. In contrast, we also find a significantly positive relation between external risk and

benchmark compensation which is contrary to the standard theoretical prediction. I.e., given that

external risk is beyond management’s control, and that the uncertainty about external factors is

more or less symmetric between the VC and entrepreneur, we would expect a negative (or at

least a zero) relationship with the use of performance benchmarks in compensation if managers

are risk-averse. Recent work by Prendergast (2002), however, presents a model that generates a

positive relation. In his model, a positive relation will exist when uncertainty makes it difficult

to observe a manager’s actions.11


11
  The anomalous positive relationship between incentives and idiosyncratic risk has also been found by Allen and
Lueck (1992), Core and Guay (1999), and Lafontaine (1992). Aggarwal and Samwick (1998) is one of the few
studies that find the predicted negative relationship. Bhattacharyya and Lafontaine (1995) also discuss possible
explanations for these conflicting results.


                                                        18
       The last three regressions examine the determinants of founder time vesting. This equals

(1) the fraction of founder equity if no performance benchmarks are met (but with full time

vesting) less (2) the fraction of founder equity if no performance benchmarks and minimum time

vesting, all divided by the fraction of founder equity if no benchmarks are met but with full time

vesting. Time vesting is significantly higher for pre-revenue ventures.

       When we add the three risk measures to the regression, we find that the degree of

complexity risk is strongly positively related to the degree of time vesting, while both internal

and external risks are insignificant. The positive relation between complexity and vesting is

consistent with two theoretical explanations. First, vesting might be used as an alternative to

explicit benchmarks when multi-tasking problems make benchmark compensation inefficient,

similar to subjective performance evaluation. Second, by making it more costly for a founder to

leave the firm before the shares have fully vested, vesting mitigates potential hold-up problems

along the lines of Hart and Moore (1994). These potential hold-up problems will be more costly

for complex ventures, for which the entrepreneur’s specific (an inalienable) human capital is

more valuable. The fact that there seems to be no reliable relationship between internal risk and

vesting speaks more in favor of this latter explanation.



       C.      The effect of risk on the allocation of control

       We now turn to the allocation of board control between the VC and the founder.

According to the control theory of Aghion and Bolton (1992), the amount of control allocated to

the VC should be increasing in the severity of the agency problem between the investor and the

entrepreneur. When agency problems are small, they predict that the entrepreneur should always

be in control. As agency problems get more severe, the VC should be allocated some control; at




                                                 19
first only in the bad state of the world, but then, as agency problems increase even more, in all

states of the world. Kaplan and Strömberg (2001) document that state-contingent control is

indeed a prevalent feature of VC contracts, with control shifting gradually from the VC to the

entrepreneur as venture performance improves. Moreover, their regression results show that for

pre-revenue ventures, where uncertainty about the viability of the venture should be higher, the

VC receives board and voting control in more states of the world, broadly consistent with

Aghion and Bolton (1992). When uncertainty is high, conflicts are more likely to arise between

the VC and the founder regarding issues whether the manager should be replaced or the business

should be continued. Hence, the VCs need to be allocated control in more states in order for

their investment to be ex ante profitable.

       Still, pre-revenue is at best a very rough measure of potential conflicts of interest. To get

sharper measures, which are more likely to capture the risk factors about which the VC is truly

concerned, we use our three risk variables and relate these to the degree of VC control. When

external or complexity risk is high, the economic viability of the venture is more uncertain –

hence, it is more likely that the VC is going to want to intervene and liquidate (or sell) the

venture against management’s will. Similarly, when internal risk is high, the quality of the

management team is more uncertain, and it is more likely that the VC is going to have to

intervene in order to replace management.

       Dessein (2001) explicitly introduces asymmetric information into an Aghion-Bolton type

model. He shows that when entrepreneurs have private information about their types, good

entrepreneurs have an incentive to relinquish some control rights to the VC to separate

themselves from bad entrepreneurs. When the VC is allocated control, and subsequently

acquires post-contracting information about entrepreneurial quality, the VC will exercise this




                                                 20
control and replace management only if information indicates that the entrepreneur is a bad type.

Because entrepreneurs value their private benefits from running the firm, bad types will refrain

from seeking VC financing. Hence, for ventures where asymmetric information is severe,

implying that internal risk is high, we would expect to see more VC control.

         Moreover, Dessein’s model also predicts that VC control should be decreasing in the

quality of post-contracting information. Empirically, it seems reasonable to expect post-

contracting information to be noisier when the external environment is more uncertain, and,

therefore, to expect VC control to be increasing in the amount of external risk.

         Table 10 displays the results using two different measures of board control. The first

dependent variable is a dummy for whether the VCs control more than half of the board seats in

the venture. The second board variable equals zero if the founder always controls a majority of

the seats, equals one if neither the VC nor the founder has a majority of the seats in the bad state,

equals two if the VC controls a majority in the bad state only, and equals three if the VC controls

a majority of the seats in the good and bad states.12

         Using only general measures of uncertainty we find that the degree of VC control is

higher for pre-revenue ventures, but increases with additional rounds of financing as the VC puts

in additional funds in the venture. Adding the specific risk measures substantially increases the

explanatory power of the regressions, and, in particular, both the external and internal risk

measures are associated with more VC board control. These results give additional support for

the Aghion-Bolton approach in general, and the Dessein (2001) model in particular.

         In contrast, complexity risk comes in with a negative sign and is not statistically


12
  The classification of the situation in which neither party is in control in the bad state is arguably ambiguous. We
have run alternative regressions (not in the table) in which we classify these situations as entrepreneur control (0) or
with the VC control in the bad state (2). Our results are qualitatively identical.



                                                           21
significant. One plausible reason for this is that for complex ventures, the VC exercise of control

by replacing management or liquidating the venture would not be very efficient because so much

of the firm value is tied up in the founder’s human capital rather than in tangible assets.

       We obtain qualitatively similar results (that we do not report) when we use voting control

rather than board control although only the internal risk is statistically significant. We believe

that for most corporate decisions, including the replacement of management, board control is the

more important measure. This view is supported by Lerner (1995).



       D.      The effect of risk on staging of funds and the allocation of liquidation rights.

       The models of Townsend (1979), Hart and Moore (1998), and others focus on debt and

the allocation of liquidation rights as the optimal financial contract, when entrepreneurs can steal

or expropriate firm output. In their setting, where firm cash flow is not contractible, the optimal

financial contract is a debt-like claim in which (1) the entrepreneur promises a fixed payment to

the investor; and (2) the investor takes control of the project and liquidates the assets if the

payment is not made. Bolton and Scharfstein (1990) and Neher (1999) build on the “stealing”

approach to show that the ability to withhold future financing, through staging of funds, can

serve as a similar liquidation threat in order to force repayment.

       Previous empirical work has shown that these features are indeed standard in VC

financings. Kaplan and Strömberg (2001) show that VC contracts exhibit several debt-like

features: (1) the VC is always senior in liquidation to common stock; and (2) in four out of five

cases the VC claim is redeemable, giving the VC the ability to force the firm to repay the

liquidation amount if the firm has not yet been sold or gone public by some future date. These

features do not vary much with the uncertainty of the venture, however, and the only significant




                                                  22
cross-sectional variable in their regressions is the long-term debt ratio of the industry.

         For staging of funds, on the other hand, Gompers (1996) show that there is more staging

in industries with fewer tangible assets, while Kaplan and Strömberg (2001) show that there is

less staging for repeat entrepreneurs. Although this suggests that VCs use staging to mitigate

agency problems, the risk proxies are all indirect and the results far from conclusive.

         In table 11, we investigate the relationship of staging and liquidation rights to the VC risk

factors. The first six regressions address staging of funds. We distinguish between two different

types of staging: ex ante (or within-round) and ex post (or between-round). Ex post staging,

measured by the number of months until the next financing round, measures the extent to which

the VC increases the ability to liquidate the venture if performance is unsatisfactory by

committing less funding in a given round. In an ex-ante staged deal, on the other hand, part of

the VC’s committed funding in the round is contingent on explicit financial or non-financial

performance milestones. This essentially gives the VC the right to liquidate the venture when

the milestones are not met. We measure ex ante staging by the fraction of the funds in a given

round that is released contingent on milestones.

         We find that the extent of both ex ante and ex post staging is positively related to the use

of debt in the industry.13

         With respect to our VC risk measures, however, the uses of the two types of staging seem

to differ. Ex ante staging using explicit milestones primarily seems to be a way of dealing with

internal risk. This is consistent with ex ante staging being a way for good firms to signal their

type (or for VCs to screen out bad firms), similar to the way short-term debt is used in the model

by Diamond (1991).


13
  Recall that a negative coefficient on the ex post staging measure, the number of months until the next financing
round, indicates a higher degree of staging.


                                                         23
           Ex post staging, on the other hand, does not seem to be related to internal risk, but instead

to the amount of risk external to the firm. This suggests that the driving force for ex post staging

is not asymmetric information, but rather the option to abandon the project, which will be more

valuable in volatile environments.14

           The last four regressions investigate whether the different sources of risk are related to

debt-like features in VC contracts, i.e. redemption rights and the size of the VCs claim in

redemption or liquidation. None of these features seem to be related to internal risk (although

redemption rights are somewhat less likely for repeat entrepreneurs). The only risk factor

affecting the presence of redemption rights is the amount of external uncertainty. The

interpretation here is far from clear, and the abandonment option argument does not apply well to

redemption rights that apply more than five years into the future.

           The size of the liquidation claim (measured by a dummy for whether the VC liquidation

claim is larger than the VC investment) is significantly negatively related to complexity risk, and

here the interpretation is more straightforward. For highly complex ventures, collateral value is

likely to be very low, since most of the firm value is tied up in the founder’s intangible human

capital. Hence, the size of the liquidation claim will be more or less irrelevant for these ventures.



           E.      Summary

           In this section, we have studied the relation of venture capitalist risk assessments to the

financial contracts they utilize in their investments. We find that: (1) Greater internal and

external risks are associated with more VC cash flow rights. (2) When internal risk is high, VCs

appear to screen entrepreneurs by making funds and equity stakes contingent on explicit


14
     See Berger, Ofek, and Swary (1996) and Cornelli and Yosha (2000).



                                                         24
milestones. (3) Greater internal risk is associated with more VC control, while a less noisy

external environment with more accurate post-investment information is associated with less VC

control. These are both consistent with the model of Dessein (2001). (4) Complexity risk is

associated with a decrease in the usefulness of screening, consistent with the multi-tasking

problem of Holmström and Milgrom (1991). (5) In complex ventures, where it is likely that

more value is tied up in the founder’s human capital, VC liquidation claims are less effective,

while tying the entrepreneur to the firm through vesting founder stock becomes more important.

(6) Ex post, between-round staging (in contrast to ex ante staging contingent on explicit

milestones) does not seem to be used to mitigate internal risk, but rather as a response to a

noisier external environment, consistent with the abandonment option being more valuable.

       In interpreting our results, we believe that internal risks are more likely to be associated

with asymmetric information and moral hazard problems while external risks are more likely to

be associated with general or two-sided uncertainty. All of the results, and particularly the fact

that internal risks are more important for contingent compensation and contingent funding, are

consistent with this interpretation.

       Nevertheless, it is possible to argue that the risks we classify as internal are not related to

asymmetric information and moral hazard problems. For example, in some circumstances

management risk may measure managerial overconfidence as ascertained by the VC. Similarly,

management may have better information on customer adoption, competition, or the market than

the VC.

       We have two reactions to these concerns. First, while the arguments are possible, we

think they are relatively unpersuasive. VCs typically undertake due diligence with respect to

those risks that are external to the firm and should be able to obtain the same information as the




                                                 25
founders. It is for risks internal to the firm, that the VCs are more likely to be at a disadvantage

on average. Second, for those readers who are not persuaded by our preferred interpretation, the

fact remains that external risk, internal risk, and complexity risk are significantly and differently

related to the contracts. Alternative interpretations must be able to explain this.



IV.     The relationship between contracting and monitoring

        In the previous section, we find a relation between the risk factors identified in the VC’s

initial screening and the financial contracts. In this section, we consider the relation between the

contracts and the subsequent VC post-investment actions.

        As we showed in table 6, above, the VC screening process also identifies areas where the

VCs expect to add value through monitoring and support activities. The design of the financial

contracts may affect the VC’s ability and incentives to actually carry out such activities. First,

the founder might not agree with the actions that the VC would like to implement. In such cases,

VCs will need some formal control to carry out those actions against the will of the entrepreneur.

Second, monitoring and support activities could potentially take a lot of VC time and effort (see

e.g. Gorman and Sahlman, 1989). The VC will undertake them only if sufficiently compensated

through an increase in the value of its claims. Recent theoretical work has formalized this so

called “double moral hazard” problem and shown that the VC financial claim must have a

substantial equity component to provide incentives for support activities that affect the “upside”

value of the venture.15

        Similar to Hellman and Puri (2002), we distinguish between VC actions that are more

likely to be adversarial to management and VC actions that both investors and founders are


15
  See Casamatta (2000), Dessi (2001), Inderst and Müller (2001), Renucci (2000), Repullo and Suarez (1998), and
Schmidt (1999),


                                                       26
likely to agree to. In particular, we argue that actions related to strengthening and replacing the

management team are more likely to lead to conflict, while actions related to developing the

strategy and business model (such as arranging non-VC financing, assisting with mergers, or

leverage strategic relationships) are less likely to do so. The first group of actions are more

likely to be related to the degree of VC control; the second group of actions, to VC equity

incentives. Finally, we also consider the possibility of free-riding behavior among VCs

decreasing the incentives to provide monitoring and support. One prevalent feature of VC

financings is that they are often syndicated, with several different VC funds investing together in

a given portfolio company.16

           Table 12 reports the results of regressions of expected VC monitoring and support

activities on contract characteristics. The first three regressions analyze expected management

team interventions as a function of VC board control. Consistent with our hypothesis, the first

regression shows that the VC is more likely to expect to engage in strengthening or recruiting

management when the degree of VC board control is higher. (We measure board control using

the four-category board control variable analyzed in section 4.3 normalized to lie between zero

and one). The interaction between board control and syndicate size has a negative sign,

consistent with a free-riding problem, although the sign is not significant.

           The second regression shows that this result is robust to including a number of control

and contracting variables, as well as including industry and VC dummies. Notably, the equity

stake of the VC is not significant in predicting management interventions. Since the contracting

variables may suffer from endogeneity bias, the third regression instruments the board variables

using our three risk measures. The board control variable is still positive and significant, and the

negative coefficient on the interaction with syndicate size is now significant at the 10% level.

16
     See Lerner (1994), and Sorensen and Stuart (2001).

                                                          27
       The last three regressions in the table analyze expected value-added support activities as

a function of the VC's equity stake. The first of these specifications shows that the VC equity

stake is indeed significantly related to the extent to which the VCs expect to engage in value-

added support, while the interaction with syndicate size is significantly negative, consistent with

free-riding. The two susbsequent specifications show that this result is robust to the inclusion of

other control variables, as well as to an instrumental variables specification.

       Although VC board control and the size of the VC equity stake are highly correlated (ρ =

0.52), the last two specifications – regressions (7) and (8) – show that the previous conclusions

are robust. Board control does not explain the extent of value-added support and the VC equity

stake does not explain management interventions.

       To conclude, the analysis in table 12 yields three results. First, board control is

associated with a greater ability and tendency for the VC to intervene in management, consistent

with control theories such as Aghion and Bolton (1992) and Dewatripont and Tirole (1994) in

general, and with Hellman's (1998) application to VC management intervention in particular.

Second, consistent with the double-sided moral hazard theories, equity incentives increase the

likelihood that VCs perform value-added support activities. Third, free-riding within a syndicate

can reduce the extent to which VCs are willing to engage in such activities, particularly value-

added support.




                                                 28
V.     Summary and Discussion

       In this paper, we consider how venture capitalists (VCs) assess their investments by

studying the contemporaneous investment analyses produced by 11 VC firms for investments in

67 portfolio companies. Consistent with most academic and anecdotal accounts, we find that

VCs consider the attractiveness of the opportunity, the management team, and the deal terms.

       We also provide evidence on how the venture capitalists expect to monitor those

investments. In at least half of the investments, the VC expects to play an important role in

recruiting management; in at least a third, they expect to provide other value-added services,

such as developing strategy or facilitating partnerships. These results provide confirmation of

the results in Hellman and Puri (2000 and 2002).

       We then consider the relation of the contractual terms to the VC analyses. The novel

aspect of this analysis is our ability to distinguish among external risk, internal risk, and

complexity risk. Consistent with asymmetric information and moral hazard theories, greater

internal risk is associated with more contingent compensation for the entrepreneur and greater

VC control. Greater external risk is also associated with more VC control. Consistent with

multitasking and hold-up theories, greater complexity is associated with less contingent

compensation and more time vesting.

       Finally, we relate the financial contracts to expected VC actions. VCs are more likely to

strengthen the management teams as VC control increases. In contrast, VCs value-added

services are increasingly likely as VC cash flow rights increase, but are not related to VC board

control.

       More generally, the results confirm that VCs exert effort in evaluating investments and

are well-informed. This suggests that theories should model this explicitly as in Garmaise




                                                  29
(1999). VCs also exert time and effort in monitoring and aiding companies in which they invest

to improve outcomes. Effort is not just monitoring and replacing poorly performing

management, but also includes assisting and providing inputs to the company. Again, this

suggests that theories should model this explicitly as in Casamatta (2000).

          Our cross-sectional results relating the contractual terms to the VC identified risks also

are supportive of several contracting theories. The findings that founder pay-for-performance

incentives increase in internal risk and decrease in complexity are consistent with Holmstrom

(1979) and Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991). The findings that VC control rights increase with

internal and external risks is strongly supportive of Dessein (2001) and Aghion and Bolton

(1992).

                                                            Summary Information

Summary information for 90 investments in 67 portfolio companies by 11 venture capital partnerships. Investments were made between
1987 and 1999. Pre-revenue stage rounds are financing rounds for companies that had no revenues before the financing. First VC
investments refer to observations where we have the investment memorandum for the first time any venture capital fund invested in the
company. Repeat entrepreneur refers to observations where, before founding this particular portfolio company, the founder had
successfully gone public with a previous venture or sold such a venture to a public company. Total financing committed is the total
amount of equity financing committed to by the venture capitalists at the time of the financing round.

     Relation Between Venture Capitalist Valuations, Divisions of Equity, and VC Risk Analyses: Multivariate Analysis
Relationship between venture capitalist (VC) risk analyses and contractual terms for investments in 67 portfolio companies by 11
venture capital partnerships. Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. Degree of external risk is the average of the dummy
variables for the presence of market risk, competition risk, customer adoption risk, and financial market / exit risk. Degree of
internal risk is the average of the dummy variables for the presence of management quality risk, questionable performance risk,
contractual structure / downside risk, negative influence of other investors risk, and costly monitoring risk. Degree of complexity
is the average of the dummy variables for product / technology risk and business model / strategy risk. First VC financing round
takes the value of one if no VCs had invested in the company previous to this round, and zero otherwise. Pre-revenue venture
takes the value of one if the venture is not generating any revenues at the time of financing, and zero otherwise. Repeat
entrepreneur takes the value of one if the founder’s previous venture was taken public or sold to public company. Expected sales
in T+1 are the expected sales in the year subsequent to the investment, according to the VC analysis, where available, and
otherwise according to the business plan. White (1980) robust standard errors are in parentheses. Asterisks indicate significant
differences at: 1% ***; 5% **, and 10% * levels.

venture capital partnerships. Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. In specification (1) through (3) the dependent
variable takes the value of one if the VC always controls more than half the board seats, and zero otherwise. In specification (4)
through (6) the dependent variable takes the value of zero if the founder always control a majority of the board seats, one if outside
board members are always pivotal, two if the VC controls the board only if the firms fails to meet some milestone or covenant, and
three if the VC always controls more than half the board. Degree of external risk is the average of the dummy variables for the
presence of market risk, competition risk, customer adoption risk, and financial market / exit risk. Degree of internal risk is the
average of the dummy variables for the presence of management quality risk, questionable performance risk, contractual structure /
downside risk, negative influence of other investors risk, and costly monitoring risk. Degree of complexity is the average of the
dummy variables for product / technology risk and business model / strategy risk. Standard errors are in parentheses (for the simple
logit regressions White robust standard errors are shown). Asterisks indicate significant differences at: 1% ***; 5% **, and 10%
* levels. In specification 3, all retail observations had to be dropped because of collinearity: the VC did not have a majority of board
seats for any of the retail companies in our sample.

Relationship between venture capitalist (VC) monitoring and support actions, undertaken and anticipated, and contractual terms for investments in 67 portfolio companies by 11
venture capital partnerships. Investments were made between 1987 and 1999. Degree of board control takes the value of 0.00 if the founder always control a majority of the
board seats, 0.33 if outside board members are always pivotal, 0.67 if the VC controls the board only if the firms fails to meet a milestone, and 1.00 if the VC always has board
majority. VC equity stake is measured assuming all performance benchmarks are met and all founder and employee equity vest. Syndicate size is the number of different venture
capital funds that are investing in this or any previous round. White (1980) robust standard errors are in parentheses. Asterisks indicate significant differences at: 1% ***; 5%
**, and 10% * levels. In regression 3, the 9 observations had to be dropped, since the healthcare dummy predicted success perfectly. In the two-stage least square specifications
the contracting variables are instrumented by Pre-revenue, Repeat entrepreneur, First VC round, Degree of external risk, Degree of internal risk, and Degree of complexity risk.
