Immunization and Moral Hazard: The HPV Vaccine and Uptake of Cancer Screening

August 2016
JEL No. I10,I12

                                         ABSTRACT

Immunization can cause moral hazard by reducing the cost of risky behaviors. In this study, we
examine the effect of HPV vaccination for cervical cancer on participation in the Pap test, which
is a diagnostic screening test to detect potentially precancerous and cancerous process. It is
strongly recommended for women between 21-65 years old even after taking the HPV vaccine. A
reduction in willingness to have a Pap test as a result of HPV vaccination would signal the need
for public health intervention. The HPV vaccination is recommended for women age eleven to
twelve for regular vaccination or for women up to age 26 not vaccinated previously. We present
evidence that probability of vaccination changes around this threshold. We identify the effect of
vaccination using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design, centered on the recommended
vaccination threshold age. The results show no evidence of ex ante moral hazard in the short-run.
Sensitivity analyses using alternative specifications and subsamples are in general agreement.
The estimates show that women who have been vaccinated are actually more likely to have a Pap
test in the short-run, possibly due to increased awareness of its benefits.

1. Introduction

       Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer related cause of death among women

globally. Virtually all cervical cancers are causally related to infection by Human Papillomavirus

(HPV). Approximately 70% of cervical cancers are caused by HPV types 16 and 18 (Saslow et

al., 2007). Cervical cancer is the easiest gynecological cancer to prevent, and it only requires

regular screening tests and follow-ups. There are two tests for diagnosing cervical cancer, the

Papanicolaou test (Pap test or Pap smear), which looks for cell change in the cervix that might

ultimately become cervical cancer if it is not treated appropriately, and the HPV test, which

looks for the virus (HPV) that can cause these cell changes. The Pap test is recommended for all

women between ages 21 and 65 years old, while the HPV test is recommended for women older

than 30 along with the Pap test (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014).

       For decades the Pap test has been one of the most effective and successful cancer

screenings in medicine, yet most women diagnosed with cervical cancer did not receive the test

in the five years dating back to the diagnosis (Saslow et al., 2002). More recently, two HPV

vaccines, Cervarix and Gardasil, became available in the market. These vaccines target HPV

types that most commonly cause cervical cancer. The bivalent vaccine (Cervarix) and

quadrivalent vaccine (Gardasil) can protect against HPV types 16 and 18, which worldwide are

responsible for about 70% of cervical cancer. Gardasil also protects against HPV types 6 and 11,

which cause 90% of genital warts. These vaccines are highly effective in preventing the targeted

HPV types (Skinner et al., 2008). Cervarix was approved in 2009 by the Food and Drug

administration, and Gardasil was approved in 2006 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

2015). Prior to these approval dates, no vaccine for HPV was available in the market.




                                                                                                   1
         Despite the relative efficacy of the various HPV vaccines, regular Pap tests are

recommended for women who have been sexually active even after HPV vaccination (American

Cancer Society, 2014). Several important reasons account for that. First, vaccination does not

protect against all HPV types not included in the first generation of the vaccines. About 30% of

cervical cancer occurrences will not be prevented by the HPV vaccines. Second, protection

against the targeted types cannot be expected to be absolute. Additionally, women who got the

HPV vaccine after becoming sexually active might not get the full benefit of the vaccine if they

already had been exposed to the virus. These factors, along with the fact that long term effects of

the vaccine are unknown at the time being, suggest the need to use both prevention strategies,

namely the vaccine d the screening test as complements in order to minimize risks (Franco et al.,

2006).

         In the insurance literature, economists have drawn a distinction between ex-post and ex-

ante moral hazard (Ehrlich and Becker, 1972; Dave and Kaestner, 2009). Insurance can cause

consumers to increase medical expenditures to inefficiently high levels due to a change in the

relative price of health care (ex-post moral hazard), yet it also provides an incentive for people to

under invest in self-protection or to engage in risky health behavior (ex-ante moral hazard).

Another source of ex-ante moral hazard which has received less attention stems from Medical

innovations that appear to change risk perceptions. For example, advances in heart disease

treatments have contributed to the dramatic rise in obesity in the population (Peltzman, 2011), as

has access to improved and lower-cost treatment for diabetes (Klick & Stratmann, 2007).

Similarly, less invasive cardiac procedures are less likely to induce reductions in smoking rates

as compared with older and more intensive procedures (Margolis et al., 2014). HPV vaccination

can also cause moral hazard in low income adolescents as they are more likely to get involved in




                                                                                                    2
risky sexual behaviors in response to taking the HPV vaccine compared to those who have not

initiated the vaccine (Hill, 2014).

       In this study, we look at the behavioral response to the HPV vaccine. Specifically, we

look into the effect of vaccination on the decision to participate in Pap tests in the short run

(having a Pap test in the past 12 months). If vaccination leads to a reduction in participation in

Pap tests, it could potentially increase the incidence of cervical cancer. This should be of

concern to public health policy makers. The empirical evidence presented by Ferris et al. (2012)

shows that women are more receptive to getting the HPV vaccine when offered the choice of

longer Pap test intervals, and Pap test non-compliers are more likely to opt for the HPV vaccine

when a Pap test is required less frequently. A study in Australia showed that among women 25-

29 years of age, screening rates for those previously vaccinated were about ten percent lower

than for women who had not been vaccinated (Budd et al., 2014). Women who reported receipt

of the HPV vaccine are more likely than those not vaccinated to plan to receive a Pap test within

three years (Price et al., 2011). However, these findings might not be causal since women who

are more health conscious are also more likely to get vaccinated and to have a Pap test

administered. Moreover, intention to have a Pap test does not necessarily lead to having it done.

       This paper contributes to the literature by investigating the actual behavior (rather than

intention) of women having Pap tests after HPV vaccination. Moreover, it addresses an

econometric issue in the estimation of the effect of vaccination on participation in Pap tests:

namely that the decision to initiate the vaccine and the decision to participate in Pap tests are

determined simultaneously. There might be some unobserved factors that drive both decisions

thereby raising endogeneity issues, potentially leading to biased estimates. To deal with this

issue, we exploit the fact that the HPV vaccination is recommended for women younger than age




                                                                                                     3
26 years old, and that the probability of vaccination should change significantly around that age.

We use this cut-off point at recommended age to construct a fuzzy regression discontinuity to

identify more clearly the effect of the HPV vaccine on testing.

        The results indicate that vaccine initiation is positively associated with short-term

probability of participation in Pap tests even after controlling for potential endogeneity. This

might be the result of increased awareness that people acquire at the time of vaccination. The

estimates that ignore the potential endogeneity will result in under-estimating the true effect of

the vaccine initiation on the decision to participate in Pap tests.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows: the second section provides a background

on recommendations for Pap test and HPV vaccination. The third section describes the data and

methodology. The fourth section presents the results, while the fifth section analyses the

sensitivity of the results to different specifications. Finally, the sixth section concludes.



2. Background

        Participation in regular Pap tests has decreased the incidence and mortality rates of

cervical cancer in the past 40 years causing cervical cancer to no longer be the leading cause of

cancer death for women in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2013).

U.S. cervical cancer incidence rates and mortality rates decreased by 75% and 74%

(respectively) in the 50 years following the introduction of cervical cytology in 1949 (Howe et

al., 2006). The most successful strategy in cervical cancer prevention is population-based Pap-

smear screening programs. The introduction of screening programs in unscreened populations

can result in a 60-90% reduction in cervical cancer rates within three years after implementation

(Saslow et al., 2002).




                                                                                                     4
           Pap tests were recommended on an annual basis, for women in the 21 to 29 age group,

and once every two to three years for older women. In March 2012, the United States Preventive

Services Task Force published new cervical cancer screening guidelines which increased the

recommended screening intervals to once every three years in most circumstances (National

Cancer Institute, 2014).

           In March 2007, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) published its

recommendation for the HPV vaccine (Roblin et al., 2014). The HPV vaccine is recommended

for routine vaccination at the age of eleven or twelve. ACIP also recommends HPV vaccination

for females up to age 26 not vaccinated previously (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,

2010). 1 Vaccination was not initially recommended for women over the age, given that the

relatively older women were not included in early clinical trials for vaccines. As a result, the

FDA could not approve the vaccines for the older age group (American Cancer Society, 2014).

Although subsequent studies claimed that Gardasil could help protect women between the ages

of 27 and 45 against infection and disease from certain HPV types (Skinner et al., 2008). After

reviewing the data, the FDA concluded that the vaccine did not offer sufficient protective benefit

to these women to justify a change in the recommended age. While women 27 years of age are

legally allowed to get an HPV injection, they may do so only at their physician’s discretion.

Since this is considered off-label use, most health insurance plans would not cover it, suggesting

that both practice norms and costs act as barriers at this relatively late age. 2 The vast majority of

    ACIP also recommends the quadrivalent vaccine for boys ages eleven to twelve.

  The drug company wholesale price for either vaccine is around $130 or $140, and a full sequence of the vaccine
can cost around $390. Adding ancillary costs, this is a considerably expensive product that can significantly affect
the probability of vaccination for off-label users above the recommended age.



                                                                                                                       5
women get vaccinated prior to age 26; however, about 13% of women were older than 26 at the

time of their first injection. 3



3. Data and Methodology

        We use the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) for this study. The NHIS is a cross-

sectional household interview designed to collect information for monitoring the health of the

United States population. The core of the database contains four major components: Household,

Family, Sample Adult, and Sample Child. The Household component collects limited

demographic information on all the individuals living in a particular house. The Family

component verifies and collects additional demographic information on each member from each

family in the household and also collects information on health status, illness and injuries, and

access to healthcare and utilization. From each family in the NHIS, one sample adult and one

sample child are randomly selected and detailed health related information on each is collected.

The Sample Adult component of the NHIS contains information on Pap test screening history

and HPV vaccination. We use the Sample Adult database and use other components to match

socioeconomic information for each individual in the sample to construct our database. We

exclude the year 2008 from the analysis, since the vaccines were not approved for women older

than 26 years old until middle of that year. We also exclude year 2009 in which information

about vaccination and Pap tests is missing. The final sample consists of information from years

2010-2014.

        To estimate the effect of HPV vaccination on the decision to participate in Pap tests, we

begin by estimating:

3
  The National Household Interview Survey (NHIS) started collecting information about the age of respondent at the
first HPV "shot” only as of 2013. 87% of women had their first HPV shot at ages younger than 26 years old, and
13% had their first shot at ages older than 26.


                                                                                                                 6
                             stpapijt=f(α+ γj + δt +β1Xijt+β2∙(hpvijt)+εijt)             (1)

         We estimate this equation using a probit model. stpapijt represents whether a person had a

Pap test in the past 12 months (hereafter referred to as a short-run Pap test). 4 The variable hpv is

a dummy variable which is equal to one when a respondent has initiated the sequence of HPV

vaccination (dose≥1) in the past and otherwise zero. γj is a vector of census region dummy

variable that captures time-invariant factors that cause the outcomes to be different between

census regions 5. δt is a vector of year dummies that captures the variation in outcomes in

different years that are common among regions. Xijt is a vector of control covariates. It includes

controls for age, race, marital status, employment status, health insurance coverage status,

citizenship status, and whether a person has ever taken an HIV test. Table 1 presents the

definition and coding of each variable.

         It is important to point out that the decision to initiate the vaccine might be correlated

with some unobserved factors that can influence the decision to participate in Pap tests

simultaneously. Failing to control for the interdependence between these two decisions will lead

to biased and inconsistent estimates. The direction of the bias is unclear. For example, people

placing a higher value on health might seek both preventive options and treat them as

complements. On the other hand, it is possible that people with limited access to regular

healthcare might find the vaccination a more convenient method of protection that requires less

effort and fewer follow ups.

 The NHIS reports Pap test uptake consistently only for the past 12 months. Measures of Pap uptake over longer
look back periods are not collected for most years in our data. This restricts our statistical power to study the effect
of HPV vaccination on uptake of Pap test in the longer time spans.

 It includes dummies for West, Midwest, Northeast, and South census regions. State of residence is not identifiable
with the public use databases.


                                                                                                                           7
         A plausible strategy for identifying exogenous variation in HPV vaccine initiation is to

exploit the knowledge of the rules determining the treatment. In particular, the availability of a

known cut-off point in treatment assignment provides an opportunity to construct a regression

discontinuity design. In principle, regression discontinuity compares the average outcome for

units just left and right of the discontinuity point within a very small interval (bandwidth) around

the cut-off point. Increasing the interval around the cut-off point might result in biased estimates

of the treatment, specifically when the assignment variable is related to the outcome conditional

on treatment assignment. A more flexible variant of the model defines the probability of

treatment receipt as a function of one or more continuous assignment variables (van der Klaauw,

2008).

          CDC recommends the vaccine for women younger than 26 years old (Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). Therefore, one might expect the probability of

vaccination to be discontinuous at this cut-off point. We use this cut-off point to construct a

fuzzy regression discontinuity (RD) around this point. In a fuzzy design, treatment assignment

depends on k in a stochastic manner, but one in which the propensity of treatment (Pr (T=1|k)) is

                                       � (van der Klaauw, 2008). We use the discontinuity as an
again known to have a discontinuity at 𝐾

instrumental variable for treatment status. This new estimate can be summarized by a bivariate

probit model as follows:



         hpvijt= 1(α + α1 Ki +α2 (coveredi) +α3 (Ki*coveredi) +α4 (Xijt)+ γj +δt + uijt >0) 2(a)

         stpapijt= 1(φ + φ1 Ki+ φ2 (Ki*coveredi) + φ3 (Xijt)+φ4 (hpvijt) + θj+ τt+ εijt >0)   2(b)

                                       ε           0  1 ρ  
                                         | Z  N  ,       
                                       u         0  ρ 1




                                                                                                     8
In equations 2(a) and 2(b), γj and θj are census region dummies, and δt and τt are year dummies.

We normalize age at the cut-off point by defining variable Ki=age-ci, where ci is the cut-off

point, and age is shifted so that the discontinuity occurs at Ki=0 (Ki is the running variable). The

validity of the RD estimates depends on whether the polynomial order of the running variable

provides an adequate description of the treatment variable (Angrist & Pischke, 2009). 6 We allow

the relationship between the outcomes in equations 2(a) and 2(b) and Ki to have different slopes

on either side of the discontinuity. The variable coveredi is a dummy variable that is equal to one

if Ki<0 (person is in the recommended age of vaccination) and zero otherwise. The remaining

variables are defined as in equation 1. The results from the fuzzy regression discontinuity design

can be interpreted as a local estimator in two ways. First, because it requires limiting the sample

to a subset of the population near the cut-off point, the treatment effect can only be identified for

the sub-population around that point. Second, in this neighborhood, the treatment effect is only

identified for the compliers, namely those would either initiate the vaccination if they are in the

covered age group, or would not initiate the vaccination otherwise (Imbens & Lemieux, 2008).

As long as the order of polynomial in the running variable and data bandwidth around the cutoff

point are the same for the first and second stage outcomes, estimation of φ4 in equation 2(b) is

identical to an instrumental variable approach. 7

         As previously noted, the ACIP recommendation for HPV vaccination published in March

2007 stated that the vaccine should be delivered for routine vaccination for females aged eleven


6
 The optimal polynomial order is determined informally by visualizing the unadjusted relationship between running
variable and the vaccine initiation status. As a robustness check, we allow equations 2(a) and 2(b) to have different
polynomial orders.
7
  In theory, 2-stage least squares (2SLS) should yield similar results as the bivariate probit; however, given its
properties, the 2SLS is likely to yield biased estimates in small samples. Since we need to restrict our analysis
sample to a narrow bandwidth around the cut-off point, we did not opt for this model. Moreover, non-linear models
fit these data better.



                                                                                                                     9
and twelve, and for women up to age 26 not previously vaccinated. HPV vaccine is delivered in

three doses over the course of six months, and as a result, respondents who were younger than 26

in September 2007 (younger than 25.5 years of age at the time of the recommendation) fall into

the recommended age group. We compare this group to those individuals who turned 27 by

March 2007. 8 In our main analysis, we restrict the sample to 1.5 years on either side of the cut-

off points.

        This approach explicitly models endogeneity through the correlation parameter ρ between

ε and u, and it indicates endogeneity when it is different from zero. Note that Z is the vector of

discontinuity and exogenous variables. We impose bivariate normal distribution on the error

term following Greene (2007). We restrict the sample to an interval of 1.5 years before and after

the cut-off point in order to have a small interval around the cut-off point with a sufficiently

large number of observations. There is a visible discontinuity in the probability of vaccination

around the cut-off point.

        The variable stpap is a dummy variable which is equal to one when a person had a Pap

test in the past 12 months, and zero otherwise. The variable hpv is equal to one when a person

had at least one dose of HPV vaccine anytime in the past, and zero otherwise. Our identification

strategy is based on comparing women who were 24-25.5 years old in March 2007 (issuance date

of the HPV vaccine guidelines) to women who were in the 27-28.5 age range at that point in

time. We chose our study period so that the youngest women in our study are 27 (24 in March

2007) by the time of the first survey (year 2010), while the oldest are 35.5 (28.5 in March 2007)

in the last survey (year 2014). Given the fact that the vast majority of women vaccinated, about


8
 The original recommendation by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) implied that women one day after their
26th birthday are excluded from the recommended age group. However, some insurance plans may provide coverage
for the vaccine up to the day prior to the start of the 27th birthday. Given the lack of clarity in this range, we
excluded all women ages 26 plus 1 day to 27 from the discontinuity analysis


                                                                                                               10
87% (see footnote 3) do so prior to age 26, it is safe to assume that the majority of women in our

sample were vaccinated more than a year before this survey, and by default, years before

subsequent survey years in our data which end in 2014. Thus, the twelve-month survey look-

back period for the Pap test is not an issue.

       Table 2 presents the summary statistics in our final sample for women who were in the

recommended age group at the time of the recommendation (March 2007), versus those who

were not in the recommended age group at the time. The percent of women who had a Pap test in

the past 12 months and of women who initiated and completed HPV vaccination is significantly

higher among those who were in the recommended age group at the time of the recommendation.

Among control covariates, there is one noteworthy item, namely that the share of women with

health insurance is significantly higher among those who were not in the recommended age

group at the time of the recommendation.



4. Results

       We begin by investigating the validity of the RD design graphically. Figure 1 shows the

local quadratic regressions of covariates on the running variable. No visible discontinuity is

observed around the cut-off point. Figure 2 shows the discontinuity in the treatment variable at

the cut-off point. There is a visible discontinuity in the probability of vaccination around the cut-

off points. It indicates that people are more likely to get vaccinated if they are in the

recommended age group.

       Table 3 presents the results from the baseline regression (equation 1) as well as the RD

design. The first column presents the marginal effects from the probit model without taking




                                                                                                   11
potential endogeneity into account. The next two columns present the marginal effects from the

regression discontinuity framework along with the results from the first stage.

        HPV vaccine initiation increases the probability of having a Pap test in the short run. We

find a negative bias in those estimates that ignore the endogeneity. Initiating the vaccine can

increase the probability of having a Pap test by 52 percentage points. This positive association

might be due to an increased awareness of the existence of the test happening at the time of

vaccination. Note that ρ captures the potential correlation between unobservables that determines

vaccine initiation and having a Pap test simultaneously -- ρ is negative and statistically

significant.

        Although we initially have a limited number of observations in Table 3 (assumptions are

relaxed in a subsequent table), the point estimates for the instrumental variable have the expected

sign indicating that being in the recommended age group increases the probability of vaccine

initiation significantly. We also report the F-statistics for the excluded IV from the first stage in

order to provide a measure to test for weak identification. The excluded IV has an acceptable F-

statistic of around 11.

        Other results in Table 3 also indicate that having any kind of health insurance can

increase the probability of having a Pap test and initiating the HPV vaccination. The point

estimates for income are also positive for both probit, and bivariate probit model, but only

statistically significant at 10% level for the bivariate probit model. An HIV test is also positively

correlated with both having a Pap test and initiating the HPV vaccine in all the specifications. If

an individual needs to be tested for a sexually transmitted disease, it is more likely for that

person to take precautionary measures for other STDs. 9

            Altogether, we do not find any evidence of ex-ante moral hazard; to the contrary, we find

a positive association between getting vaccinated and having a Pap test in the past year. This is

despite the fact that the recommendation for HPV vaccination was changed to every three years

rather than annually. Note that reducing the frequency of recommended testing in the new

guidelines implies that the estimated moral hazard effect is downward biased; that is, longer

intervals between tests lower the probability of utilizing the routine preventive care in the later

years independently of any behavioral effects. However, the guidelines can also have an opposite

effect by reducing the (opportunity) cost of routine testing. 10 To address this, we perform

separately, analyses for the periods between 2010-2012 and 2013-2014 as well as the pooled

sample. The parameter estimates of HPV were stable across the two sub-samples. In the 2013-

2014 period, the estimated coefficient falls short of statistical significance at the conventional

levels (P-value=0.12) and the F-stat from the first stage is lower. We attribute the loss of power

to sample attrition (n= 1,829 in the 2013-14, compared with n=3,832 in the pooled data) and to

  To see this, we modify the expected utility framework in Ehrlich and Becker (1972) and Dave and Kaestner

the fact that the proportion of women above recommended age group who got vaccinated grew

over time. Given the stability of the relevant parameters over time, we opted to report results

from the pooled sample only. However, the full set of results is available upon request.

         Increased participation in Pap tests after HPV vaccination might be due to an increased

awareness at the time of vaccination. Despite findings from clinical trials that found the vaccine

to be safe and effective, perceived safety vaccine was low (Brewer & Fazekas, 2007). There

were some rumors on the internet that claimed HPV vaccination increases the risk of

precancerous lesions if a person had already been exposed to HPV 16, and 18 prior to

vaccination. 11 As a result, a person might decide to have a Pap test after vaccination to avoid any

possible adverse outcomes. Moreover, long term safety records of the vaccine were unknown at

the time the recommendation was published. This might have led physicians to continue

recommending Pap tests to their patient even around the time of vaccination.

         It is important to point out that regression discontinuity results can be interpreted as the

local average treatment effect only for the sub-population near the cut-off point. Fuzzy

regression discontinuity restricts the sub-population even further to that of compliers at this value

of the covariate. Generalizing the results as population average treatment effect requires strong

assumptions justifying extrapolation to other sub-populations (Imbens & Wooldridge, 2007a).

We explore a variety of assumptions and their effects in the next section.



5. Sensitivity Analysis

         We found that the age recommendation for the HPV vaccine caused a discontinuity in the

probability of HPV vaccination. To verify that this association was not spurious, our first


11
  For example, see: http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/07/20/does-gardasil-actually-increase-
your-risk-of-cervical-cancer.aspx


                                                                                                                     14
robustness check was to repeat the analysis using a common vaccine for which guidelines in the

cervical cancer setting should not be relevant. We identified the flu vaccine as such a case;

additionally, the flu vaccine is recommended annually at all ages. Thus, we did not anticipate any

difference in the probability of this particular vaccine on either side of the cutoff. We ran a probit

model of having a flu vaccination in the past year on the explanatory variables and discontinuity

dummy. The estimated coefficient was small and highly insignificant; suggesting the observed

difference in the probability of HPV vaccination is truly associated with the recommendation. 12

         Next, we investigate how sensitive the parametric estimates are to alternative and more

flexible specifications. To implement this, we added different combinations of polynomial orders

of running variables to the Pap test and the HPV vaccine initiation equations (van der Klaauw,

2008). In Table 4, we report the estimates of HPV vaccine initiation from the bivariate probit

framework, as well as the coefficients of the discontinuity variable, the correlation parameter ρ,

and the F-stat from the first stage. The results are firmly consistent with the previous findings

indicating that the HPV vaccine initiation will increase the probability of the short-run Pap test.

         In another set of robustness checks we alter the bandwidth around the cut-off point. A

smaller interval will decrease the risk of misspecification bias, but it necessarily comes with a

loss in efficiency as sample size declines. Panel A of Table 5 presents the results from using

intervals shorter or longer than our base case of 1.5 years above or below the cut-off point. The

estimated coefficients of HPV initiation remain positive in all the specifications, and relatively

stable in magnitude. Moreover, the results are statistically significant in all cases, with the

exception of the case off the narrowest bandwidth (0.5 years) where the sample size is the


12
  We ran a probit model fluijt= 1(α + α1 Ki +α2 (coveredi) +α3 (Ki*coveredi) +α4 (Xijt)+ γj +δt + uijt >0), where flu is a
dummy variable which is equal to one if a person had a flu shot in the past 12 months, and zero otherwise. As
expected, the marginal effect of the discontinuity variable (α2) in this model was negligible and statistically
insignificant, (α2 = 0.005, P value=0.845). All other coefficients were similar to the HPV model.


                                                                                                                       15
smallest. Taken together, the results from the sensitivity analysis are consistent with our main

findings; they do not provide any evidence of moral hazard.

       Finally, to test the sensitivity of our results to the distributional assumptions in the

bivariate probit model, we reran our analysis using a two-stage residual inclusion, that is

appropriate for non-linear outcomes yet that imposes far fewer distributional assumptions.

Noting that our endogenous variable is binary (HPV vaccine uptake), estimating the residuals

from the first stage is more complicated than in the case of a continuous variable. We closely

followed Imbens and Wooldridge (2007b) to construct generalized residuals. In the first stage,

we estimated a probit model of vaccine initiation on the explanatory variables and excluded

instruments (discontinuity). We then calculated generalized error based on the formula below:



                                    � ijt)/ɸ (ℎ𝑝𝑣
    Generalized error= (hpvijt)*[φ(ℎ𝑝𝑣         � ijt))]-(1-hpvijt)* [φ(−ℎ𝑝𝑣
                                                                       � ijt)/ɸ (−ℎ𝑝𝑣
                                                                                 � ijt))] (3)



       φ is the pdf of a standard normal variable, and ɸ is the cdf of standard normal

distribution. In the second stage, we ran a probit model for having Pap test in the past 12 months

on a set of explanatory variables, hpv vaccine initiation, and generalized error estimated from the

first stage. The results are reported in the first column of panel B of Table 5. We restrict the

sample to 1.5 years around the cut-off point, as in our main analysis. The results are very similar

to those we obtained from the bivariate probit model.

       We also use the second definition of HPV vaccine uptake, namely for those who

completed the entire sequence of vaccination (three or more HPV injections). Clearly, at any

given time, there are fewer people who finish the full course of vaccination in comparison with

those who initiated it, resulting in a smaller variation in the endogenous variable. However, it is




                                                                                                   16
conceivable that the perceived risk may be different among those who complete the full regimen

of the vaccine in comparison with those who do not complete it. To explore this issue, we use the

framework in equation 2, with the baseline 1.5-year bandwidth on either side of the cut-off point.

These results are added to Panel B of Table 5. The estimated coefficient for vaccine completion

on HPV vaccine is positive, comparable in magnitude to that found in our main analyses, and

economically meaningful; however, it was not statistically significant (P-value=0.16). We

attribute the lack of significance in this result to the limited variation in our endogenous

regressor. 13



6. Conclusion

     We posit that vaccination can influence risk perception in people who receive a vaccine,

causing them to reduce preventive efforts against related disease, thereby exhibiting ex-ante

moral hazard. In this study, we specifically look at the behavioral response to HPV vaccination

in terms of participation in Pap tests. Although HPV vaccination can protect against certain

types of HPV and thereby reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, the protection granted by the

vaccine is partial and it is not considered a perfect substitute for diagnostic screening using the

Pap test.

         Empirically, we exploit the established age-specific guidelines for receiving the vaccine

to construct a regression discontinuity design for the Pap test decision. Because the cut-off point

at the recommended age it non-deterministic (women are able to choose vaccination rather than

being assigned to it), we opt for the fuzzy discontinuity design, rather than it’s more commonly

used “sharp” counterpart. Accordingly, we simultaneously account for both the vaccine and test


13
  Restricting the sample to the 1.5 year intervals around the cut-off point yielded 344 people who initiated the
vaccination, but only 161 people who completed the full course.


                                                                                                                   17
probabilities. Note that the validity of regression discontinuity results requires that on any given

treatment level (vaccinated or not vaccinated), the relationship between the outcome (Pap test)

and the running variable (age) be locally continuous. This assumption might be violated when

there is a possibility of misreporting in the running variable; however age is unlikely to pose this

problem.

       Due to the sample size available to us in the 2010-2014 NHIS data for young adult

females, we opted for a relatively wide bandwidth around the cut-off age for the vaccine.

However, in sensitivity analyses with narrower bandwidth s, trading off smaller samples for a

more clearly specified quasi-experiment, yielded similar results; our results were similarly robust

to variety of specifications test. This lends greater confidence in our overall finding.

Combined, our results provide no evidence of ex-ante moral hazard. Rather, we find that

individuals who were in the recommended age group at the time the recommendation went into

effect were more likely to receive an HPV vaccine compared to those who were not in the

recommended age group (about seven percentage point), and those who had vaccinated were

more likely to have a Pap test in the past twelve months (about 52 percentage points). We noted

results from regression discontinuity models may not be generalized for the entire population,

but they provide a valid interpretation as local average treatment effects around the cut-off point.

We speculate that having the vaccine causes patients to have more interactions with health care

systems around cervical cancer prevention, thereby increasing awareness of the need for

continued vigilance. This may be the subject of further behavioral research.
