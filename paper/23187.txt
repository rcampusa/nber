If scientific knowledge is a public good, why do firms invest in research? This paper revisits this
classic question with new data on patent citations to scientific publications by corporations. Using
data on 4,736 firms for the period 1980-2006, we document that corporate investment in research
is closely related to its use in internal invention. Specifically, firms that build on their scientific
research in their inventive activity invest more in research than those that are less successful in
using their research internally. Consistent with this, research that is internally used is valued more
and is more productive. Our results are consistent with the view that to justify further investment
in research corporate scientists need to demonstrate that their recent scientific work is useful for
the core inventive activity of the sponsoring firm.

1       Introduction

Corporate investment in scienti…c knowledge has always been a puzzle. It is substantial in magnitude and

the available evidence suggests it is privately pro…table, and yet, we do not fully understand how …rms

derive value from producing what is essentially a public good. In 2015, the business sector performed

nearly 26% of all basic research in the United States and funded a similar share (NSF 2017)1 . In absolute

terms, the business sector invested over $22 billion in basic research, a substantial amount. While evidence

on the pro…tability of such investments is scarce, studies based on data from the 1960s and 1970s suggest

that private returns are substantial. In particular, Zvi Griliches (1986), based on a sample of 883 large

share.

manufacturing …rms in the United States, concluded that investment in basic research was associated

with higher productivity and pro…ts, implying a signi…cant private returns to basic research. Yet, the

mechanism by which these private returns accrue remains unclear once the knowledge produced is made

publicly available in the form of patents and scienti…c publications.

       Over the last quarter century, a variety of explanations have been put forward. These explanations

focused on absorptive capacity to use external knowledge (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989; Rosenberg, 1990;

Gambardella, 1992), enhancing reputation to attract investors and costumers (Hicks, 1995) and incentives

for high-skilled scientist-inventors (Audretsch and Stephan, 1996; Stern, 2004; Gambardella et al., 2015).

The various explanations are not mutually exclusive, but can have very di¤erent normative and positive

implications (section 2 discusses these in more detail).

       In this paper, we explore the empirical basis for a di¤erent explanation, namely that ". . . most of

the actual research in industry is devoted to the development of new products or processes" (Griliches,

1986:145)2 . We use newly developed data linking patents to scienti…c publications matched to …rms to

investigate the extent to which …rms invest in research as an input into their own inventions. We measure

corporate research by scienti…c papers authored by researchers employed by …rms. We measure the use of

research as inputs into inventive activity by citations in the …rm’s patents to its own scienti…c publications.

Spillovers are measured by citations in the patents of other …rms to the focal …rm’s scienti…c publications.

We …nd that …rms produce more scienti…c knowledge when they are able to use it in their own inventions,

but spillovers to product market rivals are associated with lower scienti…c production. Our estimates

indicate that the positive e¤ect of one internal citation on the number of future publications produced

by the focal …rm is equivalent to the combined negative e¤ect of four external citations. Thus, while

spillovers might cause …rms to underinvest in research, …rms would still invest in research if they are able

to use it internally.

       Our principal contribution is to document that corporate production of scienti…c knowledge is closely

related to its use in internal invention. We examine both the determinant of progress of science and
   2
     The modern innovation literature has tended to con‡ate research and development. The older innovation literature was
much more careful in distinguishing between the two. Nelson (1959) was among the …rst to examine incentives to invest
in research as opposed to development. Using publications data, Adams (1990) …nds that scienti…c knowledge absorbed by
…rms is associated with higher productivity growth. Simon Kuznets, in his 1971 Nobel Prize Lecture concluded that "Mass
application of technological innovations, which constitutes much of the distinctive substance of modern economic growth, is
closely connected with the further progress of science, in its turn the basis for additional advance in technology ".


                                                            2
its application in development at the …rm level. Our main methodological contribution is to match

publication records from Web of Science (WoS) to front-page non-patent literature (NPL) references on a

large scale. While previous research using patent citation data was mostly done for selected industries and

years (e.g., Narin and Noma, 1985; Narin et al., 1997; McMillan et al., 2000; Hicks et al., 2001; Breschi

and Catalini, 2010; Bikard, 2015; Popp, 2016), our research examines a broad range of companies across

many industries over a quarter of a century. Our primary …rm sample consists of 4,736 U.S. headquartered

publicly listed, R&D-performing companies over the period 1980-2006. Collectively, these …rms account

for approximately 300 thousand corporate scienti…c publications over the sample period, of which 50,494

publications are cited at least once by patents granted up to 2014.

   We present three main …ndings. First, we validate that our measure of patent citation to science

corresponds to the use of science in invention. Using data from the Carnegie Mellon Survey of R&D

performing …rms (Cohen et al., 2000), we show that …rms whose patents cite science are also those

that report using scienti…c output in their R&D projects. This relationship continues to hold at a …ner

measurement scale such as relating citations to use in speci…c technology areas.

   Second, we demonstrate a strong positive relationship between corporate investment in research and

internal use of past research in invention. Firms invest more in research when the scienti…c knowledge

they produce is cited in their patents. This relationship is stronger for new, basic, high quality cited

research and for citing patents in core technology areas of the inventing …rm. We supplement these

…ndings by showing that internal use is associated with a higher R&D productivity and a higher stock

market valuation of scienti…c publications stock.

   Third, consistent with the view that research is an input into internal inventive activity, we …nd that

…rms produce fewer publications when their research spills over to close product market rivals and that

these spillovers are negatively related to the private value of research. These patterns are inconsistent with

the view that …rms invest in research principally to absorb external knowledge. This is also inconsistent

with …rm’s investing in research principally to attract talented workers or to signal to customers or

regulators.

   The …rm behavior we analyze, namely the production and use of scienti…c knowledge by pro…t seeking

companies, is complex. We are well aware that both the production and use of research are potentially


                                                      3
a¤ected by common variables, some of which are unobserved and are likely to vary across …rms and

industries. We probe the robustness of our results by using …rm-…xed e¤ects and by directly measur-

ing organizational features that should help …rms use internally the science they produce. We present

instrumental variable estimates that are based on variation across states over time in the application

of the Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine. This doctrine restricts scientists and inventors’mobility between

companies, leading to a higher use of research in invention through a tighter link between research and

development personnel.

        The rest of the paper is organized as following. Section 2 discusses related literature, Section 3 presents

the data and empirical methodology, Section 4 presents the estimation results and Section 5 concludes.


2        Related literature

American industrial research activity typically takes place inside corporate research labs. These labs were

initially established with only modest goals. In the late 19th century, …rms in technology intensive sectors

such as railroads, steel, and telegraphy relied largely on external inventions. These …rms established

industrial labs to evaluate the quality of inputs, such as the quality of steel for rails (Mowery, 1995;

Carlson, 2013). Thereafter, in the early 20th century, …rms such as AT&T, GE and DuPont invested in

internal research to solve production problems and evaluate and adapt inventions acquired from other

…rms (Reich, 1985; Hounshell and Smith, 1988). Corporate investment in research became more signi…cant

during the inter-war years, as corporations grew larger and more anxious to manage innovation instead

of having to rely on external inventions (Maclaurin, 1953). Stronger anti-trust enforcement provided an

additional impetus as some farsighted managers saw in research a source of new products to fuel growth

without running afoul of the anti-trust authorities.

        The importance of discoveries such as vacuum tubes, radar, radio, synthetic rubber, nuclear …ssion,

and penicillin in the conduct of World War II led to a deeper appreciation of the potential economic

usefulness of research. The simplest view of the role of research in innovation was the so-called "linear

model" associated with Bush (1945), who asserted that technical progress rests upon scienti…c advance;

that inventions grew out of research3 . This view was modi…ed and enriched in a variety of ways (Kline
    3
        In Vannevar Bush’s own words: "Basic research leads to new knowledge. It provides scienti…c capital. It creates the fund



                                                                 4
and Rosenberg, 1986; David, Mowery and Steinmueller, 1992). However, the underlying notion that

"...most of the actual research in industry is devoted to the development of new products or processes..."

(Griliches, 1986: 145) remained in place. In a seminal study, Griliches estimated the private return to

research using the National Science Foundation (NSF) R&D-Census match, containing information on

R&D expenditures, sales and employment for approximately 1000 largest manufacturing …rms from 1957

through 1977. He estimated a Cobb-Douglas production function, including basic research as a fraction

of total R&D in addition to R&D stock, labor and capital and found a very large return to basic research.

Firms that spent a larger share of R&D on basic research were substantially more productive.4

    While Griliches’s work demonstrated the presence of signi…cant private returns to research, the mech-

anism by which these private returns accrue remained unclear. Since the results of basic research were

typically published and shared (e.g., Dasgupta and David, 1994), this raised the question of how …rms

were bene…ting from their investment in research and why should they invest themselves rather than

"free-ride" on the research of others (Arrow, 1962; Nelson 1959). Contributing to this puzzle was the

absence of a serious attempt to explore empirically the extent to which …rms invest in science to spur their

own downstream inventions. This puzzle led to new explanations for why …rms invest in research includ-

ing absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1989; Rosenberg, 1990; Gambardella, 1992), incentives for

high-skilled scientist-inventors (Audretsch and Stephan, 1996; Stern, 2004; Gambardella et al., 2015) and

enhancing reputation to attract investors and costumers (Hicks, 1995). The various explanations are not

mutually exclusive, but can have very di¤erent normative and positive implications.

    Cohen and Levinthal (1989) challenged the public good nature of research, arguing that accessing

outside knowledge is costly and requires absorptive capacity, which in turn requires that …rms engage in

R&D. Rosenberg (1990) also challenged the idea that existing knowledge, though in the public domain,

was "on the shelf", available to all. Instead, he argued that …nding, evaluating, and using publicly avail-

able knowledge itself presupposed some prior knowledge. He claimed therefore that …rms invest in research

because, in part, basic research helps the company stay up-to-date and identify scienti…c developments
from which the practical applications of knowledge must be drawn. New products and new processes do not appear full-grown.
They are founded on new principles and new conceptions, which in turn are painstakingly developed by research in the purest
realms of science." (p. 241).

     Mans…eld (1980) found that investment in basic research was related to productivity growth in U.S. manufacturing
industries in the period 1948-66, controlling for applied research and development.

in its …eld as well as more easily absorb external knowledge while …tting it to its own needs (Rosenberg

1990). A vast literature has found evidence consistent with absorptive capacity. Using survey data, Levin

et al. (1987) …nd that independent R&D is most e¤ective for learning about rivals’ technology. Gam-

bardella (1992) shows that pharmaceutical …rms with better research capabilities, measured by number

of publications, are able to exploit internal as well as external science more e¤ectively.

    Using data from the pharmaceuticals industry, Cockburn and Henderson (1998) argue that to take ad-

vantage of public research …rms must develop internal basic research programs as a platform of interacting

with public sector researchers. Several studies examined the role of corporate publications in attracting

talented scientist-inventors. Hicks (1995) argues that companies invest is research because publications

are an e¤ective tool to recruit scientists5 . Henderson and Cockburn (1994) emphasize the importance of

publications as a reward system. Examining research programs of major pharmaceutical …rms they …nd

that scientists that are promoted on the basis of their publications and reputation in the wider scienti…c

community generate more important patents. Some researchers may have a "taste for science" i.e., may

be willing to accept industrial positions if allowed to spend some time on their own research and to publish

it. Stern (2004) …nds that scientists may be willing to accept 20% lower wages in exchange for autonomy,

such as time for conducting and publishing independent research. Using survey data on PhD industrial

scientists, Sauermann and Cohen (2010) study the relationship between industrial scientists’motives and

their innovation activities. They …nd that intellectual challenge and independence have the strongest

(positive) relationship with innovation output, especially in upstream research activities. Gambardella et

al. (2015) argue that DuPont’s invention of Nylon is the result of o¤ering the young Harvard scientist

Wallace Carothers the opportunity to publish his independent research. Gans et al. (2013) develop a

theoretical model in which …rms allow researchers to publish in return to lower wages as long as patents

can be used to prevent the disclosed knowledge from bene…ting rivals. It is worth noting that while

demonstrating that performing research and producing scienti…c articles play an important motivating

role for attracting scientists, it remains unclear why …rms wish to attract scientists in the …rst place.

Moreover, if performing research is merely a reward instrument, whether research is used in invention
   5
     Cockburn and Henderson (1998) conclude that participation in research "acts as a powerful recruiting tool, since the
highest quality scientists in a …eld are often reluctant to work for private …rms if they will not be able to publish and thus
maintain their personal scienti…c reputation".

should not in‡uence investment decisions.

   Basic research can also bene…t the sponsoring …rm by allowing it to signal its scienti…c and tech-

nical capabilities to regulators, prospective customers, employees, or …nanciers (Hicks, 1995; Audretsch

and Stephan, 1996; Azoulay, 2002). Lichtenberg (1986) shows that through investment in research,

…rms can signal their capabilities to attract government contracts. Based on Compustat …rm data and

defense-related federal procurement data he …nds that approximately half of the increase in private R&D

investment between 1979 and 1984 was stimulated by increase in government demand. Audretsch and

Stephan (1996) suggest that collaborative research with university scientists helps biotech …rms signal

their quality to investors. Azoulay (2002) …nds that prescriptions for anti-ulcer drugs are in‡uenced by

publications activity by drug manufacturers. Hicks (1995) suggests that scienti…c publications serve as

a signal of the …rm’s tacit knowledge and capabilities and thus enhance the technical reputation of the

…rm. She emphasizes that by publishing in open science …rms establish a trustworthy reputation with the

academic and scienti…c community, which helps them in turn trade information with these communities.

   The various explanations for why …rms invest in research predict that invention productivity would

be higher in …rms that invest in research. For instance, insofar as the …rm invests in research to attract

talented inventors, one would also expect that talented inventors publish scienti…c articles, and for in-

vention productivity to be higher in such …rms. The absorptive capacity view has similar predictions if

one makes the auxiliary assumption that inventors that are active in research are better able to absorb

external knowledge, and hence, are more productive. What is distinctive is whether the coupling between

research and invention is based on the use of internally generated knowledge in the sponsoring …rm’s own

inventions.

   There are two related implications of this distinction that can be empirically tested. If corporate

research is principally about building reputation capital with regulators, customers, or others, it should

be more e¤ective in doing so when others build upon it and cite it. In other words, spillovers should

enhance the e¢ cacy of the signal and internal use would merely be a welcome bonus. If, however,

corporate research is primarily about producing more and higher quality inventions internally, spillovers,

particularly to rivals, should lower private return and reduce the incentives to invest in research. In such

case, the …rm’s incentives to invest are directly tied to whether its own inventors build upon the internally


                                                     7
generated research. To test this, in our empirical analysis we examine how a company’s publication activity

is related to the use of internally generated knowledge in its own inventions as well as to the use by others

including its rivals in the product market.


3    Data

We combine data from three main sources: (i) company and accounting information from U.S. Com-

pustat, (ii) scienti…c publications from Web of Science and (iii) patent and non-patent literature (NPL)

citation from PatStat database. Building on Arora et al. (2015), we develop new data linking corporate

publications to NPL citations to learn about the use of corporate science in invention and its implications

for corporate investment in research, R&D productivity and stock market value.

    We start with all publicly traded …rms in the U.S. annual Compustat database and select companies

with active records and positive R&D expenses for at least one year during our sample period, 1980-2006.

We exclude companies without at least one patent based on the NBER 2006 patent dataset. We also

exclude …rms that are not headquartered in the United States. Our …nal estimation sample consists of

an unbalanced panel of 4,736 …rms and 57,765 …rm-year observations. Of those …rms, 2,413 have at least

one scienti…c publication during the sample period.

    We use scienti…c publications as our measure of production of new scienti…c knowledge and patents as

our measure of inventive activity. We treat a citation by a patent to a corporate publication as an indicator

that the patented invention used or built upon the knowledge in the publication. Internal citation is a

citation by a patent to a scienti…c publication produced by the same …rm.

    Corporate publications. Similar to the method discussed in Arora et al. (2015), to measure …rms’

participation in scienti…c research we match our sample …rms to the Web of Science (WoS) database, which

covers articles published in over 5000 journals. We include articles from journals covered in the "Science

Citation Index" and "Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science", excluding social sciences, arts

and humanities articles. Using the a¢ liation …eld, we identify approximately 300 thousand articles with

at least one author employed by our sample of Compustat …rms, published from 1980 through 2006.

Appendix 6.2 provides details on the matching procedure.

    Patent citation to corporate science. The main methodological contribution of this paper is


                                                      8
matching NPL citations to WoS publications. Using all patents granted in the period 1980-2014, we

perform a many-to-many match between NPL citations and WoS corporate publications (approximately 14

million citations matched to 300 thousand corporate publications), allowing for more than one publication

to be matched to each citation. To exclude mismatches, we develop a specialized matching algorithm

that is based on di¤erent sources of publication information: standardized authors’ names, number of

authors listed, article title, journal name and year of publication. The matching algorithm accounts

for misspelling, unstructured text, incomplete references, and other issues that may cause mismatches.6

Finally, we perform extensive manual checks to con…rm matches. Details on the matching algorithm are

provided in Appendix 6.4.

      Following the above procedures, we obtain 266,361 patent citations to 50,494 corporate publications

(17% of corporate publications), by 151,412 citing patents. Of the cited publications, 79% receive only

external citations and the remaining receive at least one internal citation.

      Ownership structure. Due to the complexity of measuring large …rms’innovative activities, which

typically take place inside numerous subsidiaries (Arora et al., 2014), we aggregate the data to the

ultimate-owner-parent-company level (UO). For example, if a …rm’s subsidiary publishes scienti…c articles

while the parent company is the assignee registered on the …rm’s patents, we record both at the UO level

and a citation from a patent to a publication would be considered as an internal citation.

      The construction of the …rm dataset presents several challenges. For instance, a parent company

and a subsidiary may have di¤erent identi…cation numbers and records in Compustat. Furthermore, a

single company may correspond to multiple …rm identi…ers due to changes in ownership structure and

accounting changes over the sample period. We detail the challenges of constructing the dataset and the

procedures we take to deal with them in Appendix 6.1.

Our main sample and variables are at the parent company-year level. Appendix Table A1 summarizes the

for publishing …rms. A total of 2,413 …rms (51 percent of our sample …rms) publish at least one scienti…c

article. 799 …rms receive at least one citation to their publications (an average of 1 internal and 7 external

citations per year), 388 …rms make at least one citation to their own scienti…c publications (an average

of 1 unique …rm publication cited per year) and 760 …rms receive at least one external citation to their

publication (an average of 6 unique patents citing a …rm’s publications per year).

       Table 3 presents mean comparison tests for di¤erences in characteristics between …rms with high and

low internal citations for the sample of publishing …rms with at least one citation. Firms with above mean

value share of internal citation (de…ned as the ratio of internal citations received and the sum of internal

and external citations received) have statistically signi…cant higher (i) number of publications, (ii) R&D

intensity and (iii) inventor-author overlap, where higher overlap indicates a stronger tie between research

and development personnel, measured as the share of patents that list at least one scientist (publication

author) as an inventor.78

3.2      Validating patent citations to scienti…c articles as a measure of use of science in
         invention

To validate our measure of use of science–NPL citation to WoS articles– we utilize the Carnegie Mellon

Survey (CMS) data on industrial R&D (Cohen et al., 2000).9 Our sample includes 772 patenting …rms

that were included in the survey with patents granted between 1991 and 1999 (a total of 29,318 patents).

Figures 1A-1C present the relationship between patent citations to science and the survey answers per-

taining to the role of science in corporate R&D. There is a strong correlation between the average number

of patent citations to science made by the surveyed …rms’patents and the responses of the same …rms to

      This measure is further discussed in section 4.2.1 as part of our instrumental variable analysis.

      Appendix Table A3 presents a mean comparison test between patents that cite internal science and patents that do not
cite internal science. We …nd that patents that cite internal science are of statistically signi…cant higher quality (based on
forward patent citation received) and are in the core technology of the …rm (core de…ned as the four-digit IPC that has the
majority of …rm patents in a given year).

         Figures 1A and 1B present mean comparisons for the average number of patent citations to publications

for …rms with high and low survey response for the use of public science in R&D projects.10 Classi…cation

to high and low is based on median value survey response. The …gures show that …rms with high

self-reported use of science also cite more public science (publications by all universities and research

institutions, Figure 1A) and articles publications by top 200 American universities (Figure 1B).1112 Figure

1C shows that the relationship between self-reported use of science and citations to science holds also

within narrowly de…ned technology areas.13 The …gure shows that there is a tight correspondence between

the speci…c scienti…c areas the …rm reports to have in‡uenced its R&D projects and the research areas

cited by its patents.

         Table 4 con…rms that the above correlations continue to hold in a regression analysis that controls for

…rm size, number of backward patent citations to other patents (to ensure that the e¤ect of NPL citations

is not driven by how many backward citations the patent makes), and complete sets of four-digit industry

and year dummies.

4         Econometric analysis
4.1        Internal citation and publication output

We estimate the relationship between internal use of research, measured by patent citations to internally

produced science, and investment in research, measured by numbers of publications authored by at least

one corporate scientist. Our baseline speci…cation is as follows:
    10
      Based on 1994 CMS data Q.18: "During the last three years, what percentage of your R&D unit’s projects made use of
the following research outputs produced by universities or government research institutes and labs?: a. Research …ndings".
   11
      Top university publications were identi…ed by matching a list of top 200 U.S. university names based on Shanghai
Ranking to the a¢ liation …eld of each publications record.
   12
      Appendix Figure A1 shows that the same pattern holds for main industries. Appendix Figures A2-A4 present additional
supporting evidence. Figure A2 shows that citations to science are positively related to share of Ph.Ds or M.D. scientists of
all R&D employees as reported in the survey.
   13
      Based on 1994 CMS data Q.22: "Referring to the …elds listed above, indicate the …eld whose research …ndings in general
(not just university and government research) contributed the most to your R&D activities during the last three years. Then,
indicate the importance of that …eld’s …ndings to your R&D activities". The sample is restricted to …rms that indicated their
main …eld in Q22 as A-J (excluding category K -‘others’). Publications were classi…ed to main …elds based on key related
words under the WoS journal subject category …eld. For example, “Organometallics” Journal related subject category is
“Chemistry, Inorganic & Nuclear; Chemistry, Organic” accordingly it is classi…ed under main …eld of chemistry.

variable for …rm-year observations with zero publications. Table 5 presents the estimation results.

    One main concern is that …rms with a higher number of publications are more likely to randomly cite

one of their publications, which would upward bias b1 . To mitigate this concern, all of our speci…cations

include …rm …xed e¤ects as well as …rm controls for scale such as patent stock, R&D stock and sales.

Furthermore, our choice of the temporal structure of internal citations aims at mitigating concerns that

number of publications and internal citation are a¤ected by common shocks (e.g., shocks to research

opportunity that a¤ect both number of publications and number of patents).15

    Column 1 presents the estimation results from a pooled speci…cation with four-digit industry …xed

e¤ects. There is a positive and statistically signi…cant relationship between internal citation and number

of publications. Column 2 presents the same pattern of results for a between-…rm speci…cation, which

collapses the panel data into a cross-section by averaging variables at the …rm level. Column 3 adds

…rm …xed-e¤ects. b1 falls sharply from 0.68 (column 1) to 0.11, indicating that the relationship between

internal citation and publications is driven largely by heterogeneity across …rms rather than within …rms

over time. Yet, b1 remains statistically signi…cant. Based on the estimates from column 3 (…rm …xed

e¤ect), one additional internal citation is associated with an additional 0.5 publication per …rm-year

(0:11    6:216=1:274).

    Columns 4-8 present several robustness checks. Column 4 restricts the sample to …rms with at least

one publication during the sample period. There is no substantial change in b1 . Column 5 controls

estimate on self citations is statistically zero. This result is reassuring because it mitigates a concern than

that b1 captures a "self-citation" e¤ect that might be driven by cumulative innovation capabilities (Hall

et al., 2005; Belenzon, 2012).

    Columns 6-8 present the estimation results using alternative measures of internal citation, all yielding

the expected positive relationship with publications.161718

4.1.1     Heterogeneous e¤ects

Not all citations to science are of equal importance. We expect internal citations to a¤ect future investment

in research when the cited publication (i) is of high scienti…c impact, (ii) is based on recent work that

is less known by others and (iii) is related to the …rm’s core technologies and to its valuable inventions.

These predictions are con…rmed in our data and are reported in Table 6.

    Column 1 distinguishes between citations to old vs. new science. Internal citations to new science

include only citations to articles published no later than …ve years from the grant year of the citing patent.

While the coe¢ cient estimate on internal citation to recent science is positive and statistically signi…cant

(0.130), internal citations to old science have no e¤ect.

    Columns 2-3 distinguish between citations to basic and applied publications using journal CHI index19

(Column 2) and Journal Impact Factor (JIF) (Column 3). In Column 2, we de…ne basic (applied) journals

as the top (bottom) two categories of the CHI index and classify publications accordingly. In Column 3,

we classify journals as basic and applied based on their JIF value. A publication is classi…ed as basic if it
   16
      In unreported robustness checks, we ran the analysis excluding references to articles related to clinical trial phase
in the pharmaceutical and biotech industry, which are not considered as research. We examine all publications cited by
pharmaceutical and biotech patents and identify clinical trial publications by related phrases in the title and abstract of
each publication record (e.g., clinical trial, clinical study, preclinical trial, subjects). We locate less than 100 internally cited
clinical trial publications and exclude them from the analysis. Our results remain robust.
   17
      As additional unreported robustness checks, we performed the same analysis excluding citations added by patent ex-
aminers. We also excluded citations where patent inventors cite their own publications. The results are robust in both
cases.

is published in a journal with above median JIF value (using the JIF value distribution in the complete

WoS database), and as applied otherwise. About 70% of internal citations are to articles published in

basic science journals (this percentage is robust across both classi…cations) and these citations matter

the most for the production of future publications. Based on Column 3 (JIF), the coe¢ cient estimate

on internal citation to basic science is positive and statistically signi…cant (0.122), while the coe¢ cient

estimate on internal citation to applied science is statistically zero.

      Column 4 distinguishes between high and low quality publications using number of citations an article

receives from other publications, divided by average number of citations received by all WoS publications

published in the same journal-year as the focal publication. Classi…cation of articles into high and low

quality is based on median value of normalized citations received in the corporate publications sample.

Our results indicate that only citations to high quality publications matter. While the coe¢ cient estimate

on high quality internal citation is positive and signi…cant (0.116), the coe¢ cient estimate on citations to

low quality publications is statistically zero.

      Column 5 distinguishes between use of science by patents in core and non-core technology areas of

the focal …rm. Core citations include only citations to publications made by patents in the …rm’s core

technology area. Core technology is de…ned as the IPC with the majority of the …rm’s patents in a given

year.20 There is a strong relationship between citations by core technology patents and future publications.

Moving from core to non-core citing patents lowers the coe¢ cient estimate on internal citation from 0.12

to 0.04.

      Column 6 distinguishes between citations by high and low quality patents. Patent quality is based

on number of citations a patent receives divided by average number of citations received by all patents

granted in the same year as the focal patent. Patents are classi…ed into high and low quality using median

value from the corporate patents sample. The relationship between internal citation and publications is

stronger for high quality citing patents, but the coe¢ cient estimates on high and low quality patents are

not statistically di¤erent from each other (0.091 vs. 0.054).

      In summary, Table 6 shows that internal patent citations to science that matter for the production

of future science are citations to recent, high quality basic publications that are made by core and high
 20
      Average number of patents in core technology areas is 8.6. About 40% of internal citations are by core patents.

quality patents. These results are consistent with the view that to justify further investment in research

scientists are required to demonstrate that their recent scienti…c work is useful for the core inventive

activity of the sponsoring …rm.

4.2      Exploring the causal e¤ect of internal citations

An important concern is that internal citations and investment in research can be driven by common

unobserved or mismeasured time-varying e¤ects, such as technological opportunity shocks or technology

specialization that can be correlated with number of publications and internal citations. This section

proposes an instrumental variable estimation strategy to mitigate this concern.

4.2.1      Inventor-author overlap

Our instrumental variable estimation is motivated by a potential determinant of internal citation: inventor-

author overlap. Arguably, …rms should be better positioned to use the science they produce in their down-

stream development if there is a tighter link between its research and development personnel (Kline and

Rosenberg, 1986; Rosenberg, 1990).21 This link should align research priorities with downstream needs

and facilitate "back and forth" between upstream research and downstream development. In particular,

a …rm should be better positioned to capitalize on its research if some aspects of the research …ndings are

tacit and more easily transmitted through face-to-face interactions between researchers and inventors.

       Building on this logic, the next section explores legal constraints to labor mobility that potentially

a¤ect the overlap between research and development personnel as an instrument for internal citation.

Stronger mobility barriers should raise the overlap between researcher and inventor teams and in turn

lead to a higher internal citation rate. Importantly, there is no clear reason why mobility barriers should

a¤ect the number of publications a …rm produces, conditional on how these publications are used in

downstream development.
  21
    According to Rosenberg (1990, p.170): "When basic research in industry is isolated from the rest of the …rm, whether
organizationally or geographically, it is likely to become sterile and unproductive. The history of basic research in industry
suggests that it is likely to be most e¤ ective when it is highly interactive with the work, or the concerns of applied scientists
and engineers."




                                                               15
       We construct a measure of overlap between inventors and authors at the …rm-year level. This measure

is the share of patents with inventors who are also authors of a publication by the same …rm published

no later than three years from the focal patent’s grant year. Inventor-author overlap is de…ned only for

publishing …rms. Appendix 6.6 provides additional details on the construction of this measure.22

       Columns 1-2 in Table 7 present OLS estimation results of a linear probability model that examines the

relationship between inventor-author overlap and internal citation. The dependent variable is one for …rm-

year observations with at least one internal citation and zero otherwise. Column 1 includes a complete set

of four-digit industry dummies and Column 2 includes …rm …xed e¤ects. As expected, the probability of

internal citation increases with inventor-author overlap. Based on the within-…rm estimates (Column 2),

a one-standard deviation increase in inventor-author overlap increases the probability of internal citation

by about 30%, relative to the sample mean.23

       Column 3 examines external citations and …nds that they are unrelated to inventor-author overlap.

This result mitigates a concern that the overlap-citation relationship is driven by a higher general propen-

sity to cite as overlap increases.

4.2.2      Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine

We proceed by introducing a source of variation that should a¤ect inventor-author overlap, but not

publications. We exploit variation in the adoption of Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine (IDD) by U.S. state

courts as an instrument for internal citation. IDD is a legal doctrine that restricts workers mobility from

one organization to another in cases where they might “inevitably disclose”trade secrets. It is applicable

even if the employee did not sign a non-compete or non-disclosure agreement, if there is no evidence of

actual disclosure or if the rival is located in another state. IDD status at the focal …rm’s state in a given

year is taken from Klasa et al. (2015) (see also Marx et al., 2009). Our instrument multiplies IDD by a

…rm-speci…c employment mobility risk, measured as number of rival publishing …rms in close geographical

proximity to the focal …rm.

       Our instrument, IDD mobility, is constructed as:
  22
    Average value of inventor-author overlap is 0.2 with a median of 0.
  23
    Under the assumption that overlap should a¤ect citations to publications of current workers, as a robustness check we
compute internal citation only for recent publications (published no later than …ve years from the grant year of the citing
patent). The coe¢ cient estimate on inventor-author overlap increases in size and remains statistically signi…cant.



                                                            16
                                    IDD mobilityit = IDDst           mobility riskit

    Where, IDDst , is a dummy variable equals one if IDD is in e¤ect in the focal …rm’s (i) state (s) in year

t. Firm address is from the publication’s “a¢ liation” …eld.24 mobility riskit is the number of publishing

…rms in the same industry (4-digits SIC) within 100 mile of the focal …rm in a given year. We calculate

distance between …rms using the NBER’s ZIP Code Distance Database.

    Our main identifying assumption is that mobility barriers do not directly a¤ect incentives to invest

in research. Thus, one has to assume that IDD adoption is uncorrelated with unobserved state-speci…c

variables such as technological opportunities. We test this assumption by examining whether changes in

IDD status are correlated with technological opportunities, measured by patents per R&D. As shown in

Appendix Table A7, there is no relationship between changes in IDD and patents per R&D (same pattern

holds for publications per R&D).

    Column 4 in Table 7 presents OLS estimation results for the relationship between IDD mobility and

inventor-author overlap. As expected, higher mobility restrictions are associated with a higher inventor-

author overlap. The estimates indicate that a two standard deviation increase in IDD mobility is asso-

ciated with an increase of 22% in inventor-author overlap (relative to the sample mean).

    Columns 5-7 present within-…rm Two-Stage Least Squares estimation results for the e¤ect of internal

citation on publications using lagged IDD_mobility as an instrument. To mitigate possible unobserved

time-varying state heterogeneity in economic conditions that might be correlated with IDD we also control

for state employment level.25 Column 5 presents the …rst stage estimation results, where internal citation

is regressed on lagged IDD mobility controlling for patents stock, R&D stock, sales and state employment.

The results con…rm that higher mobility restrictions are associated with higher internal citation and that

the instrument has strong explanatory power (Kleibergen-Paap F statistic=72).

    Column 7 presents the second stage estimation results where internal citation is instrumented with

IDD mobility. The IV coe¢ cient estimate on internal citation is larger than the OLS estimate in
  24
     Our algorithm accounts for cases where several publishing institutions are listed under the a¢ liation …eld and locates
the relevant state in the string that is related to the focal …rm. For example, “JOHNS HOPKINS UNIV DEPT CHEM
BALTIMORE MD 21218 USA, ARCO CHEM CO NEWTOWN SQ PA 19073 USA."
  25
     Annual state employment is from U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).




                                                            17
Column 6 (0.6 versus 0.1). One possible explanation for the smaller IV estimate is that the OLS estimate

is downward biased due to unobserved …rm heterogeneity, which is corrected in the IV estimation. For

example, mismeasured or unobserved …rm specialization might be positively correlated with internal

citations (because both patents and publications are in similar …elds they are more likely to be linked by

a citation) and negatively correlated with number of publications (because they are more focused, …rms

perform research in a more narrow research domain). Another possible explanation for the smaller OLS

estimate is noise. If the variation used in the IV estimation captures "true" use citations, b1 would be

larger.26

       Finally, Appendix section 6.7 presents an analysis that exploits a di¤erent source of variation in internal

citation–pro…t shocks due to foreign exchange rate ‡uctuations that a¤ect the dependence of inventions

on science (Cyert and March, 1963; Graham at al., 2004; Bruneel et al., 2016). We …nd that at the

industry level, foreign currency devaluation is associated with drop in pro…ts and fewer internal citations

to science. These results are consistent with …rms performing less exploratory, science-based, innovation

in leaner times. Our instrumental variable estimation further shows a positive and statistically signi…cant

e¤ect of internal citation on publications. Lastly, we include both instruments, IDD and devaluation,

in a single two-stage least-squares speci…cation. The same pattern of results remains in the …rst and

second stage estimations and the Hansen test for overidentifying restrictions supports the validity of the

instruments (results are presented in Appendix Table A5).

4.3       Knowledge spillovers

If …rms invest in research because it is an input into internal inventive activity, the use of this research

by rivals would lower the return to such investment (Nelson, 1959; Arrow, 1962). In this section we

investigate how investment in research is related to external citations–citations in patents …led by others

to the research published by the focal …rm.

       Table 8 presents the estimation results. Column 1 includes the number of external citations made
  26
    Appendix Table A4 Columns 4-6 present results for the IV estimation with right-hand-side variables lagged by two and
three years. The coe¢ cient estimate on internal citation remains positive and statistically signi…cant.



                                                          18
to the focal …rm’s publications (by corporate and non-corporate patents). While the coe¢ cient estimate

on internal citation remains robust and similar in size to previous estimates (Table 5, Column 3), the

coe¢ cient estimate on external citation is negative and statistically indistinguishable from zero. A similar

relationship is found when restricting external citation to citations received only from corporate patents

(Column 2).

       Not all citations represent pro…t-reducing spillovers. Pro…t-reducing spillovers are more likely when

a rival uses the knowledge than when an unrelated …rm uses it. Similarly, pro…t-reducing spillovers are

more likely when recently generated knowledge is used by a rival, rather than when the knowledge is older

and already di¤used.

       We build on Bloom et al. (2013) and Ja¤e (1988) to construct SEGMENT and TECH as our measures

of the proximity of citing and cited …rms in product market space and technology space, respectively.

Firms are close in product space if the distribution of sales across di¤erent product market segments

is similar. Firms are close in technology space if the distribution of patents across technology classes

is similar. Formally, the distance in technology space is the cosine of vectors representing the share of

patents in 4-digit IPC classes for each pair of …rms. Product market distance is measured analogously

using industry segments (4-digit SIC codes level).27 More details on the construction of SEGMENT and

TECH are provided in Appendix 6.5.

       We compute two external citation variables as SEGMENT-weighted and TECH-weighted number of

outsider citations to the focal …rm’s publications (using SEGMENT and TECH as weights). Naturally,

only citations by corporate patents are included in this analysis. Insofar as higher SEGMENT citations

represent pro…t-reducing spillovers, we expect these to be negatively related to publications. We make no

clear prediction for TECH citations.

       Columns 3-5 present the estimation results of breaking up external citations by SEGMENT and TECH.

The coe¢ cient estimate on SEGMENT citations is negative, however statistically insigni…cant (Column

3).

                                                          19
       Columns 4-5 restrict citations to recent publications (published no later than …ve years from the

citing patent’s grant year). As expected, external citations from close product market rivals are nega-

tively related to publications. Conversly, citations from close technology rivals are positively related to

publications (Column 4). This may capture unobserved …rm-speci…c publications quality e¤ect–quality

is positively correlated with citations from technology rivals and with publications production. Finally,

the SEGMENT and TECH estimates become larger in absolute value when restricting the sample to

publishing …rms (Column 5).28

       Overall, our results are consistent with the view that a …rm’s investment in research depends, among

other things, on how its research is used internally and externally. A …rm whose research is used in its

own inventive activity is likely to continue investing in research. However, a …rm whose research spills

over to rivals is likely to reduce its investment. An important empirical contribution of the present paper

is quantifying this internal/external tradeo¤. Based on the estimates from Column 4 in Table 8, one

additional internal citation mitigates the negative e¤ect of four segment-weighted external citations.

                                                   Insert Table 8 here

4.4      R&D productivity

We next examine whether higher internal citation implies a greater productivity of R&D investment as

measured by number of citation-weighted patents produced per R&D dollar invested. Table 9 presents

the estimation results of the following speci…cation:



   ln(1 + Citation weighted patentsit ) =           0   +   1 Share   of inter citationit       1                                     (2)

                                               +    2 Share   of inter citationit          1   ln (R&D stockit       1)


                                                3 ln (R&D     stockit   1)   +   4 ln (1   + P ub stockit   1)   +   i   +   t   +   it


       Citation-weighted patents is the annual ‡ow of patents weighted by the ratio of the number of citations

each patent receives and average number of citations received by all other patents granted in the same

year as the focal patent. Share of Inter citation is the ratio of internal citations from own patents to

number of citations received from all corporate patents.29 The coe¢ cients of interest are                                 1   and   2:   We

expect that …rms with more scienti…c R&D programs to be more productive. Thus, we expect b1 > 0

and b2 > 0. As in previous analysis, all speci…cations control for …rm …xed e¤ects.

       Column 1 shows a strong positive relationship between internal citation and R&D productivity (b1 >

0): Columns 2-3 add the interaction term between R&D stock and share of internal citation. As expected,

b2 > 0 and is statistically signi…cant. Column 3 restricts the sample to publishing …rms with no substantial

change in the estimates.

                                                     Insert Table 9 here


4.5      Stock market value

If internal citation increases private returns to research, whereas spillovers to rivals reduce private returns,

this should be re‡ected not only in the level of publication output, but also in its value. We examine next

the relationship between use of research and …rm stock market value30 . Following Griliches (1986) and

Hall et al. (2005), we estimate the following speci…cation:



       ln(M arket valueit ) =     0   +   1 ln(1   + Internal pub stockit               1)    +   2 ln(1   + External pub stockit    1)


                             +    3 ln Assetsit 1     + Z0it   1   +    i   +   t   +    it                                               (3)

       Internal pub stock and External pub stock are publications stock weighted by number of internal and

external citations each publication receives, respectively31 . Assets is the book value of physical capital32

and Z is a vector of controls including lagged sales, R&D stock and patents stock. The coe¢ cient estimates

are amenable to di¤erent interpretations. We interpret these coe¢ cients as re‡ecting the imputed value

attributable to the relevant asset, or the "shadow price" of the asset (Hall et al., 2005). Our interest is

at the coe¢ cients      1   and   2:   We expect b1 > 0 and b2 < 0: Table 10 presents the estimation results.
  29
     Average value of Share of Inter citation is 0.013 with a standard deviation of 0.093.
  30
     Market value is the sum of common stock, preferred stock and total debt net of current assets.
  31
     Publications stock is computed as Internal pub stockt = Internal pubt + Internal pub stockt 1 , where Internal pubt is
the number of internal citations publications receive in year t: External pub stockt is computed in an equivalent way with
external citations received. For example, if a publication receives one internal citation and two external citation, it adds one
to Internal pub stockt and two to External pub stockt :
  32
     Calculated as the sum of net plant, property and equipment, inventories, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries, and
intangibles other than R&D.


                                                                   21
    Consistent with previous research, Column 1 shows a positive relationship between publications stock

and market value (Arora et al., 2015). Column 2 breaks up publications stock into internally- and

externally-cited publications. As expected, b1 > 0, but contrary to our expectation b2 > 0 (signi…cant at

the 5% level).

    Column 3 distinguishes between external citations received from rivals in product markets and those

from other …rms in the same technical domains. Thus, External pub stock is broken up into two separate

measures, one where external citations are weighted by product market proximity (SEGMENT) and an-

other where external citations are weighted by technology market proximity (TECH). This decomposition

of external citations leads to a negative and statistically signi…cant coe¢ cient estimate on SEGMENT, as

expecred. The coe¢ cient estimate on TECH is positive, similar to our …ndings from Column 4, Table 8.

    The estimates from Table 10, Column 3 indicate that one additional internal citation weighted publi-

cation mitigates the negative market value e¤ect of approximately 3 external SEGMENT-weighted pub-

lications. Taken together, the evidence from Table 10 supports the view that private return to research

is positively related to its internal use in invention, but negatively related to its use in invention by close

product market rivals.

5    Conclusion

Using data on 4,736 publicly traded American …rms over the period 1980-2006, this paper studies the

relationship between use of corporate research in invention and corporate production of science. We sys-

tematically match all NPL (non-patent literature) references to publication records from Web of Science

to learn about how corporate research is used in invention. Our primary contribution is providing sys-

tematic evidence of the private economic value of corporate research as an input into internal inventive

activity and demonstrating that investment in research is strongly tied to how research bene…ts technology

development.

    We make several empirical contributions. First, we show that patent citations to scienti…c publications

are a good measure of use of science in invention. We utilize the Carnegie Mellon Survey to show that

…rms whose patents cite science also report greater use of science in their R&D projects. Second, we show

                                                      22
that …rms that are able to use their research in their inventions produce more of it. This relationship

is stronger for new, high quality basic research and for citing patents in the core technology area of the

inventing …rm. We supplement these …ndings by showing that internal use is associated with higher R&D

productivity and stock market valuation of scienti…c publications stock. Third, spillovers reduce private

value and …rms publish less when their research spills over to product market rivals.

   Our …ndings support the view that …rms invest in research because its scienti…c output feeds into

downstream technology development. Our paper contributes to the growing discussion of why American

…rms are withdrawing from investment in science (Arora et al., 2015). To understand the causes and

implications of the decline in corporate research, we must …rst develop a better understanding of why

…rms invest in research in the …rst instance. Over time, …rms will invest less in research if the output

of their research becomes relatively less important for the technology they develop, and spills over to

product market rivals.

6     Appendix.
6.1   Sample construction
We implement various matching procedures to construct two main datasets, one at the …rm-year level
and another at the citation-publication level, including (i) matching scienti…c publications to Compustat
companies; (ii) mapping patent citations to publications; (iii) matching patent data to Compustat; and
(iv) dynamic matching of Compustat accounting information. We discuss these procedures below.
    A parent company and a subsidiary may have di¤erent identi…cation numbers and records within
the Compustat data. Also, a single company may correspond to multiple …rm identi…ers (CUSIPs or
GVKEYs) within the Compustat database due to changes in ownership structure and accounting changes
over the sample period that can lead to a change in its identi…cation number. Appendix Table B1
illustrates the challenges in assigning a unique id over time based on the …rm id in Compustat. To deal
with these challenges, we implement several procedures.
    First, we rely on the NBER 2006 patent data project, which corresponds to our subsample years,
to identify multiple Compustat records that are associated with a single company in our subsample.

                                                    26
Second, we further merge parent Compustat companies and independent Compustat subsidiaries and
related joint-ventures that appear in our initial subsample using the “CGS Associated Issuers”database,
which links related issuers in the Compustat database and other online sources. For example, we merge
ARMSTRONG WORLD INDUSTRIES under its holding company ARMSTRONG HOLDINGS INC
as well as merge the joint venture, DOW CORNING CORP, under both his parent companies, DOW
CHEMICAL and CORNING INC. We manually modify the NBER data according to these changes.
Third, we uniquely identify each parent company by a 9-digit CUSIP (our UO-COMPANY variable) and
up to …ve associated CUSIPs in case of multiple related …rm CUSIPs and subsidiary CUSIPs. In addition
to our UO-COMPANY identi…er, we assign each company a unique NBER “PDPCO”code. This enables
us to dynamically match our dataset with Compustat accounting data and with NBER patent data. We
exclude from our sample non-patenting …rms. Lastly, we exclude …rms that are not headquartered in
the United States, based on Compustat current records. Appendix Table B2 presents an example of the
dynamic match.
    The above procedures leave us with our …nal estimation sample of an unbalanced panel including
4,736 publicly traded US headquartered companies and 57,765 …rm-year observations over the period
1980-2006. These …rms have at least one year of positive R&D expenditures and at least one patent from
1980 through 2006.

6.2   Matching scienti…c publications to Compustat companies
After obtaining our initial subsample of …rms we proceed to match our …rm sample to publications data
to capture their investment in science. We obtain publications data from the Web of Science database
(previously known as ISI Web of Knowledge). We include articles from journals covered in the "Science
Citation Index" and "Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science," excluding social sciences, arts
and humanities articles.
    Each publication record contains detailed information including title of the publication, authors, jour-
nal info and our main variable of interest, an a¢ liation …eld with name and address of the publishing
institute or company in case of a corporate publication. This …eld can include more than one listing
in case of a collaborative publication, for example, “DARLEY M (reprint author), TEXAS INSTRU-
MENTS INC, DEPT DATAPATH VLSI PROD SEMICOND GRP 8330 LBJ FREEWAY, POB 655303,
DALLAS, TX 75265 USA SUN MICROSYST INC, MT VIEW, CA USA”.
    Companies appear in the Compustat …le under their most current name with no records of previous
names. Since company names may change over the course of our sample years (e.g., due to mergers and
acquisitions), we manually search online sources (e.g., Bloomberg, Opencorporates, Crunchbase websites)
and check older Compustat datasets and the “CGS Associated Issuers” in order to identify previous
names relevant to our sample period. For example, EG&G, which changed its name to "PerkinElmer
Inc" in 1999 after buying the Analytical Instrument division from Perkin-Elmer will appear under both
names in our dataset. Similarly, “APPLIED MOLECULAR GENETICS INC ”, which changed its name
in 1983 to “AMGEN INC ” will appear under both names in our dataset, as well as the pharmaceuti-
cal company “WYETH ”, which up to 2002 was known as “AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS ”, “3M
CO”, formerly known as the “MINNESOTA MINING AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY ”, and

                                                    27
“SPECTRA DIODE LAB ”, which changed its name to “SDL, INC ”. In addition to the parent company
name we also check related subsidiary names using SDC Platinum (M&A data) and other online sources.
Lastly, we allocate abbreviations that are commonly used by companies instead of their o¢ cial name.
For example, “INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES CORP ”, will also appear under its common
abbreviation “IBM ” and “GENERAL ELECTRIC CO” under “GE.”
    Company name was …rst standardized by cleaning all non- alphabetic characters as well as Compu-
stat related indicators and converting all strings to uppercase characters. Where possible, we omitted
legal entity endings and other common words (e.g. INC, CORP, LTD, PLC, THE, LAB, PHARMA-
CEUTICAL) to maximize the matching rates (e.g., “XEROX CORP ” was standardized to “XEROX ”,
“ABBOTT LABORATORIES ” to “ABBOTT ”). However, in cases where the company’s name is too
short, generic or can match to other strings within the address …eld, we preserved the original name to
avoid mismatches. For example, omitting the legal entity from “QUANTUM CORP ”would mismatch it to
various research institutions such as “TEXAS STATE UNIV CTR APPL QUANTUM ELECTR DEPT ”.
Similarly, “MALLINCKRODT INC ”can mismatch with “EDWARD MALLINCKRODT INST ”or with
“HARVARD UNIV MALLINCKRODT CHEM LAB ”and “KELLOGG CO”can mismatch with “M.W.
KELLOGG”. For cases where we cannot omit the legal entity, we try adding additional relevant names
to improve the match, for example for “MERCK & CO” we also include “MERCK RESEARCH LAB ”
and for “GTE CORP ” we include “GTE LAB ”. To further improve the quality of match, we obtained
the list of most frequent company names of the …rst publisher within the a¢ liation string and adjusted
our company name list accordingly.
    One last step in standardizing the company names is to …t it to the publication a¢ liation …eld format
that contains many abbreviated words. For this process, we formed a list that includes over 80 abbreviated
words matched to their various origins as well as to other forms of abbreviations. For example, LABORA-
TORIES, LABORATORY, LABS, LABO, LABORATORIE, LABORATARI, LABORATARIO, LABO-
RATARIA, LABORATORIET and LABORATORIUM were all abbreviated to “LAB”. The list was
compiled from the most frequent abbreviated words in the Address …eld (accordingly, the list is targeted
to our sample). Appendix Table B3 presents a list of the most frequent abbreviated words.
    Finally, we apply a many-to-many match between each standardized company name and the a¢ liation
…eld for each publication (approximately 14mm publications and 5.5K names), while allowing for more
than one …rm to be matched to each publication (to allow for collaborative publications). We use STATA’s
“regexm” command33 to detect whether the a¢ liation …eld contains each company name. In addition to
our automated algorithm, we perform extensive manual checks to detect cases that can cause mismatches
and verify matches by comparing the address listed within Compustat to the address in the publication
data. For example, to distinguish between “THERATECH INC / UTAH ”and “THERATECH INC ”we
verify that the address of the …rm under the a¢ liation …eld is in Salt Lake City.
    We …nd approximately 300 thousand articles from more than 5000 di¤erent journals that were pub-
lished from 1980 through 2006, with at least one author employed by our sample of Compustat …rms. At
the end of this procedure, we obtain a match between a unique publication id and a UO company id.

    Stata’s “strdist” command is based on the Levenshtein distance score, which measures the distance between two strings
by the minimum number of character edits required to gain an exact match.

6.3    Matching patent data
We apply the strategy used in the NBER 2006 patent data project (Hall et al., 2001) to perform a dynamic
match of patents to our subset of Compustat …rms. The NBER dynamic reassignment of patents accounts
for changes in Compustat identi…cation numbers and M&A reassignment of patents based on SDC data.
We make manual adjustments to the NBER data based on our aggregation of the data under a parent
“UO”company. For example, while BOEING CAPITAL CORP and BOEING CO are treated as separate
companies in the NBER database, we merge BOEING CAPITAL CORP under BOEING CO as it is a
wholly owned subsidiary of the company. We adjust the NBER data in such way that all of BOEING
CAPITAL CORP patents are assigned to BOEING CO. Using this process we identify the original UO
…rm of each patent and also account for reassignment of patents over time. In case a patent has several
assignees, we match the patent to several …rms and assign fractional patent ownership to each assignee
(i.e., 1/number of assignees).

6.4    Matching NPL citations to Web of Science
Patent citations to science are obtained from the Non-Patent Literature (NPL) citations section located
at the front page of patents taken from PatStat database. An example of a front-page patent citation
to non-patent literature is provided in Appendix Figure A5. Using all patents granted in the period
1980-2014 (including corporate and non-corporate patents), we match NPLs to corporate publications
from Web of Science (approximately 14mm citations and 300k corporate publications). This is a central
match and the most challenging one, due to di¤erences in structure between NPLs and publications. We
begin with a many-to-many match, allowing more than one publication to be matched to each citation.
For each possible records pair, we construct a score that captures the degree of textual overlap between
the title, journal, authors and publication year. To exclude mismatches, we use a more detailed matching
algorithm that is based on di¤erent sources of publication information: standardized authors’ names,
number of authors, article title, journal name and year of publication. The matching algorithms accounts
for misspelling, unstructured text, incomplete references, and other issues that may cause mismatches.34
    The …rst step is to match between the publication’s “Title” …eld and the title that is located within
the citation string. There are two main problems: (i) the position of the title within the citation is not
…xed (ii) there may be small variation in the title (e.g., “GIVE” vs. “GIVES”) and thus an exact match
may not perform well. To overcome these problems we implement a fuzzy match algorithm. After we
standardize and clean the di¤erent …elds, we measure the length-di¤erence between the citation string
and the publication title string. Then, using STATA’s “strdist” command we calculated the distance
between the two strings. We use the di¤erence between the length di¤erence and distance as a measure
of proximity of the titles. We supplement this measure with an exact match of the …rst part of the title.
In some cases the title is missing from the citation string. In such cases we rely more on other available
  34
    The following example (from the …rst line in Appendix Table B4) illustrates the matching challenge. NPL citation:
LIN, KUN SHAN, ET AL., SOFTWARE RULES GIVES PERSONAL COMPUTER REAL WORD POWER , INTER-
NATIONAL ELECTRONICS, VOL. 53, NO. 3, FEB. 10, 1981, PP. 122 125. Matched Publication: Title: SOFTWARE
RULES GIVE PERSONAL-COMPUTER REAL WORD POWER, Authors: LIN KS, FRANTZ GA, GOUDIE K, Journal
information: ELECTRONICS 54 (3): 122-125 1981.



                                                         29
features to determine the …nal match.
    Second, we match between the publication’s “Authors”…eld and the authors listed within the citation
string. As with the title, we cannot identify the exact location where the authors are listed within
the citation string since the location varies from one citation to another. In addition, there are several
di¤erences in how names are written: (i) Last name only vs. full names; (ii) names vs. initials (e.g., LIN
KS vs. LIN KUN SHAN); (iii) listing of all authors vs. one author followed (or not) by “et al.”; (iv)
order of last and …rst names within the string. To verify a match by authors we …rst count the number
of authors listed in the publication record. We then check whether the citation string contains “et al.”.
To mitigate the name variation problem, we implement an algorithm that matches di¤erent variations of
the authors’ name to the citation (including transformation of last and/or …rst and/or middle name to
initials and changes in order listed). In cases where several authors are listed under the publication and
“et al.” does not appear within the citation we perform a one-to-many match between the citation and
each author and assume that at least 80% of the authors must be matched to the citation to determine a
match. For cases where several authors are listed in the publication and only one is matched within the
citation while “et al.” is omitted, we rely more on match results in other features to determine the …nal
match.
    Next, we match journal information including standardized journal’s name, year published, page
numbers and volume, while accounting for typos, abbreviations and di¤erences in format between the
datasets (e.g., “INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONICS”vs. “ELECTRONICS”; “VOL. 53, NO. 3”vs. “54
(3)”).
    Finally, we combine the match results for the di¤erent features (title, authors and journal information)
using di¤erent weights according to their relative importance, in order to determine a …nal match. We
perform extensive manual checks to con…rm matches. At the end of this procedure, we obtain unique
identi…cation numbers for the citation, the citing patent and the cited publication.

6.5   SEGMENT and TECH proximity measures
We build on Bloom et al. (2013) and Ja¤e (1988) to construct the measures SEGMENT and TECH
as the correlations between …rm pairs. SEGMENT proximity is computed based on the distribution of
line of business listed within the Compustat operating segments database. We use the dynamic match
as explained previously to match our UO …rms to Compustat segment database and calculate their sales
share over the complete sample period (1980-2006) in each segment. There are a total of 60 segments (out
of 69 available) related to our citing and cited …rms. We generate a vector for each UO …rm based on the
distribution of sales share in each of these 60 segments. The SEGMENT proximity for each cited–citing
                                                                             S0 S
…rm pair is the absolute un-centered correlation between their vectors, p i pj where Si denotes the
                                                                             Si   Sj
vector of the shares of …rm i’s sales in di¤erent segments. In case of several assignee …rms matched to
the cited patent, we compute the average distance between the di¤erent …rms. The measure ranges from
zero (least correlated) to one (fully correlated).
    Similarly, TECH is computed based on each …rm’s patent share distribution across di¤erent technology
…elds. We generate a vector for each UO …rm based on its granted patents share in each 3-digit main IPC


                                                    30
over the complete sample period (1980-2006). The TECH proximity for each cited–citing …rm pair is the
                                                                            T0 T
absolute un-centered correlation distance between their IPC-share vectors, p i pj where Ti denotes the
                                                                              Ti   Tj
vector of the shares of …rm i’s patents in the di¤erent technology …elds.

6.6   Inventor-author overlap
Inventor-author overlap is measured as the share of patents per …rm-year that include an inventor who
is also an author of a corporate publication by the same …rm published no later than 3 years from the
patent’s grant year.
     We perform the following steps to construct the overlap measure. First, we standardize inventor and
author names for all non-collaborative patents and corporate publications related to our sample …rms
during the sample period (1980-2006). For patent inventor names, we use the HBS Patent Inventor
Database that identi…es individual inventors for each patent and conveniently lists their …rst-name and
last-name in separate …elds. For publication author names, we use the publication’s author list, which
lists names by last name followed by initials (e.g., “MALIK RJ , HAYES JR , CAPASSO F , ALAVI K
, CHO AY”). The standardized name format we implement for the match is last name followed by …rst
name initial, all in uppercase letters (e.g., MALIK R).
     Next, for each …rm-grant year we perform a many to many match between each patent’s inventor-
standardized names and author-standardized names of publications published by the focal …rm up to 3
years prior to the patent’s grant year. For example, IBM patent US6013336 (granted in 2000) includes an
inventor, Peter Baumgart, who also published a paper in 1997: “Wang, R.H., Raman, V., Baumgart, P.,
Spool, A.M. and Deline, V., 1997. Tribology of laser textured disks with thin overcoat. IEEE Transactions
on Magnetics, 33(5), pp.3184-3186.”
     Finally, we compute for each …rm-grant year the share of non-collaborative patents that their inventor
list includes at least one author of a corporate publication published by the …rm up to 3 years prior to the
patent’s grant year. The average value of inventor-author overlap is 0.21 median is 0, standard deviation
is 0.33 and the 10th and 90th percentile values are 0 and 0.9, respectively. Figures B1-B2 show that there
is heterogeneity in inventor-author overlap across our sample …rms.

6.7   Instrumental variable II: Pro…t shocks due to exchange rate ‡uctuations
A di¤erent source of variation in internal use arises from changes in the mix of downstream innovation
activities. Whereas incremental innovation is less likely to use science, including internally generated
science, exploratory innovation is more likely to build on scienti…c advances and be guided by them.
Exploration has more uncertain outcomes and is less likely during lean times. Put di¤erently, exploratory
innovation requires …nancial slack, because "slack provides a source of funds for innovations that would
not be approved in the case of scarcity" (Cyert and March, 1963, p. 279). The opposite relationship has
been argued between slack and exploitation. Exploitative innovation, also called ‘problemistic search’,
is directed towards …nding an immediate solution to a speci…c problem (Levinthal and March, 1981;
March, 1991; Greve, 2003, 2007; Bruneel et al., 2016). For example, Bruneel et al. (2016), building on
survey data from 2002-2006, …nd that high levels of …nancial slack (measured by cash ‡ow) are associated


                                                    31
with British …rms’engagement in explorative knowledge sourcing from universities, whereas low levels of
slack are associated with exploitative knowledge sourcing. Moreover, consistent with the ’slack search’
view, Graham at al. (2004) report that 80% of the 401 executives they surveyed would decrease their
discretionary R&D spending and delay starting a new project in order to meet an earning target.
    We exploit …nancial shocks using foreign currency devaluations for export-oriented American …rms.
When dollar-denominated pro…ts drop due to a stronger US dollar (USD), …rms would engage in more
exploitation and less exploration. Assuming that exploitation builds less on science, we expect less internal
use of research (that is, patent citations to own science) as …rm patents become more exploitative and
less exploratory. The main idea is that exchange rates a¤ect pro…ts of …rms with foreign subsidiaries, and
pro…ts in turn a¤ect the decision of …rms to exploit science. Our identifying assumption is that short-term
pro…t shocks a¤ect the decision of …rms to use science, but short-term pro…t shock does not a¤ect the
value of scienti…c research independently from its e¤ect on use. Speci…cally, we assume that (i) the future
pro…ts depend upon the realized level of exchange rates, so that conditioning on current exchange rates,
the long run value of research is una¤ected for a given level of internal use, and (ii) shocks to exchange
rates lead to changes in internal use. We demonstrate that negative shocks to exchange rates lead to a
decrease in pro…tability and that negative exchange rate shocks shift downstream innovation away from
exploration and towards exploitation, as re‡ected in reduced patent citations to science. We assume that
in turn this will also reduce internal use of the …rm’s own science.
    Our instrument uses the yearly change in foreign exchange rates weighted by …rm-speci…c weights.
We use two sets of weights: (i) foreign subsidiaries by …rm i in each country and (ii) the industry-level
export of goods between the US and each foreign country in the main industry of …rm i. We include
only manufacturing …rms (SIC 20-39). The data are for the years 1990-2006 (which allow us to include
subsidiaries in former USSR countries). The weighted change in exchange rates is computed as:
                                             XX
                                     dit =           Sic        Exportjct   dtc
                                             c   j

    Where, dit is …rm-year change in the weighted-average value of foreign currency relative to USD.
It includes only manufacturing industries and covers the years 1990 to 2006. Higher dit means USD
becomes stronger indicating a negative shock to USD-denominated pro…ts. dtc is the change in the USD
denominated value of country’s c currency between years t and t-1. Annual exchange rates are o¢ cial
exchange rates from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators. We compute an annual average
based on monthly averages (local currency units relative to the U.S. dollar). For countries adopting the
Euro currency, we adjusted dtc to zero, for the year of the currency change. Changes in annual exchange
rate vary from a 10th percentile value of -0.09 to 90th percentile value of 0.24 (mean of 0.22 and standard
deviation of 1.4). Examples of extreme devaluation include the Brazilian Real that depreciated by more
than 1600% during 1993 and 1994, the Indian Rupee depreciated by 30% between 1990-1991, the Chinese
Renminbi that depreciated by 50% between 1993-1994 and the British Pound Sterling that depreciated
by 17% between 1992-1993.
    Sic is the share of subsidiaries …rm i has in country c of all subsidiaries owned by …rm i. Subsidiaries
information for our sample …rm are from the 2014 Orbis database, maintained by Bureau VanDyke. The


                                                           32
average …rm has 54 foreign subsidiaries in 8 di¤erent countries. Example of a¢ liates’countries include:
Great Britain (9%), Germany (7%), France (6%), Netherlands (5%), Italy (4%), China (4%), Brazil (3%),
India (3%), Russia (1%). Exportjct is the share of export by industry j (where …rm i operates) to country
c in year t. Annual industry export ‡ows between US and foreign countries are based on Schott (2010)35 .
  dit varies from a 10th percentile value of -0.38 to 90th percentile value of 0.45 (mean of 0.02 and standard
deviation of 0.5) for our estimation sample.
    Appendix Table A5 presents the estimation results. Our sample is conditioned on …rm with at least
one publication stock. It includes 1901 publishing …rms, out of which 981 …rms have subsidiaries in 52
di¤erent countries. We compute a dummy variable based on the measure, which receives the value of 1
for devaluation ( dit >0). We lag d dummy by two periods as our instrument for one-period lagged
internal use and control for the level of exchange rate, dit .36
    Columns 1-4 present the relationship between d dummy with pro…ts (EBIDTA) and the use of
science–the average number of patent citations to non-patent literature (NPL), per patent. Consistent
with our proposed mechanism, foreign currency devaluation is associated with drop in pro…ts. Based on
the estimates from Column 1 and evaluated at the sample average, devaluation is associated with 8%
drop in EBIDTA. In other words, exchange rates shocks a¤ect short-term pro…tability.
    Columns 2-4 further show foreign currency devaluation is associated with drop in use of science.
Column 2 shows that devaluation is associated with reduction of 0.5 citations per patent to the non-
patent literature (NPL) which is equivalent to a 9.7% decrease at the mean. Column 3 shows that results
hold when restricting the sample to …rm-years with patents. Based on the estimates from Column 3,
devaluation is associated with 12.5% decrease in average NPL per patent. For Column 4 the dependent
variable is share of patents per year with at least one citation to NPL. Evaluated at the sample average,
devaluation is associated with 12% drop in share of patents citing NPL. These results are consistent with
…rms conducting less exploratory inventive activity in leaner times. It is plausible that this would also
imply less use of internal science.
    Columns 5-7 present the results using devaluation as an instrument for internal use. The …rst stage
estimation instruments internal citation with a dummy variable for dit >0. As expected, devaluation
of foreign currencies is negatively associated with internal use. Based on the estimates from Column 5,
devaluation is associated with 8.1% decrease in average internal use (a decrease of 0.65 internal cites).
We reject the test for weak instruments with a Kleibergen-Paap F statistic=59 (Staiger and Stock, 1997).
    Column 7 presents the second stage estimation results, regressing the log of number of publications
against the predicted lagged use of science due to pro…tability shocks. The coe¢ cient estimate on internal
citation increases from 0.9 (OLS estimation, Column 6) to 1.4. Based on this estimate, a 10 percent
increase in internal citation is associated with approximately 14% increase in annual publications.
    Lastly, Columns 8-10 include jointly our two instruments, IDD and devaluation, in a single two-
stage least-squares speci…cation. The same pattern of results remains in the …rst and second stage
estimations. The Hansen test for overidentifying restrictions is consistent with the instruments being

term and correctly excluded from the estimated speci…cation (p-value for overidentifying restrictions=0.44,
Hansen J statistic=0.59).

Notes: This table provides summary statistics for the main variables used in the econometric analysis. The sample is at the firm-year level and includes an unbalanced
panel of 4,736 US HQ publicly traded companies (out of which 2,413 are publishing companies) over the sample period, 1980-2006. These firms have at least one year
with positive R&D expenditures and at least one patent during the sample period. The sample for all publication variables is restricted to publishing firms. Inventor-
author overlap is the share of patents per year with inventors who include at least one author of a publication published by the same firm in the three-year window prior to
the patent's grant year. For Inventor-author overlap, the sample is conditional on at least one publication stock and on firm-years with granted patents.

Notes: This table presents mean comparison tests for firms with high share of internal citations vs. firms with low share of internal citations. Share of internal citations is the ratio of
citations the firm's publications receive from its own patents to total citations received. The sample is conditional on firms with positive citations. The unit of analysis is a firm, yearly
values are averaged over the period 1980-2006. * and ** denote that the difference in means is significant at the 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Notes: This table presents OLS estimation results for the relationship between average patent citation to publications per patent and the 1994
Carnegie Mellon survey (CMS) questions response (Cohen et al., 2000) related to the importance of research findings as an input to the firm’s R&D
projects. The relevant CMS questions are mentioned in the main text. The sample includes only patenting firms. In Column 3, the sample is restricted
to firms that indicated their main research field in Q22 (excluding ‘Others’ category). For Citations to articles in main research field , publications
were classified to research fields based on WoS journal subject category. Citations to corporate articles include citation to publications by our main
sample of Compustat firms. Citations to patents include backward citations to patents. Robust standard errors in parentheses.

Notes: This table presents OLS estimation results for the relationship between past internal patent citation to own publications and future annual publications, for the period 1980-
2006. Internal citation to publications include patent citations up to year t-1 to publications published up to the same year. Column 2 averages variables at the firm level and performs
a cross section analysis. In Column 5, Self-citation is defined as average number of patent citations to own patents per firm-year. In Column 6, internal citations are measured as
average citations to own publications, per corporate patent. In Column 7, share of internal citations is defined as ratio of citations the firm's publications receive from own patents to
total citations received by the focal firm’s publications. In Column 8, share of internal citations is defined as ratio of citations the firm's publications received from own patents to
total citations to corporate science made by the focal firm’s patents. All specifications include a dummy variable that receives the value of one for firms that never published up to the
focal year. Standard errors (in brackets) are robust to arbitrary heteroscedasticity and allow for serial correlation through clustering by firms.

Notes: This table presents OLS estimation results for the relationship between past patent citations to own publications and future annual publications,
while distinguishing between different types of internal citations. All Internal citation variables include patent citations up to year t-1 to publications
published up to the same year. See main text for exact variable definition. All specifications include a dummy variable that receives the value of one for
firms that never published up to the focal year. Standard errors (in brackets) are robust to arbitrary heteroscedasticity and allow for serial correlation

Notes: for this table the sample is conditional on at least one publication stock over the sample period, 1980-2006. Columns 1-3 present OLS estimation results for the relationship
between inventor-author overlap and citation to science. Dummy for internal (external) citation is equal to one if the firm receives at least one internal (external) citation at the focal
year to any of its publication published up to the focal year. Inventor-author overlap is measured by the share of patents per year with inventors who include at least one author of a
publication published by the same firm in the three-year window prior to the patent's grant year. IDD-Mobility is equal to the status of the Inevitable Disclosure Doctrine (IDD) per
the focal firm's state-year (i.e., for effective IDD equals to one) multiplied by a mobility risk measure that is based on the number of publishing firms within 100 miles in the same
industry. Specifications include a dummy variable that receives the value of one for firms with no patents at the focal year. Columns 5-7 present Two-Stage Least Squares estimation
results for the effect of patent citations to own publications on the number of future publications, using IDD-Mobility as an instrumental variable. Standard errors (in brackets) are
robust to arbitrary heteroscedasticity and allow for serial correlation through clustering by firms.

Notes: This table presents OLS estimation results for the relationship between external and internal patent citation to own publication and future annual publications, for the
period 1980-2006. All the citation variables include patent citations up to year t-1 to publications published up to the same year. SEGMENT and TECH measure the product
market proximity and the technology market proximity, respectively. In Column 1, external citation include corporate and non-corporate patent citations. Columns 2-5 include
only external citation from corporate patents. Columns 4-5 include citations to publications published no earlier than five years prior to the citing patent. All specifications
include dummy variable that receives the value of one for firms that never published up to the focal year. Standard errors (in brackets) are robust to arbitrary
heteroscedasticity and allow for serial correlation through clustering by firms.

Notes: This table presents results OLS estimation results of a patent equation, for the period 1980-2006. Patents are
weighted by citations. Share of internal citations is defined as ratio of citations the firm's publications receive from
own patents to citations received from all patents. All specifications include a dummy variable that receives the
value of one for firm-years without patents and a dummy variable that receives the value of one for firm-years
without citations. Standard errors (in brackets) are robust to arbitrary heteroscedasticity and allow for serial
correlation through clustering by firms.

Notes: This table presents OLS estimation results for the relationship between citation-weighted publication stock and
stock market value, for the period 1980-2006. In Column 2, publication stock is weighted by its internal and external
citations from patents granted up to 2014. In Column 3, external cited publications are weighted by product market
proximity (SEGMENT) and the technology market proximity (TECH), between the citing patent and cited publication.
Publication stock includes WoS publications of our sample firms, published over the sample period (1980-2006).
Standard errors (in brackets) are robust to arbitrary heteroscedasticity and allow for serial correlation through clustering
by firms.

Notes: The table presents OLS estimation result (Columns 1-3) and Two-Stage Least Squares estimation results (Columns 4-6) for the relationship
between past internal patent citations to own publications and future annual publications, for the period 1980-2006, for different lags of right hand
side variables. Internal citations to own publications include patent citations up to year t-1 to publications published up to the same year. For the
IV estimation, the sample is conditioned on at least one publication stock. The endogenous variable, internal citation to publications, is
instrumented by the IDD-Mobility measure. Standard errors (in brackets) are robust to arbitrary heteroscedasticity and allow for serial correlation
through clustering by firms.

Notes: This table presents instrumental variable estimation results for the effect of patent citations to own science on firm's future publication, for the period 1990-2006. The sample is conditional on at least one
publication stock. The endogenous variable, internal citation in year t-1, is instrumented at the firm-year level by a devaluation dummy that is based on weighted-changes in exchange rates in countries where the
firm has subsidiaries. Profit is measured by EBIDTA. NPL citations are cites in year t by the focal firm's patents to any article. Standard errors (in brackets) are robust to arbitrary heteroscedasticity and allow for
serial correlation through clustering by firms.

Notes: This table presents OLS estimation results for the relationship between internal and external citations to firm's own publication and future annual publications, by industry, for the period 1980-2006.
Industry classification is based on four-digit main SIC code. Citation variables include patent citations up to year t-1 to publications published up to the same year. External cites to own publications include
corporate and non-corporate patent citations. All specifications include dummy variable that receives the value of one for firms that never published up to the focal year. Standard errors (in brackets) are
robust to arbitrary heteroscedasticity and allow for serial correlation through clustering by firms.

1994 Carnegie Mellon survey data (Cohen et al., 2000) Q.18: “During the last three years, what percentage of your R&D unit's projects made use of the following research outputs produced by universities or government research
institutes and labs : a. Research findings”. High and low are defined by the mid category rank in the survey. Figure A & B: Low -131 firms; High-31 firms. Figures C & D: Low -293 firms; High-41 firms. The lines represent
standard error bars. The sample includes only patenting firms. Citations are restricted to publications published no earlier than five years prior to the citing patent. Related patents were granted between 1991 to 1999.
