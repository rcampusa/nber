Monetary/Fiscal Policy Mix and Agents' Beliefs

                                              ABSTRACT

We reinterpret post World War II US economic history using an estimated microfounded model that
allows for changes in the monetary/fiscal policy mix. We find that the fiscal authority was the leading
authority in the ‘60s and the ‘70s. The appointment of Volcker marked a change in the conduct of
monetary policy, but inflation dropped only when fiscal policy accommodated this change two years
later. In fact, a disinflationary attempt of the monetary authority leads to more inflation if not supported
by the fiscal authority. If the monetary authority had always been the leading authority or if agents
had been confident about the switch, the Great Inflation would not have occurred and debt would have
been higher. This is because the rise in trend inflation and the decline in debt of the ‘70s were caused
by a series of fiscal shocks that are inflationary only when monetary policy accommodates fiscal policy.
The reversal in the debt-to-GDP ratio dynamics, the sudden drop in inflation, and the fall in output
of the early ‘80s are explained by the switch in the policy mix itself. If such a switch had not occurred,
inflation would have been high for another fifteen years. Regime changes account for the stickiness
of inflation expectations during the ‘60s and the ‘70s and for the break in the persistence and volatility
of inflation.

1    Introduction
Central bankers seem particularly aware of the potential risks linked to the lack of …scal discipline.
The ex Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke claimed that [t]he primary cause of the Great In‡ation, most
economists would agree, was over-expansionary monetary and …scal policies, beginning in the mid-
1960s and continuing, in …ts and starts, well into the 1970s. The …scal expansion of this period had
a variety of elements, including heavy expenditures for the Vietnam War and President Johnson’s
Great Society initiatives. Monetary policy …rst accommodated the …scal expansion, and then [...]
began to power the in‡ationary surge on its own. (Bernanke, 2003). Nevertheless, when studying
the evolution of in‡ation and output over the past sixty years, the role of …scal policy has often
been neglected. This is despite the fact that in many of the general equilibrium models that are
routinely used to analyze the e¤ects of monetary policy, the central bank is able to control in‡ation
only under the assumption that the …scal authority is committed to adjusting primary surpluses in
order to stabilize debt. As e¤ectively shown by Leeper (1991), when this commitment is absent
model dynamics in a rational expectations general equilibrium model depend on the parameters
characterizing the joint behavior of the monetary and …scal authorities and policy interventions can
have perverse and surprising e¤ects. This has induced economists such as Cochrane (1998, 2001) and
Sims (2011) to conjecture that the original sin that led to the rise of in‡ation in the ’70s should be
sought out in the conduct of …scal policy during those years.
    Figure 1 contextualizes the events highlighted by Bernanke, reporting the evolution of in‡ation,
ex-post real interest rate, and debt-to-GDP ratio over the period 1955-2009 together with the …rst
reference to the Great Society initiatives ever made by President Johnson (May 1964) and the ap-
pointment of Paul Volcker to Fed Chairman (August 1979). Some stylized facts can be identi…ed.
First, trend in‡ation increased steadily over the …rst half of the sample, while over the same period
the debt-to-GDP ratio declined smoothly. During this time in‡ation was very persistent and volatile
and real interest rates were low. Then, in the early ’80s, a few quarters after the appointment of
Volcker, in‡ation experienced a sudden and sharp drop that coincided with a deep recession and a
jump in real interest rates. At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio started increasing steadily, until
the early ’90s. Since then, in‡ation has been stable and its movements have been mostly at high
frequencies.
    We reinterpret the events described above in light of an estimated micro-founded Dynamic Sto-
chastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model in which the monetary/…scal policy mix and the volatil-
ity of the structural shocks are subject to regime changes. As in Sims and Zha (2006), movements
across regimes are potentially recurrent and controlled by two independent Markov-switching (MS)
processes. However, in our general equilibrium model agents are aware of the possibility of regime
changes and they form expectations taking them into account. We then solve the model using the
methods developed by Farmer, Waggoner, and Zha (2009, 2011). Speci…cally, we allow for a total
of three policy regimes and two volatility regimes. In order to capture the idea that the balance of
power between the monetary and …scal authorities might have changed over time, we allow for two

The grey shaded areas represent the NBER recessions, while the two red vertical lines mark President Johnson’s …rst
ever public reference to the Great Society (May 1964) and the appointment of Paul Volcker (August 1979). In‡ation is
measured taking the log-di¤erence of the GDP de‡ator, the ex-post real interest rate is computed taking the di¤erence
between the FFR and realized in‡ation in the following period, while the debt-to-GDP ratio is obtained taking the
ratio between the stock of debt held by the public and annualized GDP.


polar policy regimes. In the …rst polar case, the monetary authority is the leading authority: The
Taylor principle is satis…ed and the …scal authority is committed to keeping debt on a stable path. In
the second polar case, the …scal authority is the leading authority and does not necessarily respond to
movements in the debt-to-GDP ratio, while the central bank’s actions do not satisfy the Taylor prin-
ciple. The third policy regime captures the possibility of a con‡ict between the two authorities: The
central bank reacts strongly to in‡ation, while the …scal authority does not move taxes in response to
debt. In the language of Leeper (1991) these three regimes correspond to Active Monetary/Passive
Fiscal (AM/PF), Passive Monetary/Active Fiscal (PM/AF), and Active Monetary/Active Fiscal
(AM/AF), respectively.
    We …nd that the …scal authority was the leading authority from the late ’50s until the appointment
of Volcker. This event coincided with a change in the conduct of monetary policy at the end of 1979,
but the …scal authority accommodated such a change only at the end of 1981, after Reagan was
elected. The monetary authority has been the leading authority since then. In the late ’60s and mid-
70s monetary policy became active for short periods of time, but without a corresponding change in
the behavior of the …scal authority. Finally, our estimated transition matrix implies that the PM/AF
regime is the most recurrent regime and that when a con‡ict between the two authorities arises the
…scal authority prevails most of the time.
    We use actual and counterfactual impulse responses to understand the role of agents’beliefs and
how …scal disturbances propagate through the economy across di¤erent regimes. Under the PM/AF
the …scal authority is not committed to increasing taxation to keep the debt-to-GDP ratio balanced.
Therefore, a shock to government expenditure determines a long lasting increase in in‡ation. Given
that the Taylor principle does not hold, the central bank accommodates the increase in in‡ation,
the real interest rate falls, and growth accelerates. At the same time, agents revise expectations
about future short term interest rates upward causing a decline in the price of long term bonds. The
increase in growth, the drop in the price of long term bonds, and the low real interest rates determine
a decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio.


                                                                                                      3
    Under the AM/PF regime, instead, agents expect that the necessary …scal adjustments will be
made and the impact of the expenditure shock on in‡ation is largely reduced. However, given that
agents form expectations taking into account the possibility of regime changes, the increase in the
…scal burden still determines some in‡ationary pressure. The central bank tries to counteract the
increase in in‡ation, determining a small but persistent decline in real activity. These in‡ationary
e¤ects would disappear if the AM/PF regime were perceived as Fully credible, i.e. if agents expected
to remain under the AM/PF forever.
    Agents’beliefs also play a key role when a con‡ict between the two authorities arises, as in the
AM/AF regime. In this case, agents understand that the …scal authority is more likely to prevail
and that the additional …scal burden will be in‡ated away. Therefore, a positive …scal imbalance
determines an increase in in‡ation. However, now the central bank does not accommodate the
increase in in‡ation, pushing the economy into a recession. This results in a further increase in the
amount of debt that agents expect will be in‡ated away, determining additional in‡ationary pressure.
Therefore, if in‡ation is high as a result of a positive …scal imbalance, the central bank is not able
to bring in‡ation down without coordinating with the …scal authority. Finally, across all regimes
the in‡ationary e¤ects of …scal imbalances would disappear if the central bank were perceived to
be more likely to prevail in case of a con‡ict between the two authorities. This would make agents
con…dent about the possibility of moving to the AM/PF regime, regardless of the regime that they
are currently in.
    These model dynamics and the sequence of events that we uncover provide a uni…ed theory for
the stylized facts described above. Using counterfactual simulations in which the non-policy shocks
hitting the economy are left unchanged, we show that if the AM/PF regime had been in place for
the entire sample or if agents had been con…dent about the possibility of entering such a regime, the
Great In‡ation would not have occurred and the debt-to-GDP ratio would have been higher. This
is because in our model the rise in trend in‡ation and the low debt of the ’70s are two sides of the
same coin and are caused by a series of expenditure shocks that are largely in‡ationary only when
the PM/AF regime is in place. Consequently, the moment policymakers’behavior changes or agents
are con…dent that it will change in the near future, the in‡ationary shocks of the ’60s and 70s are
neutralized, trend in‡ation does not rise, and the debt-to-GDP ratio and real interest rates turn out
to be higher.
    In the same way the PM/AF regime plays a key role in explaining the Great In‡ation and the
contemporaneous decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio, the change in the policy mix at the end of 1981 is
the driving force behind the reversal of these dynamics and the large recession that occurred during
those years. To make this point, we construct a di¤erent set of counterfactual simulations in which
we restrict all the shocks that occurred after the end of 1979 to zero and then consider di¤erent
scenarios about the evolution of policymakers’ behavior. We argue that the change in monetary
policy at the end of 1979 did not cause a drop in in‡ation because it lacked the support of the …scal
authority. In this respect, this disin‡ationary attempt was similar to previous ones that occurred


                                                  4
in the ’60s and in the ’70s. It is only in the moment that the …scal authority accommodated the
change in monetary policy at the end of 1981 that in‡ation started falling. The resulting revision
in expectations about the way debt will be stabilized rationalizes the stylized facts described above,
with in‡ation experiencing a quick drop, the economy entering a recession, real interest rates rising
sharply, and debt increasing. If instead the switch to the AM/PF regime had not occurred, in‡ation
would have been higher for another …fteen years and the reversal in the debt-to-GDP dynamics
would not have occurred. Finally, the disin‡ation would have been faster and less painful if agents
had perceived the change in the policy mix as fully credible given that this would have made the
…scal imbalances inherited from the past not in‡ationary. Therefore, in our model, regime changes,
not a sequence of shocks, explain the events of the early ’80s.
    We then compute the model implied evolution of in‡ation expectations and we compare them
with the actual data. The model is able to replicate the smooth increase that started in the mid-
’60s, the absence of a signi…cant response to the appointment of Volcker and to the disin‡ationary
attempts of the late ’60s and mid-’70s, and the decline that started in the early ’80s. This is because
the change in the balance of power between the monetary and …scal authorities plays a key role
in explaining the break in the volatility and persistence of in‡ation that occurred in the early ’80s
(Stock and Watson, 2007, Benati, 2008, Cogley, Primiceri, and Sargent, 2010). When the monetary
authority accommodates the behavior of the …scal authority, in‡ation is substantially more volatile
and persistent, as was in fact the case over the …rst half of the sample, and …scal imbalances are
very important. Once the economy moves to the AM/PF regime the contribution of these shocks
to in‡ation volatility is substantially reduced and in‡ation becomes less volatile and persistent. The
fact that policy changes have pervasive e¤ects on the persistence and volatility of in‡ation provides
an important source of identi…cation. In fact, at longer horizons policy uncertainty turns out to be
even more important than breaks in the volatility of the exogenous shocks.
    Our empirical …ndings are consistent with historical accounts and anecdotes about the evolution
of the monetary/…scal policy interaction. For example, Meltzer (2009) argues that Martin and Burns
were heavily in‡uenced by the …scal authority in their decisions, while Volcker received full and public
support by the Reagan administration to put an end to the high in‡ation. Furthermore, we show
that the long term component of government expenditure experienced an acceleration after 1964,
when President Johnson made the …rst ever public reference to the Great Society, providing evidence
for the argument proposed by Bernanke that the …rst spur of in‡ation was triggered by …scal policy.
    The study of the interaction between …scal and monetary policies in determining in‡ation dynam-
ics goes back to the seminal contribution of Sargent and Wallace (1981), who consider the problem
in a deterministic environment, and proceeds with Leeper (1991), Sims (1994), and Woodford (1994,
1995, 2001) who focus on the problem of price determinacy.1 Cochrane (1998, 2001) takes a model-
free frictionless view of US in‡ation, in which a non-Ricardian regime is always in place and the real

for an alternative approach to price determination in monetary general equilibrium models.

interest is exogenously determined. Therefore, movements in in‡ation are explained by revisions in
future expected real surpluses and the debt policy implemented by the …scal authority. Our theoret-
ical framework is more similar to Leeper (1991), given that we allow for changes in policy rules in a
fully speci…ed DSGE model, but we follow Cochrane (1998, 2001) in recognizing the importance of
modeling a maturity structure of government debt. Our work is also related to Barro (1974), that
discusses under which circumstances non-Ricardian e¤ects arise in an overlapping generation model.
In this paper, non-Ricardian e¤ects arise in the moment that fully rational and in…nitely-lived agents,
in response to changes in policy makers’behavior, become aware that debt sustainability is not going
to be guaranteed by movements in primary surpluses.
    Orphanides (2002), Primiceri (2006), and Sargent, Williams, and Zha (2006) explain the rise
of in‡ation as the result of the evolution of central bank’s beliefs about the state or structure of
the economy. With respect to these studies, two important insights emerge from our work. First,
if in‡ation is high because of a lack of …scal discipline, disin‡ationary attempts by the monetary
authority lead to more in‡ation if not supported by the …scal authority. Second, changes in the
balance of power between the monetary and …scal authorities determine breaks in the persistence
and volatility of in‡ation. Therefore, some key features that in those papers have been attributed to
unforeseen structural breaks, such as a high sacri…ce ratio, a positive output gap, and high in‡ation
persistence, are in the context of our paper explained by changes in the monetary/…scal policy mix.
This implies that such features disappear the moment …scal discipline is restored.
    In our counterfactual simulations changes in policymakers’behavior have a signi…cant impact on
the dynamics of in‡ation. This is in sharp contrast with previous studies that conduct counterfactual
simulations focusing exclusively on monetary policy. In these studies replacing Burns with Volcker
would have implied only a minor reduction of in‡ation in the ’70s and removing the appointment of
Volcker in August ’79 would have only slightly delayed the return of in‡ation to the steady state.
This is because di¤erent monetary policy regimes only a¤ect how the burden of adverse shocks is
redistributed between output and in‡ation. Instead, when the entire policy mix is modi…ed a series
of …scal shocks that are in‡ationary under the PM/AF regime are completely neutralized when the
monetary authority is the leading authority.
    In our model, the government expenditure shocks a¤ect not only the …scal variables, but they
also contribute to the large and upward trending in‡ation of the 1970s. Therefore, our explanation
for the Great In‡ation implies additional data restrictions on the in‡ationary shocks from the set
of observables. In the previous literature the Great In‡ation is mostly caused by latent shocks,
whose only empirical discipline is dictated by the standard model cross-equation implications on the
observed data. In contrast, in our model the in‡ationary …scal shocks are further identi…ed by the
fact that the …scal block of the economy is included as part of the observables. In particular, we show
that these shocks resemble the low-frequency component of the observed government expenditure.
    As Davig and Leeper (2006), we …nd that …scal imbalances determine in‡ationary pressure even
under the AM/PF regime. These authors estimate Markov-switching Taylor and …scal rules, plugging


                                                  6
them into a calibrated DSGE model. Instead, in this paper we estimate the policy rules and the
other parameters of the model jointly. In this respect, the paper is related to the growing literature
that allows for parameter instability in DSGE models. Justiniano and Primiceri (2008) allow for
heteroskedasticity, while Schorfheide (2005), Liu, Waggoner, and Zha (2011), Bianchi (2013), Davig
and Doh (2014), Fernandez-Villaverde, Guerron-Quintana, and Rubio-Ramirez (2010), and Baele,
Bekaert, Cho, Inghelbrecht, and Moreno (2011) also model changes in the parameters of the Taylor
rule or the in‡ation target. Coibion and Gorodichenko (2011) study the consequences of the high
trend in‡ation of the ’70s for price determinacy. In our model we …nd very persistent movements in
in‡ation that resemble changes in trend in‡ation as a result of …scal shocks.
    The content of this paper can be summarized as follows. Section 2 describes the model. Section
3 presents the estimates. Section 4 conducts the counterfactual simulations. Section 5 shows that
the model can account for changes in in‡ation persistence and volatility and for the break in the
dynamics of in‡ation expectations. Section 6 puts our results into a historical perspective. Section 7
concludes.


2     The Model
We make use of a new-Keynesian model similar to the one employed by Clarida, Galí, and Gertler
(2000) and Lubik and Schorfheide (2004), augmented with a …scal block, external habits, and a
maturity structure for government debt. Furthermore, we allow for changes in policymakers’behavior
and stochastic volatility. These changes are modeled as two independent MS processes. We introduce
two state variables sp        vo
                       t and t , capturing the monetary policy regime and the volatility regime that
are in place at time t. Here and in what follows, sp and vo stand, respectively, for structural
parameters and volatilities. The state variables take on a …nite number of values jsp = 1; :::; msp
and jvo = 1; :::; mvo and evolve according to the transition matrices H sp and H vo ; respectively. More
details about the number and the nature of the regimes will be provided below.

there are two types of government bonds: One-period government bonds, Bts , in zero net supply
with price Pts and a more general portfolio of government bonds, Btm , in non-zero net supply with
price Ptm . The former debt instrument satis…es Pts = Rt 1 . The latter debt instrument has payment

where the parameter 1= t is the elasticity of substitution between two di¤erentiated goods. Firms
take as given the general price level, Pt , and the level of real activity, Yt . Whenever a …rm changes
its price, it faces quadratic adjustment costs represented by an output loss:

                                                             &     1 & 2

   Government. Imposing the restriction that one-period debt is in zero net supply, the ‡ow
budget constraint of the federal government is given by:

                              Ptm Btm = Btm 1 (1 + Ptm )       T t + Et + T P t

where Ptm Btm is the market value of debt and Tt and Et represent federal tax revenues and federal
expenditures, respectively. Government expenditure is the sum of federal transfers and goods pur-
chases: Et = Pt Gt + T Rt . The term T Pt is a shock that is meant to capture a series of features that
are not explicitly modeled here, such as changes in the maturity structure and the term premium.


                                                      8

debt, taxes, and expenditures as observables.2 We rewrite the federal government budget constraint

The long term component is assumed to be completely exogenous and it is meant to capture the
large programs that arise as the result of a political process that is not modeled here. Instead, the
short term component accounts for the response of government expenditure to the business cycle and
responds to the (log-linearized) output gap, ybt ybt . The total federal government expenditure is then
divided into transfers, T Rt , and government purchases, Gt . Market clearing requires Yt = Gt +Ct . We
then de…ne the variable t Pt Gt =Et to be the fraction of federal expenditure devoted to government
purchases and we assume that:

2.2    Monetary/Fiscal Policy Mix
Before describing the regime changes that we allow for, we illustrate the consequences of explicitly
modeling the behavior of the …scal authority. In order to do so, we shall simplify the two linearized
policy rules as follows:
                                 Ret = ; sp et and et = b; spebm
                                                               t 1
                                           t                t


If we then substitute the tax rule in the linearized law of motion for the debt-to-GDP ratio and
isolate the resulting coe¢ cient for lagged debt, we get:

                                             ebm =            1
                                                                    b;   sp   ebm + :::
                                               t                         t      t 1


    Leeper (1991) shows that, in absence of regime changes, we can distinguish four regions of the
parameter space according to existence and uniqueness of a solution to the model. These regions are
summarized in Table 1 and in general they are a function of all parameters of the model. However, in
practice, the two linearized policy rules are key in determining existence and uniqueness of a solution.
There are two determinacy regions. The …rst one, Active Monetary/Passive Fiscal (AM/PF), is the
most familiar one: The Taylor principle is satis…ed and the …scal authority moves taxes in order to
keep debt on a stable path:        ; sp
                                     t
                                        > 1 and b; sp
                                                   t
                                                      > 1 1. This last condition guarantees that the
               1
coe¢ cient          b; sp
                       t
                          is smaller than one, so that debt is mean reverting. Therefore, we can think
of …scal policy as passive to the extent that it passively accommodates the behavior of the monetary
authority ensuring debt stability. The second determinacy region, Passive Monetary/Active Fiscal
(PM/AF), is less familiar and corresponds to the case in which the …scal authority is not committed
to stabilizing the process for debt: b; sp t
                                             < 1 1. Now it is the monetary authority that passively
accommodates the behavior of the …scal authority, disregarding the Taylor principle and allowing
in‡ation to move in order to stabilize the process for debt:    ; sp
                                                                  t
                                                                     < 1. Under this regime, even in the
absence of distortionary taxation, shocks to transfers can have an impact on the macroeconomy as


                                                                   10
agents understand that they will not be followed by future o¤setting changes in the …scal variables.
Finally, when both authorities are active (AM/AF) no stationary equilibrium exists, whereas when
both of them are passive (PM/PF) the economy is subject to multiple equilibria.4
    In applied work, a lot of attention has been devoted to the AM/PF determinacy region and to
the problem of indeterminacy (see Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000), Lubik and Schorfheide (2004),
Coibion and Gorodichenko (2011), and Bhattarai, Lee, and Park (2012), among others). These
papers generally conduct a subsample analysis in which …scal policy is always assumed to be passive,
all parameters are allowed to change across subsamples, and agents are not aware of the possibility
of regime changes. Instead, in this paper, we are interested in investigating the role that the lack of
…scal discipline has played in the evolution of the macroeconomy in the past sixty years. Therefore,
our model allows for recurrent changes from an AM/PF regime to a PM/AF regime. The implicit
assumption is that over di¤erent periods of time the balance of power between the monetary and …scal
authorities might have changed. Furthermore, we do not rely on a subsample analysis and agents
are aware of regime changes. We also allow for transitory periods during which both authorities are
active. This allows us to capture situations in which one authority might try to become the leading
authority without the immediate accommodating behavior of the other. Such a regime combination
implies non-existence of a stationary equilibrium when in a …xed coe¢ cient environment, while when
allowing for regime changes its properties crucially depend on agents’beliefs about the authority that
will eventually prevail.
    Summarizing, we allow for a total of three policy regimes (PM/AF, AM/AF, and AM/PF) and
two volatility regimes. We assume the following transition matrices:

We also experimented with a full transition matrix H sp and we found very similar results. Such
a speci…cation is penalized when conducting model comparison because it involves two extra free
parameters in the transition matrix without a signi…cant increase in explanatory power. Further-
more, it also implies a signi…cant increase in the computational time. Considering more than three
policy regimes and at the same time allowing for stochastic volatility proved to be computationally
challenging. Given the importance of modeling stochastic volatility when studying the possibility of
structural changes, we settled on this speci…cation with three policy regimes that also emerged from
some previous work in which the nature of the regimes was unrestricted (see Bianchi (2012)).
    It is also worth pointing out that the assumption of not explicitly including the PM/PF regime
combination is less restrictive than what it could seem. To see why, recall that in a MS-DSGE
   4
     Following Woodford (1995), economists sometimes refer to the AM/PF regime with the term Ricardian, while the
term non-Ricardian is used for the PM/AF regime. However, this straightforward one-to-one mapping between the
policy mix and the terminology introduced by Woodford is possible only when assuming that agents are not aware of
regime changes.


                                                       11
model the transition matrix is pinned down by the frequency of regime changes and the model
dynamics that prevail under the di¤erent regimes. Furthermore, the law of motion under one regime
is a¤ected by the policy parameters under the alternative regimes. If the data were strongly favoring
the model dynamics implied by the PM/PF regime, this would be re‡ected in the estimation of
the transition matrix and of the policy parameters. Speci…cally, the estimated transition matrix and
policy parameters would be such that when under the PM/AF regime, agents would still be con…dent
that …scal adjustments would eventually be made. This would imply macroeconomic dynamics that
would be very similar, although not identical, to the ones associated with the PM/PF regime because
in both cases …scal imbalances would not have in‡ationary e¤ects. The two regimes would only di¤er
in the timing of the …scal adjustments, but the …scal mechanism would not arise. Instead, we will
show that the …scal mechanism is present in the estimates recovered in this paper. Later on, we will
also consider a counterfactual simulation that makes this point transparent (see Subsection 4.1).
    Finally, a rational expectations general equilibrium model with recurrent monetary policy changes
and agents aware of regime changes has already been studied in Bianchi (2013). In that paper, …scal
policy was implicitly assumed to always be passive, while monetary policy was moving between active
and passive. A key result of that paper, as well as of other related papers such as Sims and Zha (2006)
and Fernandez-Villaverde, Guerron-Quintana, and Rubio-Ramirez (2010), was that replacing Burns
with Volcker would not have been able to prevent the rise of in‡ation. Instead, as we shall see, in
our model changes in policy makers’behavior are going to have important e¤ects on macroeconomic
dynamics.


2.3    Solving and estimating the MS-DSGE model
The technology process At is assumed to have a unit root. The model is then rescaled and linearized
around the unique steady state (note that regime changes do not a¤ect the steady state). We employ
the solution algorithm proposed by Farmer, Waggoner, and Zha (2011). The authors show that
when a solution exists, it can be characterized as a regime-switching vector autoregression, of the
kind studied by Hamilton (1989), Chib (1996), and Sims and Zha (2006):

                                 sp sp                       sp sp
                      St = T (   t ;   ; H sp ) St 1   +R(   t ;   ; H sp ) Q ( vo
                                                                                t ;
                                                                                    vo
                                                                                       ) "t        (6)

where sp ; vo ; and St are vectors that contain the structural parameters, the stochastic volatilities,
and all the variables of the model, respectively.
    It is worth emphasizing that the law of motion of the model depends on the structural parameters
( ), the regime in place ( sp
  sp                                                                             sp
                             t ), and the probability of moving across regimes (H ). This means that
what happens under one regime does not only depend on the structural parameters describing that
particular regime but also on what agents expect is going to happen under alternative regimes and
on how likely it is that a regime change will occur in the future (see also Davig and Leeper (2007)).
In other words, agents’beliefs matter for the law of motion governing the economy.

    The law of motion (6) is combined with a system of observation equations. The likelihood is
computed with the modi…ed Kalman …lter described in Kim and Nelson (1999) and then combined
with a prior distribution for the parameters to obtain the posterior. As a …rst step, a block algorithm
is used to …nd the posterior mode, while a Metropolis algorithm is used to draw from the posterior
distribution. Please refer to Appendix B and Bianchi (2013) for more details.


3       Estimates
We include seven observables spanning the sample 1954:Q4-2009:Q3: real GDP growth, annualized
GDP de‡ator in‡ation, FFR, annualized debt-to-GDP ratio on a quarterly basis, federal tax revenues
to GDP ratio, federal expenditure to GDP ratio, and a transformation of government purchases to
GDP ratio. Appendix C describes the dataset in detail.


3.1     Parameters estimates and regime probabilities
Table 2 reports priors and posterior parameter estimates. The priors for the parameters that do not
move across regimes are in line with previous contributions in the literature and are relatively loose.
As for the parameters of the Taylor rule, the prior for the autoregressive component is symmetric
across regimes, whereas we have chosen asymmetric and truncated priors for the responses to in‡ation
and the output gap in line with the theoretical restrictions outlined in Subsection 2.2: Under Regime
1, monetary policy is passive, whereas under Regime 2 and Regime 3, monetary policy is active. In
a similar way, the priors for the response of taxes to government debt are asymmetric across the two
regimes: Under Regime 1 and Regime 2, this parameter is restricted to zero, whereas under Regime
3 it is expected to be fairly large. Overall, these priors imply that Regime 1, 2, and 3 belong to
the PM/AF, AM/AF, and AM/PF regions, respectively. In order to separate the short and long
term components of government expenditure we restrict the persistence of the long term component
                                                                        5
 eL = :99 and the standard deviation of its innovations eL = :1%.         Finally, we …x the discount
factor to :9985, and the average maturity to 5 years (this is controlled by the parameter ).6
    Regarding the parameters of the Taylor rule, under the AM/PF and AM/AF regimes the Federal
Funds rate reacts strongly to both in‡ation and the output gap. The opposite occurs under the
PM/AF regime. It is worth pointing out that the posterior estimates for the coe¢ cients of the Taylor
rule are relatively tight and the truncated priors are not binding. Under the PM/AF and AM/AF
regimes the response of taxes to debt is restricted to zero, while under the AM/PF regime it turns
out to be signi…cantly larger than the threshold value described in Subsection 2.2 ( 1 1 = :0015).
    5
     This choice imposes a constraint on the amount of macroeconomic volatility that can be explained by the long
term component. Our results are con…rmed when removing this constraint.
   6
     We evaluate the parameters’identi…cation strength for the AM/PF and PM/AF regimes, using …xed coe¢ cients
methods developed in Iskrev (2010a,b). We …nd that all parameters are identi…ed in both regimes along a wide range
of the prior support and that the …scal parameters are more strongly identi…ed in the PM/AF regime. We report
details in the online technical appendix.

Figure 2: Regime probabilities at the posterior mode. Top panel: Probability of the High Volatility regime. Middle

and Fed Chairmen. The light gray areas correspond to missing data.


As for the other structural parameters, it is worth pointing out that the parameter & capturing the
level of indexation with respect to lagged in‡ation is much smaller than what is generally obtained in
the literature. Section 5 will illustrate that regime changes can account for breaks in the persistence
of in‡ation.
    In a MS-DSGE the estimates of the transition matrix of the structural parameters are determined
by the realized regime sequence, but also by the model dynamics across the di¤erent regimes. It is
therefore useful to review the properties of the estimated transition matrix. Both the AM/PF regime
and the PM/AF regime are quite persistent, while under the AM/AF regime there is a very high
probability of moving to the PM/AF regime. The estimated parameter values have three important
implications that will be key to understand the results of this paper. First, the system spends a lot
of time under one of the two polar cases, the AM/PF and PM/AF regimes. Second, when …scal
policy is active, monetary policy is generally passive, with a few short lasting intervals during which
both policies are active. On the contrary, when the AM/PF regime is in place, movements to the
AM/AF are expected to be followed by the PM/AF regime, not by a return to the AM/PF regime.
Finally, even if the AM/PF regime is the most persistent regime, the ergodic probability of being in
the PM/AF regime is 0:74, while the ergodic probability of the AM/PF regime is 0:21, implying that
the PM/AF regime is the most recurrent one.
    The …rst panel of Figure 2 reports the probability of the High Volatility regime. This captures
some key macroeconomic events, such as the 1974 oil shock, the high volatility of the FFR during the
reserve targeting period of the early ’80s, the 1991 recession, the 2001 recession and subsequent Bush’s
tax cuts, and the 2008 …nancial crisis. It is worth emphasizing that the pattern for the high volatility
regime looks somehow di¤erent from the one found in studies that focus exclusively on changes in
the conduct of monetary policy. Section 5 will illustrate that changes in the monetary/…scal policy
mix is in itself an important source of macroeconomic volatility.


                                                             15
    The second panel of Figure 2 shows the smoothed probabilities assigned to the three policy
regimes. Active …scal policy turns out to be in place for a large part of the …rst half of the sample.
Over the same period of time, monetary policy is generally passive, even if we observe some probability
of switches to the active regime, most noticeably at the end of the ’60s. The estimates capture
remarkably well the change in the conduct of monetary policy that occurred with the appointment of
Paul Volcker in August ’79. Monetary policy becomes active, while …scal policy stays active. Then we
observe a brief return to the PM/AF regime, followed again by a period during which both authorities
behave according to active rules. It is only at the end of 1981 that …scal policy accommodates the
switch in the conduct of monetary policy moving from the active to the passive policy rule. The
AM/PF policy mix has been in place since then.
    We will explicitly link the timing of the regime changes to historical accounts of the interaction
between the …scal and monetary authorities in Section 6, once the consequences of changes in the
monetary/…scal policy mix will be well understood. In the meantime, it is enough to highlight that
these results point toward a substantial change in the balance of power between the monetary and
…scal authorities. As suggestive evidence, the lower panel of Figure 2 reports the number of meetings
between the US President and the Fed Chairman over a year.7 It is quite interesting that such
meetings were substantially more frequent before the appointment of Volcker than afterwards. The
average number of meetings per year was 14:87 over the period 1964 1979, while it dropped to 2
over the period 1980 2001.


3.2     Impulse response analysis
This section analyzes in detail how changes in policymakers’behavior or in agents’beliefs a¤ect the
propagation of the shocks through the economy. In the …rst subsection, we focus on the di¤erence
across regimes, while in the second and third subsections we …rst emphasize the role of agents’beliefs
in determining the properties of the AM/PF and PM/AF regimes and then we analyze the e¤ects of
a transition from the PM/AF regime to the AM/AF regime in order to shed light on the events of
the early ’80s.

3.2.1    Actual impulse responses

Figure 3 reports the responses of GDP, in‡ation, FFR, debt-to-GDP, and the real FFR to shocks
to long term expenditure, the FFR, and preferences for each of the three regimes identi…ed in the
estimates: PM/AF (solid blue line), AM/AF (dashed-dotted black line), and AM/PF (dashed red
line). The impulse responses are computed conditional on being in a particular regime for 40 quarters.
However, the implied law of motion re‡ects the possibility of regime changes.

PM/AF, AM/AF, and AM/PF.


    Government expenditure, In‡ation, and Agents’ Beliefs. The …rst column reports the
responses to a shock to the long term component of government expenditure. The di¤erence between
the PM/AF and AM/PF regime is particularly striking. Under the PM/AF regime, agents anticipate
that with high probability the increase in expenditure will not be fully covered by future …scal
adjustments. This determines an increase in in‡ation that is accommodated by the central bank.
Given that the Taylor principle does not hold, we observe a prolonged period of negative real interest
rates and an increase in output. These e¤ects, combined with a decline in the price of long term
bonds due to higher expected future short term interest rates, determine a drop in the debt-to-GDP
ratio. Under the AM/PF regime the increase in in‡ation is substantially smaller and generates only
a modest increase in real activity. This is because, under the AM/PF regime the …scal authority
is committed to move taxes in order to cover the …scal imbalance resulting from the increase in
expenditure. However, the impact of the shock on in‡ation is not zero because agents are aware of
the possibility of regime changes. Therefore, even if the …scal authority is making the necessary …scal
adjustments today, there is always the possibility that in the future the economy will move back to
the PM/AF regime. This result is in line with what was obtained by Davig and Leeper (2006) in a
calibrated model and by Davig, Chung, and Leeper (2007) in an analytical example.
    The AM/AF regime combines the properties of the other two regimes. Given that from the
AM/AF regime the estimated probability of moving to the PM/AF regime is very high, the increase


                                                                                        17
in the long term component of expenditure determines an increase in in‡ation. However, under this
regime, the central bank does not accommodate the increase in in‡ation and the FFR eventually
rises. This determines a decline in real activity that in turn makes the …scal burden even larger. As
a result in‡ation keeps increasing, while output keeps declining.
    The ability to control in‡ation. The second column of Figure 3 reports the responses to
a monetary policy shock. Under all regimes, the Federal Reserve retains the ability to generate
a recession and an initial decline in in‡ation. However, under the PM/AF and AM/AF regimes,
the monetary policy shock back…res. This is because the increase in the real cost of debt and the
associated recession make the debt burden larger, calling for an increase in in‡ation. This "stepping
on a rake" e¤ect (Sims, 2011) implies that the central bank’s ability to control in‡ation is lost the
moment that its actions are not adequately supported by the …scal authority. The response of the
debt-to-GDP ratio is also substantially di¤erent across the two regimes: Under the AM/PF regime,
the ratio increases quickly due to the decline in output and high real interest rates, whereas under
the PM/AF regime we observe only a modest increase, due to the slowdown of the economy, followed
by a smooth decline as a consequence of the high in‡ation.
    An economic slowdown. The last column of Figure 3 considers the consequences of an economic
slowdown caused by a negative preference shock. Across all regimes such a shock determines a
reduction in real activity and an initial decline in in‡ation, in line with standard predictions of new-
Keynesian models. However, when the PM/AF and AM/AF regimes are in place, this initial decline
is soon followed by a rise in in‡ation. This is because the recession determines an increase of the
…scal burden that is in‡ationary only when agents expect to spend many periods out of the AM/PF
regime.

3.2.2   Monetary/Fiscal Policy Mix and Agents’Beliefs

To highlight the role played by agents’beliefs in the propagation of …scal disturbances, we compare
the benchmark impulse responses with two counterfactual scenarios. In the …rst counterfactual
scenario, we modify the transition matrix in a way to make the AM/PF regime the most frequent
policy mix. Speci…cally, conditional on leaving the AM/AF regime, the probability of moving to the
                                         sp       sp
PM/AF regime is decreased by 60%: H12       and H32  move from :6236 to :2494 and from :0262 to :4003;
                      sp
respectively, while H22 is left unchanged. This implies that now policymakers are expected to spend
a lot of time in the AM/PF regime with only brief periods during which both policies are active.
Once in a while from the AM/AF regime they move to the PM/AF regime, but given the estimated
persistence of this regime, agents are in general con…dent about a return to the AM/PF regime. We
denote this scenario Con…dence counterfactual. In the second counterfactual scenario, we assume that
the AM/PF policy mix is the only possible one. We refer to this scenario as Fully credible AM/PF
regime. Notice that this case corresponds to the textbook version of the new-Keynesian model in

the PM/AF policy mix under the benchmark case and the Con…dence counterfactual. Notice that
now the e¤ect on in‡ation is absent. This is because agents are con…dent that the necessary …scal
adjustments will eventually be made. We still observe an increase in GDP, but this is simply due to
the fact that the increase in expenditure also determines an increase in the amount of goods bought
by the government. Given that this does not a¤ect the output gap, the expansion in real activity is
not in‡ationary. Finally, we do not observe the decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio and the prolonged
period of low real interest rates that characterize the benchmark case.
    The second column of Figure 4 considers the same shock under the benchmark AM/PF regime
and the counterfactual Fully credible AM/PF. Notice that in this second case we do not observe any
increase in in‡ation, in line with what is predicted by the textbook version of the new-Keynesian
model with no distortionary taxation. The increase in output is instead more pronounced. This is
because under the benchmark case the central bank tries to …ght the in‡ationary pressure that results
from the …scal shock. In the counterfactual scenario there is no need to do so, given that there is no
rise in in‡ation and the output increase leaves the output gap substantially unchanged.
    Finally, it is worth emphasizing that the response of the macroeconomy to an expenditure shock
under the Con…dence counterfactual PM/AF regime is extremely similar to what is implied by the
counterfactual Fully credible AM/PF regime, even if the policy rules di¤er across the two regimes.

Figure 5: Impulse responses to a one standard deviation increase in the long term component of government expen-
diture that occurs under the PM/AF regime. Three years after the shock we consider three di¤erent cases. Under the
red dashed line policymakers immediately switch to the counterfactual Fully Credible AM/PF regime. Under the solid
blue line, the economy moves to the AM/AF regime, and after a year it returns to the PM/AF regime. Instead, under
the black dashed-dotted line, the economy again spends a year under the AM/AF, but then moves to the AM/PF
regime.


In both cases, the increase in expenditure does not lead to in‡ation because agents expect that the
necessary …scal adjustments will be made. Given that taxation is non-distortionary, the di¤erence in
the timing of the …scal adjustments does not a¤ect the behavior of the macroeconomy. This result
does not hold for all shocks and it illustrates an important point: Fiscal imbalances are in‡ationary
whenever there is a lack of commitment to make the necessary …scal adjustments.

3.2.3    From PM/AF to AM/PF: A sudden disin‡ation

In this subsection, we are interested in inspecting the mechanism behind the failed attempts to
disin‡ate of the ’70s and the successful disin‡ation of the early ’80s. Furthermore, we will shed light
on why these attempts were so costly in terms of output losses.
    Figure 5 reports the responses of GDP, in‡ation, FFR, debt-to-GDP ratio, the real FFR, and
tax revenues-to-GDP ratio to a one standard deviation increase in the long term component of
government expenditure. The initial shock occurs under the PM/AF regime. Three years after the
shock, we consider three di¤erent scenarios. In the …rst two, the economy moves to the AM/AF
regime and spends a year under such a regime. After that, two di¤erent cases are considered. In
the …rst scenario, solid blue line, policymakers return to the PM/AF regime. In the second case,
black dashed-dotted line, policymakers move to the AM/PF regime. Finally, in the third scenario
instead of entering the AM/AF regime, policymakers immediately move to the AM/PF policy mix
and are able to convince agents that they will never leave such regime (red dashed line). This last
case corresponds to a switch to the counterfactual Fully credible AM/PF regime.
    Several aspects of this simulation are worth emphasizing. The initial response of the macroecon-
omy coincides with what is described in the previous subsection: Agents expect that the increase

                                                                                                20
in expenditure will not be followed by …scal adjustments and as a result in‡ation and real activity
increase. When policymakers move to the AM/AF regime, the central bank is able to generate a
sizeable contraction in real activity. However, the impact on in‡ation is minimal because agents ex-
pect a return to the PM/AF regime with very high probability. Therefore, the implied sacri…ce ratio,
measured by the ratio between the cost of lower output and the gains in terms of lower in‡ation, is
very high in this case.
    If then policymakers switch back to the PM/AF regime, in‡ation returns to a value that is
higher than what would have been if the switch to the AM/AF regime had never occurred. This is
because the …scal burden has in the meantime increased due to the e¤ect of the recession. If instead
policymakers move to the AM/PF regime, the economy experiences a sudden drop in in‡ation and
a recession. Notice that the central bank’s behavior is unchanged across the AM/AF and AM/PF
regimes. Therefore, the drop in in‡ation is not due to a change in monetary policy, but to the change
in the behavior of the …scal authority that triggers a revision in agents’ beliefs about the way the
…scal burden will be …nanced. Despite the sudden drop, in‡ation does not go all the way down to the
steady state. Instead, it stabilizes around a positive value that re‡ects the possibility of a return to
the PM/AF regime and the fact that the …scal burden has not been fully reabsorbed yet. Given that
monetary policy is now active, the central bank reacts more than one-to-one to in‡ation, determining
a positive real interest rate that in turn pushes output below its own steady state. Notice that these
dynamics are in line with the impulse responses shown in the …rst column of Figure 4.
    It is important to emphasize that after the switch to the AM/PF regime the tax-to-GDP ratio
declines with respect to the period that precedes the switch. This occurs for two reasons. First the
economy experiences a contraction and our …scal rule allows for automatic stabilizers. Second, even if
now the …scal authority is committed to increase taxes in order to cover the increase in expenditure,
the debt-to-GDP ratio is below its steady state at the time of the regime change, implying that there
is no need of an immediate increase in taxes. In other words, at the time of the switch, part of the
debt burden has already been erased by in‡ation. It is only in the long run that the tax-to-GDP ratio
starts to slowly increase in response to the increase in debt. In fact, when the economy moves to the
AM/PF regime, we observe a sudden reversal in the dynamics of the debt-to-GDP ratio. The increase
is determined by the recession and the sudden increase in real interest rates, but a revaluation e¤ect
determined by the revision in the expected path for future short term interest rates contributes to
the initial jump. If instead the economy returns to the PM/AF regime, the debt-to-GDP ratio keeps
declining.
    It is then instructive to compare this disin‡ation with what is implied by a switch to the Fully
credible AM/PF regime. First of all, in‡ation now drops immediately to the steady state. This is
because agents are not concerned about the possibility of a return to the PM/AF regime. Conse-
quently, there is no in‡ationary pressure to be fought by the central bank and as a result output does
not experience the prolonged slowdown associated with the benchmark AM/PF regime. Notice that
these di¤erent outcomes are not due to di¤erences in the behavior of the …scal authority. The …scal


                                                  21
rule is unchanged across the two simulations, except for the short period during which both policy
authorities are active, as illustrated by the behavior of the tax-to-GDP ratio in the right lower-right
panel of Figure 5. It is also interesting to notice how the increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio is faster
under the benchmark AM/PF regime than under the Fully credible AM/PF regime. This re‡ects the
larger decline in real activity and the increase in the cost of …nancing debt caused by the possibility
of a return to the PM/AF regime.
    Summarizing, several lessons can be drawn from these simulations. Following an increase in the
…scal burden, a short period of active monetary and active …scal policies lead to an output contraction,
but not to a visible change in in‡ation. This is because the change in monetary policy is not supported
by a change in …scal policy and agents expect that the …scal authority will eventually prevail. It is
only in the moment that the …scal authority accommodates the behavior of the monetary authority
that in‡ation drops. However, the fact that the …scal burden has not been completely reabsorbed
implies in‡ationary pressure. In an attempt to contrast such in‡ationary pressure the central bank
determines a prolonged slowdown in real activity. These dynamics would completely disappear and
in‡ation would immediately go back to the steady state if agents were convinced that policymakers
will never return to the PM/AF regime or if the …scal burden were largely reabsorbed at the moment
of the switch. These results will be very important to understand the counterfactual simulations of
the next section.


4    Counterfactual analysis
One of the most interesting exercises that can be implemented when working with models that allow
for regime changes consists of simulating what would have happened under alternative scenarios.
Structural shocks are backed-out using the estimates and then used to simulate an economy subject
to the same disturbances, but with interesting changes in the way policymakers behave. This kind
of analysis is even more meaningful in the context of the MS-DSGE model employed in this paper.
First of all, like a standard DSGE model, the MS-DSGE can be re-solved for alternative policy rules:
The entire law of motion changes in a way that is consistent with the new assumptions around the
behavior of the two authorities. Furthermore, the solution depends on agents’beliefs. This means
that beliefs counterfactuals, as introduced in Bianchi (2013), can be explored: In these counterfactuals
agents are endowed with speci…c beliefs about alternative scenarios.
    In what follows, we will make use of both traditional and beliefs counterfactuals to establish the
following results. First, if the AM/PF had been in place over the entire sample, we would not have
observed the rise in trend in‡ation, from which we conclude that the prevalence of the PM/AF regime
during the ’60s and the ’70s is important to understand the Great In‡ation. Second, if during the
’70s agents had been con…dent about moving to the AM/PF regime, the Great In‡ation would not
have occurred. Third, in the context of our model, changes in policymakers’behavior, not a series of
shocks, explains the dynamics of in‡ation, debt, output and real interest rates during the early ’80s.

4.1     The Great In‡ation
What caused the rise in trend in‡ation in the ’70s? A series of adverse shocks, policymakers’behavior,
or a combination of the two? In order to answer these questions we simulate an economy in which the
sequence of non-policy shocks is kept unchanged, while policymakers are assumed to behave according
to the AM/PF regime over the entire sample. Consistently with this assumption, we assume that
agents regard the AM/PF regime as the only possible one. This corresponds to the case of the
Fully credible AM/PF regime described above. Notice that this simulation implies a change in both
policymakers’behavior and agents’beliefs.
    Figure 6 shows the change in GDP and real interest rates and the actual (dashed red line) and
counterfactual series (solid blue line) for in‡ation, FFR, and debt-to-GDP ratio. It is apparent that
under these assumptions the economy would have experienced a substantially lower level of in‡ation:
While the high frequency movements, such as the one associated with the oil crises of the ’70s, are
substantially una¤ected, the economy would not have experienced the rise in trend in‡ation. Real
interest rates would have been substantially higher in the ’70s, while they would not have increased
sharply during the ’80s. Symmetrically, during the …rst half of the sample output losses would have
been relatively large, with a peak of around 3.5% in correspondence of the two oil crises. However,
given that in‡ation would not have experienced the run-up observed in the data, the economy would
have been able to avoid the painful recession associated with the Volcker disin‡ation. The debt-
to-GDP ratio would have been slightly smaller during the ’60s, but it would have increased rapidly
during the ’70s, despite passive …scal policy, because of lower growth and higher real interest rates.8

    Appendix D shows that similar results are obtained when the counterfactual Fully credible AM/PF regime is
replaced with the benchmark AM/PF regime. In this second case, agents do not regard the AM/PF regime as the
only possible one. We report results for the Fully credible AM/PF regime because they are more robust to the Lucas’

Figure 7: The Great In‡ation: Con…dence. Counterfactual simulation in which all shocks and regime sequences are

reports the change in the real interest rate and GDP. The remaining three panels report actual and counterfactual
series for in‡ation, FFR, and debt-to-GDP ratio.


    Based on the previous counterfactual simulation, we can conclude that if policymakers’behavior
had been di¤erent, the Great In‡ation of the ’70s would not have occurred. It is then interesting to
understand, for given policymakers’behavior, what role agents’beliefs played in the rise of in‡ation.
This second counterfactual asks what would have happened if since 1955 agents had been con…dent
about the possibility of moving to the AM/PF equilibrium. Speci…cally, we keep the estimated shocks
and regime sequence unchanged, but modify the transition matrix of the policy regimes as in the
Con…dence counterfactual described in Subsection 3.2.2. It is worth pointing out that this is a pure
beliefs counterfactual, given that policymakers’behavior is left unchanged, while agents’beliefs are
modi…ed.
    Figure 7 contains the results. During the ’70s in‡ation would have moved around the steady state
without the persistent increase in trend in‡ation. Once again, real interest rates would have been
higher in the ’60 and ’70s, and substantially lower in the early 80s, showing a much smoother path
with respect to the data. Symmetrically, output would have been substantially lower in the ’70s,
but the economy would have avoided the deep recession of the early ’80s. Finally, the series for debt
would have been substantially larger with respect to the actual data and also with respect to the
…rst counterfactual simulation. This should not be surprising, given that the tax rule in place still
implies no response to the level of debt and in‡ation does not help in eliminating the …scal burden.
    Summarizing, these counterfactual simulations suggest that policymakers’behavior and agents’
beliefs about future policymakers’behavior played a key role in the rise of trend in‡ation and the
decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio observed during the ’70s. If in the ’70s agents had been con…dent
about the regime change that was going to occur a few years ahead or policymakers had followed the
AM/PF regime, the Great In‡ation would not have occurred. Furthermore, the debt-to-GDP ratio
critique.

would have been larger during the ’70s, implying that the low debt and the high in‡ation of the ’70s
are the two sides of the same coin.


4.2     Revisiting the Volcker disin‡ation
In this last counterfactual simulation we ask what would have happened if the regime changes of the
early ’80s had not occurred. This simulation allows us to investigate the role of the switch to the
AM/PF that occurred at the end of 1981 and the importance of the transitory period that preluded
such an event during which both monetary and …scal policies were active. In order to isolate the
e¤ects of regime changes, we set all the shocks starting from the last quarter of 1979 to zero and
we construct three counterfactual simulations: The …rst assumes that at the end of 1981, after the
transitory period of AM/AF, policymakers reverted to the PM/AF regime instead of moving to the
AM/PF regime (dotted magenta line), the second keeps the regime sequence unchanged (solid blue
line), the last one assumes that in the last quarter of 1979 policymakers immediately moved to the
AM/PF policy mix and managed to convince agents that they will never abandon it (black dashed
line). This corresponds to the Fully credible AM/PF regime. Figure 8 presents the counterfactual
and actual series. In interpreting these results, the reader might …nd useful to refer to the impulse
responses presented in Subsection 3.2.3.
    Several important facts stand out. First, even if monetary policy is already active as a result of
the appointment of Volcker in August 1979, in‡ation does not drop immediately. This is because
agents expect to revert back to the PM/AF with high probability. It is only when …scal policy
accommodates the change in monetary policy that in‡ation experiences the large drop observed in


                                                              25
the data. Without the switch to the AM/PF regime at the end of 1981, in‡ation would have been
above target for a long time, even if all the shocks have been set to zero. Second, even if following
the switch to the AM/PF regime in‡ation experiences a large drop, it does not go to the steady state
as it would if the regime change were perceived as once and for all. This is because the possibility
of a return to the PM/AF regime combined with the still large …scal burden inherited from the past
determines in‡ationary pressure. Third, if the regime change had not occurred, the economy would
not have experienced the recession associated with the Volcker disin‡ation, as the positive change in
output shows. This is not the case when the regime change is maintained. Finally, when the regime
change is kept, the model is able to match the turnaround in the path of the debt-to-GDP ratio that
suddenly starts increasing, moves above the steady state, and then approaches it from above. On the
contrary, when the regime change is removed, the variable shows an extremely smooth behavior and
approaches the steady state from below.
    Overall, these results show that the regime change, and not the shocks, accounts for three impor-
tant stylized facts observed during the early ’80s: The sudden drop in in‡ation, the large recession
associated with the Volcker disin‡ation, and the sudden change in debt dynamics. The results also
explain why in‡ation did not drop as soon as Volcker attempted to bring it down at the end of
1979 and why it did not immediately stabilize on the target/steady state level once …scal policy
accommodated the change in monetary policy.


4.3    Discussion
The impulse responses presented in Subsection 3.2 are helpful to interpret the counterfactual simu-
lations shown above. First, they illustrate that the rise in trend in‡ation can be explained by a lack
of …scal discipline that made a series of …scal shocks in‡ationary and undermined the ability of the
monetary authority to control in‡ation. In fact, the joint behavior of in‡ation and debt in response
to a long term expenditure shock under the PM/AF regime is in line with what was observed over the
…rst half of the sample, with a persistent increase in in‡ation and a slow-moving decline in the debt-
to-GDP ratio. Second, they illustrate why the increase in trend in‡ation practically disappears when
the AM/PF regime is imposed over the entire sample or agents are con…dent about the possibility
of moving to such a regime: In both cases, the …scal shocks that are in‡ationary under the PM/AF
regime, are completely neutralized and the Federal Reserve regains its ability to control in‡ation.
In the …rst case, this occurs because agents are not concerned about the possibility of returning to
the PM/AF regime, while in the con…dence counterfactual the result is exclusively driven by the
expectation mechanism: Agents are con…dent that at some point in the future the policy mix will
change and this is enough to neutralize the e¤ects of current policymakers’behavior. Finally, not all
shocks that a¤ect in‡ation can be completely stabilized. For example, in the short run the impact of
a mark-up shock on in‡ation is substantially una¤ected by the regime change. This explains why the
counterfactual simulations determine a drastic change in the behavior of in‡ation at low frequencies,
while they have little impact on its movements at medium and high frequencies.

                                                 26
    The impulse responses of Subsection 3.2.3 are useful to understand why the attempts to disin‡ate
of the ’70s were unsuccessful and why the Volcker disin‡ation was still quite painful. If the monetary
authority tries to disin‡ate without the necessary support of the …scal authority, the result is a
negligible decline in in‡ation associated with a sizeable contraction in output. In the moment that
the attempt is aborted, in‡ation returns to a value that is larger than what it would have been if
the monetary policy had never changed behavior. This "stepping on a rake" e¤ect represents a key
ingredient in linking our results to the work of Primiceri (2006), Cogley and Sargent (2005), and
Sargent, Williams, and Zha (2006). In these papers the rise and fall of in‡ation result from the
evolution of the central banks’beliefs about the structure of the economy. A central insight of these
papers is that the Federal Reserve might have been reluctant to bring in‡ation down in the ’70s
because of the perceived trade-o¤ between in‡ation and output growth. Our results suggest that this
trade-o¤ was in fact there and was due to a lack of coordination between the monetary and …scal
authorities. The moment the central bank tries to take the initiative and reduce in‡ation without
coordinating with the …scal authority, the result is a recession and a further increase in in‡ation.
    Bianchi (2013) and Fernandez-Villaverde, Guerron-Quintana, and Rubio-Ramirez (2010) have
conducted counterfactual simulations in micro-founded models focusing on the consequences of changes
in monetary policy only, assuming that a passive …scal policy is always in place. A common …nding
is that replacing Burns with Volcker would have implied only a minor reduction of in‡ation in the
’70s. In a similar way, removing the appointment of Volcker in August ’79 would have only slightly
delayed the return of in‡ation to the steady state. This is because di¤erent monetary policy regimes
only a¤ect how the burden of adverse shocks is redistributed between output and in‡ation. Instead,
when a change in the entire policy mix is considered a series of …scal shocks that are in‡ationary
under the PM/AF regime are completely neutralized if the AM/PF regime is the only possible one
or if it occurs very frequently.
    Given the central role played by …scal shocks, it is important to document that the model does
not imply an unrealistic behavior for the long term component of government expenditure. The top
panel of Figure 9 reports the model implied long term component of expenditure,9 showing that in
fact the variable increases steadily in the ’70s, but also that its behavior is remarkably smooth and
arguably similar to what would be obtained by pre-…ltering the data. The second panel reports the
long term component innovations. It is worth emphasizing that the most notable acceleration in the
long term component occurs after the President Johnson’s …rst ever public reference to the ’Great
Society’that took place during a speech on May 7, 1964 at Ohio University (marked by the vertical
bar).
    Therefore, the model provides support for the argument proposed by Bernanke (2003) that the
early manifestation of the Great In‡ation can be tracked back to the Great Society initiatives. At the
same time, it is important to keep in mind that these shocks are in‡ationary only when agents expect
the PM/AF regime to prevail for a long time. If the AM/PF regime had been in place, the increase

not have found it fully credible that future administrations would have taken the necessary steps to
cover the higher level of expenditure.


5     In‡ation Expectations, Persistence, and Volatility
We will now show that the changes in the monetary/…scal policy mix identi…ed in this paper can
account for the evolution of in‡ation expectations and the decline in the persistence and volatility of
in‡ation that has been documented by Stock and Watson (2007).


5.1     In‡ation expectations and persistence
The solid-circled blue line in the …rst panel of Figure 10 reports the model implied one-year-ahead
in‡ation expectations. These are computed taking into account the possibility of regime changes
using the methods outlined in Bianchi (2014). The series tracks remarkably well the evolution
of three popular measures of in‡ation expectations: The Survey of Professional Forecasters (black
dotted-dashed line), the Michigan survey (red dashed line), and the Livingston survey (solid green
line). In‡ation expectations are well anchored at the beginning of the sample, while starting from
the mid-60s they experience a smooth and persistent increase. As in the data, in‡ation expectations
do not move in response to the disin‡ationary attempts of the late ’60s and mid-70s and to the
appointment of Volcker. Only when the change in the whole policy mix occurs at the end of 1981,
in‡ation expectations drop. We then observe a slight downward trend that lasts until the early 2000s.
In the data, the drop in in‡ation expectations that followed the disin‡ation of the early-80s is more

gradual than in the model. Bianchi and Melosi (2012, 2013) consider models in which agents have
to learn the likely duration of a change in policymakers’behavior. In that class of models, it would
take time for agents to become convinced that the switch to the AM/PF regime is going to last for a
long time. Therefore, the smooth decline in in‡ation expectations would re‡ect concerns about the
possibility of a return to the policies of the ’70s that become less and less relevant as more time is
spent under the AM/PF regime. Estimating a version of this model with such a learning mechanism
is certainly interesting, but also computationally challenging. We regard this as material for future
research.
    To highlight the role played by changes in the monetary/…scal policy mix, we also report what
in‡ation expectations would have been if the AM/PF regime had been in place (dotted magenta line).
Notice that we keep the current state of the economy unchanged implying that only expectations are
counterfactual. In this case, the model would completely miss the run-up of in‡ation expectations.
This is because rational agents, observing the AM/PF regime in place today, would expect a quick
disin‡ation, no matter how high in‡ation is.
    To understand why changes in the policy mix help in matching the behavior of in‡ation expecta-
tions, the second panel of Figure 10 reports the historical evolution of in‡ation persistence as implied
by the model. The gray area denotes periods during which …scal policy is active. Two patterns
stand out. First, moving from the low volatility to the high volatility regime determines only a small
drop in in‡ation persistence when …scal policy is active. Second, the most drastic change in in‡ation
persistence is determined by the switch to the AM/PF regime at the end of 1981. The model implied
in‡ation persistence moves from around :94 to around :55. These values are very close to the values
of in‡ation persistence as observed in the data (see horizontal lines in the graph), implying that
the model can account for the break in in‡ation persistence documented in the literature. This, in
turn, helps in explaining why in‡ation expectations move so closely with actual in‡ation before the

                                                                    29
disin‡ation of the early ’80s, but not after.
    The fact that the model can account for the path of in‡ation expectations is important when
considering alternative theories of the rise of in‡ation. Among the most fascinating is certainly
the one proposed by Orphanides (2002) that argues that policymakers in the 1970s overestimated
potential output leading to overexpansionary policies, which ultimately resulted in high in‡ation.
After noticing that our model predicts a positive output gap in the ’70s, implying that the two
explanations are not mutually exclusive, it is worth pointing out that the path of in‡ation expectations
seems to play in favor of the story proposed in this paper. First, in‡ation and in‡ation expectations
started moving in the mid-’60s and kept increasing steadily until the early ’80s. This pattern seems
to require that not only policymakers were wrong, but they were increasingly wrong. Furthermore,
as pointed out by Levin and Taylor (2012), the timing is not entirely consistent with the evolution
of policymakers’beliefs suggested by Orphanides (2002), who argues that policymakers’beliefs were
especially far from the truth in the ’70s. Instead, in the data in‡ation expectations started moving
before that. Second, under the assumption that policymakers’beliefs about the economy are wrong,
while their goals are unchanged, agents should have expected a fairly quick return to steady state
in‡ation, unless we are willing to assume that the public had a clear understanding of the learning
process faced by the Fed and a sort of pessimism about its ability to get to the truth. Finally,
in‡ation expectations did not seem to react at all to the disin‡ationary attempts of the ’60s and ’70s
and to the appointment of Volcker, while they started moving around 1981.
    Our model rationalizes all of these aspects. First, in‡ation and in‡ation expectations started
moving in correspondence to large …scal disturbances. Second, in‡ation is expected to quickly return
to the target only if a switch to the AM/PF occurs. Otherwise, in‡ation and in‡ation expectations
move very closely due to the high in‡ation persistence that arises in the moment that the …scal
authority is perceived as the dominant authority. Finally, in‡ation expectations do not respond to a
disin‡ationary attempt of the monetary authority unless this is backed by the …scal authority.
    The ability of the model to replicate the behavior of in‡ation expectations also implies that
it is able to track the path of the real interest rate. Figure 11 compares the actual path of the
ex-ante one-year real interest rate, computed taking the di¤erence between the FFR and the one-
year-ahead Livingston in‡ation expectations, with its model implied counterpart (solid blue line)
and the counterfactual series in which the current state of the economy is kept unchanged, but
policymakers behave according to the AM/PF regime (red dotted line). The model is clearly able to
account for the prolonged period of low and negative interest rates that characterized the ’70s. On
the other hand, under the counterfactual series, the real interest rate would have been substantially
larger. Notice that, except for the two disin‡ationary attempts of the late ’60s and ’73/’74, ex-ante
real interest rates were extremely low during a period in which in‡ation was constantly trending
up. This was true even toward the end of the ’70s, when in‡ation was getting out of control. Levin
and Taylor (2012) suggest that this pattern is problematic for those papers that aim at explaining
in‡ation through a misperception of the sacri…ce ratio because a policy maker that is concerned

about the cost of disin‡ation would be very adverse to allow for a further increase of in‡ation at the
end of the ’70s. In our model, the very low real interest rate can instead be rationalized in light of
the dominant role played by the …scal authority. Finally, the model captures the reversal in the real
interest rate in the early ’80s as a result of a switch to the AM/PF regime.
    The ability to generate a break of in‡ation persistence is also important when relating our results
to the work of Primiceri (2006) who explains the rise of in‡ation with a model in which policymakers
are uncertain about the true structure of the economy. A key ingredient to obtain the rise of in‡ation
consists in assuming a unit root in the Phillips curve that is ignored by policymakers in the 1960s.
Primiceri (2006) argues that such an assumption is in line with the available data prior to 1960.
For example, Barsky (1987) shows that strong in‡ation persistence emerged only around 1960. Our
results provide an explanation for the rise of in‡ation persistence based on the interaction between the
monetary and …scal authorities, instead of assuming breaks in the Phillips curve. Speci…cally, once
…scal policy is perceived as the dominant authority, in‡ation persistence remains high independent
of the conduct of monetary policy and the central bank loses its ability to stabilize in‡ation.


5.2        Macroeconomic volatility
We now turn to analyze the implications of changes in policymakers’behavior for in‡ation and output
volatilities. Figure 12 reports standard deviations and variance decompositions at di¤erent horizons
varying the initial policy mix. The low volatility regime is assumed to be in place at time zero.10
Both the standard deviations and variance decompositions are computed taking into account the
possibility of regime changes using the methods described in Bianchi (2014). Regarding in‡ation
volatility, we observe a substantial reduction moving from the PM/AF to the AM/PF regime. When
the economy is currently under the AM/AF regime, the evolution of in‡ation volatility mimics the
pattern observed for the PM/AF regime. This is consistent with the fact that from the AM/AF
regime there is a very high probability of moving to the PM/AF regime. A similar argument holds
for output volatility. At all horizons, the expected volatility is lower if the economy is currently in
the AM/PF regime. Of course, as the horizon goes to in…nity, the volatilities would converge to their
ergodic values. However, given that the regimes are quite persistent, being in or out of the AM/PF

regime has a large impact on macroeconomic volatility.
    Preference shocks get the lion’s share when it comes to understanding the sources of output
growth volatility. As for in‡ation volatility, preference and long term expenditure shocks play a very
important role when out of the AM/PF regime. At the ten years horizon, more than 60% of in‡ation
variability is explained by these two shocks. When the AM/PF regime is in place, the contribution of
the long term component is initially small, but it keeps growing as the horizon increases. This is for
two reasons. First, even under the AM/PF regime, shocks to the long term component of expenditure
have an e¤ect on the macroeconomy. Second, as the horizon increases, so does the probability that
a shift to the PM/AF actually occurred.
    Summarizing, over the long horizon …scal imbalances play an important role in explaining move-
ments in in‡ation when there is a lack of commitment to stabilize debt. Even under the AM/PF
regime, we …nd that this mechanism is important because agents take into account the possibility
of moving to the PM/AF regime. This result is in line with the evidence presented in De Graeve
and Queijo von Heideken (2013) and Kliem, Kriwoluzky, and Sarferaz (2013) that document low
frequency comovements between in‡ation and …scal de…cits.




                                                               32
6    Historical Accounts
We …nd it instructive to reconcile the results of the paper to historical accounts of the interaction
between the …scal and monetary authorities. Although in the early years of our sample, William
Martin (Chair of the Board of Governors April 1951- January 1970), is successful in keeping in‡ation
low, the …rst spur of in‡ation occurred under his chairmanship, in the second half of the ’60s. As
documented by Meltzer (2009), Martin regarded himself as a public servant (see also Taylor, 2011)
and, in his own words, thought that the central bank had to be “independent within the government."
Meltzer argues that this view led the Federal Reserve to accept “its role as a junior partner by agreeing
to coordinate its actions with the administration’s …scal policy."
    Arthur Burns’ appointment (Chair of the Board of Governors February 1970 - February 1978)
meant a turn toward an even more expansionary monetary policy. There is now common agreement
that throughout his chairmanship, Burns often had to succumb to the requests of the US administra-
tion. During a conversation occurring on October 23, 1969, just after Burns’s nomination to the Fed
had been announced, Richard Nixon invited Burns “to see [him] privately anytime” and suggested
to communicate through an intermediary in order to preserve “the myth of the autonomous Fed”
(Abrams, 2006). Levin and Taylor (2012) argue that these political pressures are crucial in under-
standing the rise in in‡ation and report that Burns (1979) himself acknowledged this: “...the central
banks’practical capacity for curbing an in‡ation that is driven by political forces is very limited.”
    With in‡ation trending up at a quick pace in the 1970s, there are two failed disin‡ationary
attempts, one early in 1969-1970 and the second in 1973. Both share similar features. On the one
hand, the interest rate increases but in‡ation does not fall. On the other hand, as documented for
example by Weise (2012) using FOMC minutes and transcripts, it was widely recognized that these
disin‡ationary attempts were hindered by political pressures from the administration at that time
who wanted much more gradual approaches to price stability. As an e¤ect, Weise (2012) documents
how in both cases, the more contractionary strategy was then abandoned as politically unfeasible
and a much more middle ground policy was adopted.
    As shown in Figure 2, our model interprets these failed attempts as a likely outcome of a regime
in which both monetary and …scal authorities are active. Consistent with the historical accounts, in
this regime the Fed attempts a contractionary policy but the …scal policy is not changing its …scal
stance to surrender control over in‡ation determination, resulting in potentially even higher in‡ation.
Although qualitatively similar, according to our estimates, the 1973 disin‡ation attempt was even less
decisive than that of 1969, when the smoothed probability of the AM/AF regime was signi…cantly
larger. This di¤erent intensity is consistent with the view described in Weise (2012) who argues that
the Fed had a greater willingness in 1969 to end in‡ation than it would have at any time during the
1970s.
    Jimmy Carter’s victory in the 1976 presidential election, a campaign during which he had criticized
the Fed for not following a stronger expansionary monetary policy, sets up an even weaker political
support for …ghting in‡ation. This lead Arthur Burns and William Miller (Chair of the Board of

                                                   33
Governors March 1978 - August 1979), as documented by Weise (2012) and Wells (1994), to express
dread at the thought that the Fed would be forced to take on in‡ation by itself. Instead, they looked
to the Administration to take the lead in controlling in‡ation.11
    By the late 1970s the general public became increasingly frustrated and worried about the high
cost of in‡ation. Meltzer (2009) notes that in Gallup polls from 1978 to 1982, more than 50 percent
of respondents listed in‡ation and the high cost of living as the most important problems facing the
country. In August 1979 Paul Volcker is appointed chairman, viewed at the time as a signal that the
Fed is expected to take action. However, Volcker’s appointment and initial increase in the FFR in
October 1979 did not result in a sudden disin‡ation. Goodfriend and King (2005) argue that "the
start of a deliberate disin‡ation dates to late 1980" and that this initial increase in the FFR did not
represent a substantial departure from the way monetary policy was conducted in the ’70s: A timid
attempt at controlling in‡ation, resulting in even higher in‡ation. The results reported in Figure 5
provide an explanation for why this …rst attempt was not successful. If the central bank tries to gain
control of in‡ation without the support of the …scal authority the result is even higher in‡ation.
    This …rst attempt su¤ered a further important delay when the Fed accommodated the request of
the Carter administration to introduce credit controls on March 14, 1980. This choice proved to be
disastrous for two reasons. First, it determined a decline in the FFR and did not prevent in‡ation
from rising, an e¤ect interpreted by our estimation as a likely return to the PM/AF regime. Second,
it undermined once again the independence of the monetary authority. The result was that the
Federal Reserve had to start the e¤ort all over again. The credit controls were removed in July 1980
and this time Volcker kept interest rates high for a prolonged period of time with no interference by
the Reagan administration.
    Samuelson (2008) documents how within this period, the political support was markedly di¤erent
between the Carter and Reagan administration. The former was widely viewed as unable to help
control in‡ation.12 In fact, Carter himself later judged that in‡ation had been the decisive issue
against him in losing the presidential election to Reagan. On the opposite side, running on an anti-
in‡ation platform, Reagan brought a strong-willed approach to …ghting in‡ation. "Unlike some of
his predecessors, [Reagan] had a strong visceral aversion to in‡ation," Volcker later said. Although
the strong contractionary policy and associated economic slump lead to signi…cant social pressure
for a policy reversal, such that his popularity rating fell from 68 percent in 1981 to 45 percent in
1982, Reagan did not retreat. Samuelson (2008) recalls that di¤erently from the previous disin‡ation
attempts, he refused to criticize the Fed chairman publicly, to urge a lowering of interest rates, or to
work behind the scenes to bring that about.13 Backed by this strong political support, the monetary
  11
     For example, in March 1978 Miller worried that “time is very short for them [the administration] to take some
more believable steps in …ghting in‡ation and if it’s not done, in‡ation is going to be left to the Federal Reserve and
that’s going to be bad news” (Weise (2012))
  12
     For example, in early 1980 Carter was asked at a press conference what he planned to do about in‡ation. He
replied, "It would be misleading for me to tell any of you that there is a solution to it."
  13
     When the president did speak, he supported Volcker. At a press conference on February 18, 1982, Reagan called
in‡ation "our number one enemy" and referred to fears that "the Federal Reserve Board will revert to the in‡ationary
monetary policies of the past." The president pledged that this wouldn’t happen. "I have met with Chairman Volcker

authority pushed forward the aggressive contractionary monetary policy.14 Volcker kept interest rates
high enough until in‡ation …nally fell substantially in 1982.
    Consistent with these accounts, our estimation views the period starting from Volcker’s appoint-
ment until the beginning of 1982 as re‡ecting high uncertainty about which authority will give up
the control of in‡ation. In our interpretation of the events of the early ’80s, Reagan played a pivotal
role in determining the drop of in‡ation, providing the necessary support for the Federal Reserve’s
initiatives. The Great in‡ation is …nally conquered when the private sector is convinced that the
monetary authority has the …scal backing to control in‡ation.
    It is also useful to note that the support for this …scal backing did not have to result in immediate
…scal adjustments. In Figure 13 we illustrate this point by comparing the actual behavior of the
primary surplus during the ’80s with what is implied by the model using the counterfactual simu-
lations of Subsection 4.2. When the regime switch to the AM/PF regime is maintained (solid blue
line), we observe the sudden and pronounced drop in the primary surplus, followed by a persistent
and slow moving increase, as found in the data. Under the counterfactual scenario of a return to the
PM/AF regime we would have instead observed a sequence of primary surpluses (magenta dotted

      At the July 1981 meeting Kansas City Fed President Roger Gu¤ey argued: "Historically, the Federal Reserve has
always come up to the hitching post and then backed o¤ simply because the Administration and the Congress have
thrown bricks at us or have not been supportive of a policy of restraint. Through the course of recent history at least,
we’ve backed o¤ and we’ve made a mistake each time. I think we have an opportunity this time to carry forward what
we should have done before because for the …rst time ever we do have, for whatever length of time, the support of the
Administration at least. So, we ought to take advantage of that opportunity."(FOMC meeting Transcripts, July 81,

                                                              35
line). Finally, an immediate and fully credible switch to the AM/PF regime would have also induced
a primary de…cit in the short run, but this would have been less pronounced.
    The impulse responses reported in Figure 5 and the counterfactual simulation of Subsection 4.2
highlight why our model predicts that at that time the tax-to-GDP ratio should go down and the
debt-to-GDP ratio should go up, in line with what is observed in the data. The reasons are two-fold.
First, when the switch to the AM/PF regime occurs in the early 1980s, the debt-to-GDP ratio is
at a historical minimum, given that twenty years of PM/AF policy have already erased a signi…cant
portion of the …scal burden. Second, the economy entered a recession as a result of the de‡ationary
e¤ort. The …scal backing only requires that over the long horizon tax revenues, instead of in‡ation,
are expected to go up in order to repay the …scal burden. In the meantime the debt-to-GDP ratio
continues increasing for a while, as seen in the data, due to the higher real interest rates, the recession,
and the sluggish adjustment of taxes. In other words, what matters for the dynamics of in‡ation and
debt is not what occurs to tax revenues at that time of the switch, but how agents expect the …scal
burden to be …nanced.
    While our model can account for the observed initial fall in the tax-to-GDP ratio and the increase
in the debt-to-GDP ratio at the time of the regime switch, it is further useful to evaluate historically
the extent to which such a switch towards a passive …scal policy is consistent with the Reagan
tax reform. The …rst step in this reform was the Economic Recovery Tax Act enacted in August
1981. While this tax cut led to an immediate …scal de…cit, it was very soon followed by partially
compensating de…cit reducing measures that were aimed at increasing tax revenues, either through
higher tax rates or through expanding the tax base. These changes included the Tax Equity and
Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, the Social Security Amendments of 1983, and the De…cit Reduction
Act of 1984.
    The tax reform also signalled a series of further e¤orts aimed toward reducing government spend-
ing and increasing future tax revenues through a larger tax base. On the spending side, Romer and
Romer (2009) provide ample historical accounts on how Reagan was a strong advocate of spending
reductions and that he viewed the tax cuts as the most e¤ective way to shrink the size of the govern-
ment, following the "starve-the-beast" hypothesis. For example, as documented by Romer and Romer
(2009), in a February 1981 speech presenting his economic program, Reagan identi…ed "reducing the
growth in government spending and taxing" as a central goal, while simultaneously advocating for a
reallocation of spending toward "those functions which are the proper province of government," such
as national defense. Thus, even if the very early …scal reform led to higher initial …scal de…cit, the
historical context suggests that in the early 1980s, consistent with our estimated regime switch, there
was a fundamental shift from the 1970s in the administration’s approach towards …scal sustainability.
As detailed in these historical accounts, Reagan was strongly in favor of a small government, and,
more importantly, not willing to allow in‡ation to be used as a tool for …scal adjustment.
    Our results are further in line with Cochrane (1998) who argues that the fall of in‡ation of the
early ’80s can be rationalized by a revision in expected future surpluses induced by the Reagan


                                                    36
tax reforms. Lower rates and a broader tax base mean better growth and eventually better tax
revenues. In our case, the change in expectations is induced by a switch in the monetary/…scal policy
mix. Agents understand that once monetary policy stops accommodating the behavior of the …scal
authority and the …scal authority publicly endorses such a decision, the government will have to
move surpluses in order to stabilize debt.


7    Conclusions
This paper has shown that the rise and fall of US in‡ation can be explained by a change in the
balance of power between the monetary and …scal authorities. When the …scal authority is the lead-
ing authority, …scal imbalances generate long lasting and persistent increases in in‡ation and the
monetary authority loses its ability to control in‡ation. The e¤ects of these shocks last as long as
agents expect the …scal authority to prevail in the future. Therefore, if the monetary authority tries
to disin‡ate without the backing of the …scal authority in‡ation barely moves. However, the moment
that the …scal authority accommodates the central bank’s behavior in‡ation quickly drops, the econ-
omy enters a recession, and the debt-to-GDP ratio starts increasing. These features characterized
the events of the early ’80s and can therefore be rationalized by the change in the policy mix itself.
    Using counterfactual simulations we then established three important results. First, to the extent
that the Great In‡ation was caused by the way …scal and monetary shocks propagate under the
PM/AF regime, if agents had been con…dent about the regime change of the early ’80s or if the
AM/PF regime had been in place over the entire sample, the Great In‡ation would not have occurred.
Second, given that the fall in in‡ation in the early ’80s is explained by a regime change and not by
exogenous shocks, if the switch to the AM/PF regime had not occurred in‡ation would have remained
above the steady state for another …fteen years. Third, the Volcker disin‡ation would have been less
painful if agents had perceived the switch to the AM/PF as fully credible.

A     The linearized model
Once the model is solved, the variables can be rescaled in order to induce stationarity. The model is
then linearized with respect to taxes, government expenditure, and debt, whereas it is loglinearized
with respect to all the other variables. We obtain a system of equations:

B      MCMC algorithm and convergence
Draws from the posterior are obtained using a standard Metropolis-Hastings algorithm initialized
around the posterior mode. When working with models whose posterior distribution is very compli-
cated in shape it is very important to …nd the posterior mode. In a MS-DSGE model, this search can
turn out to be an extremely time-consuming task, but it is a necessary step to reduce the risk of the
algorithm getting stuck in a local peak. Here are the key steps of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm:

      Step 1: Draw a new set of parameters from the proposal distribution: #                                                         N    n 1; c




                                                               43
                             m                          m 1
     Step 2: Compute     (       ; #) = min p (#) =p            ; 1 where p ( ) is the posterior evaluated at
      .
                                                            m                     m
     Step 3: Accept the new parameter and set                   = # if u <    (       ; #) where u   U ([0; 1]),
     otherwise set m = m 1

     Step 4: If m    nsim ; stop. Otherwise, go back to step 1

   The matrix corresponds to the inverse of the Hessian computed at the posterior mode . The
parameter c is set to obtain an acceptance rate of around 35%. The posterior is obtained combining
the priors with the likelihood computed using the modi…ed Kalman …lter described in Kim and Nelson
(1999).
   Table 3 reports results based on the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin potential reduction scale factor using
within and between variances based on the …ve multiple chains used in the paper. The eight chains
consist of 540; 000 draws each (1 every 200 draws is saved). The numbers are well below the 1:1
benchmark value used as an upper bound for convergence.


C     Dataset
Real GDP, the GDP de‡ator, and the series for …scal variables are obtained from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis. We follow Leeper, Plante, and Traum (2010) in constructing the …scal variables.
The …scal series are built using NIPA Table 3.2. (Federal Government Current Receipts and Expen-
ditures). Government purchases (G) are computed as the sum of consumption expenditure (L21),
gross government investment (L42), net purchases of non-produced assets (L44), minus consumption
of …xed capital (L45), minus wage accruals less disbursements (L33). Total government expenditure
is obtained summing government purchases with transfers. Transfers are given by the sum of net cur-
rent transfer payments (L22-L16), subsidies (L32), and net capital transfers (L43-L39). Tax revenues
are given by the di¤erence between current receipts (L38) and current transfer receipts (L16). All
variables are then expressed as a fraction of GDP. Government purchases are transformed in a way
to obtain the variable gt de…ned in the model. The series for the FFR is obtained averaging monthly
…gures downloaded from the St. Louis Fed web-site. Finally, we depart from other papers in the
literature that reconstruct the series for government debt using the interest payments reported in the
NIPA tables and instead we use the debt series at market values from the Dallas Fed web-site. Hall
and Sargent (2011) argue that the interest payments reported by the Government are not consistent
with any well de…ned law of motion for debt. Speci…cally, the Government reports data that do not
fully take into account revaluation e¤ects. Revaluation e¤ects are important in the context of our
model that allows for a maturity structure of government debt. However, as explained by Leeper,
Plante, and Traum (2010), the two series are highly correlated implying that the choice of the series
for debt is going to play only a minor role in the context of a structural estimation.

D      Additional Results (not for publication)
This appendix reports some additional …gures and results. Figure 14 reports the median and 90%
bands for the smoothed probabilities of the di¤erent regimes based on the 1,350,000 parameter draws
retained for the estimates. Figure 15 shows that the results derived in Subsection 4.1 hold even when
agents are assumed to be aware of the possibility of regime changes when under the AM/PF. Figure
16 reports the variance decomposition across di¤erent policy regimes assuming that the economy is
currently under the high volatility regime.

Figure 16: The …rst row reports the model implied standard deviations at di¤erent horizons for output growth and
in‡ation across di¤erent initial policy combinations. The high volatility regime is assumed to be in place at time zero.
Both the standard deviations and variance decompositions take into account the possibility of regime changes.
