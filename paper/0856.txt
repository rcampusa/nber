                 New   Methods for Analyzing Structural Models
                           of Labor Force Dynamics


                                   ABSTRACT




      This   paper takes a first   step toward developing econometric models
for the structural analysis of labor force dynamics. Our analysis          is

presented    in continuous tine, although most of the points raised here
can be applied to discrete time models. We show that In previous attempts
to estimate "structural" models of job search, a key source of information
necessary to identify certain structural parameters has been neglected.
      We discuss the conditions under which structural search models can
be estimated. In particular, the wage offer distribution must be recoverable——
i.e., it must be the case that the     parameters    of the untruncated wage
offer distribution be estimable from the truncated accepted wage distri-
bution.   The wage offer distribution must be assumed to belong to a para-

metric family.    Estimates of structural parameters are shown to be sensitive
to   the distributional assumption made.

      A partial equilibrium two     state   model of employment dynamics is

estimated,    using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young
Men. We find employment and nonemployment rates Implied by the structural
parameter estimates to be generally consistent with        those   observed for
the   population of young males.

                 New Methods for Analyzing Structural Models
                           of   Labor Force Dynamics


        This paper presents new econometric methods for the analysis of
labor force dynamics. The economic models we discuss asswne that      rational

agents    make choices about their employment and labor force activity In
the   face   of uncertainty about key aspects of theft labor market environ-

ment. A variety of such models has recently appeared in     the literature
(e.g., Burdett and Mortensen, 1978 and 1980; Lucas and Prescott, 1974;

Wilson, 1980; Lippman and McCall, 1976a, b, 1981) and    research   in the

area    continues to flourish. Theoretical results already in hand offer
possible explanations for frictional unemployment, on—the—job wage growth,
job turnover and wage dispersion.
       To date there has been little systematic econometric analysis of
these models although qualitative implications obtained from these models
have sometimes been used as loose guides to interpreting unemployment
duration regressions. The few attempts at developing econometric pro-
cedures to estimate this class of models are direct transcriptions of
econometric models used to estimate reservation wages in the analysis
of female labor suppiyi A clear analysis of identification criteria
and estimation methods for models of labor force dynamics does not appear
in the literature.
       This paper takes a first step toward developing econometric models
that implement and extend the new theory. A key feature of the class of


        (l)por a survey of such models see Heclonan and MaCurdy (1981). See
also the discussion in Appendix C which makes precise the statement in the
text.

economic      models that we consider is that they produce predictions about
the dynamics of individual behavior. With the recent wide—scale availa-
bility of longitudinal labor market data with repeated observations on
individuals it has become possible to test the implications of the new
microdynamic models using microdynamic data. The goal of this paper is
to develop prothedures to enable analysts to apply the new theories to
the new data.
       This   paper makes three contributions. First, economic theory is

used to derive     the appropriate econometric specification for three models
of labor force dynamics. They are (a) a continuous tine single spell
model of search unemployment, (b) an equilibrium continuous time two
state model of employment and nonemployment, and Cc) a three state model
of employment, unemployment and nonmarket activity.
       Second, we present new identification criteria that must be satisfied
in order to estimate the structural parameters of the three models considered
in this paper. We distinguish structural parameters that can be estimated
using nonparametric procedures from structural parameters that can only
be identified if arbitrary functional forms are assumed. One identification
condition ("recoverability") applies to all econometric models for the
analysis of truncated data. An important conclusion of our analysis is
that most econometric models for the analysis of truncated data are non—
parametrically underide.ntified, and some are parametrically underidentified
as well.
       Our third contribution recognizes that maximum likelihood estimators
for   most of the models considered here are nonregular. We develop an
                                         3




appropriate     asymptotic theory for the nonregular case that arises In
the   economic models analyzed in this paper, and in other econometric

models derived from optimization theory.

      The plan    of   this paper is as follows. We first   consider   in detail

a model for a single spell of an unnployed worker's search from a iciown

distribution of wage offers. Most of the new econometric points that
arise in the analysis of      the economically more interesting models that

follow    also appear in the simpler setting of the one state model of

search.

       The   second part of the paper is devoted to analysis of a new equili-
brium   two state model of employment and nonemployment. Empirical estimates
of this model are presented. An appendix presents a three state model
of labor force dynamics which introduces nonmarket activity into con-
ventional search models and provides a structural economic motivation
for the competing risks model widely used in social science2) The
paper concludes with a summary.

 1.   Estimation of a One State Model of Search Unemployment
 1.0 Introduction
      In this section, we consider estimation of a single spell model of an

 unemployed worker's search from a laown distribution of wage offers using

 longitudinal data on a random sample of agents. Despite the fact that this

model is widely cited as a justification for much          empirical   research on un-

employment     and despite previous attempts at "structural estimation" in this
model,   a number of Important econometric      aspects of this model have been
neglected.
      We first present a continuous tine economic model for a
                                                              stationary environ-

ment. We compare the continuous time model to previous discrete time formu-

lations. We then consider issues of identification and estimation first under

the assumption of no interpersonal      variation in parameters ("no heterogeneity")
and then with such variation ("heterogeneity"). In a concluding                subsection,

we consider econometric issues for a nonstationary search model.

1.1 A One      State   Model of Search Unemployment

      This   model is well exposited in Lippman   and   Mccall (1976a). Agents
are assumed to be income maximizers (here and in the rest of the paper).
If an Instantaneous cost c is Incurred, lob offers arrive from a Poisson
process with parameter A Independent of the level of c (c a 0). the
probability of receiving a wage offer in time interval t is A& + o(t)
The probability of two or more job offers l.a interval Lt is thus negligible.2


                  is defined as a term such that                       o(it)      o.

      (2)por   one justification of the Poisson wage arrival assumption see,
j., Burdett and Mortensen (1978).
                                                  5


        Successive       wage offers are          independent       realizations from aknown

absolutely continuous wage distribution F(x) with finite mean that is

assumed to be coon to all agents (until ection 1.5). Once refused,

wage offers are       no longer available. Jobs last forever and there                   is no

on the job search. Workers live forever. (But see the discussion

in Section l.5.C.) The instantaneous rate of interest is r(>0).



      "V'1 is the value of search. Using Bellman's optimality principle for

dynamic    programming (See, e.g., Ross (1970)) V may be decomposed into three
cotnponentà plus         a negligible component (of order o(t)).

(1.1)            V   —   -            +   (t) V + itt           B   max [x ; V + o(At)
                             1-frAt       l+rtt        l+rt t             r

                         for V>O
                     —   0      otherwise


     The first term on the right of (1.1) is the discounted cost of search
in interval At. The second term is the probability of not receiving an
offer (l—XAt) times the discounted value of search at the end of interval
At.     The   third term is the probability of receiving a wage offer (itt)
times    the discounted value of the expected value (computed with respect
to F(x)) of the maximum of the two options confronting the agent who
receives a wage offer: to take the offer (with present value x/r) orto
continue searching (with present value V). Note that equation
(1.1)   is defined only for flU. If V — 0, we may define the agent as
out of the labor force (See Lippman and McCall, 1976a). rrom stationarity,
once out the agent is always out. Sufficient to ensure the existence of
                                                    6

an   optimal reservation wage policy in this model is E(IxJ) <                               (Robbins, 1970).

        Collecting terms in (1.1) and passing to the limit, we reach the
familiar formula (Lippman and Mccall, 1976a)
(1.2)                C +   rV —                   (x—rV)dF(x)         for V>O.
                                        f


"rV" is the reservation wage. It is Implicitly determined from (1.2).
                              -
For any offered wage               x    ri, the agent accepts the offer. The probability

that    an    offer is unacceptable is F(rV).


        If r—O, an optimal policy still exists if E(ILI)<                              where £ is the

lump    sum value of        the job offer over the infinite horizon. A reservation

value a exists. It is determined as the solution to

(1.2)'               c        .1       (j—R)dG)          if R>O



where G(L) is the cdf of £.

        To    calculate the probability that. an unemployment spell T exceeds
        two ingredients are required. First, we must compute the probability
that ,j offers are received in time interval t. By assumption this is
(1.3)                       Prob(j offers I             t)       (At)ietu        ,   (A >   0).
We next       need   to compute the probability              that none of        the j offers is

acceptable.          This is [flrv)]5.              Assuming independence of arrival times
and wage offers, the survivor function P(T >                            t)   is the product of these
two probabilities summed over all j, i.e.,
                                                   (At )i    —At
(1.4)                P(T >    t)       —                     a
                                                                  u

                                            i—a

                                                                      (1)



        (1)
              (The power series expansion definition of the exponential is used

So   that   the density of t is f(t)                A(l_F(rV))e(ltVfltU

        Accepted wages are     truncated     random     variables       with rV as the

lower   point of truncation. The        density of accepted wages is

(1.5)            f(xlx>rV) — f(x)            ,   QrV.
                           -       1—F(rV)
Thus the one spell search model has the se statistical structure for
accepted wages as other models of selfse1ection in labor economics
(Lewis, 1974; Heciaan, 1974 and Hecicuan and Macurdy, 1981).
        From the assumption that wages are distributed independently of
wage arrival times, the joint density of duration tines t and
accepted wages (x) is the product of the density of each random variable.
        m(t,x) — [A(i — F(rV))exp - A(1 — F(rV))tu} 1—F(rV)
                 (A exp —X(i— F(rV))tu)f(x) xarv.

The stationary search model generates a duration model with a constant
hazard      rate h '1(t U) where
                               d LnP(T >t)
(1.6)             h(t) —                                 — X(i      —   F(rV)).

Higher values of the hazard are          associated       with more rapid exit from

the unemployment state. A model with a constant hazard is said to
                                             dh(t   )
exhibit      no duration dependence                      -   0).

        Differentiation of (1.2) (and integration by parts) reveals that

 the reservation wage increases with positive translations of

 the wage offer distribution, decreases in the cost of search, increases

 in the rate of wage arrivals (A), and           decreases         in the rate of Interest.


 Thehazard rate (h(t)) increases with increases in the cost of search.
increases in the rate of interest, and with positive translations
                                                                  of the
wage offer distribution. The effect of increases in the rate of job
                                    8



offer arrivals and increases in the variance of the wage offer distribution

on the hazard rate is ambiguous. Thus, ceteris paribus, increases in the

cost of search, the rate of interest and positive translations of the

wage   offer distribution decrease the mean length of unemployment and
result in unemployment duration distributions that are stochastically
dominated by the predisplacement distributions.
     If r — 0, straightforward manipulation of (1.2)' reproduces all of
the preceding propositions except those for r and translations of the
wage offer distribution. It is well known that if r 0 unit translations
of the wage offer distribution lead to unit increases in reservation wages.
Thus translations of the wage offer distribution in this case produce no
change in the hazard rate.

1.2 Relationship to Previous Discrete Time Models of Discrete Choice

       Previous work in deterministic labor supply theory (e.g., Heclcnan
and Willis, 1977; Heclcman and MaCurdy; 1980, Heckman, 1981) estimates
a discrete time analogue of the model described above. For
a single spell of nonemployment, the decision to remain nonemployed is
made by comparing a market wage offer X to reservation wage rV although
a different theory is used to derive the reservation wage. Kiefer and
Neumann (1979) have applied discrete time econometric models developed in
the deterministic labor supply literature to the search unemployment
problem.
       The assumption used in previous work is that new wage offers (or in
the labor supply theory, reservation wages, or both) arrive each time period.
To focus on essential. aspects of the comparison we assume that the
reservation wage is nonstochastic, and the cdf of the independent
wage offers is F(X).     Previous   models produce the probability that
                                             9




a   nonemployment spell terminates after j periods as

            P(j)   =   (F(rV))   (1 —   F(rV)).

Accepted wages are truncated from below by rV so that          (1.5)    is the

density     of these offers. Thus the joint density of duration times and
accepted wages is

            k(j,x)     = [F(n)] f(x)             x   rV.


This   approach is somewhat arbitrary because it is tine unit dependent.
To use it one must assume that wage offers come in at the rate of exactly
one per period. (This is a crucial assumption in the Kief er—Neumann
analysis. See Appendix C.) The model developed in this paper assumes
that   wage   offers arrive at random times. The cost of       this    generality
is   the introduction of parameters of the wage arrival function (A).


1.3 Identification


       We   assume the analyst has access to longitudinal data on N independent
spells of unemployment.       At   this point we assume that   all individuals have

common structural parameters. The sampling frame is a fixed              known time



       1Kiefer and Neumann (1979) have indirectly addressed this problem
for the case of log normally distributed X in a discrete time search model
with one wage offer received each period. They address the problem of
identification in these models using standard sample selection bias methods.
The analysis considered in this section is more general because it permits
wage offers to arrive randomly, it is not specific to a log normal wage
offer distribution, and because it utilizes crucial information overlooked
In their analysis. For example, their analysis apparently implies that
r > 0 is a necessary condition for identification. From their analysis
it would appear that adding a wage arrival parameter A to the model could
make the model unidentified, especially              if r =
                                               0. Their analysis is mis-
leading on important points.
                                           10



 frame of length T. Some spells may be censored (so t —             T).      At the
 end of the sampling period an unemployment spell may still be in progress.
 Thus for certain episodes we do not observe an accepted wage.
        Our approach     to identification is somewhat   unusual in   that   it is
 nonparametric.        We produce consistent estimators of the reservation
wage and the distribution functions of accepted wages (4 and            durations
 (t).    We also ask under what conditions we can solve from
                                                             conditional
 empirical    distribution functions     (which are pointwise   consistently
estimated except at points of discontinuity see, e.g., Billingsley,

1968) and     the    estimated reservation wage for the underlying structural

parameters and       distributions   of interest. A crucial identification

condition is a recoverability condition, not always satisfied, which

enables the analyst to recover an untruncated distribution from a trun-

cated distribution.
       From a random sample of unemployment durations, possibly censored,
it is possible to use a Kaplan—Meier estimator (see Ka.lbfleisch and Prentice,
1980, pp. 10—16) to consistently estimate the integrated hazard and hence
the hazard (eq. (1.6)). It is thus         possible   to consistently estimate

h— A(l.-F(rV)), A variety of alternative estimators could be usedJ1From

duration data alone, it is not possible to separate A from (1—F(rV)).

       From   data   on accepted wage offers it is possible to directly estimate

the reservation wage. (2) The density of accepted wage offers is given in



           note that there are better behaved estimators for the hazard
than the one mentioned here. We use the estimator in our identification
analysis   only to indicate that in principle it
                                               is possible to estimate
h non—parametrically. See the discussion in Section 1.4.

       (2)This obvious and     essential point has not hitherto been noted in
the   literature.

fact that the range of X depends on a parameter                 (rV) means that a
standard   regularity assumption is violated. We develop            this point in the
next section where specific estimation strategies fpr parametric models
are discussed.

                             1 — (rV)
In light of the discussion in the preceding paragraph,               rV can be
consistently estimated. Provided that it is possible to recover the
untruncated distribution F(x) from the truncated distribution knowing
the point of truncation, it is possible to estimate F(x) from an estimate
of F(xlx.rV) and rV.
     We define a distribution F(x) to be recoverable from a truncated
distribution with known point of truncation (rV) if knowledge
of F(xlx>rV) and rV implies that F(x) is uniquely determined.
                                                  12



       Provided that F(x) is recoverable, all of the parameters in equation
(1.2) are identified provided that r is known. Thus if F(x) and rV are
known, from the estimated hazard A is known. (See eq. (1.6)). With A
known, F and rV can be inserted in (1.2) to estimate                  (1)

       F(x) is not recoverable without maintaining some functional form
assumption, and it is not recoverable for all functional forms. Two
absolutely continuous distributions that produce the same truncated
distribution with the same known points of truncation have densities
that differ only by a linear transformation. If densities f(x) and
f*(x) both generate the same truncated cdf, then f*(x)                    bf(x) for
x rV.

                     >   rV)       F*(x)_F*(rV)        = F(x)—F(rV)                   rV)
            F*(xlx             —                                      —
                                                                          F(xjx   >

so the densities must be proportional at all points of cóntinuity of the
distributions, i.e., f* = bf for x rV where b l—FrV             Thus the      .

     'if c is known a priori, it is possible (with known F and rV) to
estimate r.
     (2)In a discrete time search model with one wage offer assumed to arrive
each period, we can estimate F(rV). In this case we can uniquely determine
F (for F absolutely continuous) using the additional information that
                               F(rV) a k
where k and rV are known constants. Since we know the denominator of the
conditional density, we can uniquely determine F and hence f. This is an
essential feature in the Kiefer—Neumann analysis (see Appendix C).
                                             13



Without imposing a parametric structure on f(x), it is not possible
to determine the shape        of 1(x) for values of x below rV. It is possible

to   determine the shape of f(x)         for x     rV (up to a scalar multiplication)

but    not the mass above rV.
        Without further information it           is not   possible to solve from the
truncated distribution and the Imown point of truncation for a unique
untruncated distribution. There            are obviously many     untruncated   distri-
butions which can produce the same truncated distribution at a given
point of truncation. For this reason, a completely nonparametric approach
to identification is impossible.           Unless a recoverability condition is

Imposed,      the structural duration model is not identified. (Precisely
the    same   statement holds for all econometric models for the analysis
of truncated data.)
        It is sometimes possible to achieve recoverability by restricting
the true distribution flx) to be a member of a certain class of parametric
families. Thus if we require F(x) and F*(x) to be normal distributions,
F(x)      F*(x) (a =   0   and b = 1).     (This restriction does not deny that
some nonnormal F* may also fit the truncated data.) Identification
through the use of functional form is not always possible.
       We present an example in which the recoverability condition is
not met even if we impose the assumption that wage offers come from a
distribution with iciown functional form. Let wages be Pareto distributed

The   parameter -        (or a2) cannot be identified. Thus there are many Pareto

distributions     that   £ it the truncated wage data equally well.

      To   explore the consequences àf the lack of recoverability in the Pareto
case   on the remaining parameters of the model, write (1.2) for the Pareto

case as



                          c+rV           (M\(          (rV)82

The hazard is



                      h — X(1—F(rV))                             (rV)5+1
                                                        (5+1)



"rV" is identified and so are 5, X, and c. But obviously                                 and A

cannot be separately identified (we can                 use     the inequality rV    c2 to    H

produce an upper bound on a2, an upper bound on                            and hence a lower bound

on A).

      The fact that identification hinges on the functional form of the wage
                                        15



 offer   distribution is an unsettling result but accords with economic

 intuition. Without some restrictions imposed, it should not be possible

 to distinguish a model with a lot of the mass in the wage offer distri-

bution near zero from a model with a low arrival rate for job offers,

and    with   little mass in the wage offer distribution near zero. This

point    is   discussed further in Section 2.

        If wages are normally distributed, the recoverability condition

is satisfied. This fact is implicitly utilized in Amemiya (1973) and

Pearson (1903). The condition is also satisfied for many commonly utilized

distributions such as the exponential and log normal distributjons.(1)

       It is possible to test the concordance of any       assumed functional
form   for F(x) with the data. Following Heclonan (l976a) it is possible
to use a Kolmogorov—Smirnov test or chi—square test to test concordance
between the empirical counterpart of F(xlx         rV)   and a particular para-
metric cdf.2 Thus the selection of a particular functional form need

not be an entirely arbitrary process. But the fact that a given functional

form is statistically concordant with the data does not imply that it




     0The identification analysis of Kiefer and Neumann (1979) based on a log
normal distribution for wage offers apparently requires r > 0. Their model
satisfies the recoverability condition. The assumption r > 0 is not needed
to achieve model identification. Provided that R (in equation (1.2) ') is
non—negative, it is possible to repeat the analysis in the text for r    0.
Replacing rV in the text equations with R, it is possible to use accepted
wage data to consistently estimate R using the mini.mum value of X in the
saple.        From the data on accepted wages it
                                               possible to estimate the accepted
                                                   is
wage distribution. Given the point of truncation, and satisfaction of the re-
coverability condition, it is possible to estimate F(X), hence F(R), and
A. Using equation (1.2)' it is possible to consistently estimate c. For more
discussion of the Kiefer—Neumann analysis see Appendix C.

is the only functional form consistent with the data. There is no

statistical test for recoverability that can be based on the data

generated by the model.


1.4 Estimation


     The preceding section generates identification criteria by way

of producing consistent nonparametric estimators. No claim was made

there about the efficiency or asymptotic distribution of those estimators.

These   topics are more readily addressed in a parametric framework. In
this section we examine the maximum likelihood estimator of the one
spell search model in a parametric setting, and    derive   the appropriate
asymptotic   distribution.

     Two new points arise. First, as is evident from equation (1.7),

estimation   is being considered in a non—regular setting because the lower
limit of the accepted wage offer distribution depends on a parameter of
the model (rV). Thus standard asymptotic distribution arguments will not
apply (Cox and Hinkley, 1974, p. 112). Second, because we utilize a
parametric framework, it becomes essential to explicitly account for
censoring of duration spells. (1) If the sampling plan of the longitudinal
data is such that spells of length greater than             are not observed, the
density of t U    and   x conditional on tU   S.

Then the joint density of d,             t         and X is

        The   full economic model for r > 0 Implies                  the following restrictions:

In   the remainder of        this section we write the         distribution     function of wage

offers    as F(xIe)      to explicitly demonstrate the dependence of F(xIO) on

a   finite dimensional vector of bounded parnieters (8). We assume that Focle) is
recoverable (in the sense of section 1.3) and hence that. 0 is identified.
We asstm'e that r is known.

     (1)in forming this density we use the fact that the probability
d0 is the same as the probability that t exceeds
The probability that t is less than                    is (1—exp—(l—F(rV))E).

        2The second constraint for the case r = 0 is equation (1.2)'.
In   that notation, the first constraint is x a R a 0.

         The sample log likelihood function (with individual subscripts
suppressed) for a longitudinal sample of N independent individuals

                       for the censored observations.

         Structural estimation of the model requires maximizing (1.9)
incorporating the economic restrictions in (1.8). There are many possible
parameterizations of the likelihood function. The most analytically
convenient one treats rV as an explicit parameter along with 8 and A
using (1.8) to solve for c. This parameterization does not force c to
be positive and so provides a test of the model. Note that for the model
to make statistical sense, it is required that A > 0. This constraint
is automatically imposed in the estimation as we demonstrate below.
     The maximum likelihood estimator has a simple structure. Denoting
the maximum likelihood estimator by "", rV =
                                                             x
                                                 where x1 is the
minimum accepted wage observed in the sample of job takers (for whom
d=l). That this is the mle estimator is verified by noting that £ is
monotonically increasing in rV so that the first constraint in (1.8) is
always    effective at the upper limit.

       This    estimator is    strongly consistent.         Producing   the asymptotic

distribution     theory for the estimator is a more delicate matter. As is
well   known    (See Galambos, 1978, p.     71) for a given      F(xle)   there   may exist
no forming factors such that a(n1)X +
                                                   b(n1) converges to a distribution
where a(n1) and b(n1)are functions of n1(Zd). If such factors exist,

the asymptotic distribution is one of two possible functional
                                                           19

forms       (See   Galainbos,       pp.      56_.57)!1) The existence and              functional
form       of the limiting distribution of X. is critically dependent
on the functional form                   of         F(xI   e)    although      the strong consistency

of the estimator does not depend on this functional form.

     (l)tn a valuable paper on frontier production theory, Green4 (1980)
invokes conditions that ensure that (1.10) is violated and that standard
asymptotic theory can be applied. He demonstrates that standard regularity
conditions need not be satisfied in order to produce standard asymptotic
distribution  results. His results, while very useful in his context, are
not of direct use here because to satisfy his conditions we would have to
assume f(xle)    0 over the economically Interesting interval for x.

      With estimates of rV, 0 and A, we may solve f or a from the
second equation of (1.8). We may use                         the       delta method to obtain

the   sampling distribution for c (Bishop, Fienberg and Holland, 1975, p. 486).

the usual way.

        A   simple example will help to clarify ideas. Suppose the sampling

1.5.     Accounting for Population Dispersion in the Parameters of theMode].

       We have thus far assumed that all agents in our samples
have   identical values of A, c, r and    6. There   are plausible reasons why

values of tbose.parsmeters might vary among members of the population,

In many   economic models of equilibrium price distributions, dispersion in c (or
some other parameter) is required to produce equilibrium. Failure to account for
such dispersion can produce badly biased estimates of the-parameters
of structural duration models (Silcock, 1954; B lumen, Kogan and McCarthy.
1955). This is the problem of "heterogeneity."
          In principle, each parameter of the one state search model can be
written as a function of observed and unobserved variables. The parameters



          estimator such as rV that is based on an extreme observation
in a sample is obviously quite sensitive to measurement error in the
x data. Since any fed number of extreme observations (say the first
up to the kth) are consistent estimators for rV, a consistent estimator
for rV that is less sensitive (in an       imprecisely   defined way) to measure-
ment error is an average of the lowest k observations. Greene's
estimator (1980) in a related problem is also worthy of exploration:
compute rV from adjacent values of the lowest         observations of x that
are "close". See the discussion of measurement error in Section 1.53 below.
                                        26



associated      with the observed variables in these functions can be estimated.
Unobserved variables can be integrated out using distributions whose param-
eters can be estimated. This approach is used in many studies of labor
force dynamics (Hecknan and Willis, 1975, 1977; Nickell, 1979; Reclaaan,
1981.)
     A practical problem with this solution is the selection of ,articular
functional forms for use in estimation. Except for occasional quali-
tative guidelines, economic theory offers little guidance. It is silent on
the topic of the correct specification of functional forms for the distri-
butions of unobservables.
         -
             This would not be a serious problem if estimates of key parameters
of the model were "relatively" insensitive to assumptions made about            spe—

cific functional forms. In fact, the available evidence (Hecican and Singer,
1981a, b) suggests the opposite. Estimates of key parameters are very sen-
sitive tà the choice of particular functional forms.
       The situation is not entirely hopeless. Heclaan and Singer      (1981,

1982) present a computationally feasible nonparametrià estimator for the
distribution fuüct ions of unobservables, so that    at   least one aspect of
arbitrariness in model specification can be eliminated with their methods.
Nonetheless, a considerable amount of arbitrariness remains, and this
arbitrariness vitally affects the inference from the structural models.
       These problems are more troublesome than recent analyses indicate
is the case. In this subsection we make a first attempt at clarifying
the   issues that must   be addressed in order to account for   population dis-

persion in parameters. We also offer some solutions. What follows is only

the   first and (we hope) not the last word on these problems.

            It is analytically      useful to distinguish two cases.              (1) The   case

in   which population heterogeneity arises solely from dispersion in observed

variables and (2) the case in which the heterogeneity arises from unobserved

variables. We treat these two             cases,       starting with the first. In both

cases   we assume a parametric distribution of wage                    offers F(XIe) that   satis-
fies the recoverability condition. A fully                  general analysis of both cases
is not attempted, but we indicate the gaps that remain to be filled (of

which we are aware).

this   model and cannot be ignored in securing structural estimates.

Their rank condition is likely to be satisfied In "large enough" samples. We
have not Investigated the restrictions these conditions place on our choice of
c, A and e functions although this would be a potentially fruitful topic.

       A critical feature of this optimization problem is revealed in condition

 (1.18c). Note that

 constraint (1.15) is ignored in solving for B                    (so we assume      4)    1.1   0),
 the likelihood function
                               possesses no interior maximum with respect to S
unless we impose an arbitrary
                                      nonlinearity that guarantees that c is not
monoconic in S         and that bounds c from below.               For example, if a is a
constant, a maximum likelihood estimator of a that ignores (1.15)                         sets    c
at    its lowest possible value.

      A general    analysis of identification and           distribution theory is a task
for    the   future. We make some progress by assuming that the number of distinct

Z vectors is finite and equal to K and that the population covariance matrix
of Z is   of full rank. This is consistent with "fixed in repeated samples"
sampling schemes or with the Z vectors selected by a finite K state


               is positive,               is nonnegative and                  is   negative. The
last assertion can be proved by
                                       differentiating (1.16) with respect to c.

 critical in the ensuing analysis. If it is not invoked, we are unable to

 produce consistent estimators for the model although we speculate below

 on how this might be done. We denote the population proportion of the

 exogenous variables of type k by                          0        <


        By analogy with the analysis In Section 1.4 we may estimate

definite) 8c is identified and its asymptotic distribution cart be produced

by    generating the asymptotic distribution of ck by the delta method,

          The       key requirement            is that the matrix of       second partials of £

with respect                   to B and B0 be of full rank. Verifying this condition

in practice requires a case by case analysis for each choice of f(XIe).

      Note that this procedure does not in general maximize the likelihood

(1.17). Moreover it is wasteful in information. If the number of parameters

      8c is less than K, in general fewer than K of the estimated reserva-

tion wages are required to estimate 8c

      A second round iteration of the procedure jUst presented produces

estimators       with a covariance matrix no longer than the one   produced   by the
method just presented.
      The proposed iteration sequence operates by taking estimates of 8, S
and
       88
          from the first round procedure and forming rvk.. for each type k
using   equation     (1.16). For each k, use    the minimum   of rVk so formed
and           Insert   these values into £      and   obtain estimates of
and     8   as   before. Using the second round estimated reservation wages
and   the   estimates of        and   S8 obtained on the second round, repeat

the nonlinear regression procedure to estimate S. Continue iteration

until convergence. In the case in which the number of parameters In B

is the same as K, in general the iteratioU cycle just described will

produce the same final estimates of 8 as used in the initial estimates

because     none of the reservation wage information is redundant.
        For   the case of a general distribution of Z, the likelihood and

its roots are given in (1.17) and (1.18). The derivation of the asymptotic

properties       of the maximum likelihood estimator in the general case is a
task for the future. We offer some conjectures on this problem in Appendix
A where we make some progress on the probln for certain cases of interest.

 l.5.B.    Unobserved Reterogeneity(1)

      Extending the analysis to a case in which population heterogeneity
also arises from unobserved variables is in principle straightforward.
When the models are identified the appropriate asymptotic distribution
 theory is much simpler than in the models of the preceding subsection.
 The practical problem is to decide where in the model to introduce the

 population heterogeneity. In principle we should allow for such hetero-

geneity in the c, A and 8 functions so c =          c(Z8,c),       A =

 B   8(Z088,c0) where £
                               (ccAce)       is a vector of random variables

with cdf G(cIn) where r is a vector of parameters. For simplicity we

assume that    c,   A and 8 are monotone increasing functions of              and

Ce respectively.

     The reservation wage function          is defined as

                                rV    rV(c,O,A,r)


where c, A,6   are functions of c,           and c respectively. In the ensuing
analysis   it is convenient to work with a normalized cdf

                G*(CJn)    -         G(CIT,)
                                                            (dry>    0)

         The   likelihood function for duration of unemployment and accepted
 wages    is defined as the product of densities (1•27)W Provided the
 model is identified, maximum likelihood estimators of B and            n   are   con—

 siste.nt and asymptotically normally distributed provided standard con-
 ditions on the regressors (z) are assumed (see L• Jennrich, 1969)
Because "rV' is a random variable, the appropriate asymptotic distri—
 bution theory is much simpler than the distribution theory required to
 analyze the models presented In previous sections of this paper. This
 is    so because in   the present model the range   Of   the random variable X
does    not depend on a parameter of the model.

        The crucial identifying role played In     the    preceding section by
 the   restriction that X must exceed the deterministic reservation wage
 (equation (1.21)) is played in the current model by a restriction on the
range    of unobservables

improve    the efficiency of the estimators.

is given here rather than the direct formal argument which is both tedious
and unilluminating.       The key   idea   is that         shifts   both rV and the
admissible range of the unobservable c.
       The kernel of the integral in (1.29) is monotone decreasing in ZS
because rV is monotone decreasing in c (and hence Zcc

kernel   is   monotone increasing in rV. For each value of x, A, 0 and n,
(1.28)   defines an admissible region of c. In general,                  both   the location
and   length   of the admissible region change        as   Z5 and the other parameters

limit as Z6               holding   the other parameters fixed, the likelihood

another inadmissible value of the maximum likelihood estimatorJ
        The key point     to   extract from this heuristic discussion is that
changing a parameter in             alters the likelihood function in two ways:

directly through its effect on rY and indirectly through its effect on

the range of the unobservable c .

The second ifte follows from standard results on the moment generating
function of truncated normal random variables. Direct differentiation
of the likelihood formed from (1.30) reveals that 0, c,               p and    a are

Heuristically we can estimate 0 from the linear term in x of a regression of the

 analysis of Heclcnan and Singer

the greater simplicity in the asymptotic distribution theory for this

l.5.C.   Nonstationarity

       There are many interesting and empirically relevant factors that
produce a nonstationary model; finite lives for individuals (DeGroot,
1970), unemployment insurance available for a limited duration, etc.
Nonstationarity raises two difficult problems. (A) The econometrician
must be much more careful about the initial conditions of the process
than has been required in the models analyzed up to this point (Flinn
and Heckman, 1982). (B) Properly controlling for nonstationarity raises
formidable computational problems (Heclcnan and Singer, 1982)

2. An Equilibriwn Model of Sequential Search

2.0 Introduction

       The one state model of sequential search analyzed in Section One

is widely cited as the theoretical basis for empirical analysis of
                                      42




 unemployment   durations. Its value as a guide to data has been questioned
 because without modification it does not support a nondegenerate equili-
 brium wage distribution (Diamond, 1971, Rothschild, 1973) . This now
 widely echoed objection has caused many applied economists to reject
 search theory as an interesting source of hypotheses on unemployment
 durations. Many would argue that developing the econometrics of an
 economically uninteresting model puts the cart before the horse.
     In this section we develop an equilibrium two state model of sequential
search. The model is closely related to recent work on matching equilibria
by Diamond and Maskin (1979) .    demonstrate that the econometric frame-
                                 We

work presented in Section One can be applied, with minor modification,
to the equilibrium model analyzed here.
       The simplicity of the model proposed and estimated here may offend
the sensibilities of readers accustomed to regression analysis with
numerous "control variables." The simplicity of our model is charac-
teristic   of the theory on which we draw. As discussed in Recician and

Singer (1982) small departures from the stationary search model affect

the predictione from these models, the existence of optimal solutions

and the nature of the appropriate econometric model.    For these reasons

2.1 An Equilibrium Sequential Search Model


      Labor market equilibrium is interpreted as the outcome of a steady

state sorting and matching process. Pools of unattached risk neutral workers
                                     43



and firms are in the market seeking to form partnerships to
                                                            perform tasks. Before
a worker and firm meet they do not know the potential rate of productivity
of a match. Thus ex ante all firms look alike to all workers and all workers
look alike to all firms. Upon encounter the productivity rate is perfectly

revealed. The time required to complete a task is an exponential random vari-

able. The distribution of the completion tine of a task is beyond the control

of either party. Each member of a potential partnership gets half of the

total productivity of the match if it is consummated. There is a distribution

of match productivity rates in the popusation known to both workers and firms.

Values of potential matches are dj.stributed independently across workers and

firms and are distributed independently across potential matches for the same

workers and firms. The outcome of one match is of no value in predicting the

outcome of another.

     The probability that a worker meets a firm in a small tine interval   t
is   less than one and the probability of two or more such encounters is negligible.

The probability of encountering a potential partner is asswned to follow the

Poisson probability law. The Poisson parameter of encounters depends on the

number of firms searching in the market. For simplicity we assume equal

numbers of unattached firms and workers      (L) and that the rate of arrivals

to a given worker or firm is the same linear function of L.     The symmetry of
the position of workers and firms is one possible justification for the 50—50

splitting rule assumed here.

      Each party to an encounter has two options:   (a) to accept the offered

terms of the match or (b) to continue searching. The task production tech-

nology is characterized by extreme indivisibilities such that partners can—

not search while working. If the prospective partners continue search they

incur an instantaneous flow rate of costs of c.
                                     44




        Search is with recall. If two prospective partners decide to continue

searching they can consununate their match at a later time. However it is

known from the theory of search in stationary environments (Lippman and

Mccall, l976a) that they never consummate their match if they ever reject

it. The intuitive reason for this result is that since the environment is

stationary the attractiveness of any forsaken option is the same tomorrow
as it is today.

    This model generates equilibrium sequential search which is supported by

a nondegenerate equilibrium wage distribution. It shares many features in

common with the discrete outcome model of Diamond and Maskin although our

interpretation differs somewhat from theirsJ

    Each potential match has two characteristics: a flow rate of output 2x

and a rate of termination a. Distribution F(x) is assumed to be absolute-

ly continuous with finite absolute first moments. The value of a job to a

worker who receives flow rate x (by virtue of the sharing assumption) is

defined as V(X).

    It is determined by the following calculation.



(2.1)
                Ve(X)
                          l+tt+_0t1e( + Ut Vu}•

(Tens    of order o(t) are ignored.) The first term is the (discounted) value of

           alternative model not estimated here is one due to Telser. Ills model
generates the functional form of the equilibrium wage offer distribution but
there is no search in equilibrium.
                                               45



the flaw x over the interval t. The second term is the (discounted)

value of keeping the job times the probability of keeping the job (1—cAt).

The third term is the (discounted) value of becoming unemployed (V) times

the probability of becoming unemployed. Collecting terms and passing to the

limit we reach


                                                    c+UV
                                                        u
(2.2)                                  Ve(X)



As a consequence of F(x) having finite absàlute first moments V                      is

finite. V(X) is increasing in x and has bounded expectation. The

agent   is indifferent between a match that yields an x* such that Ve(X*) = V
and unemployment. For any x ?              x* the agent earns a rent with value

V(X)    —   V. x' is the reservation wage and it is defined as that value of
x* such that

                                                          x*+OV
                                    V(X*) =    V



so


                                                    rVU


     The rate of arrival of encounters is X a                g(L)   assumed to be differ-

entiable. The more participants that are searching in the market (i.e.,

the higher L) the more rapid is the rate of arrival of encounters.

       The value of unemployment is


                             cAt
(2.3)           vu =     —

                                   + (l—AAt)             +    AAt
                                                                    E   max[V(x),v]


(Tens     of o(t) are ignored.) The first term on the right is the discounted
direct    cost of search. The second term is the discounted value of remaining

unemployed tines the probability that no potential match is encountered

(1 —    AAt).   The third term is the probability of encountering a potential

match (A&) times the discounted expected value of the two options that con-

front the agent: to take the match (with value to him of Ve(X)) or to remain

unemployed      (with value V). The expectation is computed with respect to
the distribution F(x).
       Since the model possesses the reservation wage property, passing to the limit
we may write (2.3) for v           >   0   as


(2.4) rV +       c   =   A
                             r/xufl =                                        (x-rV)dF(x).


To   assure that vu      > 0   it is required that

Note that A        (g(L)) must be sufficiently large to support search behavior.

Thus in small markets (e.g. rural areas) search may not be undertaken.

       The   rate of exit   from unemployment is



(2.6)                           h(t) = A(1        —
                                                      p(rV))

while    the rate of exit     from employment is



(2.7)                                  h(t) a      a



       In steady state equilibrium, the number of individuals exiting unemploy-
ment must equal                                  Thus letting P be the
                    the number entering unemployment.

       Condition   (2.8) imposes further constraints on the problem. In particu-

lar for given values of the parameters there may be                  no value of L that
solves    (2.8) or there may be       several. The minimum           size   of the unemployment
pooi    that is required to support an equilibrium with search is (from condition

where        =     xdF(x).   Thus the higher the cost of search, the rate of

interest and the rate of match termination and the lower the mean of the

productivity distribution, the higher the unemployment pool must be to

support a search unemployment equilibrium. Determination of the uniqueness

of the equilibrium hinges on the functional form of the match distribution.

For example, if F(x) is exponential there is at most one equilibrjtnn and

there    is always one for a large enough population

    Assuming     a unique equilibrium, the unemployment rate is




The higher the cost of search and the lower the interest rate, the lower
the equilibrium rate of unemployment. The effect of an increase in a is
ambiguous. Positive translations of the match productivity distribution
reduce   the equilibrium unemployment rate.
    Condition (2.8) may be used in several ways in performing         empirical
work. It provides a check on estimates of the model because the aggregate
unemployment rate i should equal


                               U   =
                                       a+X(l-F(rV))

to L and notice that it is monotone increasing in L.

It   may also   be used to eliminate one parameter from the estimation procedure.


2.2.     Econometrics of the Two State Model


       The   statistical structure of the two           state model     so closely resembles
that of the one state model that a lengthy discussion is unnecessary. Here
we only explicitly consider the case of a homogeneous population.

       As in the one state model,
                                             inequality (2.13) is essential in securing
 structural estimates of the c and A                    functions. Satisfaction of inequal-
 ity (2.5) is essential to make the model
                                                        economically meaningful. As in the
 one state model, the minimum           of   accepted wages (or any fixed order statistic)
 is a consistent estimator of rV.
                                                  A recoverability condition for f(x) is essen-

normally      distributed and       consistent   estimators of the structural parameters.
      As     a consequence      of the homogeneity assumption spells may       be   pooled in
the log likelihood function £.                Thus we may   define

2.3   Estimates of the Two State Model


      This section reports maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters

of two specifications of the two state equilibrium model. The first speci-

fication assumes that (firm or worker) match values are exponentially dis-

tributed; the second assumes that they are normally distributed. Both sets

of estimates are derived under the assumption of homogeneity although we

attempt to control for heterogeneity by estimating the model for one demo-

graphic group: young (20—24) white male high school graduates not attending

school,   sampled from the National Longitudinal Surveys in 1971. A more
complete   description of these data is given below   (Table 1). To make the
model empirically operational we define the unemployment state more broadly       -




than is usually done to include unemployment as conventionally defined plus

nonparticipation in the market.

      The parameter estimates for the two models are presented in Table 1.

The estimated reservation wage is $1.50 (stated as an hourly rate). The

mean length of a job (!)    is   28 months. For both models viability condition

(2.5) is satisfied.

      Table   2 records some of the more interesting features of these esti-
mates. The first two rows record estimates of the cost of search (c)
secured from equation (2.4). These estimates are obviously quite sensitive
to the choice of interest rate r and the assumed functional form for the
distribution of   match productivities. The exit rate from the    nonemployed
("search") state h is 1.21 which implies a mean length of nottemployment
of 8.3 months. Given a and h the implied equilibrium nonemployment
rate is 22.52 which compares closely with the actual nonemployment rate

The mean of the accepted wage offer distribution is x =       3.45 and   the   variance is 1.464.

     *The data are taken from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men, the first
wave of which was collected in 1966. White, not enrolled in full time schooling (in
1971), hourly workers (determined by their current employment status) were used. The
final requirement was made to eliminate the need to compute hourly wage rates for
workers not paid on an hourly basis. We use data on lengths of employment and non—
employment spells occurring in 1971. We use data on accepted wages to estimate the
pareters of the wage distribution. Information from 231 complete and incomplete
unemployment spells and 2915 complete and incomplete nonemployment spells is used.

of 24.5%.

        As discussed in Section One,   estimates   of the rate of job offer or match

arrivals are quite sensitive to the assumed functional form of the offer dis-

tribution.    This is dramatically illustrated in panels four and five of Table 2.
If an exponential model is assumed the estimated mean length of time between
offers ( ) is five months and the probability of receiving no offer in
the next six months is only .3. The probability of accepting a match that
is offered is .6. Thus the exponential model implies a relatively rapid

rate of arrivals of offers and a relatively frequent rate of rejection of
those   offers.

     If a normal model is assumed,      the story changes. In    this case the mean

length of time between offers is 7.5 months and the probability of receiving

no offer in the next six months is .45. However, the probability of ac-

cepting a match that is offered rises to .92. Thus in the normal model,

job arrivals are a relatively rare event and most workers accept the first

job offer they receive.

     In this particular case, the choice of model is clear. The accepted

wage data are not exponentially distributed and an eyeball test indicates

that the implied truncated normal distribution fits the data better. Before

taking much comfort from this point, it is important to recall the point made

in Section One. In order to estimate A it is necessary to assume that
the match offer distribution is recoverable. This requires
making an   arbitrary parametric assumption about the functional form of the
productivity match distribution and the choice of this functional form will
critically affect estimates of certain parameters of the model. Although we
                                          56



can check the plausibility of any assumed functional form (assuming recovera-

bility) by inspecting accepted wage distributions, the power of such a test

is low. The    recoverability condition cannot be tested.

new points are made     there.     (A) Nonanticipated shocks in nonnarket time   are

model   widely used in social science is provided. Point A is particularly Im-
portant because it     provides a good economic reason, not provided in this section,
for   matches between workers and firms     to dissolve.   A worker (or entrepreneur)

may terminate a match in the model of Appendix B because of an unanticipated

increase in the value of nonmarket time. More general        models   of this type

are presented.ln Coleman     and   Reclean (1981).

                        Summary and Conclusions

     This paper takes a first step toward developing rigorous structural
econometric models f or the empirical analysis of labor force dynamics.
The analysis is presented In continuous time although most of the new
points raised here apply with full force to discrete time models. Rigorous
structural estimation requires the solution of new problems that have not
been addressed in previous work. We identify those problems and offer
some solutions. We have also stated certain unsolved problems in the
belief that their clear statement will focus attention on the relevant
issues that should be addressed in subsequent econometric research on
structural. models of labor force dynamics.
    A key condition required in our analysis is a recoverability
dition that is implicit in all econometric analyses of truncated data
of which structural models for the analysis of labor force dynamics are
a special case. This condition must be satisfied in order to recover an
untruncated distribution from a truncated distribution with a iciown point
of truncation. A major conclusion of our analysis is that a recoverability
condition will only be satisfied if the untruncated distribution is assumed
to belong to a parametric family. It is not satisfied for all parametric
families. Recoverability is not a testable proposition.
    The implications of this analysis are far'-ranging. Economic theory
is rarely so specific as to predict the functional forms of untruncated
distributions.' Thus, at its foundation, structural estimation in all
                                      58



 truncated   data models involves an Intrinsically arbitrary decomposition
 of reduced f on parameters into structural components. Both formally,
 and by way of empirical examples, we have demonstrated that estimates of
 structural parameters are very sensitive to arbitrary choices made about
 functional forms required to anpirically implement structural models.
 Put more succinctly, consistent non—parametric estimation of the parameters
 of most   structural duration (and truncated data) models is impossible.
 The   arbitrariness inherent in structural estimation is essential.
        Granting the satisfaction of a recoverability condition (as the
 entire literature on the econometrics of truncated data has done) we
 have also demonstrated that structural estimation in a gEneral class
of dynamic labor force models requires the utilization of inequality
constraints on accepted wage offers. Unless these constraints are used,
the structural parameters of the model are not identified. Previous
analysts have not noted this essential feature of these models.
       Incorporation of the identifying inequality constraints into an
estimation   procedure raises certain nonstandard statistical problems.

Conventional   regularity conditions are violated so that the standard
theory of maximum likelihood estimation does not apply. We develop
the appropriate statistical theory for certain cases likely to be of
interest in applications but we have not developed the general case in
this paper, although we indicate how this might be done.


     (l)A notable exception is the analysis of Telser on equilibrium
price and wage distributions.
                                        59



       We   also formulate a structural two state equilibrium matching model
of unemployment and estimate a simple version of it. Previous empirical
research on labor force dynamics has been conducted within the framework
of partial equilibrium search models which are not internally consistent
because they imply degenerate equilibrium wage distributions. The model
developed in this paper produces a nondegenerate equilibrium wage offer
distribution.
      Empirical results obtained from this model provide an economically
meaningful decomposition of the parameters of reduced form exit rates
from unemployment. However, we demonstrate that the estimated structural
parameters are very sensitive to arbitrary assumptions about functional
forms of estimating equations. We demonstrate that two different behavioral
models are broadly consistent with the same data.
      Our initial enthusiasm for structural estimation has been tempered
somewhat by the analytical and computational problems reported in this
paper.      The econometric analysis of structural duration models is still

in   its infancy. We are confident that subsequent       analysis will   solve
some of the problems left unsolved here.

      Nonetheless, because much analysis of structural models remains

to be done, because basic facts on labor force dynamics remain to be

collated and analyzed and    because   of the inherent   arbitrariness   of the

identifying assumptions used to secure structural estimates (and the

sensitivity of estimates of structural parameters to such assumptions),

we also feel that a reduced form approach to analyzing labor force models
                                   60



may be a useful complement to the structural approach presented in this
paper. A companion paper (nina and Heclcnan, 1982) develops a reduced
form approach to the empirical analysis of labor force dynamics.

       A complete analysis for the case of a general distribution for Z is a

task    for   the future. Here we analyze the exponential example with no cen-

soring f or a case in which A and c are positive constants and

e(z)       exp(Z8$).      Analysis   of this example serves as a prototype for the

more general case.



       The   model is that of equations (1.19), (1.20) and (1.21) In the text with

                                         A,c > 0.


A critical aspect of this problem is that £ is monotonically increasing in

A and decreasing in c and hence                   monotonically increasing In   A/c. The

constraints are thus always effective in securing determinate solutions for

         As a consequence of the fact that £             is   monotone increasing in A/c

(for     fixed 8).        the   maximum likelihood estimator of A and c is derived
by choosing A/c so that

      The estimation strategy in this model is thus analogous                 to that presented

shown      to be asymptotically normal (with norming factor IN).

of the hyperplanes defined by each inequality in the vector of inequalities

The values of •          expressed as a function of P trace out a $ frontier.

are as many edges on the frontier as elements In 8 —                     (i.e., K    Kx).
For   any   given value of        and for given values of Z9, Z and 1, the

      In   an iteration cycle, for fixed 89 and 8x' it is thus possible,              in general,
to   solve out for B        as a function of B, Z and 8. The likelihood

function is then maximized with respect to 8x and                      and new values of

the frontier are solved out, etc.

      Estimation   in    the more general case (A—5) proceeds along similar lines

                        A Multistate Model of Labor Force

         This   appendix presents a prototypical
                                                      model of labor force dynamics.
                                                                                       With
   the exception of
                       pioneering work by Toikka (1976), there
                                                                    are few examples of mul-
   tistate stnctural models of labor force dynamics. The
                                                         multistate models esti-
  mated by   Marston (1976) were not given a
                                                 structural interpretation
         Agents have linear utility functions
                                                  and they are assumed to live forever.
  There is stochastic variation
                                     in the (monetary) value of nonmarket time in addi-
  tion to stochastic variation
                                    in the wage offers received by agents. Variation
  in   nonmarket tine can   arise because of variation in the demand f or home time caused
  by children, illness, and
                                the like. Considering such sources of unanticipated
  stochastic fluctuation in     the value of non—market tine (not
                                                                  known to the agent)
 enables us to produce      a tractable economic model of labor force
                                                                      narticiaation
 and job turnover that is especially helpful in exnlainl.ng the
                                                                 labor force norer,epts

       We
        permit wage offers to arrive while individuals are employed.
                                                                     Wage growth
 occurs over the life cycle as individuals take repeated drawings
                                                                          from common wage
 distributions      .Burdett's model of on the job search (1978) ignores nonmarket
                                                                                   parti-
cipation    and so his theory produces
                                         a life cycle theory of the growth of wages
with age. Our model produces a theory of the growth of
                                                        wages with work experience.
Thus an individual who withdraws
                                 from the work force because of a high value of
household tine will forfeit his
                                     wage growth. That wages grow with work experience
and not, primarily, with
                         age, is the key finding of Mincer (1974) so that our model
is more in accord with the facts
                                 than Burdett's and is especially suited to explain
the wage growth of women.
                           By permitting employed workers to receive job offers
we also produce a simple model of job turnover.           -




         material   is based on Coleman and Heckman
                                                          (1981).

              Our model also departs
                                       from previous work by
                                                               permitting individuals who are
      not in the labor force to
                                    receive wage offers. Our model
                                                                       thus predicts that it
      is possible to observe
                                 individuals who transit from being out of the labor force
      to the employed state who
                                    never report themselves as being unemployed, as in fact
  is    observed in the data. The labor market state '1uneml           d" is   defined as that
  state       in which the rate of arrival,
                                              of job offers is higher than in   the other labor
  force       states. Individuals may    choose to become unemployed if the    rate of job offer ar-
  rivals in the state is
                         sufficiently high. The cost of being unemployed is a direct
  money cost as well as the value of household
                                               time foregone. In order to make the
 unemployed state an economically viable
                                                  option, the rate of arrival of job offers
 while unemployed must exceed the rate in the out of the labor
                                                                          force stateJ
          There are many other
                                  ways to model unemployment which we do not pursue here.
 Unemployment may       simply   be a nomnarket state in which
                                                                 individuals collect unemploy-
 ment    payments and consi.zme nonmarket time. Given the fixed duration
                                                                                of most unem-
 ploymen benefit programs, such a model would be inherently
                                                                       nonstationary although
 analytically tractable (i.e., it delivers qualitative results).
      Our model is similar to one developed
                                             by Toikka. Both models consider search in
 an environment in whicn the value of
                                      household time changes randomly. our model
 ismore general in that (a wage offers and changes in the value of nonmarket
                                                                              time
are not constrained to ariive one per period as in his discrete time model and (b)
                                                                                                 we
do not assume the arbitrary
                            sequential ordering of decisions that he imposes
in his, model. The rate of time preference is p.

     The distribution of wage offers F(x) is assumed to be absolutely
                                                                      continuous with
finite absolute moments. Successive wage offers are statistically independent.

The value of nonmarket time is a random variable with distribution function
                                                                            G(n)

with finite absolute moments. Successive values of nonmarket time are statistically

independent. In all states the arrivals of new values of n are governed by a Poisson

process with parameter 'j.      The probability of receiving a new value of n in the

interval At is uAt ÷ 0(M).

       In the employed state, wage offers arrive by a Poisson proceSs with parameter

A. In the nonmarket labor state, wage offers arrive by a Poisson proceSs

with parameter A. In the unemployed state wage offers arrive by a Poisson process

with parameter X, and to satisfy viability A > A           and A      A.
       Employed workers may leave their current job for two reasonsJ They may leave

if a new value of household tine n is drawn that is sufficiently high.           They also

may leave if they receive a wage offer elsewhere that is sufficiently high. To

simplify the presentation we      ignore   any transaction costs in movement among these states,

although   the framework developed can readily be extended to accommodate such costs.
       The value of a job that pays instantaneous wage x when a household opportunity
n is available is V(x). It is determined by computing the expected value of all
the outcomes that      can occur to an individual   who holds such   a job.

       There are three possibilities. First, in a small interval of time, no wage

offer may be      received and there may be no change in the value of nonmarket time.
If it is optimal to hold a job at the beginning of the interval it is also optimal
to hold it at the end. Second, the agent may receive a ew nonmarket value of time
a.    (This could be due to birth of children or the like.)         In this event he   compares
the   value of staying on the job with the value of the nonmarket state defined here

as S (a). The expected value of the        maximum of these two   options is computed at

the   beginning   of the interval At and is a component of V(x). Third, the agent

may receive a new market wage offer x' in time interval At. If this event occurs,

he compares the value of the current job to the value of the offered job. Because

of the Poisson assumption, the probability of receiving both a new wage and a new

       1CO1n and Heclcuan (1981) consider a more general model with exogenous
terminations. In addition, they permit wage offers and nonmarket time offers to
be correlated contemporaneously and over time.

          Thus V(x) is defined as

  The first term is the present value of wages x received
                                                          over the next small inter-
  val of tine t. The second
                                      term is the present value of the value of a job (V(x))
  times the probability that no new wage offer is received
                                                                   (l_AeAt) times the probabil—
 fly that no new market offers
                                       arrive (l—jtht). Neglecting terms of order smaller
  than oCAt), (i—(X+p)At) is the probability of no new
                                                       noninaricet offers, and no
 job termination, If this
                           event occurs, the optimal policy is to continue working
 at wage x because no new information
                                      has arrived to change the agent's optimal
 decision, and because the
                           optimal policy is stationary (because of the infinite
 life assumption).

       The third ten is the
                                 probability of receiving a new nonmarket draw (pAt)
 times the discounted
                          expected value of the maximum of two
                                                                   options that exist if
he receives such a draw:       to continue to work at wage x (V(x)) or to switch to

nonmaricet activity with value S(n).         The expectation is computed with respect to

        S(n) is the value of household activity given nonmarket draw n. Its deriva-

tion is analogous to that given for V(x). Three things can happen to a person

engaged in household activity at the beginning of interval At. (1) No new nonmarket

or market draws arrive.                This event occurs with probability (l—(X+p)At).

In this case, the individual continues to stay out of the workforce. (2) A new

nonmarket draw arrives.               This event occurs with probability itht.            If it does

occur, the individual chooses the labor force option that gives the maximum of the

new S(n) or the value of search Q.                 If   he chooses to search, the individual is

unemployed. (3) A market wage offer may arrive. This event occurs with probability

AAt. If it does occur, the individual chooses the option with the highest valtLe: he

either continues on in the nonmarket state or takes the job offer. As before, the

simultaneous arrival of a wage offer and fresh nonmarket draw is of negligible

probability.

        Defining Q       as    the value of search, we may write S(n)
                                    (l—(A+p)At)

        Q       is derived by an     analogous argument. A searching individual is assumed

to   consume no nomnarket time (an assumption               that can easily be relaxed) and to

incur       instantaneous   costs of search c. Thus we write
                                   (1—U +p)At)              A At

An unemployed individual may transit to employment or to the nonmarket participa-
tion state.

      Formal properties of this model (and more general models) are established

in Coleman      and   Heclcman. A standard contraction mapping argument establishes the

existence and uniqueness of an optimal policy under the stated conditions. The

          Define R    as the reservation wage value of n that makes an employed individual

    who has Just received a new nonmarket value of n indifferent between

partiipation.        It is Implicitly defined by solving 8(R)                            Q.
        The reservation wages are thus defined             by the following equations:
 (B—4a)         V(x) =     SOt(x))                (B—4b)                 V(x)                              Ree =   x

        This three equation system can be solved for the functionals V(x), 8(n) and

Q       in terms of c, p, A, A, A and the parameters of dG(n) and dF(x). Using

the reservation wage functions defined above, these three equations produce re-

strictions across the parameters of the transition matrix governing transitions
 among the three states. (For more details, see Coleman and Heclcuan,. 1981.)

        The densities of duration times in each labor force state have a simple re-

 presentation in terms of the reservation wages and arrival rates of offers. The

 econometric model produced by the theory is a competing risks model of the sort

 widely used in the duration analysis literature. (See
                                                                      Kalbfleisch and Prentice, 1980.)
 We establish the analogy by briefly reviewing that model using terminology from

 the biostatjstjcs literature.

        A patient can die from many causes that are assumed to operate independently.

 Suppose that there are two diseases, each of which is fatal. The time to death

 from disease one is
                           t1,
                                 if it is   the only disease afflicting the patient, while
 the   time to death from disease two is t2, if disease two is the only one afflicting
 the patient. In the presence of both diseases, the time to death is m.in(t1,t2).
   and      t2 are clearly only hypothetical random variables each of which would

characterize time to death if the other disease is not at work.

       Suppose that each disease considered in isolation produces an exponential

time   to    death. Thus

The competing risks model can be applied to the three state model of labor force
dynamics. For example, an employed individual is subject to two risks: (a) get-
ting a higher wage on another job and (b) getting a nonmarket draw that causes
him to terminate his current job. Whichever risk occurs first causes him to exit
his current job. Define E as the hypothetical duration of employment in the
                                                        73


current job if the only possible exit is to another job. efliS the hypothetical

duration of employment if the only possible exit is to the nonmarket state. Each

random variable has an exponential distribution as a consequence of the tine sta-

tionary Markovian process produced by the theory. The hazard rate for the density

off ee    is

where x is the current wage in the employed state and the hazard for the density

Given knowledge of x and x', and an assumed functional form for F, it is possible

to estimate consistently the parameters of F as the number of observed e to e

transitions becomes large. Consistent estimates of this density are not possible

without imposing a recoverability condition. Thus the model is nonparametrically

underidentified but parametrically identified. Since it is possible to use dura-

tion data to consistently estimate h, assuming recoverability is satisfied, Xe

can be consistently estimated (see B-8).

      A parallel argument may be developed for transitions from other states. Thus

the duration to tine spent in an unemployment spell has density

From a sample    of accepted wages for unemployed individuals it                      is   possible to use

since it is possible to use the duration data to estimate consistently h•

Using    (8—14) and (8—17) one can estimate s (simply sum the two hazards).
If n is observed, R        can be           consistently estimated by             the smallest n



1This is an enormous simplification. Some data sets ask respondents questions
   which can be used to infer n. An analysis of the more general case in which
   n is unimown to the econometrician is presented in Coleman and Eeclar&an (1981).

observed in the nonmarket state. Assuming recoverability, G(n) can be

consistently estimated.

       Thus under the assumptions made, it is possible to consistently estimate

A,   A, A,   F(x),       (3(n), Re R, RtR, R and R. The asymptotic
distribution   theory for these estimators ià produced by an analysis similar to
that given in the text, Part 1. For more detail see Coleman and Eeclan (1981).
In order to use the theory to secure structural estimates of the parameters of
the model it is necessary to sole (B—4) —      (B—7)   iteratively to compute the
reservation wage values needed to form the sample likelihood function. See
Coleman and Reckman (1981).
       The distinguishing feature of this model is that the theory imposes cross
transition   restrictions. These restrictions have not been noted or imposed in

previous empirical work on labor force turnover. (See, e.g. Tuma and Robbins,

1980.) These restrictions aid in model identification and provide tests of the

theory. We have already noted that the model predicts wage growth as a function

of experience. By parameterizing nonnarket distributions we are able to produce

a rich class of turnover models which enable us to introduce economic analysis

from household economics into turnover models. Children, nonmarket income,

health status and the like determine     the value of nonmarket time.

doubt would be cast on the standard search model. This hypothesis can be tested

assuming that a recoverability condition is satisfied. For further analysis of

this   model and more   general models see Coleman and Heckman (1981).

                             Appendix   C: the Kief er—Neumann Procedure

     This Appendix        discusses the relationship between the analysis in Section 1

of the text and the Kief er—Neumann analysis of search unemployment (1979, 1981),

We demonstrate that        the   Kiefer—Neumann analysis is critically dependent on the

assumption that agents receive one offer per period (however the period is defined).

We also note that even under their assumptions, their estimator is less

efficient than the one presented in the text because they overlook a critical piece

of information which we exploit. We further demonstrate that their inefficient

estimation approach does not generalize to a continuous time setting and so cannot

be used as a substitute for the analysis of the more general model given in the text.

        The   iCiefer   and Neumann approach is a direct application of statistical results

developed in the sample selection bias literature (see Heckinan, 197Gb and 1979 and

Heclcman and Macurdy, 1981) and in the literature on female labor supply (see Smith,

1980). F(x) is a log normal distribution so in X is normaly distributed with

mean zB and variance 2 Wage offers arrive one per "period". Following Lippman

and Mccall (1976) the reservation wage rV is defined as the solution to

(c—i)                             c + rV   =         (x   —
                                                              rV)dF(x)
for rV                  We may solve for R* — rV       (for r assumed known)

(C—2)                                           R*(c,zS,r).

Properties of R* have already been established in the text (just fix A = 1 in the

analysis of section 1.1). Given their log normality assumption, it is convenient

to work with

 (C—3)                              R      in R = R(c,zS,r).
         conditional on z, the probability that an unemployment spell terminates at

period j is (see section 1.2)                    -

         Kiefer and Neumann ignore this restriction in derivinc' their estl"'ates.

Exactly as in the analysis of sections 1.3—1.5, the likelihood function formed from

the joint density is monotonic in c and constraint C—li is always satisfied as an

equality for at least one observation.

        Kiefer and Neumann do not maximize the likelihood for their model. Instead,

they use an indirect two stage approach patterned exactly after previous models

estimated in the female labor supply literature. They first use data on unemploy-
                                                                                    R(c,zB,r)—zB
ment duration in a likelihood formed from (C—5) to estimate

as   a reduced   form index. (This      sta2e corresponds to estimating an equation
determining whether or not a woman           works.)          Using this estimated index, they i-hen
follow    previous econotnetrlc work in F sTtale labor eupplv and esttixnate \ (see
equations (C—9) and (C—b)). From-a regression of accented wages or                           and

consistently     estimate B and   a.
                                              79


       From the estimated S and C   it   is possible to solve from the estimated index

R(c,zS,r)—zB for each observation, to estimate

                                         R(c,zS,r)

for each observation. Using a nonlinear procedure, it is possible to consistently

estimate   c using the restriction implied in (C—l). Kiefer and Neumann:       (1981)

use an    iterated variant of this procedure.
       The estimates derived from this procedure are not efficient because they do

not exploit all the information in the sample (i.e., they are not derived from the

likelihood function)J1 Moreover, the two stage procedure is critically dependent

on the assumption that agents receive one off er per "period." In that case, the

per period probability of accepting a job (1—F(R)) is also the denominator of the

conditional density of wage offers. (See (C—6).) From the duration probit, it

is possible to estimate the selection index (

 correct for truncation bias in the estimated accepted wage offer distribution. In the

more   general case in which the probability of receiving an offer is less than one,
the per period probability of accepting a job is not the denominator of C—6. (For
a continuous time example see equations (1.4) and (1.5) in the text; the point

applies    to either a continuous time or discrete time model.) Thus in the more

general case, if the rate of arrival of job offers is not known, it is not

possible to estimate   the selectivity variable (X in equation (C—8)) from the
duration data alone; thus the two stage procedure outlined above breaks down.
Structural estimation requires utilization of the inequality restrictions
exploited in Section 1.
     Another point not noted by Kiefer and Neumann is that under the assumption
that   agents receive one wage offer per period, it is      always possible to recover

1One offsetting advantage is that      their estimators are less sensitive to
   measurement error   because they do not use  extreme value observations while
   the estimators in the text    are based on extreme observations. The efficiency
   comparison made in the text is rather stark.         v1(e—c) obtained from maximizing the
   likelihood has zezo large sample variance I

the untruncated wage offer distribution (above the truncation point) from the

truncated   distribution precisely because     the denominator of the truncated

distribution     is   Ictown (see the discussion in section 1.3, esvecially on tages

10—li    and footnote 1 on page 11). Thus, provided that the reservation wage
is    estimated in the manner we suggest in    the text, the   untruncated distribution

of   wage offers is always recoverable from the sample truncated distribution if
agents receive one wage offer per period. Thus it is not necessary to impose
a functional form for accepted wages onto the data. Under their assumptions
all    the structural parameters of the model are nonparametrically identified.

        Adding   unobserved heterogeneity to the model in the fashion of Hecbian
and Willis (1977) or Kiefer and Nemnnn (1981) does not alter our conclusIons
in this Appendix in any fundamental way. For the sake of brevity, we refrain
froQ    extending our analysis to include     this   case.
