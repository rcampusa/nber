                                           ABSTRACT

We consider assets when individuals were last observed prior to death in the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) and trace assets backwards to the age when these individuals were first observed. For
most individuals, assets in the last year observed (LYO) were very similar to assets in the first year
observed (FYO). In particular, most of those who were last observed with very low asset levels also
had low assets when first observed. We also estimate the relationship between an individual’s asset
change between the first and last date of observation, that individual’s education and health status
when first observed, and that individual’s within-sample changes in health and family composition.
We obtain estimates for HRS respondents who were 51 to 61 in 1992 and for AHEAD respondents
who were age 70 and over in 1993.

       Many individuals reach the end of life with limited financial assets. This paper
explores the determinants of asset balances at death by following respondents in the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) “backward” from the last wave prior to their death
to the first wave in which they were observed. We first document the relationship
between the assets in an individual’s last year observed (LYO) before death and assets
in the first year observed (FYO). We then estimate the effect of individual attributes, in
particular health status and education, and changes in these attributes, on the
relationship between assets when first and last observed.
       There is particular interest in the factors that lead some individuals to have very
low wealth levels near the end of life. There are several pathways that can lead to this
outcome. One is for an individual or household to enter retirement with modest or
substantial assets, and then to experience unanticipated events that drain financial
resources. For some individuals, the death of a spouse or divorce may result in a
decline in wealth. For others, the costs associated with a health event such as a stroke
or the onset of a chronic illness may lead to substantial reductions in assets. For still
others, a decline in wealth may accompany a general decline in health, a pattern that is
documented in Poterba, Venti and Wise (2010) and a number of other studies.
       A second pathway to low assets at death is to enter retirement with some
accumulated assets, but to “outlive” them without extraordinary expenditures at any
point during retirement. This explanation is most likely to apply to those in households
in which one or both individuals lived longer than they expected to.
       A third pathway to low assets at death is beginning the retirement period with low
assets, the result of low or no saving before retirement. Individuals in households that
enter retirement with very limited wealth are unlikely to have substantial wealth when
they are last observed. For these individuals, low wealth at the end of life is not a
manifestation of economic choices or events during retirement, but rather of events in
the pre-retirement period.
       Our aim is to assess these three alternative pathways in light of data on
observed asset trajectories late in life. We motivate our analysis with a series of figures
that follow the path of assets between the year when an individual is first, and the year
when she is last, observed. These figures summarize the widely-varying data on

                                             2
household balance sheets by presenting median assets. They are shown for individuals
aged 51 to 61 in 1992 (the original HRS cohort) and those aged 70 and older in 1993
(the original AHEAD cohort). We show separate figures to disaggregate the sample by
education level and by family status. The figures generally show little difference
between median assets when first and when last observed for those in the younger
cohort, and only a modest decline in assets for those in the older cohort.
       We then estimate regression models relating the change in assets between the
first and last year when an individual is observed and various individual attributes, some
fixed and some time-varying. Simulations based on these estimates show relatively flat
asset trajectories by age for those who do not experience a change in family
composition or in health status. However, many individuals exhibit substantial asset
declines in connection with important medical events or disruptions in family
composition. The rate at which assets decline between the years when an individual is
first and last observed is negatively related to the individual’s education level.
       This analysis is closely related to the findings we report Poterba, Venti, and Wise
(2012), which summarizes individuals’ asset holdings in the last survey wave preceding
their death. Banerjee (2015) presents similar findings. Rather than tracking all HRS
respondents who die before 2012, as we do, he focuses on the HRS respondents who
die between 2010 and 2012. His results confirm the prevalence of low levels of assets
in the years prior to death. Our findings in this paper are also related to a much broader
literature, surveyed by DeNardi, French, and Jones (2015), that seeks to identify factors
affecting wealth accumulation and decumulation in retirement. Numerous studies have
used the HRS to consider the effect of health and family disruptions on wealth. Coile
and Milligan (2009), French, DiNardi, Jones, Baker, and Doctor (2006), Lee and Kim
(2007), Smith (1999, 2004, 2005), and Wu (2003), among others, estimate the effect of
new health events on wealth or on other measures of socio-economic status. These
studies find that health events are an important source of variation in wealth. In related
work, Sevak, Weir and Willis (2003/2004), Johnson et al. (2006) and Coile and Milligan
(2009) show that widowhood is associated with large reductions in wealth.
       This paper is divided into four sections. Section one describes the data used in
the analysis. Section 2 shows how asset balances in the LYO compare to balances in

                                              3
the FYO. Section 3 presents the regression results that explore the individual attributes
that are associated with changes in assets between the FYO and LYO. Section 4
summarizes our results and discusses future directions for research.


1. Data Description
      Our analysis is based on two cohorts from the HRS – the original HRS cohort
whose members were first surveyed in 1992 when they were between the ages of 51
and 61 and the original Asset and Health Dynamics among the Oldest Old (AHEAD)
cohort whose members were over the age of 70 when first surveyed in 1993. In both
cohorts, we drop “age ineligible” spouses (not age 51 to 61 in the HRS and not age 70+
in the AHEAD). We also drop respondents who leave the sample for reasons other
than death and we drop the 1992 wave of the HRS because of incomplete data for
some variables. With one exception, respondents are surveyed biennially so we are
able to use data for 10 waves: 1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010
and 2012 for the HRS cohort and 1993, 1995, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008,
2010 and 2012 for the AHEAD cohort. We choose to use the 1993 AHEAD wave,
despite concerns about understatement of wealth in that wave that have been raised by
Rohwedder, Haider, and Hurd (2006), to maximize the sample size of our subsequent
cohorts. In the figures we present below, the 1993 observations for the AHEAD sample
do not seem substantially different from the 1995 values, which supports for including
this sample wave.
      For each respondent, there is a last year observed (LYO). If an individual is last
observed prior to 2012, then the data for the LYO pertain to the last year observed prior
to death. If the LYO is 2012, then the data are for a respondent who was alive when
last observed. Respondents are surveyed approximately every two years, so for those
who die within our sample period, the date at which assets are measured in the LYO
may be as much as two years prior to the date of death. On average it will be about
one year prior to death. Because medical expenditures are often substantial in the last
six months of life, asset balances observed in the last wave before death may over-
estimate assets at the time of death.



                                            4
       In principle, we could obtain more precise estimates of assets at the time of
death from “exit interviews” administered to a surviving spouse, child or other
knowledgeable person after the death of a respondent. These exit interviews obtain
information on the finances of the deceased in the period between the last core
interview and the time of death. We have not used these data because exit interviews
were not obtained for approximately 20 percent of deceased persons and key
components of wealth are missing for many of the remaining 80 percent. Marshall,
McGarry and Skinner (2011), who study late-life medical expenses, use the exit
interviews, imputing medical expenditures when necessary but also relying on the core
interviews to obtain components of wealth. Since much of our analysis is based on a
relatively small subsample of deceased persons, retaining as many of these
observations as possible is a high priority. While in principle we could impute
components of wealth for the missing and incomplete exit interviews, this approach
could be unreliable given the small samples we are studying and the fact that mortality
is correlated with individual attributes, making selection a substantial concern.
       We define “assets” inclusive of home equity and the net value of other real
estate, business assets, and financial assets. IRA and Keogh balances are included in
financial assets, but assets in 401(k) plans are not included--401(k) assets were not
collected for the AHEAD cohort and the data are incomplete in some years (in particular
1994 to 1998) for the HRS cohort. This is not an important concern for members of the
older AHEAD cohort because they were unlikely to have participated in 401(k) plans.
These plans were first authorized in 1982 and did not become widespread until the late
1980s and early 1990’s. They were largely unavailable to members of the AHEAD
cohort who were age 70 or older in 1993. Members of the HRS cohort were more likely
to work for an employer offering a 401(k) plan. Many 401(k) balances are rolled over
into IRA accounts, especially when employees change employers. The portion of
401(k) balances not rolled over into an IRA at retirement is excluded from our measure
of assets. So is the capitalized value of annuity income from Social Security and
defined benefit (DB) pensions. The income from both Social Security and DB pensions
is included in our definition of household income. All income streams and asset
balances have been converted to 2012 dollars using the CPI-U.

                                             5
       Our unit of observation is the person, but the asset balance associated with each
person is drawn from the household asset balance. Some results are presented
separately by family status pattern, distinguishing those who were continuously single,
continuously married, or married to single. More details on how family status groups
are defined as well as on other aspects of the data are presented below.


2. Background and Descriptive Information
       We begin by summarizing the distributions of assets when respondents are last
observed and when they are first observed. As noted above, the interval between the
first and last observation for a person can be as short as two years or as long as
nineteen years. The tables below only consider the distribution of assets for deceased
persons for whom the number of years between the LYO and the FYO is eight or more.
Each table, and each associated figure, presents results separately for the HRS and
AHEAD cohorts. To provide further insight on the financial circumstances of those with
very low asset levels, we also report the joint distribution of assets in the LYO and
annuity income in the LYO. To facilitate the comparison of assets at different ages, all
assets are converted to 2012 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.
       After summarizing the distributions, we provide additional detail on the
prevalence of zero and negative asset balances when individuals are last observed and
we present figures that provide more detail on asset trajectories by age, family status
and level of education. The tables focus exclusively on individuals who died within our
sample period, but the figures include those who were still alive when last observed.
2.1 Summary Tabulations
       Tables 2-1a and 2-1b show assets in the first year observed conditional on
assets in the last year observed for all individuals who died during the sample period.
We exclude all persons for whom the interval between the FYO and the LYO is fewer
than eight years; for very short periods between FYO and LYO, a high correlation
between the two is almost mechanical. Each table includes three panels. The top
panel shows total non-annuity assets (defined to include housing wealth, financial
assets, other real estate and business assets), the middle panel shows housing equity
(including the net value of other real estate) and the bottom panel shows net financial

                                             6
assets (all non-housing wealth). Table 2-1a considers all persons between the ages of
51 and 61 in 1992 (the HRS cohort) and the Table 2-1b considers all persons over the
age of 70 in 1993 (the AHEAD cohort).
       We first consider the results for total assets in the top panel of each table. The
last column of each of these panels shows that a large fraction of persons die with
minimal non-annuity assets. Among persons age 51 to 61 in 1992, 14.9 percent had
non-annuity asset balances that were zero (or negative) just prior to death. Another 23
percent had positive asset balances of less than $50,000. Of persons age 70 and older
in 1993, 13.3 percent had zero or negative non-annuity assets just prior to death and
another 25.4 percent had positive balances below $50,000. The cell entries in each
table show that for a large proportion of persons, non-annuity assets at death are similar
in magnitude to the comparable assets when first observed. For example, for persons
in the HRS cohort, 48.2 percent of those with zero or negative wealth when last
observed had zero or negative wealth when first observed in 1994. A larger subset of
this group, 79 percent, had less than $50,000 when first observed. Of those with
greater than $500,000 when last observed, 52.1 percent had $500,000 or more when
first observed and 82.3 percent had greater than $250,000 when first observed. Similar
patterns can be seen in Table 2-1b for persons aged 70 and older in 1993. These
tables suggest that for most individuals, non-annuity assets at death are not so different
from non-annuity assets when first observed. This is true both for those who were
between 51 and 61 in 1992 and those who were age 70 or older in 1993. A large
fraction of persons with meager assets at death also had limited assets when first
observed. Most of those with substantial assets at death also had substantial assets
when first observed.
       These comparisons are more striking if estimates along the diagonal (in bold) are
combined with the estimates to the left and to the right of the diagonal element. For
example, of HRS persons with assets in the $1-$50,000 interval in the LYO, 42.8
percent were in the same interval in the FYO, but 81 (= 21.4 + 42.8 + 16.8) percent are
in this interval or in the intervals to the left and right of this interval, that is, 81 percent
had had assets of less than $100,000 in the FYO. Thus of persons who had positive
assets of less than $50,000 in the LYO, only 19 percent had assets more than $100,000

                                                 7
in the FYO. A similar calculation reveals than of the persons who had zero (or negative)
assets when last observed, only 16.5 percent had more than $100,000 in assets when
first observed.
       The bottom two panels of each table show the distributions of housing and
financial assets respectively. For both the HRS and the AHEAD cohorts, the
relationship between housing equity in the LYO and the FYO are very similar to the
relationship for total assets. The same is true for financial assets. Persons with low
housing wealth in the LYO also tend to have low housing wealth when first observed.
For example, of those in the HRS cohort who had housing assets in the $1-$50,000
interval in the LYO, 88.5 percent had housing wealth less than $100,000 when first
observed. For the AHEAD cohort, the comparable statistic is 74.5 percent. The
corresponding values for persons with positive financial wealth of less than $50,000 in
the LYO are 87.2 percent for the HRS cohort, and 86.4 percent for the AHEAD cohort.
The factors that lead some individuals with less than $100,000 in financial assets when
first observed to report significantly higher assets when last observed warrants further
exploration.
       The row percentages in Tables 2-1a and 2-1b show the probability of being in a
given asset interval in the FYO given the level of assets in the LYO. Tables 2-2a and 2-
2b present the same underlying data in a different way, by reporting the probability of
being in a given asset interval in the last year observed conditional on the level of
assets in the first year observed. As in the previous tables, results are only shown for
those for whom the interval between the FYO and the LYO is eight or more years. The
results once again suggest a great deal of persistence: those who have substantial
assets when first observed also tend to have substantial assets when last observed
prior to death. For both age groups, over 55 percent of those with zero or negative total
assets in the FYO also have zero or negative total assets in the LYO. For the younger
age cohort, 73.8 percent of persons in the top total asset interval (> $500,000) in the
FYO are also in the top total asset interval in the LYO. In the older cohort, persistence
in the top total asset interval is somewhat lower: only 57.3 percent of those in this
interval when first observed were also there when last observed.



                                             8
       The relationships between assets when first and last observed are similar for
housing wealth and for financial wealth. In the HRS cohort, 76.2 percent of persons
with zero or negative housing wealth in the FYO had zero or negative housing wealth in
the LYO. For the AHEAD cohort, this statistic is 90.7 percent. For persons in the $250-
500,000 housing wealth interval in the FYO, only 24.1 percent of the HRS sample, and
30.9 percent of the AHEAD sample, had housing wealth in this interval when last
observed, and most had less.
       Financial assets also tend to decline between the first and last years observed.
In the HRS cohort, 61.5 percent of persons with zero or negative financial assets in the
FYO also had zero or negative assets in the LYO. Only 29.3 percent of persons with
assets in the $250-500,000 interval had assets in this interval in the LYO; 34.1 percent
had more and 36.7 percent less. For the AHEAD cohort, 45.9 percent of those with
zero or negative financial assets in the FYO also has zero or negative assets in the
LYO, and only 20.7 percent of those with assets in $250-500,000 interval in the FYO
had assets in this interval in the LYO. For this group, 28.3 percent had more, and 51.0
percent less, financial assets in the LYO. The data suggest a general tendency for both
housing wealth and financial wealth to decline modestly between the FYO and the LYO
for both the HRS and the AHEAD cohorts.
       To provide a simple way to visualize the mobility patterns across the asset
intervals in Tables 2-2a and 2-2b, Figures 2-1a and 2-1b show the percentage of
individuals who are in each FYO interval who moved to a higher interval, dropped to a
lower interval, or stayed in the same interval when they were last observed. For both the
lowest and the highest interval the chart is of limited interest, but for individuals whose
asset holdings place them one of the four middle categories, the graph shows the
pattern of mobility. The contrast between the two figures illustrates the greater
likelihood of individuals in the AHEAD sample, who are older than those in the HRS
sample, moving to a lower asset interval when last observed than when first observed.
Both figures illustrate that for those in the lowest asset category when first observed, the
probability of being observed at a similarly low level of assets when last observed is
very high.

        To highlight those individuals who reach the end of life with very few assets,
Table 2-3 provides further information on asset trajectories for those who have positive,
zero and negative asset balances in the LYO before death. Negative asset balances
just prior to death are common, particularly for those in the younger cohort. The primary
source of negative wealth is consumer debt, which typically consists of credit card debt,
medical debt, or life insurance policy loans. A substantial fraction of the individuals who
died with negative assets died before the Great Recession, and the house price decline
2008 and 2009 may have increased the number of older individuals with negative asset
positions.

        Table 2-3 shows that the members of the older cohort are much less likely than
those in the younger cohort to have negative asset balances in the LYO—1.8 percent vs
7.0 percent. A substantial proportion in both cohorts, 7.9 percent for HRS and 11.5
percent for AHEAD, also have zero balances. The table also reports mean assets for
those with negative, and with positive, net assets. For the 7 percent of the HRS sample
that appears to have negative net assets when last observed, the average net assets, -
$25,661, is substantially lower than the median (-$6,375). For the older AHEAD
sample, only 1.8 percent of sample shows negative net assets when last observed, and
the mean and median are much closer to zero.

       For individuals who report very low levels of non-annuity assets, their economic
well-being depends critically on their annuity income and their access to insurance that
can provide support in the event of medical or other emergencies. We provide some
information on the income profile for these individuals by cross-tabulating their annuity
income in the last year observed by their total non-annuity assets in the same year.
Both assets and income are in 2012 dollars.
       The results suggest that among individuals with zero or negative total assets in
the year last observed, 36.8 percent have less than $10,000 of annuity income and 85.1
percent have less than $20,000 of annuity income. By comparison, only 6.9 percent of
those with more than $500,000 in total assets have annuity income of less than
$10,000, and 25.6 percent have an annual annuity income of more than $40,000.

2.2 Asset Trajectories
       To provide more information on the evolution of assets between the year first
observed and the year last observed, we present figures with the median non-annuity
assets in each survey wave for respondents stratified by their last year observed. The
LYO for each profile is easily identified by the most recent year for which assets are
graphed. Thus the top profile in each panel shows median assets in 2012 and all prior
years for all persons whose LYO is 2012. Another profile shows assets in 2010 and all


                                                16
prior years for all persons whose LYO is 2010, and so forth. Our analysis is “backward-
looking” in the sense that we classify respondents by the last time we observe them,
and then examine their survey responses in earlier years.
       The top two panels in Figure 2-2 show the assets in each year by the LYO for
persons who were age 51 to 55 and age 56 to 61 in 1992. We draw attention to several
features of the data. First, for persons last observed before 2012 (these persons were
all deceased after the LYO) the median asset profiles indicate little change in median
assets between 1994 and the LYO. Second, for persons last observed before 2012,
there appears to be no relationship between assets and mortality, as indicated by the
absence of vertical gaps between the profiles. The median assets for those who died
earlier are comparable to the median assets for those who died later. While a “mortality
gradient,” with lower mortality rates for those with higher income and wealth, has been
widely documented, our focus on medians by LYO group may confound this
relationship. Moreover, a strong relationship between assets and mortality emerges if
the group still living in 2012 (the uppermost profile) is considered. Persons who die
after 2012 have much more wealth, both when first observed in 1994 and when last
observed in 2012, than persons who died prior to 2012. For the group still living in
2012, there is some evidence of asset decline over the sample period, but it is difficult to
disentangle age-related drawdown of assets from year-related changes in asset values
as contributory factors for this pattern. In both figures the decline in assets coincides
with the Great Recession of 2007-2008.
       The bottom two panels of Figure 2-2 show median asset profiles for two older
age groups from the AHEAD cohort. Relative to the groups from the HRS cohort, these
profiles show stronger evidence of asset decline approaching end of life, but again the
decline coincides with the Great Recession. There is also some evidence of a positive
asset-mortality relationship for both older groups. There is, however, one notable
exception to this pattern: for those aged 76 and older, the group still living in 2012 does
not appear to be wealthier than several of the groups that predeceased them.

                         Figure 2-3 is based on the same data as Figure 2-2, but it combines all persons
in the top two panels of Figure 2-2, and all persons in the bottom two panels of Figure 2-
2, and then distinguishes persons by level of education. The solid lines pertain to
persons with more than a high school education and the dashed lines are for those with
less than a high school education. There is a very substantial difference in the initial
non-annuity wealth of the two education groups. Among those 51-61 in 1992 with less
than a high school degree, those who are still living in 2012 clearly have more wealth
than those who died before 2012, but among those who died before 2012 there appears
to be little relationship between age of death and wealth in 1994. For this group, wealth
at death is approximately the same as wealth in 1994. For those with more than a high
school education, the pattern is similar: those who were alive in 2012 had substantially
more wealth in 1994 than those who died before 2012, but there is little relationship
between wealth in 1994 and the age of death.

                            Figures 2-2 and 2-3 do not distinguish married from single persons, even though
wealth profiles may differ by marital status and may be strongly affected by changes in
this status. Figure 2-4 shows separate asset profiles for persons that experienced
different family status transitions over the observation period. We distinguish persons
who were single when first observed in the HRS or AHEAD and single when last
observed (11), persons who were in a two-person household when first observed but
single when last observed (21), and persons who were in a two-person household
when first observed and in a two-person household when last observed (22). A fourth
group – persons single when first observed and in a two-person household when last
observed– was too small for meaningful analysis. The top two panels show data for
persons aged 51-61 in 1992; the left panel shows data for the 11 and the 22 groups
and the right panel shows data for persons in the 21 group. The 11 group has the
lowest level of assets and for this group there is little difference between assets in 1994
and assets when last observed. The 22 group has the highest level of assets and for
this group assets in the LYO tend to be larger than assets in 1994. The assets of the
21 group are the most dispersed in the LYO and in most but not all cases the level of
assets in the LYO tends to be similar to that when first observed.
                            Profiles for the persons who were over the age of 70 in 1993 are shown in the
bottom two panels of Figure 2-4. The left panel shows profiles for the 11 group, for
which assets tend to decline with age. The data show a pronounced relationship

                                                                                 19
between wealth and mortality, with those with more wealth in 1993 living longer. The
22 group also shows a substantial wealth-mortality relationship. The profiles show
that for persons who remain married until their death, median assets in the year last
observed are similar to median assets in 1993 for those with an LYO of 2006 or earlier.
For those with an LYO of 2008, 2010, or 2012, the profiles for the 22 group show a
substantial increase in wealth until about six years before the LYO and then a decline.
The median asset profiles for the 21 group exhibit a strong wealth-mortality
relationship, and for all LYO groups, assets when last observed are lower than assets in
1993.

3. Regression Estimates
                              To complement the tabular and graphical analysis of asset profiles, we estimate
regression models that describe the relationship between assets when first and last

                                                                                       20
observed. We do this using data on individuals in both the HRS and AHEAD samples.
To motivate our estimating equation, Figures 3-1a and 3-1b plot the relationship
between assets in the first and last year observed for persons between the ages of 51
and 61 in 1992.                       There are many outliers in the data; many are probably reporting
errors. In Figure 3-1a, asset balances are truncated at $4,000,000. In Figure 3-1b, the
truncation is at $200,000. The figures show that there are many negative asset
balances in both the FYO and in the LYO.

                      To minimize the effect of outliers, we estimate regression models in which the
dependent variable is the natural logarithm of net worth. The presence of zero and
negative asset balances poses an obvious problem for such a specification. We
experimented with various transformations of the data that would enable us to use the
negative values but ultimately settled on carrying out our estimation using only the
observations with positive values of assets in both the FYO and the LYO. These are
the observations in the upper right quadrants of both figures. For the sample aged 51
to 61 in 1992, this restriction limits us to 77 percent of the individuals who have data on
assets holdings in both the first and last year observed. For the older AHEAD sample, it
limits us to 81 percent of the sample. It is difficult to assess the effect of these
exclusions on our results. One simple test is to estimate models based on asset levels
and to compare results for the full sample to results from the sub-sample that conditions
on positive values of assets in both the FYO and the LYO.
                      Table 3-1 shows the results of estimating a bivariate regression specification
relating assets in the last year observed to assets in the first year observed, using a

In Table 3-1 and in all subsequent tables we first estimate the regression model for the
full sample, and we order the residuals. Then, we delete the observations
corresponding to the top and bottom three percent of the residuals, and we re-estimate
the equation. The resulting estimates are presented in the table.

The estimate of the coefficient on assets when first observed (β) changes very little
when the negative and zero asset values are excluded. The intercept term for the level
of assets, not surprisingly, is affected by this sample limitation. This finding gives us
some confidence that a model specified in logs may not be appreciably affected by the
exclusion of observations with zero or negative asset balances.
       To estimate the effect of personal attributes, in particular health, family status
and education, on assets when last observed, conditional on assets when first
observed, we postulate a simple log-log model linking assets in the LYO and the FYO,
and allow for log-linear relationships between assets in the LYO and the other
covariates. The log-log specification for assets in the FYO implies that a one percent
change in assets in the FYO will lead to a constant percentage change in assets in the
LYO. The log-linear specification implies that a unit change in each of the covariates
leads to a constant percentage change in assets in the LYO. The specification is:

We describe the covariates included in this equation in more detail when we discuss the
estimates below. Note that this regression framework is focused on the conditional
mean of the natural log of assets when last observed, in contrast with the figures in the
last section, which emphasized conditional medians.
       Estimates of this equation are shown in Table 3-2 for persons aged 51 to 61 in
1992 and persons aged 70+ in 1993. For each age group, we present three
specifications. The first includes only the log of assets in the FYO, the second also
includes other covariates, and the third includes the other covariates and year effects.
The year effects are included to absorb changes in wealth that may result from
economy-wide shocks, such as the financial crisis and associated drop in house and
stock prices in 2008.
       The estimates are based only on individuals who are known to be deceased by
the end of the sample. Those who are still alive when last observed in the 2012 wave of
the HRS, and those who left the sample but are not known to be deceased, are
excluded.   In the specification with no covariates, the estimates of  indicate the log of
assets in the LYO if a person had one dollar of assets in the FYO. The estimates of β
indicate the fraction of the log of assets in the FYO that are carried over to the LYO. In
the specifications without covariates, the coefficient on assets in the FYO (β) is lower for
the 70+ group than for the 51-61 group, a finding that is consistent with the patterns
observed in Figures 2-1 to 2-3.

Notes: Sample excludes all persons who were alive when last observed. The variable "age in LYO" is the number of years over the age of 53 in the LYO for
the age 51 to 61 group and the number of years over the age of 70 for the age 70 or older group.


           In the specifications with covariates, the variable Years since FYO is the number
of years elapsed between the FYO and the LYO. The variable Age in FYO is the
number of years over the age of 53 in the FYO for the 51 to 61 age group and the
number of years over the age of 70 for the age 70 or older group. The next seven
variables are intended to capture the effect of health on the change in assets between
the FYO and the LYO. The first variable, Health in FYO is the value of a percentile
health index in the FYO. This index, described in Poterba, Venti, and Wise (2013), is
constructed from 27 health-related questions in the HRS and is scaled to range from 1
(lowest) to 100 (highest). The next six variables are indicator variables for the onset of
particular health conditions between the FYO and the LYO. For married persons, these
variables are set to one if the health condition is reported for either partner. There are


                                                                          25
three indicator variables for level of education (less than a high school degree is the
excluded category) and two indicator variables for family status pathway (the 21
category is excluded).
       The estimates of the coefficients on the health-related variables suggest
important links between health shocks and the late-life evolution of assets. For both
age groups, the overall level of health in the FYO has a statistically significant effect on
assets when last observed. For the younger group, the coefficient of 0.003 implies that
an improvement in health that moves an individual up by ten percentiles in the FYO is
associated with an increase of approximately three percent in assets in the LYO. For
the younger group, a stroke, the onset of lung disease and the onset of psychological
problems are all associated with substantial reductions (approximately 25 percent) in
assets in the LYO. For the older group, the onset of psychological problems and of
diabetes are both associated with declines in assets in the last year observed. The
relationship between education and assets in the LYO is strong, even conditional on
assets in the FYO. The education estimates for the younger and older groups are
similar, with the effect of having received a college degree larger than the effect of
having attended some college, which in turn is larger than the estimated effect of a high
school degree. On average, persons in the 22 family status pathway group have
assets in LYO that are 30 to 40 percent higher than those of persons in other pathways.
       The final set of estimates for each age group adds year effects for the last year
observed (1996 is the excluded year). The variable “years since FYO” is deleted from
this specification to allow estimation of the full set of age effects. The estimates of the
coefficients on the covariates are essentially unchanged when the year effects are
added. This suggests that the covariate estimates are not picking up macro shocks
associated with the financial crisis. For the younger group, for most years we cannot
reject the null hypothesis that the coefficient on the year effect is zero. For the older
group, the estimates for 2004 through 2010 are all negative and we can reject the null
hypothesis of zero coefficients. The magnitudes are large: older persons last observed
in these years held between 20 to 50 percent less assets than individuals with similar
characteristics who were last observed in 1996.



                                             26
          Table 3-3 shows separate estimates of the regression model by family status
pathway for persons 51 to 61 in 1992 and Table 3-4 shows estimates by family status
pathway for persons 70 and older in 1993. Both tables show results with and without
covariates, excluding year effects. The sample size for the 21 pathway group for the
HRS (51 to 61) group is quite small and many of the estimates are not significantly
different from zero. For the 22 group the indicator variables for the onset of lung
disease, psychological problems, and stroke have the greatest negative effect on assets
in LYO given assets in FYO. For the 11 group the most consequential conditions for
assets in the LYO are psychological problems, heart problems, and stroke. The general
health index level when first observed is associated with higher LYO assets in both the
11 and the 21 groups, but not for the 22 group. This may be because married
couples are more financially resilient in the face of health challenges, because one
spouse can take actions, such as providing care at older ages or increasing labor
supply at younger ages, to offset the adverse financial effects of a health shock. For the
22 and the 11 groups the education estimates are large; for the 22 group they are
also precisely measured.

Notes: Sample excludes all persons who were alive when last observed. The variable "age in LYO" is the number of years over the age of
70 in the LYO.

          Table 3-4 shows estimates by family status pathway for the age 70 and older
group. The sample sizes are much larger than the sample sizes for the 51 to 61 group.
The general level of health is statistically significant in only one of the three family status
pathways, although the magnitude of the estimated effect is quite large: a 10 percent
increase in the index is associated with a 6 percent increase in assets in the LYO.
Among the health variables, the indicator variable for psychological problems has a
strong negative effect in two of the three pathways, and a stroke has a negative effect
for persons who are single throughout our sample. Surprisingly, the onset of heart
problems is estimated to have a positive effect on assets in the last year observed for
two of the three pathways.
          Education is very strongly related to assets in the LYO for both the 11 and the
21 groups. For example for the 11 group, an individual with a college degree is
estimated to have a 67 percent increase in assets in the LYO relative to an individual
with less than a high school degree. For the 12 group the comparable increase in 59
percent. For the 22 group the education effects are much smaller. Somewhat
paradoxically, the coefficient on the indicator variable for having attained at least a

                                                                  28
college degree, 0.190, is smaller than the coefficient for some college, 0.252, although
the hypothesis of equal effects could not be rejected at standard significance levels.
       An indicator variable for psychological problems (emotional, nervous or
psychiatric problems) has the most robust negative effect on assets in the LYO, looking
across all persons age 51 to 61 in 1992 and 70+ in 1993 and across the three family
status pathways. In addition, health in the first year observed is associated with greater
assets in the LYO for all groups except the 22 group.
       We illustrate the relative magnitudes of the effects reported in Table 3-2 by
simulating asset balances for various covariate combinations using the specification
without year effects. Table 3-5 presents simulated asset balances based on the
estimates for ages 51 to 61 in 1992 and Table 3-6 present simulations for those over 70
in 1993. The first two rows of each table show the simulated assets in the LYO for a
baseline person who has $100,000 of assets in the FYO, for each of the four levels of
education, and the weighted average across all education groups. The first row reports
assets in the LYO when all covariates except assets in the FYO and education are set
to their sample means. The first entry in the first row of Table 3-5 shows that assets fall
by about $16,000 (from $100,000 to $84,139) for persons without a high school degree.
The remaining entries in this row show terminal assets for persons with other levels of
education. The differences by level of education are substantial, especially since we
condition assets in the FYO both in the estimation and in the simulation. The last entry
in the row shows that average assets remain almost constant between the FYO and
LYO. The second row shows the results of the same simulation, except that all of the
health condition variables are set to zero rather than to their means. The last entry in
this row shows that, on average, persons who do not experience any health events
increase asset balances between the FYO and the LYO.
       The remaining rows of Table 3-5 show the simulated level of assets in the LYO
when selected attributes are set at specified values and the other covariates are set to
their means. For example, averaging over all education groups (the last column), an
increase in health in the FYO from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile is associated
with an increase in assets in the LYO from $96,001 to $108,966. Overall, the
relationship between health in the FYO and assets in the LYO is modest, although

                                            29
statistically significant. However, both changes in family status and changes in health
conditions have substantial effects on assets in the LYO. For example, using the
coefficients in the “all” column, persons who are continuously married are predicted to
have approximately $29,000 more in assets in the LYO, $83,821 versus $112,920, than
persons who went from a two-person household to a one-person household. The two
most important health conditions, stroke and psychological problems, are each
associated, on average, with a $25,000 to $30,000 reduction in assets.
       Table 3-6 presents comparable results for persons age 70 and older in 1993.
The last entry of the first row of simulations suggests that, on average, the assets of this
group declined modestly between the FYO and the LYO. The second row shows that
assets would have been only marginally higher if the baseline person had experienced
no health conditions. A comparison with the previous table suggests that the effect of
health conditions is much greater for the younger than for the older cohort. This may be
because an adverse health shock at a younger age reduces earnings and potential
pension and Social Security accruals, in addition to creating expenditure needs. The
effects of most of the other covariates are of similar orders of magnitude for the two age
cohorts.

4. Summary
       We have considered the determinants of assets as individuals approach the end
of life, comparing asset balances when individuals in the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) were last observed prior to death with comparable data measures in the first year
the individual was included in the survey. We have data through 2012 for members of
two HRS cohorts--respondents aged 51 to 61 who were first observed in 1992, and
respondents aged 70 and above who were first observed in 1993. Thus we are able to
study the evolution of assets for as many as 19 years.
       We first document levels of total assets, housing assets, and financial assets
near the end of life for each of the HRS cohorts. Asset balances are quite persistent in
the later stages of life. For the younger cohort, 70 percent of those with less than
$50,000 in total assets when last surveyed before death also had fewer than $50,000 in
assets when first surveyed. For the older cohort, 52 percent of those with less than
$50,000 in assets when last surveyed before death also had fewer than $50,000 in
assets when first surveyed. Low levels of both housing and financial assets are also
persistent. Those who had substantial assets at the end of life also had substantial

                                            31
asset balances when first observed. The persistence of wealth is confirmed in a series
of figures showing median total assets in each survey wave between the wave first
observed and the last wave observed before death. For the younger cohort the path of
assets is essentially flat. For older cohorts there is some evidence of a modest decline.
These findings suggest that the low level of retirement wealth of many households at
the time of retirement, documented in many studies including Poterba (2014) and the
U.S. Government Accountability Office (2015), is a key contributor to low levels of
wealth for individuals near the end of life.
       We relate the change in assets between the first and last year observed to
individual attributes and to changes in these attributes. We obtain estimates for each
subgroup, those in the HRS who were 51-61 in 1992 and those in the AHEAD who were
70 or older in 1993, and for persons in each family status pathway. This includes those
who were in two person households in both the FYO and the LYO, those who were in
one-person households in both the FYO and the LYO years, and those who were in a
one-person household in the LYO but a two-person household in the FYO.
       We pay particular attention to how the onset of chronic conditions, an individual’s
level of education, and changes in family composition, such as death of a spouse, are
associated with changes in assets. Simulation results based on our regression
estimates suggest that on average, assets remain roughly constant between the FYO
and the LYO for the younger cohort and decline modestly for the older cohort. For
those who do not experience a health event or family disruption, the asset profile slopes
upward for the younger cohort and slightly downward for the older cohort. However, for
individuals who experience adverse health events, such as a stroke or the onset of
psychological problems, the decline in assets can be quite large. Similarly, individuals
who experience a change in household composition, to one-person from two-person, on
average also experience substantial declines in wealth.
       Taken as a whole, these results suggest that the level of assets of individuals
approaching the end of life is determined primarily by the assets these individuals held
many years earlier. Most of those with limited assets at death also had limited assets
earlier in life. They did not run out of assets in retirement; they never had many assets
to begin with. However, there are also some individuals who entered retirement with

                                               32
modest or even large asset balances and experienced health shocks or family
disruption that resulted in significant declines in assets. For the cohort age 51 to 61 in
1992, we find little evidence of asset decline among persons who did not experience
health shocks or family disruption. For these individuals, there is no evidence that asset
balances are being depleted by normal consumption expenditure in retirement. For
older persons, it is also the case that assets at death are determined primarily by asset
balances earlier in retirement. However, for those in our sample who were over the age
of 70 in 1993, and who were therefore mostly over 90 by 2012, there is some evidence
that assets decline modestly prior to death, even in the absence of health or family
shocks. The onset of health conditions can have large negative consequences for
asset balances of the older cohort as well, but on the whole the effects of health
conditions are smaller than for the younger cohort.
       A natural extension of this project would ask what individuals might have done
earlier in life to avoid reaching late life with few resources. We will pursue this issue in
future analysis. For those who are observed with lower assets in the LYO than in the
FYO, purchasing an annuity earlier in life might have improved well-being in later years.
To assess this possibility we plan to calculate the potential annuity income that each
individual could have obtained by purchasing an annuity in the first year observed. We
also plan to estimate the number of individuals who saved very little while working.
       One explanation of low saving, which is difficult to evaluate, is that some
households do not earn enough to both meet their spending requirements, and save,
while working. Analyzing the dispersion of accumulated financial assets for those who
are in the bottom quartile or half of the lifetime earning distribution could shed light on
this hypothesis. Previous research, including Venti and Wise (1998, 1999), Hendricks
(2007), Yang (2009) and Bozio, Emmerson and Tetlow (2011), has shown that at each
level of (lifetime) earnings, there are both high and low savers. This suggests that “low
earnings” can only provide a partial explanation for low assets in late-life, but this
possibility warrants further investigation.
