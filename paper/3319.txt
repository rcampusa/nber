RE-INTERPRETING THE FAIUJRE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET EFFICIENCY TESTS:
              SMALL TRANSACTION       , BIG HYSTERESIS BANDS


                                                ABSTRACT

Small transaction costs and uncertainty imply that optimal cross—currency interest rate
speculation is marked by a first—order hysteresis band. Consequently uncovered interest
parity does not hold and market efficiency tests based on it are miaspecified. Indeed
measured prediction errors are a combination of true prediction errors and a wedge that
consists of the "option value" of being in foreign currency and either plus or minus the
transaction cost. Due to the nature of this wedge, we should expect measured prediction
errors to be serially correlated, correlated with the current forward rate and perhaps have a
non—zero mean, if the interest differential itself is serially correlated. The existence of the
wedge helps account both for the failure of market efficiency tests and the difficulties in
 finding   an empirically successful model of   the   risk premium.

        If the foreign exchange market i. efficient, traders risk neutral and transactions costs

negligible, the difference between the forward rate and the realised future spot rate should be

white noise. Empirical research has resoundingly rejected this joint hypothesis. Hansen and

Hodrick (1980), Meese and Singleton (1980), Levich (1980), Frenkel (1981), Cumby and Obstfeld

(1981), Hsieh (1984) and Frankel and Froot (1987), inter aim, find that prediction errors
sometimes have a non—sero mean, are serially correlated and correlated with lagged variables

including the forward rate itself. Meese and Rogoff (1983) find that the current spot and forward

rate are equally good predictors of the future spot. Hodrick (1987) and Levich (1985) provide

excellent analytic surveys of this vast literature.

         Hodrick (1987) states that there are three interpretations of this evidence.   The first

claims that the data are not ergodic (due to regime changes) and attributes the failure. to severe

small sample bias.     The second views the failure. as evidence of foreign exchange market

inefficiency (e.g., Bilson 1981, Krugman 1989). The third views the failure. as evidence of a risk

premium in the foreign exchange market. Roll and Solnik (1977), Meese and Singleton (1980),

Frankel (1982, 1986), Hansen and Hodrick (1983), Faint (1984), Hodrick and Srivutava (1984),

Rogoff (1984), Domowits and Hakkio (1985), Giovannini and Jorion (1987), Caznpell and Clarida

(1987) and Lewis (1988) consider various models of the risk premium, however, a theoretical

model of the risk premium that performs well empirically has proved elusive.

        Thu paper contributes a fourth (not mutually exclusive) interpretation to this list. We

argue that very small transaction costs can help account for the failure of these market efficiency

tests, and may help explain why an empirical model of the risk premium has proved elusive.

Foreign exchange market efficiency tests assume that uncovered arbitrage equalizes expected rates

of return on all currencies. With this assumption1 unobservable expectations can be deduced from

observed interest differentials and spot rate.. An entirely unrelated line of research shows that

sunk entry and/or exit costs create a range of inactivity in firms' dynamic entry—exit strategic.,

and that this band permits hysteresis.' Dixit (1989c) provides an analytic approximation which

shows that even third—order small sunk costs produces a first—order hysteresis band.            Since

transaction costs are sunk co.ti, cross—currency interest rate arbitrage should be marked by a

first—order hysteresis band even if trading costs are only third—order small. In other word., even

third—order small transaction coats may prevent arbitrage from equalizing expected rates of

return and so invalidate uncovered interest parity. The importance of this observation is that the

prediction errors used in market efficiency tests are actually a combination of true prediction

errors and a first—order wedge that consists of the "option value" of being in foreign currency and

either plus or minus the transaction cost. As it turns out the wedge is positive for low interest rate

differentials and negative for high differential..

        This suggest an alternative interpretation of market efficiency tests. Namely, the failure

of measured prediction errors to be white noise may be due to the wedge. Even if the true

prediction errors were white noise, if the interest differential itself is serially correlated, the

measured prediction errors will be serially correlated, correlated with the forward rate and other

lagged variables, and may have a non—sero mean due to the nature of the wedge. We also show

that white noise tests should fail more strongly during prolonged appreciation, and depreciations

of the exchange rate. Furthermore, since empirical models of the risk premium use measured

prediction errors as data, their lack of success may be due in part to the presence of the wedge.



                                                      2
More constructively, any attempt to identify a risk premium must first separate out the wedge.

        It has Long been known that transaction costs lead to a band within which deviations

from covered interest rate parity may persist because they cannot be profitably exploited. The

literature on transaction cost has tended to focus on these deviations as a direct measure of the

cost of exchange rate uncertainty.        Levich (1979), Frenkel and Levich (1975, 1977) and

McCormick (1979) find these costs vary considerably across currencies and have increased under

floating rates. Fieleke (1975) find, that they are positively related to uncertainty.

        Aiyaga.ri and Gertler (1989) and Constantinides (1986) consider the impact of differential

transaction costs on capital market equilibrium in a closed economy.            These models require

numerical solutions and focus on the liquidity premium when trading stocks involves a transaction

cost while trading bonds does not. Constantinide. (1986) finds that transaction costs have only a

second—order effect on equity prices. Aiyagari and Gertler (1989) include uninsurable income risk

which forces a trading volume large enough to make transaction costs a significant determinant of

equity prices. We focus instead on the hysteresis band and its impLications for foreign exchange

market efficiency tests.    Note that unlike market efficiency tests in international economics,

differences between expected rates of return in domestic markets axe not interpreted as tests of

market efficiency.



 II. AnIlZvtraLive Example
         That tiny transaction costs may account for the failure of market efficiency tests is

 implausible at first glance. To address such prices, this section studies an illustrative example.

 The example employs the regulated Brownian motion approach. Althou&i this approach is not

 appropriate for the principle purpose of this paper, its renown and analytic convenience makes it

 well—suited to addressing priors.     In particular we wish to demonstrate that even minuscule

 transaction costs together with uncertainty significantly alter the basis of market efficiency tests.



                                                       3
        Consider a risk neutral trader choosing between holding his wealth in dollar denominated

certificates of deposits (CD.) and pound denominated CD..         The return on dollar CD., 1,     is

constant. The trader'. expectation of the dollar rate of return on sterling, V, obey.:

(2.1)        dR/V =        pdt   + ads,
where ds is the increment of a Wiener process. A small transaction co.t, c, is incurred in moving

between dollar CD. and sterling CD..          The problem is to find the arbitrage strategy that
maxirnises discounted expected cash flow measured in dollars.

        This problem can be reduced to one previously solved. Consider an equivalent problem:

the trader receive, a flow of i whether he is in dollars or pound.; when in pounds he receive. I plus

V—i. Consider a third problem: He receives zero when in dollar, and R—i when in pounds. The

objective functions of the second and third problems different only by a constant, so they have

identical optimal strategies. The third problem is isomorphic to Dixit (1989a). Assign i to Dixits

w, V to hi. P, and 'c   to hi. k and 1. Dixit (1989a) is well known, so the solution I. relegated to

the appendix.

        Analytic solutions for the hysteresi, band are impossible with Brownian motion

uncertainty due to non—integer powers in the value function. Numerical solutions are readily

had. Dint (1989a,b), Bertola (1989), Constantinides (1986), Brennan and Schwarts (1985) and

Beutolila and Bertola (1988) find the band I. remarkably wide for reasonable parameter. in

applications ranging from hysteresi, in trade to natural resource management. Dixit (1989c)

provides an analytic approximation to the band which help us understand why these bands are

so wide. Dint's result... imply that for small ?ç

switches to dollars. The key feature of this relationship is the 1/3 power. Even if the value

expression inside the brackets is only 0.000001 the band width will be two percentage points.

        Suppose a is 0.02 (i.e., there is a 95 percent chance that annual changes in the differential

are less than plus or minus 4 percent), I is 5 percent and the transaction coat is 10 basis points.

(Frenkel and Levich 1977 estimate these to be 50 basis points in the early 1970s. McCormick 1979

estimate them to be 9 to 18 basis points in 1976. Currently bid—ssk spreads on spot transactions

are about 5 to 10 basis points.) The re.ultina band width is 5.7 percenta&e points. Suppose the

transaction costs are only one basis point, and 0is 0.02. The resulting band is still 2.7 percentage

points wide. Finally, supposing 0     is   only 0.01 and i   is   only one basis point the band is still 1.3

percentage points wide.     The thrust of all this i. clear —            uncertainty and even minuscule

 transaction costs require a significant modification of optimal uncovered interest arbitrage, if

 indeed the dollar return on sterling is close to Brownian motion. Dixit (1989c) shows that the

 band is centered on i for small r.

 £1.1 Bead Width sad the Meowed Forward Rate ProJictioa Error

         If isis zero, the trader sells pounds whenever Re is less than i and buys pounds when ever

     is greater than I. In a more complete model with many such agents, the price of pounds would

 adjust to maintain parity between expected rates of return at all instants when ,=0. If covered

 interest parity also holds, the difference between the forward and future spot exactly equals the

 unobservable expectation errors. If the market is efficient these errors should be white noise.

 However, if c is not zero no arbitrage occurs when R fails in the hysteresis band. Consequently,

 uncovered interest parity need not hold, so the forward—future spot gap does not equal pure

 expectations errors. Consequently measured prediction errors need not
                                                                       be white noise. A key

  question is how is the band width related to the difference between measured and true

  errors. Clearly, R can differ from i by plus or minus
                                                                  (O'_(°)/2 without inducing arbitrage.

plus a wedge which is bounded by plus or minus (a'—Q°)/2. That ii even with risk neutrality and

efficient information processing, the expected difference between the forward and future spot

         An informal check on the plausibility of the assertion that transaction coats are important

is to examine real world trading strategies. The data necessary to do this formally are not easily

bad, however, the optimal trading strategy implied by the hysteresis band could be implemented

with commonly used technical or chartists methods. One such strategy draws a line across the top

of recent quotes and a line across the bottom of recent quotes. The trader buys sterling when R

passes through the top line; he sells when it passes through the bottom line. The chart ii redraw

after major market movements. In our example the trader should draw lines a chart of R5—i, not

the spot rate chart as foreign exchange traders are wont to do. However if the spot ii serially

correlated and the interest differential relatively constant, the two are equivalent. Note that the

band width is related to some measure of spot rate volatility. By contrast, arbitrage strategie.

which would be neccessary to enforce uncovered interest parity condition would not lead to an

inactivity range in traders' charts.

        The    virtues   of the regulated     Brownian      motion   approach   are   abundant   and

well—appreciated. However, it is of limited use in analysing the behavior of rational agents when

the forcing variable is an endogenously determined price since such prices tend to revert to a

steady—state value or trend.     In the present situation it is plain that ft cannot literally be a

random walk with drift. Almost any sensible macro model would imply that it ii mean—reverting,

or at least trend—reverting. Furthermore, the market data and efficiencies tests are explicitly

stated in a discrete time framework. Of course, if Brownian motion closely approximates the




                                                     6
mean reverting process, the regulated Brownian motion solution may closely approximate the true

solution. Krugman (1988), Miller and Weller (1988) and Svenuon (1989) discuss how to stretch

the regulated Brownian motion framework to address such problems.

        Lucas and Prescott (1974), Caplin and Krishna (1986). Rafael (1989), Baldwin and Lyons

(1989) and Baldwin (1989) take a different approach.              Applying discrete time dynamic

programming techniques, these papers show that the sunk cost hysteresis band exists when the

forcing variable follows almost any process. Baldwin (1989) develops techniques that allow the

characterization of the hysteresis band for a general Markov process. In Baldwin and Lyons

(1989) the number firms is determined by free entry.           We shall see that the analytics for
determining the spot rate are quite similar to those determining the number of fiims in Baldwin

and Lyons (1989). The next section applies this analysis to exchange rate dynamics.



IlL Basic Model
        Consider a world with two investments possibilities, one period dollar CD. and one period

sterling CD., populated by atomistic, risk neutral foreign exchange traders who face a email

transaction cost, , of moving between dollars and sterling. The dollar return on dollar CD. is
constant.   The pound return on sterling CD. is stochastic. The log of the spot rate, s,             is

endogenously determined by the traders' behavior. The timing is as follows: all traders observe i

at the beginning of every period and then trade simultaneously.             We assume the interest

differential follows the simple Mazkov process:

(3.1)       i—.4 =   p(i1.4)     +       where O p < i, E{e1)= 0, E{e1,(.}=O, all j,      1



P[.J is E's density function, G(. ,i1J is it's conditional density and the real line is their support.

grouped together in the vector x for notational convenience. The control variable ii U1 (U= 1 if

(3.2)                   At+i =            it+i_ = p(i—i)    +             t=   S[is1I.
              The typical trader chooses a trading strategy, p=14xt,AtJ, to maximize hi. discounted

cash flow:

(3.3)               V[x01 =   E{E6tg[x,Aj4x]j,          where:


              g[x,Aj4x)]

                                   I   iAt?c
Here we have made use of the standard log approximation of the dollar rate of return on sterling,

and t5   is   (1+r)1 where r is the constant discount rate (r i). Expectations are over all E.
              Our two primary taik.. are to characterize the optimal arbitrage strategy and the law of

motion for the spot rate, S[• ,.J. To this end we employ discrete time dynamic programming

techniques.          That is, we suppose the existence of a value function, V V[x,A], use it to
characterize the optimal strategy acd then use the optimal strategy to characterize the value

fun,tion.           Given   the value function, we characterize the optimal trading strategy by

characterizing the          much simpler problem of choosing U to maximize g[x,A.UJ plus
                  x,Ut}, where E{V+i I xt,U} is the expectation of V1 conditioned on x, Ut.

Plainly, a trader's current decision can be summarised by two numbers,           a and a.     If he was

holding pounds and i turns out to be below Ck,       he   goes out of pounds; otherwise he stays put. If

he was holding dollars and i turns out to be above a, he goes into pounds; otherwise he stays

put. a and        are the it's at which he is indifferent between the alternatives (for clarity the

elements of x are written out), that is:

                        = i + öE{V1 I ,1_i,0}.
(3.4) and (3.5) are the value—matching conditions. Note that the traders' indifference implies

homogeneous traders there would be sero activity in the foreign exchange market for

realisations of it between      and a. This is the sunk cost hysteresis band. Consequently for

would be no pound buyers, only pound sellers. To eliminate excess supply the price of pounds, s

must fall to the point where pound sellers are indifferent between dollar, and pounds:

Since   all traders   are   aware of this, the posted spot would jump down immediately to this level

upon announcement on it. Likewise, if it turned out greater than a, there will be only pound

and width.

+i+E{5t+2Ixt}1t+i+sE{t+2Ixt,1} These relationships are plotted in Figure 3.3.

           A concept that plays an important port in the analysis is the difference between the

conditional expectation of             when U equals zero and one. We refer to this as the option

value of being in sterling as opposed to dollars (or the incumbency premium for short).                            The

function that relates          to x,                     is defined as:

           The properties of 'P are also simple to establish. First ' is increasing in                     To see this

note that the realized difference between being in pounds and dollars depends on what                         i1 turns
out to be. By inspection of Figure 3.3, this difference in non—decreasing in                              Since the i'

process displays positive persistence, a higher i shifts the conditional distribution of it11 to the

right, giving more weight to higher values of the difference. Obviously, then the conditional

expectation of the difference is increasing in i. By similar reasoning,                            is bounded between

— and c.

3.5.1 Peraisieace ai4 Band Width

           Consider two polar cases of the it procese: perfect persistence and no persistence. When

it is iid there is no persistence in it. In this case both the expected future spot and                              are




                                                                    12
independent of i, so the band width is 21c regardless of how volatile the lid process is. Basically

when i is lid the current realization of it tells the traders nothing about future returns to holding

pounds, so a dollar holder will require the full ic to be covered by this period's interest differential

before moving.    Likewise, a pound holder would suffer a negative differential up to 'c before

moving. Thus greater uncertainty does not always widen the band. The other extreme is of

perfect persistence. That is, any change in it is expected to persist forever (i.e., all future es are

zero, and p = 1). In this case the current i is a perfect signal about future i's. In this case the

band is much narrower, namely, r2s'c.      Comparing the two polar cases we see that the band is

wider with some uncertainty than with zero uncertainty, but increasing the amount of uncertainty

does not always widen the band. A heuristic way of thinking about this is to examine the effect of

more uncertainty on the signal quality of the current   i.

         The Link between transaction costs and the band width measured in terms of annualized

rates of return depends crucially on the period length since the band end points in (3.11) are in

 terms of interest rates quoted on the basis of the period length. To illustrate this point assume

 that i is lid and ?C is small. In this came the band is exactly 2ic wide and approximately centered

 on i. Take #c equal to 0.0005 and i equal to a 5 percent annual rate and contrast the case of
 trading only once a year with the case of daily trading. In the first case arbitrage forces the

 expected dollar return on pounds to be between 0.0495 and 0.0505, so uncovered interest parity

 comes pretty close to holding. Consequently the miupecification of the market efficiency test is

 minimal. However with daily trading, arbitrage keeps the daily dollar return on pounds between

 0.000637 and —0.000363 (5 percent on a daily basis ii 0.000137). On an annualized basis the

 upper end point of the band ii 25.44 percent mind the lower end point ii —12.12 percent.
 Consequently the measured prediction error may be an extremely poor estimate of the true

 prediction errors.

ln(a'I—ln[a°J    N2'c. This dovetails with Dixit's result that in continuous time the derivative of

the band width with respect to        is infinite at ic = 0. In the modern foreign exchange market a

trade only takes a few seconds, so even a tiny band would translate to an enormous annualised

interest rate differential, if it were indeed iid.

3.5.3 Mstmlg of CD. sad the term strctrc of LAs lqsleresis Asi4
        The hysteresis band described above applies to CD. of a one period maturity. In this

subsection we show that it can be applied to CDs of longer maturities with little modification. If

the English capital market i. efficient (maintaining the assumption of risk neutral investors)

sterling CDs of various maturities will be priced such that investors are indifferent to holding the

various CDs during the next period. Thus whether regardless of a CD'. maturity, the optimal

cross—currency arbitrage can be deduced from the                       band described above. Of course, in

deciding when to trade long CD., it is not sufficient to look at the interest rates; expected price

changes of the long CD. must also be included.

         It is simple to restate the band in terms of the interest rates on sterling of any maturity.

For instance suppose the period length is one day and traders have the choice between one day

and two day sterling. We know that incipient cross—currency arbitrage will be triggered when the

daily sterling rate of return is greater that        or less than    d.2 If the English capital market is
efficient, the expected return on holding a two day CD for one day equals the return on a one

day CDs. That is, E{(1+i)/(1+it+i)} equals (1+it), where ibis the two day sterling rate.
Thus the high side of the band stated in terms of 2 day interest rates is defined implicitly by:



                                                           14
                                   l+wi
                 (1+a) = E{        1+i          =

where      denotes the critical value in terms of 2 day interest rates. To get a handle on this

expression, we take a log approximation:

                                   (w—2i) = (a—i)(1+p)—7,
where   7 is the correction from Jensen's inequality and i is on a daily basis.
         Two cues highlight the implications of this formula. On one hand, suppose pu near one

and 7 is negligible. In this case the high end of the band for two day sterling rates is twice as far

from the 2 day dollar rate as      is from the one day dollar rate. In other words the band in terms

of two day rates is roughly twice the width of the band in terms of one day rates. On the other

hand, if p is sero (via, the interest differential is Ud) and   is negligible, the band width is roughly

invariant to maturities. Thus the band should be insignificant for long term interest rates. In this

case, we also have a strong testabLe implication. White noise tests on measured prediction errors

should fail much more strongly on .hort term interest rates than on long term interest rates.

 5.5.4 Ba,4 Wiitk and Unexpisited Profit Opportnailiea
          We just showed that the band in terms of long sterling rates can be more that 2ic wide, if

 the interest differential is close to a random walk. At first glance this seems impossible. That is,

 it would seem that if the expected dollar rate of return between dollar CD. and say one year

 sterling CD. differed by more than twice the transaction costs there would be unexploited profit

 opportunities. Dixit's seminal work on costly entry and exit under uncertainty explains why this

 is possible. The easiest way to explain this is to first lay out the incorrect argument that the rates

 of return cannot get more than 2c out of line, and then directly show what this argument is

 leaving out. To be concrete, suppose the expected future spot equals the current spot and the one

 year sterling rate ii 2i'c plus epsilon (epsilon is an arbitrarily small positive number) above the

 dollar rate.




                                                         15
        Here is the (incorrect) argument that this cannot   be   a equilibrium situation: An investor

could borrow at the dollar rate and invest in a one year sterling and thereby expect to earn

enough to more than cover the cost of the round trip in and out of sterling. Since a very large

number of dollar holders would want to do this the spot rate is not an equilibrium. Now we argue

that it would not be optimal for any investors to undertake the arbitrage just described.3 To be

concrete, suppose the expected dollar rate of return differential (including both the interest and

exchange rate change components) is close to a random walk; each period there is about 50

percent chance that the differential ii x percent higher than last period and about 50 percent

chance that it is x percent lower. If an investor borrows dollars and invests in one year sterling

when the differential is 2ic plus epsilon, his expected profit would be epsilon per dollar. Suppose

instead he waited till next period. If the expected rate of return rises and then he buys into one

year sterling, his expected profit would be x plus epsilon per dollar. If he waits and the expected

return falls, he need not move into sterling so his expected profit is worth no less than sero.

Clearly, if the discount factor is not too large then the expected value of waiting till next period

exceeds the expected value of investing in sterling today. Consequently, no investor would move

to take advantage of the 2i'c plus epsilon differential. They would require more than 2?c plus

epsilon in order to find the invest—now alternative more attractive than the wait-and—.ee

alternative.

        The basic fault with the incorrect argument is that it looks at the problem as if the

investor's choice is between dollars today and sterling today. In fact the true problem is whether

to move into pounds today, or wait and see whether to move tomorrow. As Dixit (1989) describes

it, a dolla.r holder owns a dollar and a call option to buy into the randomly fluctuating rate of

return differential. Due to transaction costs and uncertainty, the value of this call option is not

zero. When he moves into pounds he gives up the option on pounds and get. a call option on

dollar,. Consequently, he will not move until the expected return to being in pound. exceeds the




                                                    16
expected return to being in dollars by at least 2ic plus the difference in the values of the options.

As the maturity of the sterling CD, increases, the volatility of the daily rate of return on holding

them increases (as loig as i is not lid), so the value of the call option on them increases.
Consequently, the investor will require a greater interest rate differential in order to find it

optimal to exercise the call option.

3.5.5 Upper .*i Lower Boar4s o ike Bead Width

            To get a rough idea of the band width for one period CDs, we establish lower a.nd upper

bounds. Certainly the band is wider than r2lc, since there is leu than perfect persistence. Taking

  = 0.000 1 and r = I = 0.05 on an annual basis and consider daily trading. We have that
equals 0.000005 on a daily basis. Annualized, this ii 18.7 basis points. Thus a lower bound on the

band width is approximately 3.7 tenth of one percentage point. For the upper bound we take the

lid case, where half the band ii equal to       IC.   Employing   daily trade, the same i but taking

  =   0.0005,   we get a band which is 37.56 percentage points wide on an annualized basis. Clearly

these upper and lower limits are a long way from good estimates. The interest differential is quite

volatile so the lower limit is too low, however, it displays significant persistence, so the upper

bound case is too high.

33     kerecterixiag ike Poutioa of Ike Bead

            From the value matching conditions the band position depends upon              Figure 3.4

 illustrates this relationship. LL plots (3.6) for i<   a, end HR plots (3.7) for i> a.     Since   the

 current spot does not depend on         when i falls outside the band, LL and HR are in exactly the

 same position in both the top panel (which depicts the period t situation) and the bottom panel

 (which depicts the period t+1 situation) of the diagram. If i turns out to be greater than (, say

 t', then          be    which is higher than         This implies that in the bottom panel, the band

 will be shifted to the right as shown. Note that the band in t+i is such that a.1          equals   I'.

 This should be obvious since the equation that determines s looks exactly like the value matching

condition in t+1. If p is near unity and           has   a single—peaked symmetric distribution then the

likelihood that          will fall near the higb side of the band is large. Basically it displays

positive persistence and the band tends to follow it around.



. A Number of Testable Implicaioris
         If the hysteresis band has a significant effect on the foreign exchange market it should be

evident in the data. This section discusses several empirically testable propositions.

4.1 The ffpsleresi.   Beii aw4 Le Forward Rats Prrdichon Errors
         If uncovered and covered interest parity hold, the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of
the future spot. The hysteresis band invalidates uncovered interest parity.

Prouosition 1: The forward rate may not be an unbiased predictor ot the future spot.

         The spot is determined by i + E{s+i I x)_.s+oP[it,.t_iI                  i—Ic in the sell—pounds

region of Figure 3.2. Clearly, in this region the expected value of the measured prediction error is:

(4.1)             (f_E{s+1Ix})          =                 + Ic    > 0,

defining t to be     —   i   +s. Similar reasoning implies that in the buy—pounds region:

 (4.2)
                  (— E{st+i x}) = ö1'[i,i_1j — Ic
                                I
                                                                 < 0.

 Lastly in the hysteresis band:

 (4.3)        0< ö'I1[a,sJ + K                   (c_E{st+ilxt}) > ö'I'(a,s_1—Ic              <0,

 where               Inspection of Figure 3.4 show. that 'I' [it,.....ij is increasing in i', is strictly less
         s=
 than K and strictly greater than —ic. Plainly, then (4.3) implies that there is a unique realization

 of i' for which (— E.(.+i xe)) =   I
                                            0.

          In summary, equations (4.1)—(43) imply that the measured difference between the

 forward rate and the actual future spot should not be expected to be sero. Measured prediction

 errors are not pure expectation errors even when trader. are risk neutral. They are expectation

 errors plus the incumbency premium and either K or                      —Ic.   We   continue to refer to



                                                            18
(c—E{5+1kJ) as the measured predictions errors to suggest comparisons with existing
empirical literature. Proposition 4 consider. the magnitude of the wedge.

Proposition 2: The prediction errors should display positive serial correlation

         Using equation. (4.1)—(4.3) and the fact that                               is increasing in t'    we   plot

(ç—   E{s     I
                  x}) as a function of i   in Figure 4.1. Clearly, the errors arc positive for low i', and

negative for high i. If i itself is positively .erially correlated, then the errors should be positively

serially correlated as well.

Proposition 3: The prediction errors should be positively correlated with the current forward rate

prolonged dollar appreciations, and especially Large and negative during prolonged dollar

        As we showed in Section 3, a realization of i outside the band shifts the nearest edge of

the band to the realization. Thu. if by chance we observed that for a number of sequential
periods the interest rate differential decreased, lowering the spot rate, we know that the band was

shifting to the left. Thus we know that period alter period the i' realizations are typically falling

near the lower end of band where the wedge ii largest. Similarly, sequential increases in the spot

lead us to expect that the measure prediction errors will be quite negative.

comparisons of tests on different time periods and different currencies would provide evidence on

the importance of the transaction costs.



 5. Summary and Concluding Remarks

         It seems quite plausible that foreign exchange traders are risk averse. This paper aumes

 they ale risk neutral and rational in order to apply the basic intuition of the irreversible
 investment literature to the foreign exchange market. We showed that very small transaction

 costs together with uncertainty Imply that uncovered interest speculation .hould be marked by a

 non—negligible hysteresis band. Thus the most general point in this paper is that measured

 prediction errors include a wedge in addition to true prediction errors.          We show that the

 empirically observed properties of measured prediction errors are consistent with the nature of the



                                                         20
wedge. More generally, we show that even tiny transaction costa should not be ignored in models

of exchange rate determination. Specifically, any empirical effort to identify a risk premium must

somehow separate the wedge from the risk premium.

Additional Implications

        Uncovered interest parity is one of the linchpins of modern exchange rate theory. Since

small transaction cost require a modification of this condition, the analysis in this paper suggests a

number of interesting extensions. Uncovered intere.t parity implies that fixed exchange rates

require i = i exactly at all times. We just showed that the presence of transaction costs equal to
one hundredth of one percent implies that central banks might not face pressure on its reserves as

long as the interest differential was less than something like 1 to 4 percentage points. Thus

exchange rate variability together with tiny transaction costs would allow a moderate degree on

monetary independence in a fixed exchange rate regime.

         Additionally removing all uncertainty on cross interest arbitrage, by maintaining aero

margins around parity, might lead to greatly increased arbitrage on the interest rate differential.

This would argue that the as the European Monetary System attempts to reduce margins to zero

it might encounter difficulties. Namely, unless EC interest rate are actually pegged to each other

on a niinute—to—-rninute basis substantial cross—border interest rate arbitrage could strain rceerve

hcldings.

         The hysteresis band also suggests an approach to calculating optimal margins for fixed

exchange rate systems. Introducing margins around parity introduces uncertainry, and so would

 lead to non—negligible bands. The bands would permit the central bank to use the interest rate to

 stabilize some minor domestic shocks. This minor gain in stabilization is traded off against the

 costs of slightly increased exchange rate uncertainty.

         Standard exchange rate dynamics are based on uncovered interest parity.             Since we

 showed that uncovered interest parity is not in general supported by cross—currency interest



                                                      21
arbitrage, the standard dynamics may be incorrect or incomplete.

          Lastly, note that there is absolutely nothing international about the point. The band.

would exists even for arbitrage between assets denominated in the same currency. This suggests

that assets price, even in domestic market can get quite out of line without leading to equalizing

arbitrage. Unlike market efficiency test in international economics, difference. between expected

rates of return in domestic markets are not interpreted as tests of market efficiency. Moreover, it

suggests that even a small Tobin tax on asset trade could allow rates of return on various assets to

get fairly far out of line. This clearly has a deleterious effect on economic efficiency.




APPENDIX 1: Smooth Pa3ting and the Sctnk Cost Model
          Dixlt (1989a) is well—known so we only briefly sketch the derivation of the optimal

strategy. (See Dixit 1988 for an intuitive exposition of the smooth pasting approach.)          The

strategy is summarized by two time—invariant numbers, cx° and a'. If V is greater than a', he

goes into pounds (if he was in dollars); if V is less than a° be goe. out of pounds (if he was in

pound.).

           Four necessary conditions help us determine a° and a' and the value functions. Clearly,

at the Qs the trader must be indifferent to acting, o we have the value—matching conditions:

(All)          V5[ail_,c = V[a'l,       and     V[a°I = V[a°)—?c
 Because the decision making is ceaseless, and V is Brownian motion, we get another set of

necessary condition., the so—called smooth—pasting conditions:

(A1.2)          V'[a°I = V'Ia°,       and     V'[a'J = v'dj
           By Ito'. lemma and option pricing techniques the value function V and V obey:

 (A1.3)         rV(ftJ = (R.—i) + (a2/2)(R')2V"[V) + p V V'[R', and
 (A1.4)         rV[RJ = (2/2) (R)2V"(RI + p V V'[Ri



                                                       22
The general solution, for these second order differential equations are:

(A 1.5)          V'[R) =   Ae      + R1/(rj) — i/r,         and      V[R'l =

where —a and /3 are the roots of the associated quadratic equation:

(A1.6)           (cr2/2)e(el) +        —r   =   0


            Using these definitions of V and V5 with the two value—match and two smooth—pasting

conditions, we have four necessary conditions to solve for the four unknowns: a', a°, A and B.

1.    Hysteresis is the failure of an effect to reverse itself as its underlying cause is reversed.

2. Here we have ignored the positive covariance between the future spot and the future short term

sterling rate.     This is a problem even in the absence of transaction costs.              For instance, if

uncovered interest parity holds for one period deposits, then (14.i) = (1+it) (s+i/st), where it          is


the one period sterling rate. But if the English market is efficient and investors risk neutral, then

(l+it) equals E{(1+i t)/(l+it+i)}, where i is the two day sterling rate. Now since it+i                 and

          have positive covariance, it is clear that the expected dollar rate of return on holding two

day sterling CD. for one day, which equals E{st+i(l+i t)/(l+it+i)st}i is greater than the dollar
 rate of return on dollar CD.. To put it differently, if the spot adjusts to equate the expected rate

 of return on one period deposits, the expected rates of return on long deposits cannot be equalized.

 3.    Here we assume that each investor can buy only a finite amount of sterling. (The finite

suffice). The problem is that if he can borrow an infinite amount at i and invest it in sterling at I

plus ep.ilon his expected profit would be infinite. Thus although he could expect to earn more per

dollar by waiting, this involve. the comparison of two infinite values. We could, however, allow

an infinite supply of investors, each of which has a finite investment potential.
