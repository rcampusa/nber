Fundamentally, Momentum is Fundamental Momentum

                                            ABSTRACT

Momentum in firm fundamentals, i.e., earnings momentum, explains the performance of strategies
based on price momentum. Earnings surprise measures subsume past performance in cross sectional
regressions of returns on firm characteristics, and the time-series performance of price momentum
strategies is fully explained by their covariances with earnings momentum strategies. Controlling for
earnings surprises when constructing price momentum strategies significantly reduces their performance,
without reducing their high volatilities. Controlling for past performance when constructing earnings
momentum strategies reduces their volatilities, and eliminates the crashes strongly associated with
momentum of all types, without reducing the strategies' high average returns. While past performance
does not have independent power predicting the cross section of expected returns, it does predicts
stock comovements, and is thus important for explain cross sectional variation in realized returns.

1. Introduction
   Price momentum, i.e., the tendency of stocks that have performed well over the prior
year to outperform, going forward, stocks that have performed poorly over the prior year,
is often regarded as the most important financial anomaly. The anomaly is observed over
long periods and across markets. Momentum has generated large, though highly volatile,
returns. The anomaly has been particularly challenging for proponents of market efficiency,
as it is difficult to imagine a risk-based story consistent with both the large magnitude and
transient nature of momentum returns. It is also problematic for the profession’s dominant
empirical pricing model, the Fama and French (1993) three factor model, which predicts
that momentum, because it covaries negatively with value strategies, should have negative
average excess returns. These facts have brought momentum enormous attention in the
finance literature. This paper argues that such attention is not deserved. It shows that
momentum is not an independent anomaly, but driven by fundamental momentum. That
is, price momentum is merely a weak expression of earnings momentum, reflecting the
tendency of stocks that have recently announced strong earnings to outperform, going
forward, stocks that have recently announced weak earnings.
   This may seem surprising, in light of Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok’s (1996,
hereafter CJL) well known and widely accepted conclusion that “past return[s] and past
earnings surprise[s] each predict large drifts in future returns after controlling for the
other” (p. 1681). CJL actually consider the possibility “that the profitability of momentum
strategies is entirely due to the component of medium-horizon returns that is related to
these earnings-related news,” but explicitly reject this hypothesis, concluding that “each
momentum variable has separate explanatory power for future returns, so one strategy does
not subsume the other” (pp. 1682–3). They draw this conclusion primarily on the basis
of return spreads they see in both directions from an independent three by three portfolio
sort on past performance and earnings surprises. This is rather weak evidence on which to
base their conclusion. These sorts are far too coarse to provide adequate controls for the
two variables. In any third of the stock universe picked on the basis of earnings surprises,

                                             1
sorting on past performance still induces significant variation in earnings surprises.
   Against this weak test, a preponderance of stronger evidence suggests that earnings
momentum drives price momentum. In cross sectional regressions of firms’ returns onto
past performance and earnings surprises, earnings surprises largely subsume the power
of past performance to predict cross sectional variation in expected returns. Adding
earnings surprises as an explanatory variable in cross sectional regressions dramatically
attenuates the coefficient on past performance, which loses its significance, while adding
past performance as an explanatory variable leaves the coefficient on earnings surprises
essentially unchanged.
   Time-series regressions employing the returns to price and earnings momentum
strategies are even more conclusive. These tests are more robust to measurement error
than cross sectional regressions, and do not require parametric assumptions regarding
the functional form of the relation between expected returns and the predictive variables.
These time-series regressions suggest that price momentum is fully captured by earnings
momentum. Price momentum strategies do not have a positive alpha relative to earnings
momentum strategies, while earnings momentum strategies have large, highly significant
alphas relative to price momentum strategies. This suggests that an investor who wants to
trade momentum would lose nothing by completely ignored price momentum.
   While investors trading earnings momentum would not benefit from trading price
momentum, they would benefit from accounting for past performance. Accounting for
past performance improves the performance of momentum strategies, if it is used to help
investors avoid price momentum when trading earnings momentum. Price momentum
contributes to the volatility of earnings momentum strategies, and drives the strategies’
largest drawdowns. Earnings momentum strategies explicitly constructed to avoid price
momentum consequently have lower volatility, and none of the negative skew, of traditional
earnings momentum strategies. Because these earnings momentum strategies unpolluted
by price momentum generate average returns comparable to their traditional counterparts,
they have significantly higher Sharpe ratios.


                                                2
   The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 establishes the basic asset
pricing facts, that earnings surprises subsume the power of past performance to predict
returns in both cross sectional and time-series regressions. Section 3 shows that controlling
for past performance when constructing earnings momentum strategies improves their
performance by decreasing volatility, while controlling for earnings surprises when
constructing price momentum strategies hurts their performance by decreasing returns.
Section 4 shows that the superior performance of volatility managed price momentum
strategies is also explained by earnings momentum. Section 5 shows that the results of
this paper are robust to accounting for transaction costs. Section 6 investigates the role of
past performance in predicting comovements between stocks. Section 7 concludes.


2. Basic asset pricing results
   This section establishes the basic asset pricing facts, that earnings surprises subsume
the power of past performance to predict cross sectional variation in expected returns, and
that the time-series performance of price momentum strategies is fully explained by the
performance of strategies based on earnings surprises. It also shows that these results are
robust across the spectrum of firm size.


2.1. Measuring past performance and earnings surprises

   Comparing the power of past performance and earnings surprises to predict expected
return variation requires measures for each. For past performance I use the measure
most commonly associated with price momentum strategies, performance measured over
the preceding year, skipping the most recent month to avoid diluting price momentum
with short term reversals (r2;12 ). For earnings surprises I use two measures commonly
employed in the literature, standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) and cumulative three
day abnormal returns (CAR3). SUE is defined as the most recent year-over-year change
in earnings per share, scaled by the standard deviation of the these earnings innovations



                                             3
over the last eight announcements, subject to a requirement of at least six observed
announcements over the two year window. For earnings per share I use Compustat quarterly
data item EPSPXQ (Earnings Per Share (Basic) / Excluding Extraordinary Items). Earnings
announcement dates are Compustat quarterly data item RDQ. CAR3 is defined as the
cumulative return in excess of that earned by the market over the three days starting the day
before the most recent earnings announcement and ending at the end of the day following
the announcement.
   The time-series average rank correlation between r2;12 and SUE is 29.1%, between
r2;12 and CAR3 is 13.7%, and between SUE and CAR3 is 19.9%. This suggests that
the earnings innovations scaled to create standardized unexpected earnings are actually
largely expected; SUE correlates more strongly with past performance than it does with
the market’s contemporaneous reaction to the earnings’ announcements. Past performance
reflects innovations to investors’ beliefs about a firm’s prospects, including, but not limited
to, guidance the firm has provided regarding it operations, some, but not all of which,
are reflected directly in announced earnings. The fact that SUE correlates more strongly
with r2;12 than with CAR3 indicates that more of the information regarding the change in
earnings per share are incorporated into prices prior to announcements than in the days
immediately surrounding announcements.


2.2. Fama and MacBeth regressions

   Table 1 reports results of Fama and MacBeth (1973) regressions of individual
monthly stock returns onto the past performance (r2;12 ), and the most recent earnings
surprises measured by both standardized unexpected earnings (SUE) and the cumulative
three day abnormal returns (CAR3). Regressions include controls for other variables
known to predict cross sectional variation in expected returns, size, relative valuations,
profitability, and short horizon past performance, measured here using the log of firms’
market capitalizations (ln(ME)), the log of firms’ book-to-market ratios (ln(B/M)), gross
profitability (GP/A, where GP is revenues minus cost of goods sold and A is assets, as


                                              4
in Novy-Marx (2013)), and stocks’ prior month returns (r2;12 ).1 Independent variables are
trimmed at the one and 99% levels. The full sample covers January 1975 through December
2012, with the dates determined by the data requirements for making the SUE and CAR3
strategies. The table also reports subsample results, with the early sample covering January
1975 through December 1993, a period largely coincident with the January 1977 through
January 1993 sample studied in CJL, and the late sample covering January 1994 through
December 2012.
       The first two specifications show the coefficient estimates on past performance and the
two earnings surprise measures, respectively, over the entire sample. The first specification
shows a significant positive cross sectional correlation between prior year’s performance
and expected returns, while the second shows far more significant correlations between
earnings surprises and expected returns.
       The third specification shows that in the regression that includes both past performance
and earnings surprises, the coefficient on past performance is reduced by three quarters, and
becomes statistically insignificant, while the coefficients on the earnings surprise measures
are essentially unmitigated, and become more significant. This suggests that the power past
performance has predicting cross sectional variation in expected returns in specification one
derives from its correlation with earnings surprises, while the power earnings surprises have
to predict returns is unrelated to past performance.
       The last four specifications show subsample results consistent with the conclusion that
earnings surprises have independent power predicting expected return differences across
stocks, while the power of past performance derives primarily from its correlation with
earnings surprises.
   1
     Chan, Jegadeesh, and Lakonishok (1996) also run Fama and MacBeth regressions of firms’ returns on
past performance and earnings surprises, but their tests, in addition to covering a much shorter sample, differ
from those presented here in at least three important ways. First, for the dependent variable they use stocks’
subsequent six month or one year returns, which weakens the tests due to the transient nature of momentum
effects. Second, and most importantly, they transform their independent variables into percentile rankings,
which reduces the power of the earnings surprise variables. Lastly, they do not include controls for other
known cross sectional return predictors.

2.3. Spanning tests

    The results of the Fama and MacBeth regressions shown in Table 1 suggest that the
power of past performance to predict cross sectional variation in expected returns is largely
subsumed by earnings surprise. This subsection shows that price momentum is fully
captured by earnings momentum in time-series regressions.
    These time-series regressions, or spanning tests, essentially ask which momentum
strategies, among those constructed using past performance and the two measures of

                                                      6
earnings surprises, generate significant alpha relative to the others.                     They do so by
regressing the returns of a test strategy, taken from the set of momentum strategies, onto the
returns of explanatory strategies, which include the Fama and French factors and the other
momentum strategies. Significant abnormal returns suggest an investor already trading the
explanatory strategies could realize significant gains by starting to trade the test strategy.
Insignificant abnormal returns suggest that the investor has little to gain by starting to trade
the test strategy.
       For the price momentum strategy I use the up-minus-down factor, UMD, available from
Ken French’s data library.2 For the earnings momentum factors I construct analogues
to UMD based on the two measures of earnings surprises. Specifically, these factors
are constructed from underlying portfolios that are formed monthly, as the intersection
of two size and three earnings momentum portfolios. The size portfolios divide stocks
into large or small cap universes, based on NYSE median market capitalization. The
earnings momentum portfolios divide the world into three portfolios divided at the 30th
and 70th percentiles, using NYSE breaks, of earnings surprises, measured using either
SUE or CAR3. The earnings momentum factors are each formed as an equal weighted
average of value weighted large cap and small cap earnings momentum strategies, which
buy the upper tertile and short the bottom tertile of the earnings surprises portfolios based
on the corresponding measure of earnings surprises. In a convenient abuse of notation,
these earnings momentum factors are denoted SUE and CAR3, the same as the earnings
surprise measures on which they are based. The performance of the portfolios underlying
these factors is provided in the Appendix, in Table A1.
       Figure 1 shows the performance of the three momentum factors, UMD, SUE, and
CAR3. The figure shows the growth of a dollar, net of financing costs, invested in the
beginning of 1975 into each of the strategies. To facilitate comparison, the strategies are
all levered to run at a sample volatility of 10%. The figure shows that both of the earnings
momentum strategies dramatically outperformed the price momentum strategy, suggesting

    Table 2 analyzes the performance of the three momentum factors formally. Panel A
shows the performance of UMD. Specification one shows that over the 38 year sample the
standard price momentum factor earned a highly significant 64 basis points per month, with
a t-statistic of 3.03. Specification two provides the standard result that momentum’s Fama
and French three-factor alpha is even larger. Specification three shows that UMD loads
heavily on both SUE and CAR3, and as a result has a significant negative alpha relative
to earnings momentum, even after controlling for the three Fama and French factors. This

fact, that earnings momentum subsumes price momentum in time-series regressions, drives
the success of Hou, Xue, and Zhang’s (2014) alternative factor model pricing momentum
strategies. Novy-Marx (2015) shows that their model’s success pricing portfolios sorted on
past performance is driven entirely by post earnings announcement drift in its profitability
factor. It also shows that it succeeds in pricing portfolios sorted on gross profitability only
by conflating low return earnings profitability, which drives the factor’s covariance with
gross profitability, with earnings surprises, which drives the factor’s high average returns.
     Specifications four through seven show consistent subsample results. UMD generated
positive returns over both the early and late halves of the sample, though these were only
statistically significant over the early sample. Yet even in the early sample, when UMD
earned 85 bps/month, it failed to generate abnormal returns relative to the price momentum
factors.
     Panels B and C show that the earnings factors SUE and CAR3 both fall outside the
span of UMD and each other. The earnings momentum strategies both generated highly
significant returns over the whole sample, with t-statistics exceeding seven for SUE and

                                                  10
eight for CAR3. For both factors the returns are highly significant over both subsamples,
though roughly 50% larger and more significant over the early sample. Both earnings
momentum factors’ returns remain highly significant after controlling for the three Fama
and French factors and the other two momentum factors, even in the late sample when their
performance was less impressive.


2.4. Results by size

   The Fama and MacBeth regression results of Table 1 are primarily identified off of
small cap stocks, which account for a large majority of names. The performance of all
three of the momentum strategies considered in Table 2 is also driven disproportionately
by the small cap stocks, the returns to which are over-weighted when calculating factor
returns. These facts raise concerns that the results of the previous subsections are absent
from the large cap universe, which accounts for a large majority of market capitalization.
This subsection shows that this is not the case. The results also hold among large cap
stocks.
   Table 3 provides results of spanning tests, similar to those presented in Table 2,
performed within NYSE size quintiles. Within each size quintile I construct price and
earnings momentum strategies. These buy and sell the top and bottom 30% of stocks
within that size quintile on the basis of the corresponding sorting characteristic, r2;12 , SUE
or CAR3. Portfolios are rebalanced monthly, and returns are value weighted.
   Panel A of Table 3 reports characteristics of the size portfolios. It gives time-series
averages of the number of stocks and average size of stocks in each portfolio, as well as the
fraction of the names and market cap in each portfolio.
   Panel B shows the performance of the price momentum portfolios constructed within
NYSE size quintiles. It shows that sorting on past performance generates positive return
spreads across the size portfolios, though these spreads are decreasing monotonically with
size. That is, momentum is stronger among smaller stocks. It also shows that except among
the smallest stocks, which make up on average only 3.5% of market capitalization, the

Table 3. Spanning tests of value, profitability, and volatility-based defensive strategies,
constructed within size deciles
The table reports the performance of price momentum (winner-minus-loser; WML) and earnings momentum
(SUE and CAR3) strategies, constructed within each NYSE size quintile. These strategies buy and sell the
30% of stocks with the highest and lowest values of the corresponding sorting characteristic among stocks
in the same size quintile. Portfolios are rebalanced monthly, and returns are value-weighted and ignore
transaction costs. The table reports the average monthly excess returns to each set of strategies, as well as
results of time-series regressions of each set of strategies’ excess returns onto the returns of three Fama and
French factors and the other two momentum factors constructed within the same size quintile. The sample
covers January 1975 through December 2012, dates determined by the data requirements for making the SUE
and CAR3 strategies.

returns to the momentum strategies are completely insignificant relative to the earnings
momentum strategies constructed within the same size quintiles, even after controlling
for the Fama and French factors. Among the smallest stocks, where past performance
generates by far the largest spread return, the price momentum strategy has a large, highly
significant, negative alpha with respect to the earnings momentum strategies.
    Panels C and D show that both earnings surprise measures generate returns spreads
in each size quintile that are more significant than those generated by sorting on past
performance. They also show that all ten of the earnings momentum strategies generated
positive alphas relative to the Fama and French factors and the other momentum strategies
constructed within the same size quintiles. These alphas are all significant at the 5% level,
except for the CAR3 strategy constructed using stocks with the largest capitalizations, for
which the alpha is significant only at the 10% level.



3    Conditional strategies
    Past performance and earnings surprises, especially surprises measured by SUE,
are positively correlated. Sorting on past performance consequently yields systematic
variation in SUE across portfolios, while sorting on SUE yields systematic variation in past
performance across portfolios. This conflation makes it difficult to evaluate the impact of
the two effects independently. This section attempts to address this issue by constructing
momentum strategies that are neutral with respect to SUE, and SUE strategies that are
neutral with respect to past performance.
    These strategies are constructed by controlling for one variable while sorting on the
other. Specifically, stocks are first matched on the control variable, and then assigned to
portfolios on the basis of the primary sorting variable. For example, a strategy that selected
pairs of stocks most closely matched on SUE, and then for each pair bought the one with
stronger past performance and shorted the one with weaker past performance, would have
substantial variation in past performance, but essentially none in recent earnings surprises.


                                             14
   To make the conditional strategies, UMDjSUE (“UMD conditional on SUE”) and
SUEjr2;12 (“SUE conditional on prior year’s performance”), as directly comparable as
possible to UMD and SUE, I would like them to have the same variation in the primary
sorting characteristic as their traditional counterparts.      That is, I would like a past
performance spread in UMDjSUE similar to that in UMD, and an earnings surprise spread
in SUEjr2;12 similar to that in SUE. UMD and SUE hold the 30% of stocks with the highest
past performance or earnings surprise rankings, and short the 30% with the lowest rankings,
so the average ranking of the primary sorting variable on the long and short sides of UMD
and SUE are 85% and 15%, respectively.
   If past performance and earnings surprises were uncorrelated, then selecting groups of
stocks matched on the control variable would not affect the distribution of the rankings
on the primary sorting characteristic.       The stocks’ rankings on the primary sorting
characteristic would then be like n independent draws of a standard uniform variable. The
maximal order statistic of n independent standard uniform variables is distributed nx n 1 , so
                          R1
has an expected value of 0 x.nx n 1 dx/ D n=.n C 1/. The expected value of the minimal
order statistic is, by symmetry, 1=.n C 1/. So if past performance and earnings surprises
were uncorrelated, then assigning stocks on the basis of the primary sorting variable among
groups of n D 6 stocks matched on the control variable would yield expected average
rankings of the primary sorting variable in the high and low portfolios of 6=7 D 85:3%
1=7 D 15:3%, respectively, similar to those obtained from a univariate tertile sort.
   Past performance and earnings surprises are significantly correlated, however, which
is what conflates price and earnings momentum strategies in the first place.               This
correlation reduces the spread in the primary sorting characteristic between the high and
low portfolios of the conditional strategies. Groups of n stocks matched on one of the
characteristics exhibit less variation in the other characteristics, because of the correlation,
than would n randomly selected stocks. Variation in the primary sorting characteristic
among stocks matched on the control variable comes only from the variation in the former
unexplained by the latter. To achieve a spread in the primary sorting characteristic for


                                              15
the conditional strategies comparable to that observed in the traditional price and earnings
momentum strategies consequently requires initially selecting larger groups of matched
stocks. Selecting groups of seven stocks matched on the control variable yields conditional
strategies with variation in the primary sorting characteristic that most closely matches the
variation resulting from the univariate tertile sorts.
       Finally, to make these conditional strategies as comparable to UMD and SUE as
possible, the returns to the conditional strategies are also averaged across large and small
cap strategies. Specifically, large and small cap stocks, defined as those with above and
below NYSE median market capitalizations, are matched into groups of seven on the
basis of either past performance (r2;12 ) or recent earnings surprises (SUE). Stocks are
then assigned to portfolios on the basis of their rankings on the other variable, earnings
surprises or past performance. The conditional earnings surprise factor, SUEjr2;12 , and
the conditional momentum factor, UMDjSUE, are an equal-weighted average of the
value-weighted large and small cap strategies that hold the corresponding high portfolios
and short the corresponding low portfolios.3
       Figure 2 shows the time-series average of the average past performance and earnings
surprise ranks of the portfolios underlying the conditional momentum and earnings
surprise factors, as well as the unconditional factors UMD and SUE. Panel A shows past
performance ranks. The UMD portfolios and UMDjSUE exhibit nearly identical variation
in past performance ranks. The unconditional SUE factor exhibits about a third of this
variation, despite being constructed without consideration for past performance. The
conditional earnings surprise factors exhibit essentially no variation in past performance
rankings, as intended.
       Panel B shows similar results for earnings surprise ranks. The unconditional SUE factor
and SUEjr2;12 exhibit almost indistinguishable levels of earnings surprise rank variation,
   3
    The appendix also reports results for conditional strategies constructed by selecting only matched triples
on the conditioning variable. This yields similar name diversification to UMD and SUE on the long and
short sides, but significantly less variation in the primary sorting characteristic between the high and low
portfolios. Results using this alternative methodology for conditional factor construction are consistent with
those presented here.

the momentum crash in the spring of 2009. The figure shows that purging earnings
momentum from UMD, however, yields a significant worsening in the performance of the
price momentum strategy.
   Table 4 analyzes the performance of the four strategies formally. The first specification
shows that UMD generated highly significant gross spreads over the 38 year sample. The
second shows that UMD has a significant information ratio relative to the momentum
factor constructed to be neutral with respect to earnings surprises, UMDjSUE, suggesting
earnings momentum significantly contributes to the performance of the standard price
momentum factor. The third specification shows that UMD loads heavily on both the
conditional factors UMDjSUE and SUEjr2;12 , and that these loadings explain UMD’s
performance. UMD’s loading on the conditional earnings momentum factor is roughly
a third of its loadings on the conditional price momentum factor, consistent with the UMD
portfolios’ earnings surprise rank spread one third as large as their past performance rank
spread, observed in Figure 2.
   Specifications four through six show that the unconditional earnings momentum factor
SUE generated a spread similar to, but much more significant than, that on UMD.
They also show that SUE, like UMD, loads heavily on both the conditional factors, and
that these loadings also explain SUE’s performance. SUE’s loading on the conditional
price momentum factor is roughly a quarter of its loadings on the conditional earnings
momentum factor, again consistent with the relative earnings surprise and past performance
rank spreads observed on the factors’ underlying portfolios in Figure 2.
   Specification seven shows that UMDjSUE, the price momentum factor purged of
earnings momentum, generated only two-thirds the spread of the standard UMD factor, and
that this spread is significant at the 10% level, but not at the 5% level. Specification eight
shows that UMDjSUE has a significant negative alpha relative to UMD, while specification
nine shows that this negative alpha is insignificant after controlling for the short position
UMDjSUE takes in SUE after controlling for UMD.
   Specifications ten through twelve show that SUEjr2;12 , the earnings momentum

     earnings momentum factor constructed to be neutral with respect to price momentum SUEjr2;12 (specifications ten to twelve). The conditional
     factors are constructed similar to UMD, but sort stocks on the primary sorting characteristic (r2;12 or SUE) from among stocks matched on the
     other characteristic. The initial match selects groups of seven stocks, which yields variation in the primary sorting characteristic nearly identical
     to that obtained from a univariate tertile sort. Explanatory factors are taken from the same set of strategies. The sample covers January 1975

constructed to be neutral with respect to past performance, generated a similar, even more
significant, spread to that observed on the unconditional factor SUE, and that it has an
extremely large information ratio relative both to SUE and to SUE and UMD.
    None of the inferences discussed here change if one includes controls for the three
Fama and French factors in the time-series regressions. The results are also even stronger
if the conditional strategies are constructed such that the underlying portfolios have similar
name diversification, as opposed to primary sorting characteristic variation, to the portfolios
underlying UMD and SUE (results provided in Table A2, in the appendix).
    Price momentum strategies are also known to exhibit large negative skew and significant
excess kurtosis, i.e., they generate extreme moves more frequently than if the returns
were log-normally distributed, and these extreme moves are more likely to be crashes.
Table 5 demonstrates that these features of momentum strategy performance are driven by
price, not earnings, momentum. While the table shows that earnings momentum strategy
also exhibits large negative skew and significant excess kurtosis, the earnings momentum
strategy constructed controlling for price momentum has positive skew and only mild
excess kurtosis.

4. Constant volatility strategies
       The negative skew and excess kurtosis in price momentum strategies are also analyzed
in detail by both Barroso and Santa-Clara (2013) and Daniel and Moskowitz (2014).
These papers argue that momentum’s crash risk is time-varying and predictable, and
that managing crash risk significantly improves momentum strategy performance, making
momentum even more difficult to explain. This section shows that fundamental momentum
explains even these high Sharpe ratio, risk-managed, price momentum strategies.
       To construct the risk-managed momentum strategies I follow Barroso and Santa-Clara
(2013), who lever a winners-minus-losers strategy each month attempting to hit a target
volatility, i.e., they scale a standard momentum strategy by its trailing volatility.4 I
construct the constant volatility strategies UMD , SUE , and CAR3 similarly, levering
each corresponding dollar long/dollar short strategy by an amount that is inversely
proportional to that strategy’s realized daily volatility over the preceding month. To
facilitate comparison between the constant volatility strategies and the dollar long/dollar
short strategies, the target volatility is picked such that the average leverage employed in
each of the constant volatility strategies is close to one.
       Figure 4 shows the trailing 12-month average leverage for each strategy. The figure also
includes, for comparison, the leverage for a similarly constructed constant volatility market
factor, MKT . The strategies exhibit similar leverage at each point in time. For example,
all the strategies show dramatic reductions in leverage during the NASDAQ deflation,
roughly coincident with the terrorist attacks of 9/11/2001, and following the start of the
great recession after 2008, both times of market stress and high uncertainty. While Barroso
and Santa-Clara (2013) claim in their abstract that “the major source of predictability is
not time-varying market risk but rather momentum-specific risk,” the figure suggests that
   4
     Daniel and Moskowitz (2014) employ a similar procedure, but also incorporate information regarding
their estimation of momentum’s conditional expected returns, based on their observation that momentum
has performed poorly when its volatility has been high in periods after the market has performed poorly.
While generated stronger results, their procedure is more complicated. It also employs fitted returns based on
parameters estimated over the whole sample, raising look-ahead bias concerns.

to construct the constant volatility strategies UMD , SUE , and CAR3 . This leverage is inversely
proportional to the dollar long/dollar short strategies’ realized daily volatility over the preceding

volatility strategies is close to one. Leverage for a similarly constructed constant volatility market
strategy, MKT , is provided for comparison. The sample covers January 1975 through December
2012, dates determined by the data requirements for making the SUE and CAR3 strategies.

Fig. 5. Constant volatility strategy performance. The figure shows the value of a dollar invested at
the beginning of 1975 in the constant volatility price momentum factor, UMD (dotted line), and
the constant volatility earnings momentum factors, SUE (solid line) and CAR3 (dashed line).
The performance of the conventional momentum factor, UMD (dot-dashed line), is provided as a
benchmark. Returns are calculated net of financing costs (i.e., are excess returns). To facilitate
comparison, factors are scaled to have a sample volatilities of 10%. The sample covers January
1975 through December 2012, dates determined by the data requirements for making the SUE and
CAR3 strategies.



with Barroso and Santa-Clara (2013) and Daniel and Moskowitz (2014), the figure shows
that the constant volatility price momentum strategy, UMD , generates far superior
performance to its conventional counterpart, and mostly avoids the momentum crash in
the spring of 2009. The figure also shows, however, that the constant volatility earnings
momentum strategies dramatically outperform the constant volatility price momentum
strategy.

   Table 6 formally analyzes the performance of the constant volatility strategies. Panel
A investigates the performance of UMD . Specification one shows that over the 38 year
sample the constant volatility price momentum strategy earned 85 basis points per month,
with a t-statistic twice as large as that on the average excess return to the conventional
momentum factor (6.34 versus 3.03). Specification two shows that UMD also has a
large, highly significant information ratio relative to conventional momentum. UMD had
an alpha of 47 bps/month relative to UMD and the three Fama and French factors. The
t-statistic on this alpha is 5.65, implying an extremely high information ratio. Specification
three shows that UMD is inside the span of the constant volatility earnings momentum
factors. UMD had a completely insignificant alpha of 2 bps/month relative to SUE ,
CAR3 , and the three Fama and French factors.
   Specifications four through seven show consistent subsample results. UMD generated
highly significant returns, even over the late half of the sample when UMD failed to do so,
though the strategy did, similar to UMD, deliver average returns roughly twice as high over
the early sample. In both subsamples, however, this performance is entirely explained by
the strategy’s loadings on the constant volatility earnings momentum factors.
   Panels B and C show that the constant volatility earnings factors SUE and CAR3 are
both outside the span of UMD and each other. The earnings momentum strategies both
generated highly significant returns over the whole sample, with t-statistics close to ten.
These returns are highly significant over both subsamples, though again more impressive
over the early sample. These returns are essentially unmitigated after controlling for the
three Fama and French factors and UMD, and remain highly significant after controlling for
the three Fama and French factors and the other two constant volatility momentum factors.

5        Transaction costs
        Before getting overly excited about the remarkable performance of the momentum
strategies observed in the preceding sections, it must be remembered that trading
momentum entails significant transaction costs, costs which have, up until now, been
ignored. Both the long and short sides of conventional SUE factor turn over, on average,
more than twice a year. This costs on average 35 bps/month to trade.5 The UMD and CAR3
factors are even more expensive to trade, turning over on average three times per year at an
average cost of 50 bps/month. These costs are sufficient to wipe out most of the strategies’
excess returns.
    5
     Transaction cost estimates are all made using the methodology of Novy-Marx and Velikov (2014). This
methodology employs Hasbrouck’s (2009) Bayesian-Gibbs sampling procedure to estimate effective spreads
using a generalized version of the Roll (1984) model, where sufficient data is available, and a nearest matching
algorithm on size and volatility where it is not. The procedure yields estimates of the effective spreads faced
by a small liquidity demander, and thus represent a conservative estimate for small traders without significant
market impact. The estimates ignore the convexity in price impact from large trades, and may thus understate
the costs faced by traders with significant market footprints.



                                                      27
   The constant volatility factors generate superior performance, but are even more costly
to trade. Changing the strategies’ leverage each month induces significant additional
turnover. The constant volatility earnings momentum strategies’ leverage on the dollar
long/dollar short strategies changes on average by almost 25 percentage points per month.
The average leverage adjustment for the constant volatility price momentum strategy is
slightly higher. These leverage adjustments result in an additional 25% average one-way
transactions each month on each side of the strategies, increasing the cost of trading by
roughly another 25 bps/month. These higher costs are again sufficient to eat up most of the
constant volatility strategies’ superior gross returns.
   The strategies considered so far, however, have all been constructed without regard
for transaction costs. Consciously designing momentum strategies to minimize transaction
costs yields strategies with significantly better net performance, though this performance
is still obviously significantly worse than what could have been achieved if trading were
costless. Novy-Marx and Velikov (2014) find that the single most effective trading cost
mitigation technique is to trade using a buy/hold spread, i.e., to have a more stringent
requirement for actively trading into a position than for maintaining an open position. The
buy/hold spread eliminates much of the trading that results from stocks entering a portfolio
one month only to fall out the next, a type of transaction that represents a significant fraction
of turnover with standard academic portfolio construction.
   When constructing strategies that account for transaction costs I consequently follow
Novy-Marx and Velikov (2014), who find that a buy/hold spread of 20% yields significant
trading costs reductions while maintaining a similar exposure to the sorting characteristic.
Specifically, stocks enter the long portfolio when they enter the top quintile of the sorting
characteristic using NYSE breaks, and remain in this portfolio as long as they remain in
the top two quintiles. Similarly, on the short side, stocks are sold when they enter the
bottom quintile of the sorting characteristic using NYSE breaks, and are covered only
when they fall out of the bottom two quintiles. The strategies, like UMD, are constructed
as an equal weighted average of the value weighted large and small cap strategies, where


                                               28
large and small stocks are defined as those with above and below NYSE median market
capitalization. To further reduce turnover and transaction costs, reclassification from large
to small, or small to large, does not force the closing of open positions. Using this
buy/hold spread yields a nearly 50% reduction in turnover and transaction costs for the
price momentum strategy, and significant but more modest reductions for the SUE and
CAR3 strategies of roughly one third and one quarter, respectively.

Fig. 6. Comparison of momentum factors net of transaction costs. The figure shows the
value of a dollar, net of financing costs, invested at the end of the first quarter of 1974 in
the ROE factor, rebalanced monthly on the basis of the most recently announced quarterly
earnings-to-book, and similarly constructed factors based on standardized unexpected earnings
(PEAD), earnings innovations-to-book (ROE), lagged earnings-to-book (lag-ROE), and a lower
frequency earnings-to-book strategy based on annual return-on-equity, which is only rebalanced
once a year, at the end of June (E/B). Returns are calculated net of financing costs (i.e., are excess
returns). To facilitate comparison, factors are scaled to have a sample volatilities of 10%. The
sample covers January 1975 through December 2012, dates determined by the data requirements
for making the SUE and CAR3 strategies.

   Figure 6 shows the performance, net of transaction costs, of the three momentum factors
constructed using the buy/hold spread, UMDnet , SUEnet , and CAR3net . The figure shows
the growth of a dollar, net of financing costs, invested in the beginning of 1975 into each
of the strategies, where to facilitate comparison the strategies are all levered to run at an
average sample volatility of 10%. The figure shows that the strategies all generate positive
abnormal returns, even after accounting for transaction costs, though this performance is
severely attenuated relative to that calculated ignoring transaction costs. Consistent with
earlier results, the earnings momentum strategies generate superior performance to the
price momentum strategy.
   Table 7 replicates the spanning tests of Table 2, using the transaction cost mitigated
strategies’ net returns. Panel A shows that price momentum delivered significant returns
even after accounting for transaction costs, though accounting for transaction costs reduced
the momentum strategy’s Sharpe ratio by a third and makes its returns only marginally
significant. It also shows that the earnings momentum factors do an exceptional job pricing
the price momentum factor. The price momentum factors’ net alpha relative to the Fama
and French factors and the net earnings momentum factors is only one basis point per
month, and completely insignificant. This result is consistent with that observed in Table
2. That table showed a significant negative alpha on price momentum relative to the two
earnings momentum factor, but the price momentum tracking portfolio took large positions
in both earnings momentum factors, and incurring transaction costs on both these positions
was more expensive to trade. After accounting for trading costs the price momentum factor
and its tracking portfolio generate similar returns.
   While price momentum’s net performance is inside the span of the net earnings
momentum factors, Panel B shows that SUEnet is outside the span of UMDnet and CAR3net .
SUEnet earned highly significant returns over the sample (test-statistic of 3.40) even after
accounting for transaction costs, and had a highly significant alpha relative to the three
Fama and French factors and the other two momentum factors. This net performance was
positive, but not statistically significant, over the late half of the sample, covering 19 years.

or the earnings momentum factors, SUEnet and CAR3net, where these strategies are constructed using a
buy/hold spread to reduce turnover and transaction costs, and the explanatory factors are the returns to the
Fama and French factors (MKT, SMB, and HML), or these factors and the other two net return momentum

     Panel C shows that CAR3, which is more expensive to trade than SUE, and suffered
greater performance deterioration over time, generated statistically significant net returns
over the whole sample, but completely insignificant net returns over the second half of
the sample. Its abnormal returns relative to the Fama and French factors and the other
two momentum strategies were also insignificant over the whole sample, suggesting that
in practice CAR3 does not significantly improve the opportunity set for investors already
trading SUE.


5.1. A portfolio perspective

     Another way to quantify the potential value of momentum strategies to real investors is
to consider the potential Sharpe ratios that could have been achieved using the strategies.
Table 8 reports the portfolio weights in ex post mean-variance efficient portfolios of various
combinations of the momentum strategies and the three Fama and French factors. Panel
A provides full sample results. The first four specifications show that all three of the
momentum strategies have reasonably high Sharpe ratios over the sample, though this is

clearly highest for SUEnet, which is the only momentum strategy that realizes a higher net
Sharpe ratio over the sample than the 0.48 delivered by the market. They also show that
access to all three momentum strategies hardly improves the Sharpe ratio over that available
from SUEnet alone (0.57 vs. 0.55). The last five specifications show that adding any of the
momentum strategies to the opportunity set of an investor already trading the three Fama
and French factors yields significant Sharpe ration improvements (from 0.81 to from 0.98 to
0.16), but that including price momentum and the strategy based on CAR3 again yield only
marginal improvements above those realized from adding SUE alone (1.19 vs 1.16). Panel
B and C show consistent subsample results, and suggest that if anything these conclusions
have strengthened over time.



6    Past performance and future comovements
    While the previous sections demonstrate that past performance is not strongly
associated with cross sectional variation in average returns, at least after controlling for
earnings surprises, past performance is important for understanding the cross section of
realized returns. This is partly mechanical, as sorting on past performance is sorting, in
part, on covariances. Given two stocks that covary strongly, when one performs well the
other is also more likely to do so, so stocks that covary strongly are more likely to end
up in the winners’ portfolio together. Similarly, stocks that have negative market-residual
covariance are more likely to end up in opposite sides of a momentum strategy, because
when one outperforms the market the other is more likely to underperform, and vice-versa.
The relatively high average covariance of stocks in the winners’ (or losers’) portfolio, and
the relatively low average covariance between stocks in the winners’ and losers’ portfolios,
helps explain realized return variation.
    Figure 7 provides graphical evidence of these effects. Panel A shows the volatilities of
value-weighted portfolios obtained by decile sorting, using NYSE breaks, on the three
momentum characteristics, past performance (r2;12 ), standardized unexpected earnings

B shows the portfolios’ loadings on the momentum factor constructed on the basis of the same

(SUE), and three day cumulative abnormal returns (CAR3). The portfolios sorted on
the return based variables, r2;12 and CAR3, exhibit volatilities that are U-shaped in the
portfolio number. This is unsurprising, as more volatile stocks are more likely to exhibit
large returns, positive or negative, and thus end up in the tail portfolios. In contrast, the
portfolios sorted on SUE exhibit a downward sloping volatility profile. Stocks that have
experienced growth in earnings per share appear, on average, less volatile.
   Panel B reports momentum loadings for each portfolio from four-factor time-series
regressions. These regressions include, as explanatory returns, the returns to the three Fama
and French factors, and the returns to the momentum factor based on the same sorting
characteristic used to construct test portfolio. The figure shows that the three different
momentum characteristics yield similar variation in the corresponding momentum factor
loadings across the portfolios.
   Panel C shows that despite the similar dispersion in momentum factor loadings, UMD
is far more important for explaining realized return variation in portfolios sorted on past
performance than the SUE or CAR3 factors are for explaining realized return variation in
portfolios sorted on earnings surprises. All three factors contribute more to explaining
the performance of the tail portfolios, which have larger momentum tilts, positive or
negative, than the portfolios in the middle. The figure shows, however, that even for
these tail portfolios the earnings momentum factors only contribute modestly to explaining
realized performance, increasing the return variation explained by the model in all cases
by less than 5%. This is primarily because the three-factor model performs relatively
well explaining these portfolios’ realized performance, explaining in excess of 85% of the
returns variation for even the extreme positive and negative surprise portfolios. UMD, in
contrast, is extremely important for explaining the variation in the extreme price momentum
portfolios. These portfolios experience much more return variation driven by comovement
among stocks with similar past performance. Including UMD as an explanatory factor
consequently increases the return variation explained by the model by almost 15% for the
extreme winner portfolio, and almost 25% for the extreme loser portfolio.

7. Conclusion
   Past performance predicts cross sectional variation in average stock returns because
strong past performance is a signal of positive moves in fundamentals. After controlling
for fundamentals, past performance does not provide significant additional information
regarding expected returns. Fundamentally, momentum is fundamental momentum.
   Past performance should not be ignored, however, when trading momentum.
Earnings momentum strategies constructed without regard for past price performance
take unintended, performance impairing, positions in price momentum.             Designing
earnings momentum strategies explicitly to avoid price momentum reduces the strategies’
volatilities, and eliminates their tendency to occasionally crash, without significantly
reducing expected returns. This results in higher Sharpe ratios and smaller drawdowns.
   Recent past performance may also provide an informative signal in other markets. A
similar phenomenon is observed with De Bondt and Thaler’s (1985) long run reversals.
Value and size explain the performance of stock market strategies based on long run
reversal, because stocks that have experienced long periods of underperformance tend to
have low valuations. Because of this correlation, poor long run past performance may also
signal value in markets in which direct measures of value are unavailable, e.g., markets
for assets that have no accounting variables that could be used to scale prices. Similarly,
in markets where fundamentals are not directly observable, or are difficult to quantify,
recent past performance helps signal fundamental innovations, or at least the markets’
interpretation of these innovations.
   Past performance is also important for understanding the cross section of realized
returns. Recent winners tend to perform strongly together, and poorly precisely when recent
losers perform strongly. These strong comovements introduce significant risk to strategies
that tilt toward price momentum, contributing volatility even when the strategies are well
diversified in names, and negative skew that exposes the strategies to large drawdowns.
Accounting for these tilts, when they are present, dramatically improves the explanatory
power that asset pricing models have explaining variation in realized returns.

SUE and CAR3 strategies’ underlying portfolios
   This table reports the average monthly excess returns of the portfolios underlying the earnings momentum
factors SUE and CAR3, and results of time-series regressions of the excess returns to these portfolios onto the
three Fama and French factors, MKT, SMB, and HML, and the price momentum factor, UMD. The portfolios
are constructed using either large or small capitalization stocks, defined as those with above and below median
NYSE market capitalization, and hold stocks ranked in the highest or lowest 30% by the earnings surprise
measure, also using NYSE breaks. Returns are value-weighted, and the sample covers January 1975 through
December 2012, dates determined by the data requirements for making the SUE and CAR3 strategies.

Appendix Table A4
Conditional strategies’ underlying portfolios, alternative construction
     This table reports the average monthly excess returns of the portfolios underlying the conditional
momentum factors UMDjSUE and SUEjr2;12 , and results of time-series regressions of the excess returns
to these portfolios onto the three Fama and French factors, MKT, SMB, and HML, and the price momentum
factor, UMD. The portfolios are constructed using either large or small capitalization stocks, defined as those
with above and below median NYSE market capitalization, and hold stocks ranked highest or lowest by
the primary sorting characteristic (r2;12 or SUE) from triples of stocks most closely matched on the other
characteristic. Returns are value-weighted, and the sample covers January 1975 through December 2012,
dates determined by the data requirements for making the SUE and CAR3 strategies.
