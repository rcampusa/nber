       Although   the tax reforms of the 1980s substantially lowered

the excess burden caused by high marginal tax rates, there were

also significant adverse effects on incentives to save and to

invest in business plant and equipment.

       Effective tax rates   on.   real capital gains and real net

interest income remain very high because the tax rules do not

recognize the difference between real and nominal magnitudes.
These high effective tax rates discourage personal saving. The

paper discusses a number of ways in which the tax law could be
modified to encourage more saving and less borrowing.

       Existing tax rules bias corporate decisions in favor of debt
finance relative to equity finance and in favor of investrents in

intangible assets (like advertising, consumer goodwill, and R and

D) relative to investments in plant and equipment. The paper

discusses the use of a cashflow corporate tax (with complete

expensing of investment and no deduction for interest payments)
as a way of remedying both of these biases in our current tax

law.

    Personal Saving. Business Investment, and Corporate Debt


                       Martin Feldstein*


    The tax reforms of the l980s achieved a remarkable reduction
of personal income tax rates.   Cutting the marginal tax rate from
the 70 percent rate at the start of the decade to 28 percent on

the investment income of the highest income taxpayers reduced the

associated deadweight loss to less than one—sixth of its previous

level. Even the smaller reduction of the top marginal tax rate on

personal services income from 50 percent to 28 percent reduced
the associated deadweight loss by nearly three-fourths.

     The restructuring of the personal income tax in the l980s is

testimony to the power of economic ideas.   Economists for decades
have emphasized the adverse effects of high marginal tax rates

and have advocated broader tax bases with lower marginal tax

rates. In the end, this key idea came to have widespread

bipartisan support in the Congress and in the Administration.
While it took strong political leaders to persuade the public of

the desirability of tax reform and imaginative staffs in the

Administration and in the Congress to invent the technical

gimmicks that made the final legislation acceptable to a

Congressional majority, the driving force behind the reform was
the basic economic insight that high marginal tax rates have

disproportionately large burdens.

I.   Adverse Effects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986

      As a result of political considerations, some provisions of

the Tax Reform Act of 1986 contain serious harmful effects of the

incentives to save and invest. Although the revenue effects of

reducting high marginal tax rates were balanced in part by
                                                              the

                                                       left some
deductibility of net nonmortgage interest, that still

though the total net revenue loss was relatively small and
                                               all tax rates or
easily have been offset by a small increase in
other modifications of tax rules, there was strong political

pressure to provide middle and lower income taxpayers with even
larger proportional tax reductions than those received by high
income taxpayers.     The legislation was therefore expanded to

include   a   massive increase in personal exemptions, an increase

that cost approximately $25 billion a year in lost revenue with

almost no effect on marginal tax rates. To keep the overall tax

bill revenue neutral, this revenue loss had to be offset by an
                                                          tax
equally large increase in corporate taxes. This corporate
increase was achieved by eliminating the investment tax credit

 and reducing depreciation allowances, changes that substantially

 reduced the incentive to invest in business plant and equipment.

       Even with the enlarged personal exemptions, the distribution

 of the tax reductions appeared to favor higher income taxpayers.

 This appearance was an illusion because the Treasury and the
                                               not take the
 Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation did
increased corporate tax into account in calculating the

distributional consequences of the legislation. Doing so would

have shown that the overall effect of the tax reform was to raise

the tax burden on higher income taxpayers (Feldstein,l988). The

tax bill was nevertheless modified to raise the tax burden of

higher income taxpayers by eliminating their IRA deductions,

capping pension contributions, imposing an extra tax on large

pension payouts, and, most importantly, by taxing realized

capital gains at the same tax rates as ordinary income.
     Because capital gains realizations are very sensitive to tax

rates (Feldstein, Slenrod and Yitzhaki, 1980; Lindsey, 1987),

this last change may not in the end lead to any increased tax

collections from higher income taxpayers.   It will undoubtedly
have the adverse effects of reducing the incentive to invest in

equities, encouraging the corporate use of debt finance, and

decreasing the overall efficiency of the capital market.

Ironically, ignoring the actual increase in the tax burden on

upper income taxpayers that resulted from the rise in the

corporate tax led to an increase in the capital gains tax rate
that will have serious adverse effects on the economy without

necessarily raising the tax paid by those high income
individuals.

     The tax reforms of the 1980s have succeeded in reducing

marginal tax rates and eliminating the personal tax shelters.

The tax reforms of the 1990s are likely to focus on improving the

taxation of capital income to increase saving, to improve the

allocation of total capital formation and to reduce

incentive for excess use of corporate debt.



II.   Insufficient Saving

      The United States has long had one of the lowest saving

rates in the world and a rate that falls far short of equating

the social rate of return on additional capital and the

              increased availability of home equity loans and

 other forms of consumer credit, and the reduced number of

 underfunded private pensions.   But taxes are clearly an important
 reason for our chronically low saving rate and one that can be

reversed by changes in policy. While some skeptics express doubts

about the potential effects of tax rules on private saving, the

research of a large number of careful scholars
                                                [including Boskin
(1978), Summers (1981), and Venti and Wise (1987)] confirms that

personal saving does respond to changes in effective tax rates
and after—tax rates of return.

     Despite the sharp reductions in statutory tax rates, the
effective tax rates on the return to saving remain very
                                                        high
because existing tax rules fail to distinguish real and nominal

rates of return. Consider a taxpayer who earns a 9

                                                   average 5
percent during the life of the bond.     His expected pretax real
return is thus 4 percent.   If the taxpayer has a 28 percent

marginal federal income tax rate and a 5 percent state income tax

rate, he faces a combined marginal tax rate that takes one third
of his nominal 9 percent return. His after tax nominal rate of

return is therefore only 6 percent.     With   a   5 percent expected

inflation, the real after tax return is only 1 percent.
     Thus taxes reduce the real return to 1 percent from 4

percent because the tax law does not correctly distinguish
between real interest income and the payments that just offset

the inflationary erosion of the debt.    Although the combined

fluctuations, let alone to provide an incentive to save.      It is
not surprising that individuals have been net sellers of

corporate equities.
     The failure to distinguish real and nominal interest also

reduces the net cost of mortgage borrowing and other consumer

debt. An individual who borrows at 12 percent faces a 7 percent

real cost of funds before tax but only a 3 percent net—of-tax

cost of funds.

     The most obvious remedy for these defects in the tax
treatment of capital income is to adjust the measurement of

capital gains and of interest, including interest on consumer

borrowing and mortgage debt, to reflect the difference between
nominal and real interest rates. Administrative complexity and

the inability to adjust for inflation with complete precision do
not result in as much economic loss as a tax system that grossly

mismeasures real taxable income and dramatically reduces the net

incentive to save.    Moreover, if fully implemented, these

adjustments for inflation would actually increase total tax
revenue.

     The current taxation of capital income would of course still

reduce the incentive to save even if real capital income and

expenses were measured perfectly.    A   consumption tax or consumed—
income tax that excluded all savings from the tax base would

eliminate this distortion. Although such a consumed—income tax

might be chosen over an ordinary income tax in the initial design
of a new national tax system, there are formidable problems of

 rate to the interest rate on government bonds.
III.    Misallocated Investment and Excessive Debt

       The current system of taxing corporate income leads to a

misallocation of total investment and potentially destabilizing

levels of corporate debt.    Although the 1986 elimination of the
investment tax credit and decrease in depreciation allowances

were advocated as ways of "levelling the playing field" among

different types of business investments, the net effect of these

changes was to increase the tax bias against investments in
business plant and equipment in favor of investments in owner

occupied housing and in corporate intangible assets like

advertising, customer cjLdwill, manpower training, and research
and development that can be expensed at the time of investment.

This tax distortion leads to   a   misallocation of capital that

reduces the level of real income and the rate of economic growth.


       Tax rules distort the composition of corporate finance   a
well as the composition of business investment.      For many years

economists were puzzled by the failure of corporations to respond

to the strong tax incentives to use debt and to substitute share

repurchases for dividend payments. Debt is a lower cost source of

finance because interest payments are deductible in calculating

taxable profits. Share repurchases involve a lower tax burden on

shareholders because the cost of the stock is subtracted in

calculating the taxable gain and, until recently, that gain was
taxed at lower rates than dividend income. In recent years,

practice has caught up with theory, helped in part by the new
financial technology of junk bonds and the favorable initial

experience of large leveraged buyout funds.
     Now there is increasing concern that the tax distortion in

favor of debt is creating an excessive volume of LBOs and an

undesirably high level of debt. The Federal Reserve and others
have indicated concern that high debt levels that may be

privately optimal could cause substantial economy—wide problems
if high interest rates or a severe recession caused widespread

defaults.   While it is difficult to assess these risks, there is

no doubt that the current tax rules provide a strong bias in

favor of debt finance.

     The concern about excessive debt has recently led to

proposals to limit the deduction of interest by highly leveraged
corporations or on debt assumed in LBO transactions. There are
clear practical difficulties in distinguishing LBO5 from the

ordinary acquisitions that are a constant part of corporate

growth. Attempts to restrict interest deductibility is likely to
transfer borrowing to companies that currently have low debt—

 equity ratios or to foreign companies. In the end, such
 restrictions are unlikely to limit the substitution of share

 repurchases for dividends and will do little or nothing to reduce
 overall debt finance.

      One way to reduce the existing tax bias in favor of debt and

 the incentive for LBO share repurchases would be to replace the

 current corporate income tax with a cash—flow corporate income

bias that currently exists against investment in plant and

equipment relative to outlays on advertising and other forms of

"intangible capital" and to investments in owner—occupied

housing.
     The cash—flow corporate income tax can be implemented by two

changes from the current corporate income tax: eliminating the

deductibility of interest expenses (thus treating them like

dividends) and permitting an immediate write-off of all
investments in plant and equipment (thus treating such

investments like all other business costs). As King (1988) notes,

eliminating the deductibility of interest expenses is equivalent
to continuing the interest deduction but including net borrowing

as a taxable receipt. This establishes that the cash-flow

corporate income tax is equivalent to taxing the difference
between all cash receipts (other than from the sale of new

equity) and all cash payments (other than the payment of

dividends).
     Because outlays on plant and equipment are expensed under a

cash flow corporate tax in the same way as outlays for

advertising, training and other current costs, the bias against
investments in fixed capital is eliminated. The cash-flow

corporate income tax simultaneously solves the problems of
misallocated corporate investment and excess corporate debt. The

revenue loss from periniting all investment to be expenses would

be balanced by eliminating the deductibility of interest; any

remaining revenue difference could be made up by a small change

                                11
inthe corporate tax rate.
:IV   Conclusion

       The new administration has the opportunity to focus on tax

reform aimed at strengthening capital formation.   If they are

siccessful, the United States will have a higher level of saving,
more investment in plant and equipment, and less reliance on

corporate debt.
