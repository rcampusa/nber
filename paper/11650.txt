       ABSTRACT

       A Melitz-style model of monopolistic competition with heterogeneous firms is
       integrated into a simple New Economic Geography model to show that the
       standard assumption of identical firms is neither necessary nor innocuous. We
       show that re-locating to the big region is most attractive for the most productive
       firms; this implies interesting results for empirical work and policy analysis. A
       ‘selection effect’ means standard empirical measures overestimate agglomeration
       economies. A ‘sorting effect’ means that a regional policy induces the highest
       productivity firms to move to the core while the lowest productivity firms to move
       to the periphery. We also show that heterogeneity dampens the home market
       effect.

1. INTRODUCTION
One of the great contributions of the new economic geography (NEG) is to explicitly model
“the self-reinforcing character of spatial concentration” (Fujita, Krugman and Venables 1999
p.4). The early work in this literature, e.g. Krugman (1991), and Venables (1996), achieved
this with a modelling approach – Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition – that ignored many
important aspects of locational economics. An intense effort by theorists over the past decade
has broadened the modelling to allow for many important effects, much of this relies on the
monopolistic competition framework of Ottaviano, Tabuchi and Thisse (2002). See Fujita and
Thisse (2002) for a succinct synthesis of this work.
One of the most convenient, but least realistic assumptions in the new economic geography
(NEG) literature is that of identical firms. An extensive empirical literature shows that firms
vary enormously in terms of size (Cabral and Mata 2003) as well as in terms of productivity
and trade behaviour (Bernard, Jensen and Schott 2003, Helpman, Melitz and Yeaple 2004).
Our paper argues that this ‘assumption of convenience’ is neither necessary nor innocuous in
NEG models. A more recent empirical literature suggests that big plants are more likely to be

Selection and Sorting                                                                              2

found in clustered in areas that are specialised in a particular sector (Lafourcadey and Mionz
2003, Alsleben 2005).
We show how a Melitz (2003) style model of monopolistic competition with heterogeneous
firms can be integrated into a simple NEG setting. We use the model to demonstrate that
relaxing the standard assumption of homogenous firms has several important implications –
all of which turn on the fact that re-locating to the big region is most attractive for the most
productive firms.

Intuition for spatial selection
Before turning to the implications, we provide intuition for why spatial selection occurs in our
model, i.e. why firms that move to large markets tend to have above-average productivity. In
most NEG models, the spatial equilibrium occurs at a degree of spatial concentration where
the agglomeration forces balance the dispersion forces. In simple NEG models, the
agglomeration forces consist of backward and forward linkages, while the dispersion force
consists of local competition (also called market crowding). Highly productive firms are
systematically subject to greater agglomeration forces and weaker dispersion forces than are
less productive firms. Because more productive firms have lower marginal costs, they tend to
sell more so the backward and forward linkages operating in the bigger market are
systematically more attractive to the most efficient firms. Likewise these firms’ high
productivity also means that they are systematically less harmed by the higher degree of local
competition in the big market. Plainly, then the delocation of firms from a small region to a
large region will involve spatial selection as far as firm-level productivity is concerned. The
most productive firms will move to the big market first.

Implications
The first implication is a cautionary tale for empirical researchers. Since relocation is a non-
random process, a ‘selection effect’ plagues standard empirical techniques for measuring
agglomeration economies. We sign the bias, showing that standard techniques will
overestimate the importance of agglomeration economies since firms that move to the
agglomerated region have above average firm-level productivity independently of any
agglomeration economies.
The second concerns the impact of regional policy. Most regional policies aim to increase the
share of industry in periphery regions. Taking production subsidies as an example, we show
that regional policies tend to attract the least productive firms since they have the lowest
opportunity cost of leaving the agglomerated region (or not moving there in the first place).
The result is a ‘sorting effect’. A policy that succeeds in increasing the periphery region’s
share of industry will induce the highest productivity firms to move to the core and the lowest
productivity firms to move to the periphery. This sorting has several implications for policy.
For example, it may explain why modest production subsidies have very little impact on
regional welfare. Small subsidies attract few firms and all of these are intrinsically inefficient.

1.1. Previous literature
Our paper is not the first to consider selection effects in a model with heterogeneous firms.
For example, Melitz and Ottaviano (2003) and Melitz (2003), among others consider selection
in the sense of the elimination of the least efficient firms within a nation. These papers,
however, ruled out the possibility of spatial relocation by fiat. Our paper concerns a very
different aspect of selection, namely the spatial dimension of selection.
Selection and Sorting                                                                               3

This distinction between national selection and spatial matters when it comes to our primary
contribution – the idea that standard econometric techniques for measuring agglomeration
economies overestimate the strength of these forces. One observes a correlation between
geographical clustering of firms and high average productivity. But which causes which? On
one hand, it may be that the big market makes firms more productive (agglomeration
economies); on the other hand, it may be that the geographical gathering of the most
productive firms raises big market’s average productivity (spatial selection). Here is an
example of why this distinction matters. If the cluster-productivity correlation is due to
agglomeration economies, a nation can raise the total output of its productive factors by
encouraging spatial clustering. However, if the correlation is due to spatial selection, a pro-
clustering policy merely fosters spatial inequality.

1.1.1 Melitz and Ottaviano (2003)
This paper marries the Ottaviano, Tabuchi and Thisse (2002) framework (OTT for short) of
monopolistic competition in a linear demand system (assuming zero inter-regional mobility of
factors) with the Melitz-Hopenhayn mechanism for the development of firms, each associated
with a particular labour input coefficient (i.e. marginal cost). The Melitz-Hopenhayn
mechanism assumes a continuous drawing of new firms (since firms are continuously dying
according to a Poisson process) from the underlying distribution G[a], with support [0..a0];
this yields a mass of potential firms nG[a], but only the most efficient find it worthwhile to
actually producing.
Specifically, firms that have marginal costs above the demand curve intersection will not
sell/produce anything (firms are atomistic and so take the intercept as given even though it is
endogenous in the aggregate; greater competition lowers the intercept). In short, competition
truncates the distribution of marginal costs at some point, call it aD, so only firms with
marginal costs less than aD actually produce; the unlucky innovators who drew a’s greater
than aD let bygones be bygones, realizing ex post that they have wasted their fixed innovation
costs. The mass of active firms rises to the point where the ex ante expected profits from
getting an ‘a’ less than aD just balances the ex ante expected loss of getting an a>aD, taking
proper account of the fixed innovation costs. See Figure 1, but ignore aX for the moment.
As usual in the linear demand system of OTT framework, a bigger market supports more
firms and tougher competition. Thus the truncation point is lower (i.e. a wider range of
inefficient firms are eliminated) in bigger markets. This is a new agglomeration force that
Melitz-Ottaviano (MO) have found – one that stems from the combination of heterogeneous
firms and the standard pro-competitive effect that arises in OTT (but not in the Dixit-Stiglitz
setting). In short, the cluster-productivity correlation in MO due only to agglomeration
economies, i.e. the big market makes the average firm more productive by expanding
production of the most efficient firms and eliminating the worst firms.
To highlight the difference between the MO paper and our own, consider the following
thought experiment. Suppose there are two such nations that are fundamentally different in
size and they begin to trade but trade is costly. Since trade is costly, the effective marginal
cost of selling in the export market is higher, so there will be some firms that find it worth
their while to sell locally, but not to export (call these D-type firms), while others – the most
efficient firms – find it worth their while to export (call these X-types). Referring to the
threshold, maximum marginal cost for X-types as aX, we see that market size will matter. In
particular aX will be higher in the big market (since they are exporting to the smaller market
with weaker competition). See Figure 1.

Now imagine we allowed firms to relocate in the MO framework. The equilibrium outcome is
complex, but it is absolutely obvious that some firms would move (see the appendix for
details). To take the easiest example, there is a range of varieties that are ‘lying fallow’ in the
big market but which would have positive value in the small market (i.e. these varieties have
been developed and could produce if conditions were right).
Of course the relocation will itself change all the thresholds and the mass of active firms, but
our basic point is that relocation would change things. MO assumed away relocation because,
presumably, they wanted to focus the international trade aspects (the main axis of the
heterogeneous-firms trade models).

1.1.2 Nocke (2003)
Most of the paper is spent establishing that the Hopenhayn mechanism and imperfect
competition produce the basic within-nation truncation results that are familiar from
heterogeneous-firms literature. The big difference between Nock and Melitz (2003) is that
Nocke assumes that the process generates new entrepreneurs and these are without
geographical location in the sense that new entrepreneurs find it equally costly to locate in
any market after they know their efficiency, whereas the Melitz and MO models firms are tied
to the nation in which they are created.
There are four main differences between Nocke (2003) and our paper. First, Nocke explicitly
states (p.12) that his sorting result will not go through when consumers have a CES utility
function as in the Dixit-Stiglitz model of monopolistic competition. We work with Dixit-
Stiglitz monopolistic competition and do show a spatial selection effect and sorting with
subsidies. This is not a critique of Nocke but rather prima facie evidence that his paper and
ours are quite different. Second, Nocke assumes that heterogeneity is associated with
‘entrepreneurs’, i.e. people, not firms. For this reason, his sorting result has been viewed as
belonging to the migration-sorting literature. Third, Nocke works in a partial equilibrium
setting (e.g., no resource constraints, no wage determination). Fourth, the entrepreneurs in
Selection and Sorting                                                                             5

Nocke never consider the local price index when choosing location, even though comparison
of real rewards is standard in the international trade and economic geography literature. Again
this is not a critique, but it does show that he is working in a model where things are held
constant that cannot be held constant in Economic Geography models. In summary, there is
no doubt that Nocke (2003) presents sorting results similar to ours, but his paper is really
quite different.

1.1.3 Spatial selection models
A number of papers in the theoretical literature study various forms of heterogeneity in
economic geography models. Tabuchi and Thisse (2002) investigate the impact of
heterogeneous tastes for living in various regions. They show that this location-taste-
heterogeneity acts as a strong dispersion force and removes the unrealistic, bang-bang
predictions of the early NEG models.
Amiti and Pissarides (2002) also model heterogeneous labour but the heterogeneity concerns
idiosyncratic worker characteristics rather than locational preferences. Since workers are
idiosyncratic, workers and firms cannot know how good of a ‘match’ they will make ex ante.
The quality of the match is assumed to affect worker productivity, so a ‘thick market
externality’ arises and acts as an agglomeration force in the spirit of Marshall’s labour-
market-pooling. Another paper in this line is Coniglio (2001). This paper allows for high and
low skilled workers and assumes that skill premium is an increasing function of the number of
high-skilled workers in a region (the implicit story is one of knowledge spillovers). Combes,
Duraton and Gobillon (2004) use micro data to show that worker heterogeneity is important
and that workers appear to sort themselves geographically. They make the point that failing to
control for heterogeneity among workers can bias estimates of agglomeration economies
upward.
Heterogeneity among workers and its importance for economic geography is quite clear as the
empirical literature and migrant self-selection demonstrates (Borjas, Bronars, Trejo. 1992, and
Chiswick 1999). However, at least in Europe, labour mobility is fairly limited both within and
especially between nations, so labour heterogeneity is unlikely to be the only form of
heterogeneity that is relevant to agglomeration.
Without denying the importance of labour heterogeneity for many forms of agglomeration,
we focus on a complementary form of heterogeneity, namely firm-level productivity
differences. We believe that this form of heterogeneity may be especially important for
aspects of economic geography where labour mobility is not a key factor, but it probably
operates even in situations where labour mobility is high. Moreover, as pointed out above,
firm-level productivity differences have been well documented and are very large. Our paper
is a first step in studying the economic geography implications of such heterogeneity.
Dupont and Martin (2003) study the impact of subsidies in a NEG setting with homogeneous
firms. They show that the impact on location of such subsidies is stronger when trade is freer
due to home market magnification effect. They also study the income distribution effects
finding that although subsidies “constitute an official financial transfer from the rich to the
poor region, they actually lead to an income transfer from the poor to the rich region” in
certain cases.
The rest of the paper is organised in 4 sections. Section 2 presents the basic model, Section 3
demonstrates the ‘selection effect’ and points out its implications for empirical work, Section
4 demonstrates the ‘sorting effect’ of production subsidies and Section 5 presents our
concluding remarks.

2. THE BASIC MODEL
This section introduces a simple new economic geography (NEG) model with heterogeneous
firms.
The model can be thought of as the familiar NEG model of Martin and Rogers (1995) – also
known as the footloose capital model, or FC model for short – extended to allow for
exogenous heterogeneity in firms’ marginal costs. The heterogeneity in our model is akin to
the heterogeneity in Melitz (2003) but the firm generation and selection process is radically
simplified in so as to concentrate attention on the spatial aspects of the model.

2.1. The footloose capital model with heterogeneous firms
The FC model assumes a fixed stock of firms in order to spotlight the location effects of freer
trade.2 It achieves this by assuming that the fixed-cost element for each differentiated variety
involves a single unit of capital. Each nation’s overall number of varieties/firm is thus pinned
down by its capital endowment. We follow this tradition but add exogenous heterogeneity.

2.1.1 Basic set up
As in the standard FC model, we assume two regions, two sectors and two factors. The factors
– physical capital K and labour L – are inelastically supplied in each region; capital is
assumed to be inter-regionally mobile, while labour is immobile. The regions – referred to as
the north and the south – are symmetric in terms of tastes, technology and openness to trade.
They are also endowed with the same relative factor supplies, but the north is larger in a pure
sense, i.e. its endowment of labour and capital are proportionally larger than the south’s. This
rules out Hechscher-Ohlin motives for trade and thus allows us to concentrate more precisely
on agglomeration forces.
The two sectors are manufacturing and an outside good, refereed to as ‘agriculture’ for
convenience. The agricultural sector is kept as simple as possible. It produces a homogeneous
good using only labour under constant returns and perfect competition; its output is traded
costlessly.
Manufacturing is marked by increasing returns, Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition and
iceberg trade costs. The cost function of a typical manufacturing firm in the FC model is non-
homothetic; the fixed cost involves only capital and the variable cost involves only labour.
Specifically, each manufacturing firm requires one unit of K and ‘a’ units of labour per unit of
output. This means that the increasing returns sector is intensive in the use of the mobile
factor, as in most NEG models.
Capital owners are immobile across regions, so when pressures arise to concentrate
manufacturing in one region, physical capital moves but its reward is repatriated to its country
of origin.
Because physical capital can be separated from its owners, the region in which capital’s
income is spent may differ from the region in which it is employed. We must therefore
distinguish the share of world capital owned by northern residents (we denote this as
sK≡K/Kw) from the share of world capital employed in the north. Because we assume that


2
See Baldwin, Forslid, Martin, Ottaviano and Robert-Nicoud, 2003, Chapter 3 for a complete analysis of this
model and comparison to other NEG models in core-periphery tradition (i.e. those based on Dixit-Stiglitz
monopolistic competition) and to NEG models based on the OTT monopolistic competition framework.
Selection and Sorting                                                                                           7

each manufacturing variety requires one unit of capital, the share of the world capital stock
employed in a region exactly equals the region’s share of world manufacturing. Consequently,
we can use north’s manufacturing share, i.e. sn≡n/(n+n*), to represent the share of capital
employed in the north.
The tastes of the representative consumer in each region are quasi-linear:
                                                                 1 /( 1-1/σ )
           U = µ ln C M + C A , C M ≡ ⎛⎜ ∫ ci            di ⎞⎟
                                                 1-1/σ
                                                                                , 0 < µ <1<σ
                                       ⎝ i∈Θ                 ⎠
where CM and CA are, respectively, consumption of the composite of M-sector varieties and
consumption of the A-sector good, and σ is the constant elasticity of substitution between any
two M-sector varieties; Θ is the set of all varieties produced. This set of varieties is pre-
determined by endowments since each variety requires a unit of capital and the world capital
stock is fixed.
Since capital moves without its owners, capital moves in search of the highest nominal reward
rather than the highest real reward since its income is spent in the owner’s region regardless
of where the capital is employed (here nominal means the reward in terms of the numeraire;
real means the reward in terms the ideal price index).
We extend the FC model in two ways; we add heterogeneity in firms’ marginal production
costs and we assume firms face quadratic adjustment cost when switching regions.

2.1.2 Additional assumptions: firm heterogeneity and delocation costs
Following Melitz (2003), we allow firms to have different unit input coefficients, i.e. different
a’s. One of the major contribution of Melitz (2003) is to endogenise the distribution of firm-
level productivity and characterise the influence of that openness has on it. For our purposes,
however, we are not fundamentally interested in the overall distribution of firm-level
productivity; we are interested in how agglomeration and policy affects its geographic
distribution.3
To focus on these goals, we take the distribution of firm-level efficiency as part of each
region’s endowment. Since each firm is associated with a particular unit of capital, it is
natural to assign the source of heterogeneity to capital. We assume that each unit of capital in
each region is associated with a particular level of productive efficiency as measured by the
unit labour requirement, ‘a’. The distribution assumed is Pareto:

                        aρ
(1)         G[a] = (         ρ
                                 ),   1 ≡ a 0 ≥ a ≥ 0, ρ ≥ 1
                        a0
where a0<∞ is the scale parameter (highest possible marginal cost) and ρ is shape parameter.
Since we are free to choose units of M-sector goods, we can normalise a0 to unity without loss
of generality. Note that unlike the Melitz model, all of our firms sell in both markets as long
as trade costs are finite since we do not allow for ‘beachhead market-entry costs’ as in Melitz
(2003).4


3
  We have explored the FC model with a full-blown Melitz model, but found the results were qualitatively
identical but the reasoning was much less transparent. The one extra result concerns the fact that some firms with
fairly high marginal costs may cease to sell to both regions after they move to the big region.
4
  Melitz (2003) assumes that firms must incur a fixed cost to establish a ‘beachhead’ in a market, i.e. to sell in
that market, so only sufficiently efficient firms sell in both markets.
Selection and Sorting                                                                                                                    8

Second, we deviate from the FC model in that we assume that relocation is subject to
quadratic adjustment costs. In particular, the cost of switching regions is χ units of labour per
firm, where χ depends upon the flow of firms relocating. The specific assumption is:
(2)         χ =γm
where m is the flow of migrating firms. This means that in steady state, when all delocation
has ceased, the migration costs are zero on the margin.

2.2. Intermediate results and short run equilibrium
Results for the A sector in this sort of model are simple and well known. Constant returns,
perfect competition and zero trade costs equalise nominal wage rates across regions. We
choose units of A and the numeraire such that w=w*=1. This means that all differences in M-
firms’ marginal costs are due to differences in their a’s.
Utility maximisation generates the familiar CES demand functions.5 These, together with the
standard Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition assumptions on market structure imply ‘mill
pricing’ is optimal and that operating profit earned by a typical firm in a typical market is 1/σ
times firm-level revenue.6 Accordingly, operating profit realised by a south-based firm is:

  Individual demand for a typical variety j is c(j)=p(j)-σµ/∆, where ∆≡ ∫p(i)1-σdi and the integral is over all
available varieties, µ is expenditure on all varieties.
6
  A typical first order condition is p(1-1/σ)=wa; rearranging, the operating profit, (p-wa)c, equals pc/σ.
7
  To go from the denominator of the CES demand function defined in terms of an integral over goods to one
defined in terms of an integral of marginal costs, we use the density of a’s in each nation, namely K times G[a]
for north and K* times G[a] for south. The support in both cases is the unit interval.
Selection and Sorting                                                                                            9

when no firms have relocated to the north. Here Kw is world endowment of K, which is also
the mass of varieties produced worldwide; sK is the share varieties produced in the north since
K and K* are the north’s and south’s capital endowments, respectively.
Solving the integrals, using (1) and assuming 1-σ+ρ>0 (so the integrals converge) we have:8

                                                                                  ρ

Intuition. Notice that the deltas can be viewed as a measure of the degree of competition in
each market. For example, ∆ increases with sK since an increase in the share of varieties that
are locally produced (as opposed to imported) means more varieties are sold without trade
costs and this intensifies competition in the local market.9 Likewise, a1-σ can be viewed as the
competitiveness of a firm with marginal cost ‘a’, since this rises as its marginal cost fall.
Combining these points, we see that a firm’s market share – which equals a1-σ/∆Kw in the
north – depends upon its relative competitiveness (if all firms had the same marginal cost, the
market share of each firm would be 1/Kw). Alternatively, we can view the firm’s market
share, a1-σ/∆Kw, as varying with the ratio of its marginal cost to a weighted average of its
competitors’ marginal costs.

2.3. Delocation tendencies
Starting from the initial situation where no firms have moved, we turn now to considering the
delocation tendency of firms. The standard logic of the Home Market Effect (HME) tells us
that the big market (north) will have a more than proportional share of industry. In the
traditional FC model, the implications of this are completely captured by the share of industry
in the big market. But when firms are heterogeneous, an additional question arises. Which
firms delocate first?
To work this out, we start from a situation where no delocation has occurred, so sn=sK (i.e. the
north’s share of industry exactly matches its share of capital). Since firms are atomistic, the
change in operating profit from a single firm moving from south to north (small region to big)
is of function of it the firm’s marginal cost, ‘a’, namely:10
                                                ⎛ sE 1 − sE           ⎞ Ew
(6)                     π [a] − π * [a] = a 1−σ ⎜ ( −       )(1 − φ ) ⎟
                                                ⎝ ∆    ∆*             ⎠ σK
                                                                           w


Starting from the initial situation where no firms have moved, so sn=sK and using the
symmetry of region’s relative factor endowments i.e. sE=sK>½, (6) simplifies to:
                                                           1
                                                 2φ ( s − )
                                (1 − φ ) Ew
                                                           2
                        a 1−σ (            )
                                 λσ K w ((1 − φ ) s + φ )(1 − s + φs )
where ‘s’ is the north’s share of world E and K (i.e., s≡sE=sK>½).
There are three key features of this expression. First, the term in large brackets is positive
since north is larger, so it is clear that every southern firm would gain from being the first to

8
  Since firms are atomistic, the first firm to move has no impact on the ∆’s.
9
  Note that price-cost markets are always fixed with Dixit-Stiglitz competition, so the ‘local competition’ effect
might more precisely be called the ‘market crowding’ effect since higher local competition results in lower sales
per firm with no change in the markup.

delocate from south to north. Second, no northern firm would gain from moving south. Third,
the size of the gain for south-to-north migration is greatest for the most efficient firms.

2.3.1 Which firms move first?
It is intuitively obvious that the first firms that will find it profitable to pay the quadratic
delocation costs will be those that have the most to gain, namely the most efficient southern
firms.11 The movement of efficient southern firms to the bigger market in the north changes
the degree of competition in the two markets, that is to say, the ∆’s are affected by delocation.
To work out the feedback between migration and the ∆’s, we define the threshold level of
marginal costs for migration as aR where the ‘R’ stands for ‘relocate’. We shall provide the
condition characterising this cut-off level, but taking it as given for the moment, we note that
the migration of the most efficient southern firms to the north will change the equilibrium ∆
and ∆*. Specifically:
                    1                               aR                        1
           ∆ = s ∫ a 1−σ dG[a ] + (1 − s ){∫ a 1−σ dG[a ] + φ ∫ a 1−σ dG[a ]},
                    0                              0                          aR
                         1                                 aR                      1
           ∆* = φs ∫ a 1−σ dG[a ] + (1 − s ){φ ∫ a 1−σ dG[a ] + ∫ a 1−σ dG[a ]};                           Kw ≡1
                        0                                  0                       aR


The first expression reflects the north’s degree of local competition. The first term in the top
expression reflects the prices of north-made varieties sold in the north; the ‘s’ in front of the
integral reflects the north’s share of K, namely sK, but by symmetry of relative endowments
sK equals the relative size of the north’s market, i.e. ‘s’.12 The second expression reflects the
prices of southern firms’ varieties that are produced in the north. To understand this, recall
that southern firms with a’s in the range [0,aR] have relocated and thus become north-based
firms. The third expression reflects the prices of southern varieties that are made in the south
and exported to the northern market. The second expression is the isomorphic formula for the
southern market. We have normalised Kw=1 to lighten the notation.
Solving the integrals using (1):

                               (
                        ∆ = λ s + (1 − s )aR

                                                                                              ),
                                   (                                                                   )

Given these expressions that link the ∆’s to the range of firms that have migrated, namely aR,
we can write the value of delocation for any atomistic southern firm as a function of its own
marginal cost and the range of firms that have already moved. Specifically:

(8)                     v[a, a R ] ≡ π [a, a R ] − π * [a, a R ]
where




11
   More formally, note that all atomistic southern firms would want to move first if the delocation cost were zero.
However, if all tried to move at the same time, the flow of migrants would be infinite and so the quadratic
delocation costs would also be infinite. This tells us that some, but not all firms will want to be the first to move.
Suppose that the flow of firms, call it ‘z’, is positive and finite. Then the quadratic adjustment cost would also be
positive and finite. Consequently, only sufficiently efficient southern firms would want to move. This explains
more formally, the claim made in the text.
12
   Recall that we have cancelled price-marginal cost markups, so the a’s reflect the prices.

Turning from the benefits of relocation to the costs, note that the stock of southern firms in
                                                                                 ρ −1
the north is K*aRρ, given (1). Thus the flow of migrating firms is m = K * ρaR a& R , where the
‘dot’ indicates a time derivative as usual. Given this and (2), the cost of moving is:

(9)                     χ = γK * ρaR ρ −1a& R

Equilibrium delocation process
Profit maximising firms will delocate if the benefit of doing so is greater than or equal to the
costs. Thus, during the transition to the long-run steady state, firms will move in order of
rising marginal costs. In particular, the ‘a’ of migrating firms is at any instant is pinned down
by the equality of the cost and benefit of migrating, so the value to the marginal firm of
migrating will be v[aR,aR], which we write as v[aR] for short. Using (8) and (9), this means:
                                                        ρ −1
(10)                                v[aR ] = γK * ρaR      a& R
This describes the delocation process fully. Because v[aR] is declining in aR, as inspection of
(7) confirms, the transitional delocation process is stable and converges to the long-run steady
state level aR’ as shown in Figure 2.

The intuition for the transitional process is straightforward. Since the most efficient firms
move first, progressive delocation reduces competition in the southern market and raises it in
the northern market. As long as trade is not too free, the process will stop at some
intermediate level of delocation, which we call aR’. To summary we write:

Result 1: The first firms to delocation from the small region (south) to the large region
(north) are the most efficient small-region firms.

2.4. The location condition: long run equilibrium
The key variable to determine in the long run equilibrium is the cut-off level of marginal cost,
aR’. To characterise this, we note that when the firm migration has stopped, marginal
Selection and Sorting                                                                                            12

adjustment costs are zero. Thus the long-run equilibrium satisfies the location condition
v[aR]=0. The long run aR can be solved for analytically using (8). It is:

                           (1 − φ )(1 − s)
where sn is the share of all firms in the big region. Note that aR rises with φ and this means
that ever more inefficient firms find it profitable to delocate as trade gets freer. Note also that
as in the traditional FC model, the share of firms in the big region rises as trade gets freer and
reaches unity before trade is costless. Finally, note that full agglomeration occurs when φ
equals or exceeds the sustain point, which is:

                                    1− s
(12)                     φ CP =
                                     s
Note that the φCP here is exactly the same φCP as in the standard FC model (see Baldwin et al
2003, Chapter 3).

Result 2: The maximum marginal cost of firms that find delocation profitable rises as
trade gets freer. Full agglomeration occurs at the same level of trade openness as in the
FC model without heterogeneity, namely at φCP =(1-s)/s.
Interestingly, this means is that heterogeneity by itself does not affect the balance of
agglomeration forces and dispersion forces in this model when trade is sufficiently free or
restricted. Indeed, when measuring delocation in terms of the value of world production in the
big market the heterogeneity does not the degree of agglomeration at any level of openness. It
is easy to show that the share of production that has moved to the large market is13:
                                                     s − 1/ 2
(13)                                  s n = s + 2φ
                                                      1−φ
This implication leads immediately to the next result concerning the degree of agglomeration
measured in terms of the share of firms in the big market. When trade costs are at an
intermediate level of free-ness fewer firms will have moved from the south to the north. The
reason is simple and can be seen by considering a small increase in openness from an
intermediate level. The extra openness makes the larger northern market more attractive, so
some firms must move northwards to restore equality of profitability. Because the first firms
to delocate in this are the most efficient, they have an above average impact on the degree of
competition in the two regions. As a consequence, fewer firms need to move to restore the
balance of profitability in the two regions. Using (11) and the equivalent expression for sn in
the FC model, which is s+2φ(s-½)/(1-φ), we have:
                                                                                        ρ
                                             2φ      1       ⎛ 2φ s − 1 / 2 ⎞        1− σ + ρ
                                   − sn =       ( s − )(1 − ⎜⎜ (            ⎟⎟
                              FC
(14)                     sn                                       )                             )
                                            1−φ      2       ⎝ 1−φ 1− s ⎠

  Sales to the northern market of northern firms and southern firms located in the north are λs/∆ and λ (1-s)A/∆
respectively, while their sales to the southern market are φλs/∆ and φλ(1-s)A/∆, respectively. Weighting each of
these four levels of sales by the relevant market sizes (by s or 1-s) and adding the terms yields the expression in
the text after some simplification.

Note that as long as φ is less that φCP, i.e. as long as some firms are in both regions, this
quantity is positive. To summarise, we write:

Result 3: Heterogeneity of firm-level productivity does not change the share of world
production that moves to the big region compared to the standard FC model with
homogeneous firms. However, when measuring agglomeration in terms of the number of
firms, heterogeneity can be thought of as a dispersion force in the sense that a smaller
share of firms will have delocated from the small to big region for any intermediate level
of trade free-ness.
and

Result 4: Heterogeneity dampens the HME (defined in terms of the share of firms) for
intermediate levels of trade cost, but has no impact on the HME defined in terms of the
share of production.

2.5. Spatial selection
The preceding analysis shows how the introduction of heterogeneous firms into an economic
geography framework can be used to crystallise thinking about spatial selection effects.
What we showed can be thought of as a refinement on the usual HME. The standard HME
states that when delocation is allowed, firms are attracted to the big market to such an extent
that the big market ends up with a share of manufacturing firms that more than proportional to
its size. Here we showed that the firms that move to the big market are systematically more
efficient than the firms that stay behind. In other words, we have added spatial selection to the
HME.

Result 5: Allowing for firm heterogeneity adds a spatial selection component to the
HME, namely the big market attracts more than its ‘fair share’ of firms overall as usual,
but it also attracts all the most efficient firms. Plainly, this suggests a testable hypothesis.
Firms in the big market should be larger on average that firms in the small market.
Importantly, this is not due to the competitive effects that appear in the OTT framework
(markups are fixed with Dixit-Stiglitz competition). It is due entirely to spatial selection
whereby the biggest, most efficient firms are the first to move to the bigger market.
The intuition for this spatial selection effect is uncomplicated. The most efficient firms have a
stronger preference for location in the big market than do inefficient firms, because efficient
firms have higher sales and thus enjoy greater savings on trade costs. Additionally, the extra
local competition in the big market is less of a problem for efficient firms.


3. SELECTION BIAS AND THE MIS-MEASUREMENT
OF AGGLOMERATION ECONOMIES
We turn now to two important implications of the spatial selection, namely its impact on
regional productivity differences and how can this be measured.

3.1. Testing for agglomeration economies
The basic approach to testing for agglomeration economies is to see if the average measured
productivity of a region is related to the amount of industry in the region. For example, see
Ciccone (2002) and Midelfart-Knarvik and Steen (1999). To establish a baseline, suppose we
Selection and Sorting                                                                            14

are in a world where labour is the only measured input and we test for agglomeration
economies with the simplest regression:
(15)                    ln(lprod r ) = c + α ln(snr ) + ε
where ‘lprodr’ is measured labour productivity in region ‘r’, and ‘snr’ is the share of industry
in region r. The test for agglomeration economies would be based on α. If α exceeded zero in
a statistically significant manner, we would conclude that agglomeration economies were
present and would take α as a measure of their strength. A more detailed empirical
specification would control for other region-specific factors using region fixed effects or
actual data on productivity altering factors such as education and capital stocks; such
considerations are tangential to our main point and so are ignored.

3.1.1 Test with the standard footloose capital model
To set the stage, consider how this test would perform if there were agglomeration economies
and no heterogeneity. Thus for the moment we suppose that the true model of the world is the
standard FC model. North’s manufacturing labour productivity is the region’s real value of
manufacturing output divided by the region’s manufacturing labour input. In the FC model
with homogenous firms, total northern manufacturing revenue – i.e. the value of output – is
np1-σ(E/∆+φE*/∆*) where n is the mass of firms located in the north (see Baldwin et al 2003,
Chapter 3). The total labour input is ‘a’ times the units produced np-σ(E/∆+φE*/∆*). Due to
mill pricing, the ratio of the revenue to the labour input will be 1/(1-1/σ). To convert this to
real terms we divide by the north’s manufacturing price index; either the consumer price
index or the producer price index, which are, respectively, (np1-σ+φn*p1-σ)1/(1-σ) and (np1-σ)1/(1-
σ)
  . Thus, measured labour-productivity is (using the producer price index):

                                       ⎛       1
                                                        ⎞
                                       ⎜ s n σ −1 ⎟
(16)                    ln(lprod ) = ln⎜
                                       ⎜ a(1 − 1 / σ ) ⎟⎟
                                       ⎝                ⎠
What we can see from this is that agglomeration economies are indeed in operation in the
sense that labour productivity increases with the share of firms in the north (recall that
n+n*=Kw in the FC model). A properly specified cross-region regression equation would find
that firm-level productivity is increasing in the mass of firms present in a region and this
would be interpreted as evidence of agglomeration economies. Specifically, the estimated α
would be 1/(σ-1)>0.
In the FC model with heterogeneous firms, total northern manufacturing revenue – i.e. the
value of output – is (E/∆+φE*/∆*)∫p(i)1-σdi where the limits of integration are from zero to n.
The labour input would be (E/∆+φE*/∆*)∫a(i)p(i)-σdi with the same limits of integration.
Again due to mill pricing, the ratio of these is 1/(1-1/σ). Converting to real terms using the
producer price index, which in this case will be equal to (λK+λK*aR1-σ+ρ)1/(1-σ), measured
labour productivity is:
                                                   ⎛                             1
                                                                                     ⎞
                                                   ⎜ (λ K + λ K * a R 1−σ + ρ ) σ −1 ⎟
(17)                             lprod         = ln⎜                                 ⎟
                                         het
                                                   ⎜       a(1 − 1 / σ )             ⎟
                                                   ⎝                                 ⎠
Again a properly specified regression would detect a positive relationship between the mass
of firms in a region and firm-level productivity, however, the resulting estimate of
agglomeration economies would be upward biased since firms that had relocated to the big
Selection and Sorting                                                                                               15

region would have systematically higher than average productivity (recall that all our a’s are
bound between 0 and 1, so aR1-σ+ρ<1. To summarise:

Result 6: Selection Effect Bias – Standard econometric tests for agglomeration
economies are likely to overestimate the impact of agglomeration on firm-level efficiency
since delocation systematically involves the most efficient firms moving to the large
region. In other words, because the most efficient firms are the first to move from the
small region to the big, average firm productivity in big regions should be higher even if
there are negligible agglomeration economies in operation.


4. SORTING AND SUBSIDIES
This section turns to the implications for regional policy. We continue with the basic model
presented in Section 2, but we start from an initial situation of full agglomeration. As we saw
above, all firms will be in the large region when trade is freer than φCP. Moreover, we
consider a policy that pays firms a subsidy of S (a mnemonic for ‘subsidy’) to move from the
large region to the small region. To focus on the impact of the subsidy, we assume the subsidy
is financed by lump sum taxation (see Dupont and Martin 2003 for a consideration of tax
issues).

4.1. The new locational equilibrium
We start the analysis by showing that this relocation subsidy will induce relocation to the
small region, if the subsidy is sufficiently large.
Starting with all firms in the north, the change in operating profit (ignoring the subsidy) for an
atomistic firm moving from the north to the smaller south would be:
                                            (1 − φ ) E w ⎛ 1 − s      ⎞
(18)                                a 1−σ                ⎜⎜      − s ⎟⎟ < 0 ;             φ > φ CP
                                                λσ ⎝ φ                ⎠
for a firm with the marginal cost of ‘a’. Since we are considering φ>φCP, this difference would
be negative as shown (this follows from the definition of φCP). Importantly, the loss from
relocation, ignoring the subsidy, is decreasing in the firm’s marginal cost parameter ‘a’. The
reason is a corollary of Result 1; the most efficient firms find location in the big region most
profitable, so they are also the ones that would sacrifice the most by relocating to the small
region. However, if we started with a very small subsidy and increased it, the first firms to re-
locate to the small region would be the most inefficient firms.

Result 7: The first firms to respond to subsidised relocation from the big region to the
small one will be the least efficient firms.
To work out the precise relationship between the subsidy S and the cut-off marginal cost, we
note that if all firms with marginal costs in excess of aS move to the south, the ∆’s will be:14
(19)       ∆ = λ aS(    1− σ + ρ
                                   + φ (1 − aS
                                                 1− σ + ρ
                                                            )
                                                            ),           (
                                                                 ∆* = λ φaS
                                                                                1−σ + ρ
                                                                                          + 1 − aS
                                                                                                     1− σ + ρ
                                                                                                                )

14
  For example, ∆ involves four integral; the prices of northern and southern firms in the north and northern and
southern firms in the south. The first two integrals are K∫a1-σf[a]da+K*∫a1-σf[a]da, where the limits of integration
are from 0 to aS. Solving these equal (K+K*)λaS1-σ+ρ, but K+K*=1. Using similar manipulations for the third and
fourth integrals yields to formula in the text.
Selection and Sorting                                                                            16

where aS is the cut-off level of efficiency above which firms do not move. The implied change
in a north-based firm’s operating profit when it moves south is (including the subsidy):
                                E w (1 − φ ) ⎛ 1 − s s ⎞
                        a1−σ                 ⎜      − ⎟+S
                                     σ       ⎝ ∆* ∆⎠
Since the ∆’s involve aS raised to the power of 1+σ+ρ, we cannot explicitly solve for aS, but
the condition for it can be implicitly written as:
                             σ −1   Sσ                 s 1− s
(20)                    aS               = (1 − φ )(    −     )
                                    Ew                 ∆ ∆*
where Ew=µLw, since each individual spends µ on manufactures and there are Lw individuals
in the world. Note that the left-hand and right-hand sides of this expression are always
positive. The right-hand side is always decreasing in aS since the degree of competition in the
north falls and that in the south rises, as aS increases. The left-hand side, by contrast, is always
increasing in aS. This tells us that there will be a unique solution for aS in the economically
relevant range (which is the unit interval in this case since we assumed a0=1) as long as S is
big enough. The solution is illustrated in as aS’.

4.1.1 Delocation, subsidy size and openness
Two comparative static exercises are of interest. The first is to see how the cut-off varies with
the level of the subsidy. Inspection of (20) reveals that an increase in S will raise the left-hand
side without altering the right-hand side, so the result will be a decrease in the cut-off level of
inefficiency. This means that a higher subsidy will attract more firms, as expected.
The second exercise is to see how deeper integration affects the effectiveness of a given
subsidy. Since higher trade free-ness, i.e. dφ>0, lowers the right-hand side without altering the
left-hand side, we see the subsidy becomes more effective as trade gets freer. This result is
Selection and Sorting                                                                          17

quite intuitive since we know that both the agglomeration and dispersion forces weaken in the
FC model as trade gets freer (Baldwin et al 2003, chapter 3), but the subsidy incentive is
unaffected by changes in openness. Once trade is sufficiently free, all firms would move to
get the subsidy.
To summarise, we write:

Result 8: Starting for a core-periphery situation, a per-firm subsidy aimed at
encouraging production in the periphery tends to attract the least efficient firms. The
reason is that the most inefficient firms are the ones that have the least to lose from leave
the big region. This may help explain why regional production subsidies are considered
so ineffective in improving the competitiveness of remote regions.

Result 9: The subsidy is more effective in promoting relocation the large is the subsidy
and the freer is trade.
For completeness, we note that it is possible to find analytic solutions for the minimum
effective subsidy and the subsidy that induces all firms to move to the small region. To
summarise:

Result 10: The minimum effective subsidy (i.e. the subsidy that just induces some firms
to relocate to the periphery) is 2µ(1-φ)[(1+φ)s-1]/λφσ. To induce all firms to move to the
intrinsically small region, the subsidy would have to be infinite.

4.2. Sorting equilibria
Another way of expressing Result 8 is to say that production subsidies will result in what
might be called a ‘sorting equilibrium’. Since the most efficient firms have the most to gain
from being in the big market and the least efficient firms have the least to lose from leaving, a
subsidy tends to sort firms according to their efficiency levels. All the most inefficient firms
end up in the periphery and all the most efficient firms end up in the core.
The notion of sorting equilibria has two immediate implications. First, sorting magnifies the
econometric difficulties pointed out in the previous section. Since real-world firms do have
heterogeneous levels of inefficiency, sorting will lead to an outcome that mimics
agglomeration economies. Second, judging the success of regional subsidies such as the EU’s
Structural Funds will be tricky. Since such funds will systematically attract the least efficient
firms to periphery regions, there will be an important difference between the share of firms in
the periphery and their efficiency. Although we do not consider it explicitly, this later
suggestion may have growth implications if there is a correlation between a firm’s level of
efficiency and its ability to innovate. We leave this for future work.


5. CONCLUSION
Hereto, the new economic geography literature has relied on the assumption of identical
industrial firms. While this was viewed as an assumption of convenience, this paper shows
that allowing for firm-level heterogeneity has important implications for empirical work and
for policy predictions. In particular, we showed that the most efficient firms are the ones that
move first to the big region. This non-random ‘selection’ implies that standard empirical
methodologies will tend to overestimate agglomeration economies. Moreover, the same
selection logic implies that production subsidies aimed at promoting industry in
disadvantaged regions can have a ‘sorting effect’. That is, the subsidies will result in a
Selection and Sorting                                                                          18

situation where all the most productive firms, regardless of their region of origin, will choose
to locate in the core while all the least productive firms will locate in the periphery.
We believe that the inclusion of firm-level heterogeneity raises many interesting issues in
economic geography that should be explored in future work. For example in search for the
most appropriate model, we considered adding Melitz-heterogeneity to other NEG models
such as the footloose entrepreneur model. Here we found that heterogeneity had complex
effects on both demand and cost linkages.

APPENDIX: SPATIAL SELECTION IN THE MELITZ
OTTAVIANO MODEL
This appendix introduces the Melitz and Ottaviano (2003) frameworked discussed in the
introduction and shows that the basic features of spatial selection that arise in our model also
arise in the MO framework.

5.1.1 Assumptions and the model’s core logic
Melitz and Ottaviano (2003) model can be thought of as the marriage of the Ottaviano,
Tabuchi and Thisse (OTT) monopolistic competition framework and the Hopenhayn-Melitz
mechanism for the development of firms with heterogeneous marginal costs.

5.1.2 The Ottaviano Tabuchi Thisse monopolistic competition framework
The OTT monopolistic competition set-up works with a linear demand system where income
effects have been eliminated via quasi-linear preferences. As usual in the monopolistic
competition tradition, there are many, many firms producing differentiated varieties. Since the
firms are small, they ignore the impact of their sales on industry-wide variable. Practically,
this means that the producer of each differentiated variety acts as a monopolist on a linear
demand curve. Indirectly, however, firms face competition in the OTT framework since the
demand curve’s intercept declines as the number of competing varieties rises.
Open-economy general-equilibrium considerations are minimised by assuming that labour is
the only primary factor and that the sector producing the ‘linear good’ in the quasi-linear
preferences is marked by perfect competition, constant returns to scale and costless trade.
This equalised wages internationally and ensuring trade balances at all times.
Increasing returns is introduced as usual by assuming potential producers must pay a fixed
cost to develop a new variety. This cost – which comprises FI units of labour – is paid just
prior to production.
Free entry and the elimination of pure profits. As in other monopolistic competition
models, the OTT framework assumes that the degree of competition rises up to the point
where pure profit is eliminated. Given the very convenient preferences assumed, more
competition – either in the form of more firms, or in the form of lower trade barriers – lowers
the y-axis intercept of the linear demand curve facing each and every firm (see top panel of
Figure 4); as usual the marginal revenue curve meets the demand curve at the intercept and
has half its slope, so it too falls with extra competition. Although it is not shown in the figure,
it is easy to understand that the price charged by a typical firm with marginal cost ‘c’ is
(A+c)/2 and this falls as competition rises. Moreover, sales of a typical firm (which is always
b(A-c)/2 for a linear demand curve, where ‘b’ is the demand curve’s slope), so operating
profit (which is always b(A-c)2/4 for a linear demand curve) falls monotonically with the
degree of competition.
When the long-run equilibrium is reached, the degree of competition must be such that the
operating profit earned by a typical firm, π in the figure, is just sufficient to cover the fixed
entry cost FI (see bottom panel of Figure 4).

5.1.3 The Hopenhayn-Melitz framework
The Hopenhayn-Melitz approach to heterogeneous firms assigns all heterogeneity to firms’
marginal costs. That is to say, the differentiated varieties are made from labour by firms
facing constant marginal production costs; namely, ‘ci’ units of labour per unit of output of
variety i. With wages equal to unity, we can refer without ambiguity to ‘ci’ as firm i’s
marginal costs.
Where does the marginal-cost heterogeneity come from? Following Hopenhayn (1992a,
1992b), it is assumed that once a new variety is developed (by paying FI), the new variety is
randomly assigned a marginal costs, i.e. a ‘c’, from a known distribution function, G[c]. G[c]
has positive probability over the range 0 ≤ c ≤ cm, so maximum conceived marginal cost is cm
and the minimum is zero. Intuition is served by thinking of this as a stochastic variety-
innovation process; FI buys a ‘blueprint’ for a new variety, but the new variety’s marginal
cost is random. The Hopenhayn-Melitz approach focuses exclusively on steady state
equilibriums and ignores discounting but keeps present values finite by assuming firms face a
constant probability of ‘death’ according to a Poisson process with a hazard rate of δ.

5.1.4 The equilibrium
Entry is continuous since varieties are continually dying and replacements are needed to keep
the system at its long-run equilibrium (δn firms die every instant and the same number is
needed to maintain equilibrium). The continuous drawing from the underlying distribution
G[c] yields a mass of potential firms nG[c], but only the most efficient find it worthwhile to
actually produce, as the top panel of Figure 5 illustrates. Specifically, some firms will have
marginal costs above the demand curve intersection, A, and so will not sell/produce anything;
we call this threshold marginal cost cD (D is a mnemonic for domestic market). In this way,
Selection and Sorting                                                                           22

competition truncates the distribution at of marginal costs at cD (recall that A falls as
competition rises).

In the simplest heterogeneous-firms trade model, there are two nations assumed, for
simplicity’s sake, to be symmetric in terms of tastes, technology, size and trade costs. The
cost of transport goods between nations is τ>1 (initially assumed identical for trade in both
directions). Note that one of the merits of the MO model is that it can handle asymmetries and
many nations, but the model’s core logic is best presented in a setting uncluttered by
exogenous asymmetries.
Given the trade cost τ, only firms with sufficiently low marginal costs can profitably sell in
their export market. This second cut off is obviously related to the first since the intercept in
the two nations is the same by symmetry; specifically, cXτ=cD, where cX is the maximum
marginal cost of an exporting firm (X is a mnemonic for export).

5.1.5 Allowing delocation
In this appendix, we extend the MO model to allow firms to delocate between two regions in
search of the highest profits. As in our model, we rule out both firm death and firm entry in
order to spotlight the spatial aspects of the problem.
Following to MO, in demand side, the inverse demand for each variety can be written as:

                      L                              αγ + ηP
(21)       qi =           ( A − pi ) ;          A≡           ; P ≡ ∫ p j dj ; η ≡ 1
                      γ                              ηnc + γ       Ω

where L is the number of consumers (and the labour supply), ‘A’ is the endogenous y-axis
intercept, nc is the mass of varieties consumed (since not all varieties are traded, we need a
separate notation for the number of varieties produced in a typical country and the number
consumed by a typical consumer), and P is the sum of all prices in the market; Ω is the set of
all varieties consumed in the market. By choice of units, we normalise η=1.
Selection and Sorting                                                                                       23

Inspection of (21) reveals two convenient features. First, a ceteris paribus increase in the
number of varieties consumed, nc, lowers the intercept. Second a lowering of the price of
competing varieties will lower P and thus lower the intercept.
The linear demand system makes this model extremely simple to work with. Atomistic firms
take the mass and distribution of c’s as given, so the A in (21) is viewed as a parameter and
they act as monopolists on their linear demand curve. Standard results imply that (see top
panel of Figure 5):

                    A + ci                  A + ciτ                  ( A − ci ) 2
           pi =            ;       pi * =           ; π D (c i ) ≡ L              ; c X ≤ ci ≤ c D
                      2                        2                         4γ

                            ( A − ci ) 2    τ 2 ( A − ci ) 2
           π X (c i ) ≡ L                +L                  ; 0 ≤ c i ≤ c X ; π N (c i ) ≡ 0 ; c D ≤ c i
                                4γ                 4γ
where p is the profit maximising price charged by D- and X-type firm in their local markets,
p* is the price changed by X-types in their export markets, and the π’s are the Ricardian
surpluses for D-types, X-types and N-types, respectively.

5.1.6      The cut-off conditions
Firms only sell locally if they can make positive operating profits. Given (22), the zero
operating profit condition is where sales are zero and this implies:

(23)                    aD = A,             a X = A * /τ
where aD and aX are the cut-off for D-types and X-types, respectively. To find the closed form
solution for A, we must solve for the price index P and this requires a specific functional form
for G(c). However, for the purposes of this appendix, qualitative reasoning is sufficient.
Selection and Sorting                                                                         24

Notice that A is increasing in P and decreasing in nc. Since competition is tougher in the big
market, and more varieties are consumed in the big market, A is lower in the big market, i.e.
A<A*. Consequently, we know that cD<cD*, where cD and cD are the cut-offs in the big and
small market respectively. Likewise, cX*<cX since firms based in the small nation have to be
more competitive to sell into the big competitive market. To summarise:
Result 1: Big country has smaller export-entry cut-off marginal costs, cX. This implies
that the big country has higher share of exporting firms. On the other hand, small
country has larger market-entry cut-off marginal costs, cD.
This results is shown in Figure 6.

5.1.7 Delocation Tendencies with Quadratic Adjustment costs
Now we add geographical delocation to the MO model. Firm can delocate between the
countries in search of the highest profit. As in our model, we assume quadratic adjustment
costs, as in our model this means that firms move in the order of how much they have to gain
from moving and in the long run, the moving costs are zero and profits are equalised between
the two regions for any given level of ‘c’.
We being by considering the incentives of various firms to delocate, assuming that no
delocation has occurred.

Profit gap function
Inspection of Figure 6 shows that in the initial no-delocation, firms the move from the small
south to the big north may change types. For instance, southern firms with c’s less cX but
more than cX* would switch from being D-types in the south to being X-types in the north.
We call this DX migration. Southern firms with c’s below cX* will remain X types, so we call
this XX migration. Southern firms with c’s above cX and below cD and will remain D types,
so we call this DD migration. Some southern firms would never complement moving from the
initial situation since they can make positive profits in the small market but not in the big
market.
The incentives for delocation are different across migration types. Figure 7 plots the profit
gap function for each type in terms of marginal costs. Interestingly, the gap function for XX
migration is a hump-shaped curve. This concavity implies that the intermediate productivity
of XX migrants have the highest incentive to delocate to the bigger market while the highest
productivity firm is indifferent in its location. The gap function for XX migration is tangent to
the gap function DX migration at point cX* (the cut-off between D and X types in the south).
From cX* to cX, migration would be DX. The DX profit gap is tangent to the DD curve at cX.
From cX to cD, migration of the DD sort.
It is easy to show and intuitively obvious that as south to north migration occurs, the cut-off
points converge since the firm migration equalises the degree of competition in each market.
Thus in this model, the first firms to delocate are southern firms who are more efficient than
average (they are X-types before and after delocation), but they are not the most productive
firms. This confirms that qualitative message in our model that delocation leads to spatial
selection such that delocating firms have above average productivity.
The long run equilibrium is complex to illustrate analytically, but we have simulated the
model and find that as in our model, the firms that move in equilibrium have above average
productivity compared to the firms that remain in the small region.
