             INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND NORTH-SOUTH TRADE


                                  ABSTRACT


    We study the incentive that a government in the South has to protect

the intellectual property rights of Northern firms, and the consequences of

the decision taken by the South for welfare in the North and for efficiency

of the world equilibrium. We conduct our analysia in the context of a com-

petition between a single Northern producer and a single Southern producer

selling some good to an integrated world market. In this competition, only

the Northern firm has the ability to conduct R&D in order to lower its prod-

uction costs, but the Southern firm can imitate coatleasly if patent protec-

tion for proceaa innovationa is not enforced by the government of the South.

We find that the interests of the North and the South generally conflict

in the matter of protection of intellectual property, with the South bene-

fitting from the ability to pirate technology and the North harmed by such

actions. A strong system of intellectual property rights may or may not

enhance world efficiency.

I.   Introduction

     The issue of intellectual property rights has become a contentious one

indeed in recent trade relations between North and South. In the North,

producers of new knowledge and ideas rely on protection in the forms of

patents, copyrights and trademarks to enable them to appropriate some of the

benefits from investment in research and development. The Northern

governments have responded to pleas for assistance from their corporate

sectors in the face of billions of dollars of lost revenue and profits from

piracy and counterfeiting1 by applying pressure on the South to provide

greater enforcement of property rights and by pushing for new codes of

international behavior.2 At the urging of the United States, for example, the

parties to the GATT established as one of the fourteen negotiating groups of

the Uruguay Round one charged "to clarify GATT provisions and elaborate as

appropriate new rules and disciplines regarding international enforcement of

intellectual property rights" (Baldwin, 1988, p.65). The South, for its part,

manifests almost total dependency on the North for the technologies needed for

growth and development. These countries fear exploitation at the hands of

innovative firms in the North in view of their weak bargaining position. They

have been quite reluctant to accede to Northern demands for strengthening of

standards on protection of intellectual property (GAO, 1987).

     The welfare economics of intellectual property rights in a closed-economy

setting are reasonably well understood. A fundamental tension exists between

the social desirability of widespread dissemination of available know-how and

the need for society to provide adequate rewards to purveyors of new

information. The tension stems from the public-good nature of most forms of

knowledge; once generated, knowledge can be used simultaneously by many

parties besides the original creator at zero or minimal additional cost. This
                                        2

consideration argues against protection of intellectual property, since the

granting of property rights can only diminish the efficiency of use of a given

knowledge base. But absent some form of protection, private agents will have

little reason to invest their resources to generate new information and

technologies. The socially optimal degree of protection of intellectual

property requires a balancing of these fundamentally opposing objectives (see

Nordhaus, 1969). Most governments have chosen to award limited market power

(in the form of narrowly prescribed patents, copyrights and trademarks) to

innovators as a compromise solution in which some static misallocation is

accepted as the cost of preserving dynamic incentives.

     In a world economy inhabited by sovereign governments, the issue of

protection of intellectual property becomes all the more complex. The

globally efficient degree of protection need not serve the separate interests

of the individual governments that must enforce property rights. In

particular, one would suspect that national well-being is maximized by a

higher degree of protection of intellectual property in countries that develop

new technologies and stand to earn monopoly rents from their application than

in countries that only consume the goods and services that are produced using

new ideas. But conflict of interest between governments is by no means

inevitable. As an extreme example, suppose no product development would take

place in an industry absent adequate protection against piracy and infringe-

ment. Then a country with no capability to conduct R&D would nonetheless

benefit from enforcement of patent and copyright laws insofar as its consumers

stand to capture some surplus from any new products marketed within its

borders. Indeed the U.S. government, in its discussions with trade partner

governments in the South, has sought to emphasize the stake that the latter
                                        3

have in the intellectual property rights system (see GAO, 1987, pp.43-44).

     In this paper, we study the welfare economics of patent protection in a

North-South trading environment.3 We suppose that initially a Northern firm

and a Southern firm have access to an "old" technology to produce a good that

is demanded in both countries. The Northern firm alone also has the ability

to devote resources to an R&D project in order to improve the production

technology. If foreign intellectual property rights are protected by the

government in the South, then the Northern firm will gain via its R&D efforts

a competitive advantage over its Southern rival. It can exploit this

advantage in the ensuing international oligopolistic competition by capturing

an increased share of the market, or, in some circumstances, by licensing its

superior technology to its rival. If alternatively, the government in the

South fails to enforce patent protection over the new production process, then

the Southern firm will be able to pirate the innovative technology and can

once again become an equal competitor in the international marketplace. This

prospect, we assume, is well understood by the Northern firm, which then sets

its R&D outlays accordingly.

     We investigate the extent to which patent protection by the government of

the South adds to social welfare in each country separately, and in the world

as a whole.   In our model, global patent protection serves to stimulate

innovation, so that production costs are lower (for at least the Northern

firm) in the sales-stage equilibrium. This effect alone acts to the benefit

of both countries. Against this is the fact that enforcement of patent

protection mitigates, and in some cases eliminates, oligopolistic competition,

to the detriment of welfare in both countries. Finally, the presence or

absence of protection of intellectual property in the South has implications
                                         4

for the international distribution of income, as the Northern firm captures a

greater share of extra-normal industry profits when rights are protected than

it does when infringement takes place.

      The remainder of our paper is organized as follows. In the next section

we develop the model described above, and compare levels of welfare in each

country with and without Southern protection for Northern intellectual

property. We maintain the assumption, in this section, that international

licensing arrangements between horizontal competitors are infeasible. In

Section III, we introduce the possibility of licensing, ask when it will take

place, and then re-examine the welfare comparisons of the protection and no-

protection regimes. We discuss some implications of our analysis for current

international economic relations in the concluding section.



II. Patent Protection When Licensin2 is Infeasible

      We consider a linear-quadratic Cournot duopoly in an integrated world

economy. Initially, one firm in the North and one firm in the South can

produce some homogenous good at constant marginal cost, a. The Northern firm

now faces an opportunity to devote resources to a deterministic R&D project in

order to improve upon the existing production technology. The firm can

achieve a coat reduction of amount & by spending &2/i on process innovation.

Letting R denote its research outlay, its post-innovation marginal cost of

production will be4

                          (iR)"2   ,
                                                R    a2/


      Final marginal cost in the South will depend upon whether or not the
                                          S


Northern firm's patent rights to its innovative production process are

protected by the government of the South, and on whether or not the Southern

firm is able and willing to negotiate a licensing agreement with its Northern

rival. We assume throughout this section that the complexity of the

technology and the attendant difficulties in writing an enforceable contract

preclude any licensing agreements. Then, if property rights are protected,

the Southern fin's cost of production remains c â€”    a.   If, alternatively, the

government of the South fails to enforce the Northern firm's patent rights,

the Southern firm will be able to imitate the innovative technology. To make

our arguments as sharp as possible, we suppose that the cost of reverse

engineering is negligible.5 Then absent protection for intellectual property

marginal production costs in the South are equal to those in the North.

      After the Northern firm completes its R&D project and the Southern firm

imitates if possible, the two firms engage in Cournot (quantity-setting)

competition. We adopt a linear form for (inverse) demand in the integrated

world market, and choose unita so that this curve has a slope of one. Then




(2)        Pâ€”fl-     (y+Y),          fl>a,

where P is the market-clearing price of the good and y and Y are the

quantities sold by the Southern and Northern firms, respectively. We assume

as well that at every price a constant fraction 1/9 of demand originates in

the marketplace of the South. This implies an inverse demand function in the

South of p(q) â€”       - Oq, where q is the quantity sold there, and also that the
South will enjoy a fraction 1/9 of total world consumer surplus at any

equilibrium price.

       A.   Prooertv Rizhts Violated

       We begin by solving the model under the assumption that the government of

the South fails to protect the intellectual property rights of the Northern

firm. Then the ultimate market structure is one of symmetric duonoly with

common costs Câ€”c. These of course depend on the prior R&D       decision   of the

Northern firm. As is well known, the Cournot equilibrium levels of output in

this instance are y â€” Y â€”    (fi-C)/3   and the equilibrium price is P â€”   (+2C)/3.
       We assume that, at the R&D phase, the Northern firm correctly foresees

the implications of its actions for the subsequent product-market competition.

That is, we seek a dynamic equilibrium that satisfies the sub-game-perfection

constraint. The problem facing the Northern firm in the first stage of the

game is to choose R to maximize total profits




            Z(R) â€”
                     [p - a Ã·(7R)U2]    -   R

where the expression for operating profits in (3) represents the product of

price and per-unit profit. The first-order condition for a profit maximum

implies6

demand curve and the equilibrium price line. Straightforward calculations

       8.   Prooertv Rights Protected

       If the government of the South does indeed prevent its local firm from

infringing upon the patent rights of the Northern innovator, then the

duopolists bear different marginal costs at the time that they meet in the

product market. In this case, three types of equilibria may arise, depending

upon the size of the parameter 7 describing the effectiveness of R&D in

reducing production costs. For small values of i the R&D efforts of the

Northern firm will be modest, and asymmetric duoo1v will characterize the

final stage of competition. For large values of       the Northern firm will find
                                                              8

it   optimal to reduce its costs substantially, so much so that it will enjoy an

unfettered monopoly position in the product market. Finally, when y takes on

intermediate values, the Northern firm will act strategically to induce exit

by its rival (see Dixit, 1980). Then its final position in the product market

will be one of monopoly, but the firm will find itself constrained to choose a

level of R&D spending sufficiently large to guarantee non-positive profits for

its rival. We shall refer to this last market structure as one of strateaic

oredation. We proceed now to find optimal levels of R&D, and equilibrium

profits, consumer surplus, and total welfare for each of these scenarios, and

to delimit the values of -              for   which each applies.

       Consider first the output stage of an asymmetric duopoly with costs C and

c. The two first-order conditions equating perceived marginal revenues to

marginal costs imply a Cournot equilibrium with Y â€”                  ( - 2C   +   c)/3   and y â€”

(fi - 2c   +   C)/3,     and an associated equilibrium price P â€”         (+C+        c)/3.
Anticipating these outcomes, the Northern firm chooses P. to maximize



                                                      2
 (8)           Z(R) â€”            -   a + 27h/2Rl/Z        -   R



The optimal choice of R when duopolistic competition is foreseen satisfies


               P.   â€”   4(fi)2
                        (94)2

nut,   with this level of R&D, output by the Southern firm remains positive if

and only if <            3/2.    So, y <      3/2   is necessary for the duopoly outcome to

obtain.

       If duopoly does obtain, the expressions for equilibrium outputs and price
imply




(IOn)        z   â€”
                     (::2


             z â€”     (3-2y)2(fl-a)2
(lOs)
                        (9 4-i)2



We   can also calculate levels of consumer surplus, whence we find




 (lln)       s   â€”   2(9-l      (fla)2(3-i)2
                        9
                                   (94-i)2



 (lis)           â€”     ($a)2(3)
                            (94-i)2


Summing the respective consumer and producer surpluses for each country gives




 (12n)        W â€”                [9 - 4i + 2(9_l)(37)2]
                     (94-i)2


              w â€”     (fl-a)2     [.(3.2y)2 + 2(3--i)2]
 (l2s)
                     9(9-4i)



         Now suppose, for the moment, that the Northern firm               were   to face no

competition whatsoever. Then its jointly optimal choices of output and

                                                           -y(fl-a)2/(4-i)2.   When would these
 research would be Y â€”           2(fl-a)/(4-i)   and K â€”

 choices represent an equilibrium despite potential competition from the firm

 in the South? If, at the implied monopoly price P â€”                   [fl(2+i)+2a/(4-1)   the
                                                10

Southern firm could not cover its production cost a, then the rival would

choose to exit the industry. From this, we see that unconstrained monopoly

results whenever 1 > 2. In this case,



(13n)       Z â€”     (a)2

(14n)       s       2(9-1)   (fla)2
                      9

(l5n)       w   â€”   (-a)2    (69 -    19 - 2)

while zâ€”0 and


(14s)       w â€” s â€” 2(fl-a)2
                    9(41)2


        Finally, for values of E [3/2,2], the monopoly choice of research

spending invites competition from the Southern rival, whereas the optimal

choice of R&D from (9) more than suffices to guarantee the rival's exit from

the market. For these intermediate values of         the Northern firm conducts

just enough R&D to guarantee y â€” 0; i.e. it drives its own cost to 2a-fl and

the price to m. This requires a research outlay of R â€”      (-a)2/-y   and yields

profits equal to

Then consumer surplus and total welfare in the North are given by

In   the South, we have, in this case, z â€”              0 and



(17s)        w -   s -
                         (Q)2

It is a simple matter to check that, for all -y <                  3/2,      Northern profits from

(iOn) exceed those from (16n), so that -y < 3/2 is both necessary and

sufficient for the duopoly outcome to obtain, Strategic predation occurs only

for values of 'y         [3/2,21.




        C. Welfare Comoarisons

        We are now prepared to compare levels of welfare in each country and for

the world as a whole across regimes when the government of the South does and

does not protect the intellectual property rights of the Northern firm. We

begin with the South. For -y < 3/2, the relevant welfare expressions are those

in (7s) and (l2s). Subtracting one from the other, we find



             sgn (w' -      w)     â€” sgn (-4868 + 40597      +   l08-y   -
                                                                             84972   - 48i2 +
(19s)

                                         493   +   2)    ,                    e   (0,3/2)




where superscripts NP" and 'P' have been used to indicate the regimes without

protection of property rights and with protection, respectively. In general,

the expression in (l9s) is of ambiguous sign. But the right-hand side of
                                              12

(19s) is positive when 9 â€”       9/8   for all -   e (0,3/2) and the right-hand side is
increasing in 9 for all y in this range. From this we conclude that the South

achieves higher national welfare when it neglects to protect intellectual

property rights if a duopoly outcome will result under protection and if ita

share in world consumption does not exceed 88 percent.

        Next consider the range of parameter values for which strategic predation

is the outcome under patent protection. We subtract (14a) from (7s) to find



(20s)        sgn (NP -   w}   â€” sgn (18(9+2) -     (97)2(   ,    -y   E [3/2,2]



The expression on the right-hand side of (20s) also is positive for all 9 >

9/8 and also increases with 9. Hence, when atrategic predation will occur

under protection, a Southern consumption share of less than 88 percent is

sufficient for the South to prefer non-protection.

        Finally, we consider the range of parameter values for which the North

would capture a monopoly position if its property rights were respected.

Recall that this case arises when R&D productivity is especially high. The

relevant welfare expressions are (7s) and (17a), and we find




(2la)        sgn (w2 - w2} â€” sgn (99(y4)2 + 2(8i254i+63)( ,                   e   [2,4]




For -y near 2, this expression remains positive unless the consumption share of

the South is very high. But for -y large (near 4), the expression is negative

for all 9 > 1. Thus, we find that protection of foreign intellectual property

can benefit the South, but only when R&D is highly productive and the country

stands to gain much on the consumption side from the fruits of the Northern
                                          13

firm's research efforts.

     In Figure 1, we have plotted the full range of permissible parameter

values for y and 1/6. In the figure, we show the combinations of parameter

values for which protection and non-protection best serve the selfish

interests of the South. We see from the figure that the South will generally

prefer to "look the other way" when patent infringement occurs, except in

cases where its consumers absorb much of the world's output of the good

subject to cost reduction or when the cost savings to be reaped from

innovation are quite dramatic.

     What then are the interests of the North?      When we compare Northern

welfare levels under protection and no-protection we find that, no matter what

the value of y and hence the market structure that would prevail with

protection, the North always benefits form having its firm's property rights

respected in the South.8 Evidently, the consumption gain from increased

competition can never outweigh the profit-distribution effect and the &D-

incentive effect. We conclude that conflict of interest between the North and

the South in regard to the system of intellectual property rights is the rule

rather than the exception in our model.

     When international conflict exists, it is natural to ask whether there

are potential gains from cooperation. In the present context we might wonder

whether the North could bribe the South to enforce patent protection in cases

where protection was not in the narrowly-defined self interest of the latter.

A world system of protected intellectual property rights would result from

efficient bar2ainina with comvensation, for example, if the North's gains from

enforcement exceeded the South's losses. To investigate this issue, we define

world welfare, ) â€”   W   + w, and compare levels of 0 across regimes.

        Suppose first that available productivity gains from R&D are modest;

i.e.    -y <   3/2.   We have in this case

The expression on the right-hand side of (19w) is positive in the relevant

range for all y         .875 and is negative for all         .876. Thus, protection of

foreign intellectual property rights in the South indeed advances global

efficiency if the prospects for productivity gain through R&D are sufficiently

bright, but for modest potential advances in knowledge world welfare actually

is higher when the South jj to enforce patent protection. Evidently, for

small innovations, the benefit from the increased competition that results

when diffusion takes place outweighs the cost in terms of dampened incentives

for R&D investment.

       For larger values of      such that the Southern firm would exit the market

absent the ability to infringe upon the Northern firm's patent, protection by

the South of intellectual property rights always enhances global efficiency.

Straightforward computation reveals that O > cP            for   > 3/2. Our analysis

suggests, therefore, that intellectual property rights ought to be strongly

protected in highly innovative industries, but that the argument for pro-

tection is lass compelling when technological advances are likely to be small.



III. Patent Protection With Potential Licensing

       Until this point, we have excluded the possibility that, after the

conclusion of its R&D project, the Northern firm might elect to license its

superior technology to its rival in the South. We justified this exclusion
                                       15

with reference to the costliness of writing enforceable contracts in some

situations. But obviously there are circumstances where contracting

considerations do not rule out licensing. Katz and Shapiro (1985) have

studied the incentives for the sharing of technologies among horizontal

competitors in such circumstances. We now adopt their approach to introduce

the potential for licensing into our model, and then re-examine the

international issues at hand.

     A. Licensina Eauilibria

     As in Katz and Shapiro (1985), we suppose that licensing contracts can

only be signed after research and development has been completed. It seems

likely that if, instead, contracts were to be negotiated at some prior stage,

and if they called for the sharing of (some amount of) information which at

the time was not yet available to either party, then the resulting contracts

would be extremely difficult to enforce. We add a third (licensing) stage to

our game, one that takes place before the sales competition but subsequent to

the commitment of R by the Northern firm. We also rule out, with reference to

the antitrust laws applicable in most countries, any contracts that limit

competition at the sales stage. We limit attention to contracts calling for a

fixed licencing fee.9

     When licensing agreements must be reached after R&D has been completed

and imitation is costless, no agreements are possible in the absence of patent

protection in the South. The Southern firm would never be willing to pay a

positive fee to use the Northern firm's technology if it were possible for the

firm to copy that technology at no cost. So, in this sub-section, we limit

attention to situations where the South provides protection for intellectual

property. We re-introduce the alternative possibility of no protection only
                                              16

when we are ready to perform the regime comparisons.

       The licensing of technology between horizontsl competitors requires:

(i) the existence of joint gsins from sharing; and (ii) the resolution of a

bilateral bargaining problem. Given the existence of potential gains,

licensing might not take place if the two parties to the negotiation had

asymmetric information about their separate interests and attributes. Since

we have nothing to add to the voluminous literature on bargaining, we choose

the simplest possible specification of this aspect of the model. We suppose

that licensing will take place under patent protection whenever the joint

profits of the two firms with licensing exceeds joint profits in the absence

of licensing. We assume, moreover, that the Northern firm captures a fraction

a of the gains from trade, and treat a as an exogenous parameter throughout

our analysis.

       More formally, let              (R) be the levels of profits that the

Northern and Southern firms would obtain in the absence of any licensing

agreement, and let Z(R) and z(R) be profit levels (not including any licensing

fee) if technology sharing takes place. Then we assume that licensing will

occur subsequent to a research effort at intensity R if and only if Z(R)+z(R)

  Z(R)+z(R), and that in such cases the Southern firm pays a fee



(22)        1(t) â€”   (R)   -   Z(R) + a[Z(R)+z(R)-Z(R)-z(R)]



for the right to use the Northern firm's superior technology. With this fee,

the Northern firm's total profits, Z(R) + F(R), are the sum of hypothetical

profits in the absence of an agreement, Z(R), and that firm's share a of the

gains from trade.
                                                17

       Katz and Shapiro (1985) have proven that, in models such as this one,

licensing wili not take place if the potential licensor would enjoy a monopoly

position in the product market were it to exclude its rival from the superior

technology. For this reason, we restrict our search for licensing equilibria

to values of & such that asymmetric duopoly would be the outcome absent any

agreement. For these values of R, the relevant expressions for (R) and (R)

are those that would arise in an asymmetric Cournot equilibrium with

respective costs C â€”          - (iR)h/2   and c â€”   o,   while Z(R) and z(R) are those that

arise in a symmetric Cournot equilibrium with costs C â€” c â€”              a   -
                                                                                 (yR)'12.

Inserting the appropriate terms in (22), we derive




            F(R) â€”
                     (2+2a)($a)7hI2RZ + (3-3c)7R
(23)
                                      9




       Assuming that licensing will take place, the optimal choice of R for the

Northern firm is the one that maximizes Z(R) + F(R).                 The first-order

condition for this problem yields



            &      y(2+u)2($a)2
(24)
                   [9( 3a4)   12


with maximal cum-licensing profits (including the fee) equal to




                Z + F â€”
                             (fl-a)
 (25n)
                          9[9+(3c-4)i]2



                            [81 + 9-y(c2+lOa-4) +    y2(3o+l7a228a)]
                                       18

     There remains the question of whether the Northern firm will select a

value of R that yields licensing in the post-R&D licensing equilibrium as part

of its globally optimal strategy. The firm could instead choose a higher

level of R&D such that no licensing agreement would be reached once the

research phase had been completed. The profits it could earn by doing so

never exceed those given in (lOn), corresponding to maximal profits in an

asymmetric duopoly situation without licensing. In making its choice of R,

the Northern firm compares the right-hand sides of (lOn) and (25n). This

comparison yields a critical value of 1 as a function of a, y*C(a) with G'>O,

such that licensing takes place in equilibrium if and only if y C 1*.

Examining this function, we find that when -y > 1.406 licensing never takes

place (i.e., no matter what the value of a), whereas if C 1.285 licensing

always will occur with protection. For values of -y between 1.285 and 1.406,

licensing is more likely to result the larger is aJÂ°

     For values of y such that licensing would not take place in the sub-game

perfect equilibrium, the analysis of intellectual property rights is exactly

as in-Section II. So we restrict our attention here to those cases where, in

the presence of patent protection, a licensing agreement would be reached.

These cases are of special interest, because they imply that international

technology transfer takes place in any event, either by commercial arrangement

if patent protection is provided by the government of the South, or by piracy

if not.

     Using (24) and our formulae for Cournot equilibrium outputs and prices,

we can calculate profits for the Southern firm and consumer surplus levels in

each country in a licensing equilibrium. We find:

                   99(9(4.3))2
We calculate total welfare in each country, as before, by summing the consumer

and producer surplus measures in (25) and (26).



        8. Welfare Comoarisons

        We now are prepared to compare levels of welfare achieved under

protection of foreign intellectual property in the South with those that arise

when no protection is provided, in situAtions where protection gives rise to

an equilibrium with international licensing of the new technology. This

analysisinvolves comparison of (7i) with the sum                     of   (25i) and (26i), for

iâ€”s,n. Since the general expressions are quite complicated and provide

limited intuition, we proceed by focusing on several special cases.

        The first case that we consider arises when râ€”l. In this case, the

Northern firm enjoys all the bargaining power in the licensing negotiations

and extracts all the surplus from any agreement. We find



(27s)        sgn (w -    w)   â€”
                                  sgn   ($(2-y-9) +      + 9)


In Figure 2, we show the combinations of y and 1/9 for which the right-hand

side of (27s) is positive, and those for which it is negative. We see that
                                                20

the South may benefit from protection of Northern intellectual property

rights, but only if its share in world consumption of the good is quite high.

A sufficient condition for non-protection to be the optimal strategy when aâ€”i

is 1/9 < .59.

        From the point of view of the North, we have




(27n)        sgn (W - W)   â€”   sgn (y + 9   -
                                                169)



For -y C 1.406 (the largest value of , for which licensing takes place when

aâ€”l), the right-hand side of (27n) always is negative. So we find again that

the North benefits from having its intellectusl property rights protected in

the South.

        Next we consider the opposite extreme case where bargaining power resides

entirely with the firm in the South; i.e. ,            aâ€”0.   When aâ€”0 the South is more

likely to benefit from protecting Northern property rights than it is when

aâ€”i, and does so whenever its consumption share exceeds one-half (see Figure

3). However, when the consumption share of the South is not large (e.g., less

than .4), the South still prefers to pirate Northern technology than to enter

into a licensing agreement in which its firm will capture all of the surplus.

This somewhat surprising result stems from the fact that the licensing fee

remains strictly positive even when aâ€”0, end also from the differing

 incentives that the Northern firm has to carry out R&D in the two situations.

        Comparing welfare levels for the North, for the case when its firm's

bargaining power in the licensing negotiation is nil, we find that, for all

permissible values of a (sl) and       -y (E     (0,9/7)),    W2 >   W'.   Even if the

Northern firm captures 2fl of the surplus from any licensing agreement that
                                         21

materializes between itself and its Southern rival, nonetheless the North

enjoys greater welfare when its intellectual property rights are protected by

the South.

       Lastly, we consider an intermediate case where the gains from trade in

knowledge are shared equally between the two rivals; i.e., a â€”    1/2.   Figure 4

depicts the parameter values for which the South prefers protection. The

figure provides the same general message as for the more extreme cases,

inasmuch as the South benefits from protection only when its residents absorb

a large share of world output of the good. The critical values for 1/9 at

which protection becomes preferable lie between those of the earlier cases

with aâ€”O and aâ€”l. Also, we find as before that the North can only be harmed

by a failure of the government of the South to protect its patent rights.

       Our last inquiry concerns the implications of intellectual property

rights for world welfare when protection induces a licensing agreement.

Allowing once again for an arbitrary value of a, we obtain



(29)         sgn (0NP -   â€” sgn (-729(5-a)(l+a) + 486(l-a)(2+Sa) +

                                   lO82(l-2a)(3-5a) -   l63(l-2a)2)


The expression ott the right-hand side of (29) always is negative for a E [0,1]

and y in the range where licensing obtains. Thus, contrary to our findings in

Section II where licensing was considered to be infeasible, we find now that

protection of intellectual property rights always enhances global efficiency

when trade in technology can take place. Patent protection with licensing

allows the world to enjoy both widespread dissemination of knowledge and the

benefits of more intense product-market competition, while avoiding the
                                       22

disincentive effects that plague a weak system of intellectual property-rights

where infringement on patents is pervasive.



IV. Conclusions

     In this paper we have studied the incentive that a government in the

South has to protect the intellectual property rights of Northern firms, and

the consequences of the decision taken by the South for welfare in the North

and for efficiency of the world equilibrium. We have conducted our partial

equilibrium analysis in the context of a competition between a single Northern

producer and a single Southern producer selling some good to an integrated

world market. In this competition, only the Northern firm has the ability to

conduct R&D in order to lower its production costs, but the Southern firm can

imitate costlessly if patent protection for process innovations is not

enforced by the government of the South.

     We found that, contrary to the commonly-voiced polemic of the U.S.

government, the interests of the North and South generally conflict in this

matter of international economic relations. Unless the South comprises a

majority share of the market for the good whose technology is subject to

improvement or the prospects for cost-savings through R&D are quite

substantial, social welfare in the South will be higher when it eschews

protection of foreign intellectual property than when it succumbs to pressure

from the North. The North, on the other hand, always benefits from having the

patents of its firm respected outside its borders. Surprisingly, perhaps, the

global comparison can go either way; protection of intellectual property

rights enhances world efficiency when productivity in R&D is great, but not

when innovations are likely to be small. What is at stake here is the
                                        23

familiar conflict between the benefits of widespread diffusion of technology

and the increased competition that such diffusion entails, and the costs of

dampened incentives to generate technological breakthroughs.

     Needless to say, our results hinge on the special assumptions we have

introduced. Most important, we feel, are our restriction to situations of

duopoly and our exclusion of any possibility of innovation in the South. With

more Southern firms and some scope for technological improvement there

(including improvements that only serve to move the country closer to the

world technological frontier), a strong system of protection for intellectual

property may be necessary to prevent the Southern firms from appropriating

technologies from each other. Yet some countries have been known to afford

unequal treatment to foreigners in patent enforcement procedures (see ITC,

1988, p. 3.7).   So protection of domestic and foreign property need not

always go hand in hand, the provisions of the Paris Convention for the

Protection of Industrial Property notwithstanding.

     Our findings may contain an important lesson for negotiators in the

Uruguay Round. Until now, the industrial countries have maintained the

posture that governments in the South ought to respect Northern claims for

property rights over knowledge and technology partly as a matter of moral

principle and partly in their own self interest.     If, as our analysis

suggests, the South benefits by "borrowing freely from the technologies

produced in the North, then it may be more productive for the Northern

governments to abandon this high moral position and treat the issue of

intellectual property as they would any other one of conflicting national

interests. In particular, if protection of intellectual property does indeed

enhance global efficiency, as our analysis shows to be the case at least for
                                       24

substantial innovations, then the North ought to be willing and able to

compensate the South for any losses that it would incur in the course of

providing such protection. The format of the GATT negotiations presumably

presents an ideal opportunity for effecting such compensation as Southern

concessions on this issue might readily be exchanged for Northern concessions

on some others (greater market access for Southern exports?)

1. Responding to a survey conducted by the International Trade Commission
(1988), 101 U.S. corporations cited lost export sales in 1986 due to
inadequate foreign protection of intellectual property of $6.16 billion.
sixty-four respondents claimed lost sales in the United states totaling $1.80
billion. An additional $3.11 billion of lost royalty payments was noted by
104 respondents to the ITC survey. The ITC estimates that, for the companies
in its sample, sales of infringing goods may have represented an average
profit reduction of 10 percent in 1986. The International Anti-
Counterfeiting Coalition estimates total annual losses of domestic and foreign
sales by U.S. firma due to inadequate protection of intellectual property of
approximately $20 billion (see Benko, 1987).

2. Further to its survey of U.S. corporations, the ITC (1988) reports that 122
companies cited fifty-four countries as having inadequate protection of patent
rights for foreignera, while eighty-four respondents cited fifty-two countries
as providing insufficient protection for copyrights. The countries most
commonly cited in this regard are Mexico, Taiwan, Brazil and Korea. For
diacuasion of the alleged inadequacies of foreign protection of U.S.
intellectual property, see ITC (1988, Ch.3).

3. For an analysis of iasuea arising from foreign counterfeiting of domestic
trademarka, ace Groaaman and Shapiro (1988a, l988b).

4. We use an uppercaae Roman letter to denote a variable relating to the North
and the corresponding lowercase letter for the analogoua variable for the
South. Greek letters are reserved for parameters.

5. For an analysis of a (closed-economy) R&D game with costly imitation, see
Katz and Shapiro (1987).

6. We assume in all cases that a is sufficiently large so that the non-
negativity constraint on c does not bind.

7. We restrict attention to y C 4, so that R&D remains finite at the monopoly
optimum.

8. We compare (7n) with (l2n), (l7n), and (l5n), for values of -y that give
rise to duopoly, strategic predation and monopoly, respectively. In each case
it is possible to show that w -  W   > 0 at 9â€”1, and that the derivative of
this difference with respect to 9 is positive for all y in the relevant range.

9. As Katz and Shapiro discuas, the firms will prefer to negotiate contracts
calling for royalties on a per-unit output basis, because such provisions can
be used to enforce collusive arrangements in the product market. However,
these typea of contracts might be difficult to monitor and enforce, and might
also bring the firms into conflict with the antitrust authorities.

10. These findings accord with the more general results reported in Katz and
Shapiro (1985). They show for general demand functions and an arbitrary form
of static, oligopolistic competition (satisfying certain intuitive conditions)
a small innovation always is licensed if the two firms initially share common
costs, and that the set of parameters for which licensing obtains is strictly
smaller than the set that gives rise to monopoly in the absence of licensing.
