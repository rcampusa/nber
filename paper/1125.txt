         DEFINING A UNITARY BUSINESS: AN ECONOMISTS VIEW



                              Abstract


     The definition of a unitary business has figured prominently
in several recent decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court on the

constitutionality of state corporate income taxes. This paper

employs economic analysis to frame a three part test of whether a
unitary business exists. Underlying the tests is the notion that
                                                                       a
unitary business exists when separate accounting cannot

satisfactorily isolate the profits of individual firms. The first
test is common control. The' second is whether transfer
                                                        priees on
transactions within the group could be manipulated or are diifjou1t
to verify or substantial vertical integration, shared costs,

economies of scale or scope, or other forms of economic
interdependence make isolation of profits of affiliated     firms
impossible.   The thIrd test i.s one of substantiality.

I.   Introduction

     There is no longer significant disagreement that formula apportionment

is required to divide the domestic income of a multistate firm engaged in a

single unitary business among the states in which it has taxable nexus.1

Separate accounting, whether applied on a geographic or functional basis,

simply does not generally provide a satisfactory division of the income of

a unitary business among the various states.2 The reason for the made—

quacy of separate accounting under these conditions, as stated in words

that have become part of the conventional wisdom in this area, is its fail—

ure to recognize that the various parts of the unitary business (split

along functional or geographic lines) are "dependent upon or contributory

to each other. 3

     Some states respect the legal distinction between separately incor-

porated firms, no matter how closely the various members of groups of firms

may be affiliated. These states employ separate accounting for each firm

and, at most, ask whether a given firm is engaged in more than one unitary

business. Other states look beyond the legal fiction of separate incorpor—

ation to ask whether two or more members of a group of affiliated firms are

jointly engaged in a unitary business. If they are, they are required (or

allowed) to file a combined rport in order to determine the income that is

to be taxed by the state in question.4 Unitary combination is
                                                                practiced
most notably by California, but increasingly other states are applying this

approach, especially in taxing oil companies.5

    Taxpayers generally argue that combination can result in taxation of
extraterritorial values (prohibited by the due process clause of the U.S.

Constitution), discrimination against interstate commerce (a violation of

the commerce clause), and, when applied on a worldwide basis, violation of

U.S. treaty obligations.6 States, for their part, typically argue that

separate accounting cannot adequately isolate the income of firms engaged

in a unitary business and that combination is required if firms are not to

be allowed to use legal form to reduce taxes artificially, especially

through manipulation of the internal transfer prices required for separate

accounting predicated on legally distinct incorporation. The treatment of

arguably foreign source income and of intercorporate dividends, as well as

the definition of a unitary business, have figured especia.lly prominently

in cases recently decided by the U.S. Supreme Court or before it as'this is

written .

     The need to define a unitary business with clarity and certainty is

readily apparent from even this brief description.8 Indeed, in Mobil the

U.S. Supreme Court stated clearly and unequivocally that "the linchpin of

apportionability . .    . is   the unitary—business principle,"9 and in Exxon,

ASARCO, and Woolworth, as well as in Mobil, the Court considered explicitly
                                               -

whether unitary businesses existed)0

     Whether a unitary business exists in a given instance depends on the

economic realities ——   the    presence and strength of the contribution and de-

pendency between the activities of various affiliated firms or parts of

firms. Yet little has been written by economists about the proper test for

a unitary business, at least outside the context of litigation. The pre—

sent paper is an attempt to provide an ob5ective and nontechnical —— and in
                                                                                 3.


 some respects still preliminary ——      discussion   of what an economist would

 reasonably consider a unitary business to be.

      In   focusing on   the definition of a
                                          unitary business, I deliberately
 set aside important related issues, including the general need for inter-
state uniformity in taxing corporate income and the particular need for

uniformity in determining taxing nexus and in choosing the apportionment

formula to be applied.1- Moreover, I avoid the highly controversial —— and

partly noneconomic ——     issue   of whether unitary combination should be ap-
plied on a worldwide basis.12



     Suppose that the ProMax group consists of
                                                      two commonly owned and con-
trolled firms, A and B. Our conceptual problem is to determine whether (1)

ProMax consists of one unitary business
                                               or (2) firms A and B are ech en-
gaged in separate businesses. The basic test to be applied is whether,
within a reasonable degree of accuracy,
                                               separate accounting can be used to
isolate the individual profits of the two affiliated firms. If not, the
two firms should be deemed to be engaged in a unitary business. To answer

the question we examine various
                                     reasons separate accounting might not
measure profits adequately. Not surprisingly, vertical transactions and

various forms of interdependence will be found to lie at the heart of

economic unity. I do not initially discuss
                                                  the role played by common
ownership and control, which is the subject of the fourth section. For the

purpose of the second and third sections it will be convenient
                                                                     to assume
that common ownership of firms A and B is complete and that there is no

issue of common control.

    The definition of a unitary business
                                                adopted here is, to a large
degree, tautological. That is, formula apportionment —— and
                                                                   combination,
                                                                          4.


in the case of mu)tiple firms ——   is   needed because, in general, separate

accounting cannot satisfactorily divide income among affiliated firms or

parts of one or more firms engaged in a unitary business.'3 By implica-

tion, then, a unitary business is the smallest division of a firm or group

of firms, the income of which can generally be accurately indicated by

separate accounting.14 The remainder of this paper is an elaboration of

this basic tautology. Of course, there may be instances in which separate

accounting cannot, strictly speaki,pg, isolate the income of individual

firms, and yet the potential error in measurement of income would be so

small that it would be unreasonable to require combination. Thus provision

is made (in the fifth section) for a de minimus test of substantiality.



     The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section dis-

cusses vertical integration and the potential for manipulation, inaécuracy,

or nonexistence of transfer prices. The third section examines vane

other potential types of economic interdependence between firms. TF

fourth section examines the roles of ownership and control and stre

importance of autonomous decision making in the test of unity. The

 section discusses the need for a test of substantiality, summarizes

discussion up to that point, and compares my criteria for finding t

 unitary business exists with several others, especially that of Jer

 Nellerstein, a vocal advocate of a particular, somewhat more restri

 but more objective test. The final section briefly compares the tc

 unity employed by the Supreme Court in Mobil, ASARCO, and Woolwortl

 the criteria I propose.

 II. Vertical Integration and Transfer Pricing

      In the next section we examine a variety of
                                                    economic interrelations
 that might link two affiliated firms
                                        together so closely that it would be

conceptually impossible to use separate accounting to divide their joint

 income between them satisfactorily, if the interrelations are substantial.

In such cases the firms should be treated
                                            as unitary for state tax pur-
poses. In the first part of this section we examine a much simpler case ——

one in which, by assumption, there
                                   are no such interrelations.15 In such
cases the firms involved are not inherently unitary,
                                                       since, in principle,

separate accounting could, by assumption, isolate the income of the various

firms. Nonetheless, if there is a substantial volume of transactions
                                                                     among
the firms, it may be possible, in the absence of concerted administrative

action, for affiliated firms to manipulate the
                                                 prices, fees, or other
charges made for the transfer of goods and services between them and there-

fore to attribute too much income to low—tax (or no tax) states and too

little to high—tax states.16 Moreover, even under these very restrictive

assumptions of independence of operations there may he cases where it is

conceptually impossible to isolate the income of the various affiliated

firms. Unitary combination is generally appropriate if the volume of

interaffiliate transactions in goods and services with no readily deter-

mined value is substantial. Finally,
                                        more far—reaching vertical intégra—
tion may be based on economic interdependence that renders accurate
                                                                    sep-
arate accounting impossible and leads to a finding of unity,

    A. Simple Inaccuracy of Transfer Pricing

     Suppose that affiliated firms A and B each operate in one state (A and

B, respectively) and nowhere else. State A has an income tax and state B

does not. Firm A operates a large couercia1 farm on which it raises wheat
                                                                                 6.

and hogs. Firm B buys wheat from firm A, mills it, and sells flour in bulk

to bakeries. It also sells some of the by—products of milling for use as

animal feed; firm A buys some of these by—products to feed its hogs. Ex-

cept for common ownership and control there is no other interdependence

between the two firms. Assume for argument's sake that the markets for

wheat, flour, the milling by—products used as animal feed, and hogs are

perfectly   competitive, so that there are readily identifiable market values
for each    of the four commodities. Finally, assume that the prices of all

other inputs of both firms are also beyond the control of those firms.

     Given these very restrictive assumptions, there is no conceptual dif-

ficulty in isolating the income of the two firms.7 But there is also no

difficulty in seeing how transfer prices could be manipulated to shift in-

come from firm A and state A, where it would be taxed, to firm B aiid state

B, where it would not be taxed. Wheat could simply be sold by firm A to

firm B at below the market price, or milling by—products could be sold by

firm B to firm A at inflated prices. A slightly more sophisticated ap-

proach would be for firm A to sell wheat on credit to firm B, charging

interest rates below market rates, or for firm B to sell to firm A on

credit   at above market rates)8
     There are basically two ways to deal     with this problem. One is to

employ   separate accounting, supplemented by a standard of arm's—length
pricing. This is the way international transactions between affiliated
firms are treated under section 482    of   the U.S. Internal   Revenue   Code. The
other    is to avoid the administrative burden of such an approach by ruling

 that substantial intercorporate transactions between affiliates constitute

prima facie evidence that a unitary business exists and that combination ——

and with it formula apportionment of the income of the two firms ——         is   ap—
                                                                                          7.


 propriate in such cases.

       There can be little doubt that under the highly restrictive assurnp—

 tions of the example just presented separate accounting is the conceptually

 preferred approach. But once costs of administration and compliance are

 considered, the proper choice becomes less obvious.'9 The precision made

 possible by separate accounting may simply not be worth the cost of verify—

 ing the transfer prices employed in thousands of transactions between af-

filiates. This conclusion is strengthened once one adds more realism to

the example.

       B. Absence of Arm's—Length Prices

       Suppose, for example, that we are dealing with components of automo-

biles manufactured by firm A expressly for firm B and sold to no one else,

rather than with the relatively simple set of transactions outlined above.

(At this point we do not relax the assumption that there is no other inter-

dependence between the firms.) In        this    case there is no       independently
verifiable   arm's—length price to use in auditing transfer prices assigned
to   the components, and   surrogates   must    he            if
                                                     found,        separate   accounting. is
to   be employed. Troublesome problems also arise in valuing patents that are

not generally licensed, specialized services provided only to affiliates,

and loan guarantees.

      The U.S. Internal Revenue Code provides three methods of determining

transfer prices for tangible property when, as in this example, there is no

comparable uncontrolled price.20 These are (1) resale price, (2) cost

plus, and (3) other methods. The resale price method
                                                                    attempts to compute a
transfer price by deducting the customer's gross markup (value added plus

profit margin) from the amount realized on resale after further processing.

By comparison, the cost plus method bases the allowable transfer price on
                                                                           8.


the supplier's cost plus a profit margin. In both cases the problem is to

determine the appropriate markup, something that is generally inherently

impossible to do with precision.2' The regulations provide no guidance in

applying the third (other) method that can he used if neither of these

surrogates for an uncontrolled price provides a satisfactory estimate of

transfer prices.

     Implementation of section 482 is notorious for its many difficul-

ties.22 It is hardly surprising that many states have not wanted to follow

the federal government down the road to separat.e accounting and have opted

instead for combination and formula apportionment in instances where a sub-

stantial volume of transactions occurs between affiliated firms.

     Though one can have considerable sympathy with this state reaction,

another important question arises: in   the   simpler case described in the

first part of this section, should proof of actual manipulation of transfer

prices   be required for a finding of unity, or is the potential for manipu-
lation enough? (Presumably the conceptual impossibility of accurate trans-
fer prices   for a substantial flow of products would ordinarily justify a

finding of unity.) On the one hand, unused potential to manipulate trans

fer prices does not result in actual mismeasurement of income. But basing

the test on actual manipulation would mean    that   states would have to per-

form mini—482 audits to see whether manipulation was occurring and would

allow (indeed, encourage) firms to play an audit lottery. Besides that, it

would contribute greatly to uncertainty. All things considered, it seems

that where transactions between affiliates are virtually all in homogeneous

products and occur on commercial terms, including easily verifiable free—

market prices and interest rates, and there is no other important inter—

dependence, separate accounting is appropriate; otherwise, the potential
                                                                                     9.


 for substantial mismeasurement should
                                         generally he enough to justify com-
bination.

       C. Reasons for Vertical Integration

       If two commonly owned firms (or divisions within a single firm) were

connected by a flow of goods and payments
                                              occurring strictly at market
prices and nothing more, we might wonder why they were commonly owned. In

fact, this state of affairs is probably quite
                                                  rare; especially in manufac-
turing, a substantial volume of vertical transactions
                                                                 probably generally
implies something not captured in market prices.., namely vertical integra-

tion.23

       Oliver Williamson has emphasized savings in transaction costs as an

important explanation of vertical integration. When vertical activities in

the production—distribution chain are organized within one firm, there is

less need to shop around, less difficulty in appraising products and

services, less expense in contracting, more certainty of supply (and of

markets), and more flexibility in adapting to changing conditions.24

       Williamson argues that contracting via markets may be especially dif-

ficult when major investments in highly specific fixed assets are required

at various stages in the production—distrjbtj0 process or where there is

substantial possibility that product quality may be debased; under these

circumstances firms may integrate forward or backward. Specificity bf            as-
sets is important because no one wants to be left "holding the bag" —— when
the bag contains an expensive single—use     asset ——   if   a   supplier or customer
does   not perform as expected. Vertical integration can overcome this im-

pediment based on limited knowledge and fear of treachery.25
                                                                        Similarly,
firms can assure the quality of supplies
                                           by integrating backwards or assure
the   quality of distributors by integrating forward and thereby avoid de—
                                                                               10.


basement of quality.26 Advantages of vertical integration based on these

types of savings in transaction costs are difficult to quantify and allo-

cate between the various firms in a group (or divisions within a firm).

Certainly they may not be adequately captured and allocated by transfer

prices, and uncontrolled market prices are, in the nature of things, likely

to   be virtually nonexistent. I   return to this point in the surrmary   of   this

section.

      Economies of scale (described more fully in the first part of the next
section) can also make vertical integration attractive. In many areas of

American industry there is room for only a few firms that can fully realize

economies of scale. This leads to at least two (potentially related)

reasons for vertical integration. First, industries with only a few firms

often tend to be characterized by noncompetitive pricing. Where this is

true, downstream (upstream) firms may be able to capture some of the pro-

fits from noncompetitive pricing by integrating backwards (forwards).27

Where this occurs, it is difficult to know how to allocate the extra-

ordinary profits between affiliates via separate accounting.28

       Second, vertical integration may sometimes be a defensIve strategy.

That is, suppose that one firm sees its competitors absorbing some of its

formerly independent upstream suppliers, perhaps for reasons such as those

specified above.29 Rather than being left in the precarious position of

relying on the even smaller number of suppliers left after the mergers,

including those owned by its competitors, the firm may decide to absorb a

supplier (or start its own supplying firm or division). Again, profits of

the affiliates may be hard to isolate under these circumstances.

       One alleged result of economies of scale that illustrates several

points   made thus far figured significantly in the finding of economic unity
                                                                             11.


in the Exxon case. Refining is a highly capital—intensive link between the

production of crude oil and the distribution of refined
                                                           products. Because
of the enormous fixed costs and relatively modest
                                                     operating costs, it is
crucial to run refineries at near full capacity. Therefore, the state of

Wisconsin argued, it is important to assure both reliable sources of supply

and dependable markets, and profits attributable to the Dductiort, refin-

ing, and marketing functions of an integrated oil company cannot be iso-

lated.30

     In a fully competitive environment, this argument would have little

weight, since crude oil could simply be obtained on the open market and

refined products could be sold at competitive prices. But in an imper-

fectly competitive world, avoiding shortages, squeezes, gluts, and so forth

products would make to the profitability of the refining function.    Similar
situations obviously exist in other industries.

    ID. Summary Statement: Manipulation or Synergism?
                                                                                 12.

     In this section I have identified three "levels" of vertical interac-
tions that could lead to a finding of unity. Of course, these three are
not   always easily distinguishable. First, there are situations in which

standardized products with readily determinable prices pass vertically

between affiliates. In this case the primary issue is whether transfer

prices are being manipulated or for some other reason fafl to reflect

market prices. If no further interdependence is present, such cases are

not inherently unitary, and separate accounting could satisfactorily

isolate the income of the various affiliated firms, since, by assumption,

uncontrolled prices exist. On the other hand, it is easy to understand the

states' preference for.the administrative convenience of formula apportion-

ment in such cases.

       More complicated are situations in which vertical transactionè involve

nonstandardized products for which there are no readily known free-market

prices. In such cases tax administrators auditing returns based on separ-

ate accounting must resort to tests such as those provided in section 482

for use when uncontrolled prices do not exist. In this case the argument

strative   convenience; in extreme cases accurate separate accounting may

simply not be feasible.

       The third level of complication involves such complete vertical inte-

gration that it is basically hopeless to employ separate accounting in the

effort to isolate the income of vertically related affiliates. In such

cases economic interdependence is so great that even if uncontrolled prices

exist, their use may not adequately reflect the contributions of the com-

ponent parts to the income of the entire unitary business. In such cases

formula apportionment is appropriate.
                                                                          13.


    This may be a useful point at which to introduce a distinction between

two somewhat different reasons separate accounting may fail to isolate the

income of affiliated firms.33 In the first case the total income of two

firms does not significantly depend on whether or not they are affiliated,

hut the division of income between them for tax purposes may. The simple

vertical transactions described in the first part of this section illus-

trate this case. Sharing the expenses of a constant—cost operation (de-

scribed in the next section) is another example. In both cases we are

dealing primarily with the division between firms of a total amount of

profits that does not depend on whether the firms are affiliated. In such

cases, the failure of separate accounting —— and the need for unitary com-

bination ——   is   primarily administrative, not conceptually inherent. Sec-

tion 482, at least implicitly, is designed to deal with this situation.

     In the second case the joint profits of the two affiliated firms are

substantially greater than the sum of the profits of the two firms would be

if they acted independently.34 Among reasons for this phenomenon that we

have already identified are savings in transaction costs (based on speci-

ficity of assets and avoiding debasement of quality) and economies of

scale. Other important sources of economic interdependence that create

this type of synergism are discussed in the next section. In these cases

the firms are conceptually unitary in the sense that it is inherently

impossible to split the joint profits between them with scientific pre-

cision. Separate accounting based on arm's—length pricing rules are bound

to fail under these circumstances.35

     The case of automobile components described above could fall in either

of these categories, depending on the facts. Advocates of section 482 pro-

cedures implicitly assume that it falls in the first. Advocates of unitary

combination, on the other hand, contend that the prerequisites for applying

a section 482 approach are unlikely to be found in practice.



III. Contribution and Dependence

    Thus far we have concentrated on vertical patterns of interdependence.

More controversial is what might he called horizontal interdependence ——

interrelations   between affiliated firms in which one is not the customer of

the other ——   that    call for a finding of unity.    (Of course, in any given

case, horizontal and vertical interdependence may be found together.) All

the important reasons for a finding of unity based on horizontal

interdependence fall iit the second (synergism) category described in the

last part of the previous section.

    A. Interdependence in Supply: Economies of Scale and. Scope

    Economies of scale constitute one of the most pervasive potential

sources of interdependence in supply. Such economies exist when output can

be increased by some given multiple (2 for example) by increasing all

inputs by a connon, hut smaller multiple (say by 1.8). Common examples

include those based on the technical relationship between diameter and

area; when the diameter ——      of   pipelines, cylindrical storage facilities,

and so forth —    is    doubled, capacity is four times as large. This implies

that two equally large and adjacent markets can be served by a trunk

pipeline only some 40 percent (the square root of two, minus one) larger

than that needed to serve one of them. If affiliated firms A and B served

the two markets but shared the joint trunk pipeline, we could not sci—

entifically determine the profit of either, for there is no way of knowing

what fraction of the total cost of the large pipeline (between 41.4 percent

and 100 percent of the cost of a separate pipeline) to allocate to one of
                                                                              15.


 the markets and the firm serving it, and how much to the other.36

      The implications of this example go well beyond those of an attempt to

 employ separate geographic accounting for several firms (and jurisdictions)

 served by one pipeline or by common
                                       storage facilities. Economies of scale
 exist in the maintenance of inventories
                                           that, from an economic and
mathematical point of view, resemble those just discussed. This implies

 that two firms acting jointly can maintain an optimal level of inventories

at lower total cost than if each maintained its
                                                   own inventories. Again, it
would be impossible to determine the separate profits of two affiliated

firms following such a course.

     If two affiliated firms shared
                                       a pipeJine or storage faci]ities or
maintained joint inventories, they might be seen immediately to benefit

from important economies of scale; this would probably lead directly
                                                                     to a
finding of unity. What may be less obvious is that the same theory applies

to inventories of a very important commodity held
                                                     by all firms, regardless
of their line of business: cash balances.
                                              That is, two firms with ready
access to the same pool of financial resources
                                                  can economize on the cash
they need to keep in their vaults or in low—interest
                                                        liquid deposits.37
     Fixed costs resulting from indivisibilitjes are a second important

source of economies of scale. Once the initial
                                                  investment has been made in
accounting systems, legal departments, research labs, and so forth, it may

be possible to expand their output without
                                             increasing their inputs (and
their costs) proportionately. Various rules of thumb are used by cost

accountants to allocate fixed costs among firms. For example, if variable

costs can be attributed accurately to the two firms, fixed costs may be

allocated in the same proportion.
                                    Nonetheless, there is no scientific
basis for this or any other allocation of fixed
                                                  costs. Thus, profits of
                                                                                 16.

individual   firms sharing the facility characterized by fixed costs cannot

be measured accurately by separate accounting.

      It is important to note that many economies of scale of this type may

be   available over only a relatively limited range of output. That is,

there may be economies of scale, for example, in processing credit charges

and patent applications, hut only up to a point; beyond that, these may

essentially be constant—cost activities.38 Where constant costs prevail at

all levels of output, there is no synergistic effect of affiliation; there

is only the need to determine the costs attributable to each of the affil-

iates. Even econondes of scale that are exhausted at a scale far below the

actual scale of operation do, strictly speaking, imply that not all profits

can be split accurately between two firms sharing the fixed facility. But

these unallocable costs may be so small, in relative terms, that they can

safely be ignored without seriously affecting the division of income be-

tween the firms. Where that is true, it would be improper to characterize

otherwise separate activities as part of a unitary business.39 Much the

same thing can he said of economies that may be small in relative terms,

even though they are not fully exhausted at the actual level of operation.

It   makes no sense to predicate a finding of unity on scale economies that
could not possibly significantly distort the       measurement of incotne.4° In

any given situation the relative importance of economies of scale resulting

from fixed costs ——   or   from other sources ——   is   an empirical question.

This point is pursued further in the fifth section.

       Top—level management may be one of the inputs to modern corporate ac-
tivity in    which the range of potential economies of scale based on indivi—
sibilities    is the greatest.41 Economies of scale in rese.arch and develop—

ment (R and D) and the exploitation of knowledge based on R and D may also
                                                                          17.



lie near this end of the spectrum. The point is not that additional ex-

periments can be conducted with the same set of test tubes and scientists;

indeed, much research may, after a point, be characterized by roughly con-

stant returns to scale. The important thing about research in the present

context, aside from the synergism that sometimes occurs in large industrial

labs, is the fact that once discovered, knowledge can he applied to produce

output ranging from negligible to virtually unlimited. For example, once a

given pain killer has been discovered, one capsule or one billion capsules

can be produced. Similarly, the technology of under water exploration and

development can be used by the petroleum industry to drill one well or one

hundred.

      Much of what has been said up to this point in this section can he

reoriented slightly and brought together under the general headingof

economies of scope, a term that has appeared in the economics literature

only within the past decade.42 Such economies exist when the cost of

producing two or more products jointly is less than the sum of the costs of

producing them separately. They arise from the sharing or joint use of. in-

puts; for example, if a given input is imperfectly divisible or has the

property of a public good, once the input is acquired for one use it is

available for others.43 Economies of scope have been offered as reasons

for   both horizontal diversification and vertical integration.
      B. Transaction Costs and Horizontal Diversity
      The existence of economies of scope sets the    stage for one explanation

for the existence of multiproduct firms. In some instances economies of

scope can be realized by a sparate firm that sells services subject to

these economies to other entities. (For example, a firm that owns a pipe-

line might sell transportation services to two separate firms serving
                                                                          18.



nearby markets.) But in others it will be more economical to save trans-

action costs by organizing activities internally (for example, by having

expensive, highly specialized assets owned by one member of a multiproduct

group of firms).

      One explanation for the benefits of organization of production and

distribution within firms (or groups of firms), rather than between

unaffiliated firms, emphasizes the savings in transaction costs it

a1lows.4 Following Williamson, Teece has emphasized the role of

"transactions difficulties" in explaining the existence of multiproduct

firms where know—how is an important input.45 Because of the peculiar

nature of information ——   "its   value for the purchaser is not known until he

has the information, but then he has in effect acquired it without cost" ——

it   is difficult for markets to effect its transfer between firms effici-

ently;46 buyers have difficulty in determining the value of information,

and sellers are reluctant to disclose it. These problems are compounded by

the fact that know—how often cannot simply be transferred via b!ueprints or

instruction manuals, because it involves an important element of learning—

by—doing. Markets are most likely to handle the transfer of information

between firms satisfactorily where the information to be transmitted is not

 proprietary, the application is not specialized, and transfers are infre-

 quent.47 But where information is proprietary, it is used in specialized

 applications, and transfers of know—how occur frequently, it is more likely

 that new applications will he effected within multiproduct firms or groups

 of firms, rather than through market transactions.

       Teece identifies technological know—how, transfer of managerial and

 organizational know—how, and goodwill (including brand loyalty) as types of

 assets where market mechanisms may fail and for which intrafirm transfers
                                                                          19.



are superior to interfirm transfers. The very nature of this argument

suggests that there is no market price for the services being provided, and

that affiliated firms able to benefit from the sharing of such knowledge

will have lower costs than if they were unaffiliated. Therefore the

profits of the individual affiliated firms making joint use of this kind of

information cannot he isolated. If the savings in transaction costs

resulting from internal organization are substantial, unitary combination,

rather than separate accounting, is the proper approach.

     It may be worthwhile to emphasize at this point a potentially crucial

difference between this and the previous case of shared costs.48 Some

shared activities may occur at near constant costs or may be ancillary to

the basic operation of a business and sufficiently unimportant in relative

terms that their allocation èould not seriously affect the divisiofl of

income between firms arguably engaged in different businesses; legal or

accounting services may be an example. In such cases, separate accounting

with arbitrary allocation of the shared costs may be appropriate, and com-

bination may produce quite artificial results. y comparison, the impor-

tant feature of some expenses may be not that they are shared but that they

create such interdependence between activities of various affiliated firms

 that separate accounting cannot isolate the income of the firms engaged in

 joint activities; where this occurs unitary apportionment is required, even

 if the expenses are relatively minor.

      C. Externalities

      External economies and diseconomies, or externalities, exist when the

 activities of one firm create benefits or costs for another firm for which

 the first is not compensated.49 Examples of external diseconotnies are

 legion; pollution in its many forms is the best example. Important exter—
                                                                            20.


nal economies are harder to find. Standard examples include general train-

ing (that is, training that is not job—specific) and the flower gardener

who cannot collect for the benefits the apiary realizes. In what follows I

concentrate on external costs. External benefits are treated at various

other points in this paper. For example, the benefits of advertising spon-

sored by one firm that spill over to affect the demand for the product of

an affiliated firm (considered further in the fourth part of this section)

can be treated as a special kind of externality. (See also "Reasons for

Vertical   Integration" in the preceding section •for a consideration of
avoidance of debasement of quality as a   potential   reason for vertical
integration.)
     Suppose that for technologic—geographic reasons firm A is in a posi-

tion to create air or water pollution that adversely affects the ability

(costs) of affiliated firm B to produce or distribute its product.St Under

certain conditions totally unaffiliated firms would reach bargains by which

firm B would compensate firm A to limit its pollution.51 So, by the same

token, might affiliated but autonomous firms reach similar bargains, inde-

pendently of any direction from above predicated on a desire to maximize

joint profits of the ProMax group. In such a case, separate accounting

might well accurately reflect the distinct income streams of the two affil-

iated firms, just as it might in the case of totally independent, unaffili—

ated firms. In other words, the economic interdependence assumed to result

from the pollution would not necessarily justify characterizing the firms

as part of one unitary business. But there is no reason to believe that

affiliated firms that are not autonomous would strike exactly the same bar-

gain as unaffiliated firms. Indeed, the interaffiliate "bargain" on pol-

lution might simply he a sophisticated way of transferring taxable income
                                                                           21.

between   the affiliates.

       Alternatively, if no such bargain were reached between the affiliated

firms, it might appear that this is prima facie evidence that separate ac-

counting would be satisfactory, as it is for affiliated firms where there

is uncornpensated pollution. But the ProMax board might decide that the

profit—maximizing approach for the group would be to let firm A pollute and

have firm B live with the pollution. Alternatively, the board of ProMax,

might simply mandate that firm A install pollution abatement equipment or

otherwise avoid pollution in order to protect the position of firm B, if

that were the lowest—cost approach.52 In either case it appears that a

finding of a unitary business would be proper.

       It thus appears that in this case objective evidence tells us rela-

tively little about whether or not a unitary business exists. Failure to

prevent pollution could he consistent with either total autonomy of firms A

and B or with a conscious decision that allowing pollution would be the op-

timum policy for the group. Conversely, pollution abatement could occur if

either firms A and B were autonomous but reached an agreement whereby A

would limit pollution in exchange for compensation, or a higher—level decI-

sion were made that group profits would be higher if firm A would limit

pollution.   The issue is confused even further by the fact that efforts to
avoid pollution may he   based   on generally applicable regulations, rather
than   on the goal of maximizing group profits. It may be that in such cases

the only way to determine whether the firms are truly unitary is to examine

the records of meetings of the boards of directors and executive committees

of ProMax. In the absence of such an extreme move, it may be advisable 'to

take important externalities between affiliates, or efforts to prevent them

that do not have benefits beyond the group, in the case of diseconomies, as
                                                                            22.

evidence   that firms are engaged in a unitary   business.   Of course, as in

the case of other forms of interdependence, trivial externalities should

not he allowed to generate a finding of unity.

      B. Interdependence in Demand

      Interdependence can occur on the demand side of firms' transactions,

as well as on the cost side. This can clearly be true when the outputs

produced by two firms are vet; itrorig complements or very strong substi—

tutes. Thus, for example, one might argue that it would be difficult to

separate the profits of affiliated firms operating in the following pairs

of industries producing complements: flashlights and batteries; small

boats and outboard motors; automobiles and gasoline.53 ut there is some-

thing wrong with this argument as stated thus far. The problem is that

market structure has not been considered. Suppose that both flashlights

and batteries were manufactured and sold under perfectly competitive con-

ditions. The products of the two industries might, indeed, be complemen-

tary; but the products of all firms in one of the industries would he in-

terchangeable. Thus no single firm producing flashlights could substan-

tially alter the demand for the batteries produced by its affiliate, say by

altering the price of its own product. Only if neither of the industries

were perfectly competitive (that is, only if neither faced a perfectly

elastic demand curve) would complementarity between products interfere with

the   adequacy of separate accounting to isolate the profits of the two
firms. Two important empirical and judgmental questions must therefore be
answered: how great is the complementarity between the particular products
of   affiliated firms, and how much complementarity is required for a finding

that a unitary business exists?

       This   is   a useful place to consider the role of advertising. One ir—
                                                                            23.



portant purpose of advertising -—       in addition to moving the demand curve
out   ——   is   to differentiate the advertised product from others and thereby

reduce its elasticity of demand. But brand awareness generated by adver-

tising will often carry over to (or span a range of) related products.

(This is, in a sense, a form of jointness or external benefit.) If adver-

tising simultaneously creates the same brand identification for both bat-

teries and flashlights, the two demand curves are not totally elastic or

mutually independent and separate accounting cannot isolate the profits of

two firms producing flashlights and batteries that are linked by advertis-

ing but are otherwise distinct. That is, where brand loyalty based on

advertising is important, interdependence cannot be handled adequately by

simply attributing part (or even all) of the advertising expense to one of

the activities; the activities should be treated as unitary.

  -    Of course, the potential for advertising to unite activities does not

stop with products that are complementary in use. For example, General

Electric's brand indentification and product loyalty can be expected to

span an entire range of otherwise quite unrelated household appliances..54

       Much the same thing can be said about substitutes as about comple-

ments. Though they are not perfect substitutes, coal, fuel oil, wood, and

sweaters are all means of staying warm. Suppose that one firm owned a

woodlot and its affiliate manufactured woolen sweaters. Since both of

these industries are fairly competitive, it seems unlikely that the demand

curves faced by the two affiliates would be highly interdependent. Thus

there seems to be little reason to combine operations of the two firms in

one state tax report, despite the substitutability between wood and wool at

the industry level.

       Consider now the situation of coal and fuel oil. Here it seems much
                                                                         24.


more likely that there might he enough interdependence at the firm   level   to

warrant a finding that separate accounting could not isolate the profits of

two related firms operating in the t.'o fields. But it remains an empirical

question whether the important interdependence occurs on the demand side.

On balance, it seems far more likely that a finding of unity in this case

should be based on shared technology and the savings of transaction costs

discussed in the second part of this section.55

     Market sharing is a final example of interdependence in demand. Sup-

pose that two affiliated firms control a significant fraction of output in

a given industry. Their profits may be greater than if they were unrelated

(or even affiliated, bit autonomous) firms competing with each other.

Moreover, which of the two firms actually supplies various markets, and

therefore the division of taxable income among the states,. may be largely

under the control of the central management of the affiliates. In such a

case it seems only proper to treat the two firms as part of a unitary busi-

ness 56

     Yet another form of interdependence deserves brief mention, though it

deed, it has one foot in each.) This is reciprocal buying. Suppose that

affiliated firms A and B have no transactions with each other and exhibit

none of the forms of interdependence discussed thus far. But the ProMax

board determines that firm A should buy from a third unaffiliated firm C

only if firm C buys from firm B. (Presumably such an arrangement would

make sense only if none of the three firms operated in a competitive in-

dustry, a point we take as given in what follows.) Clearly such a practice

 is likely to prevent the books of account of firms A and .B from accurately

 stating their respective incomes; indeed, it may be theoretically
                                                                            25.


impossible to determine the income of the individual firms under such

circumstances. A conclusion that a unitary business exists is proper if

purchases (sales) resulting from reciprocal buying constitute a large share

of the total purchases (sales) of firm A (firm B).

       E. Risk Sharing

       Sharing of risks is another form of interdependence that
                                                                  might warrant
a finding that a unitary business exists. Moreover, it emphasizes that in

some contexts the test for unity must be placed in a particular time frame.

Suppose, for example, that a given oil company that owns well—established

reserves operates in several states. One interpretation of the facts might

be that (leaving aside.home office expenses, other shared costs, problems

of transfer pricing, and various other complications raised elsewhere in

this
       paper) separate accounting might he employed to determine the produc—
tion   income realized in each state, since petroleum has a readily discern-

ible market value., But this approach would
                                              generally be appropriate only
if a very short—run view of the question were taken or if the discovery of

petroleum involved no risks.57 Such a "snapshot" view of an uncertain and

knowledge—intensive activity may fail to give adequate weight to the inter-

dependence between present activities in a given state and research and

exploration conducted previously or elsewhere.

       To see this, suppose that we were talking about jurisdictions smaller

than states and that nature was such that only one well ——   either   a produc-
ing well or a dry hole —— could be drilled in each jurisdiction, with the

chances of success being totally random and independent of what has occur-

red in neighboring jurisdictions. Would we want to attribute all income of

the producing wells to the jurisdictions where they are located and none to

the "dry—hole" jurisdictions? I think not. If, for some reason, investors
                                                                          26.


could invest in only one well, on an all—or—nothing basis, there might be

relatively little exploration and, consequently, litt]e production.58 In

reality, however, firms diversify by drilling in a larger number of places,

relying on the "law of averages" to give them a mixture of successes and

failures   that   approaches the global probabilities. Moreover, success is

not totally random: firms learn about geological structure from each well,

regardless of whether it is drilled in the same state. That being the

case, it seems inappropriate not to treat a firm with winners and losers

unevenly scattered across jurisdictions as a unitary business.59

     When combined with savings in transaction costs in the transfer of

knowledge (discussed ir the second part of this section) and the potential

for manipulation of transfer prices, the above argument assumes special

significance. Suppose that a given manufacturing firm (A). undertakes

research only in a high—tax state but sells or leases for a nominal amount

all the resulting patents for a nominal amount to an affiliate (B)

producing in a low—tax state. In the absence of combination, firm A would

deduct the cost of both successful and unsuccessful research in reaching

taxable income. But firm B would realize the profits resulting from the

research. This is, essentially, what the states claim happens because of

the federal tax incentives for investment in Puerto Rico.6° They under-

standably argue that the two firms in this example should be considered

engaged in a single unitary business.

     An extreme version of the argument that sharing risks is one attribute

of a unitary business would lead to the conclusion that many conglomerate

corporate groups should be subject to combination. In this view

diversification based on a low covariance of earnings would be enough to

demonstrate unity. I am not comfortable with this view. First, conglomer—
                                                                        27.


ation may provide no diversification that the individual investor cannot

duplicate in the market. If it does not, it does not reduce the group's

cost of capital and there is no gain from affiliation.6' Second, even if

pooling of risks does reduce the group's cost of capital, I am not sure

that that justifies a conclusion that the income of various otherwise

separable firms cannot be isolated.62



IV.   Centralized   Decision Making and Unitary Business

      A. Common Ownershp and Control

      Ownership, along with operation and use, is one of the tests of a uni-

tary business known as.the "three unities" enunciated in Butler Brothers v.

McColgan and condoned by the U.S. Supreme Court.63 Majority ownership is

usually thought to be necessary for a finding that a unitary business
exists, and some observers have suggested that it should also be suffi-
cient.64 Although there may he much to be said for such a straightforward
rule from the point of view of simplicity, certainty, and uniformity, from
an economic point of view common (majority) ownership is neither necessary

nor sufficient for the existence of a unitary business.65

      If the division of income between two companies is to be manipulated

to produce a misleading picture of the firms' respective incomes for tax

purposes, it is generally necessary that the two firms be under common con-

trol. Where common control is lacking, economic interdependence ordinarily

should not lead to a conclusion that a unitary business exists, since it

can generally be assumed that those responsible for running the various

firms will look to the profits of their respective firms. The important

question is the meaning of "control" in this context.66

      The distinction Fama and Jensen make between decision management and
                                                                             28.



decision control is particularly useful.67 Whereas management involves

initiation of proposals and implementation of those that are ratified, con-

trol involves ratification and monitoring of proposals initiated and imple—

inented by management. In this terminology, representatives of owners, as

residual claimants, exercise control but not management in large open

corporations. The crucial question for our purpose, then, is whether

common ownership—control (in the Fama—Jensen sense), when combined with

substantial vertical transactions or other forms of interdependence, is

enough to justify a finding of unity, or whether common (centralized)

management at the operational level is required.68

      It appears to me that common control (as Fama and Jensen use the term)

is the relevant concept and that a requirement of common operational man-

agement    goes too far. Further light can be shed on this q.uestion by con-
sidering the maxim that "a condition of near—decomposability will carac—
terize strategic and operating decisions in a well—managed firm."69 The
general office is responsible for strategic decisions and operating deci-
sions are lodged in the managers of semiautonomous entities. Williamson
notes     that, "a presumption that the general office favors profits over

functional goals is warranted."7° The implication is that in a unitary

business central (controlling) management makes decisions with an eye to

the profits of the whole, not the parts.71

        Actual patterns   of control should be examined in   assessing hether or

not   a   unitary business exists; these patterns may be suggested by patterns

 of ownership, but they may not be. The existence of a majority of common

 board members or of comrnoii top—level management would be especially in—

 structive. Some of the more aggressive states and the Multistate Tax

 Commission (MTC)    have even argued that examination of minutes of meetings
                                                                          29.


of hoards of directors and executive committees is neccessarv if common

control, as manifested in pursuit of common objectives, is to be
discovered. 72

     B. Autonomy and Central Control

     The autonomy of various affiliated firms or divisions within single

firms has been raised in the Exxon, Woolworth, and ASARCO cases. This is

conceptually quite proper, for the top management of a firm (or group of

firms) interested in maximizing aggregate profits can generally concede

autonomy to its constituent divisions (or firms) only under
                                                              very
restrictive conditions.73 These conditions are essentially those under

which we would probably find that the divisions (firms) were not involved

in a unitary business. If the conditions under which
                                                        attempts by
divisional managers to maximize the profits of their djvjsons will

maximize the profits of the entire firm
                                          are violated, top—level management

interested in maximizing profits will either abandon decentralized decision

making or adjust the price signals sent to lower—level managers in such a

way as to induce behavior that will maximize profits for the entire firm.

In either event, we would conclude that there is a unitary business. This

is, of course, as it should be, since we would expect decentralized de-

cision making based on unadjusted transfer prices to lead to the

maximization of the profits of the entire firm only if separate accounting

accurately measures the profits of hidividual d1vis1n5. What then are

some of the reasons decentralized decision maldog aimed
                                                          at maximizing
divisional profits may fail to maximize aggregate profits?

    First, decentralized management cannot be expected to act properly in

the face of declining costs resultiing from economies of scale in the use of

shared facilities.74 Economies of scale would lead to a natural monopoly
                                                                             30.

internal    to the firm. Pricing of the decreasing cost activity to maximize

profits of the division responsible for it would cause it to be underutil-

ized. Profit maximization for the firm requires that internal decisions be

based on transfer prices set equal to marginal (incremental) cost. But if

this is done, divisions responsible for activities subject to declining

costs will incur accounting deficits, since average cost exceeds marginal

cost.

        Second, external costs (and benefits) flowing between divisions are

likely to lead to improper decisions, in the same way that pollution (and

external benefits) prevents the achievement of maximum social welfare. In

the absence of Coase—type bargains, lower—level managers will make the

proper decisions only if pricing signals are adjusted from above to reflect

externalities.

        Third, if   there   is interdependence in production or in demand for the

output of the various divisions (or possibilities for profitable reciprocal

purchases), division managers may not take due account of the effects of

their actions on the profitability of other divisions.75

        Fourth, if their outlook is restricted to their own (perhaps artifi-

cially limited) sphere of activity and the profits of various divisions

have    a low covariance, managers may be more risk—averse than is appropriate
from the group's point of view. Top—level management may need to adjust
signals to lower—level management or        otherwise induce more risk taking.

        Finally,    and in a somewhat different vein, if transfer prices deviate
from market prices (or marginal costs) because they are being manipulated

to minimize taxes (or for other reasons), there is no reason to expect that

the profit—maximizing actions of lower—level managers will lead to global

profit maximization.
                                                                          31.


     All these (and other) examples of the potential failure of decentral-

ized decision making can be overcome (at least in prinicple) by centraliz-

ing certain decisions or by adjusting the pricing signals to which lower—

level managers respond. Either centralization of important decisions or

significant adjustments in pricing signals should thus be considered prima

facie evidence that a unitary business exists.76
                                                   Conversely, one prerequi-
site for a finding that a unitary business does not exist would seem to be

heavy reliance on transfer pricing based on marginal costs and
                                                                 virtually
total autonomy from central direction.77



V. Summary Statement of Criteria

     The analysis of the section II and III suggests that there are two

reasons that are conceptua]ly distinct, though often found together, for

determining that the members of a group of commonly owned and controlled

firms are engaged in a unitary business. First, substantial transactions

between affiliated firms can make it
                                       administratively difficult, and per-

haps impossible, to verify that transfer prices are not being manipulated

to shift income between affiliated firms, and therefore between jurisdic-

tions. This problem is most likely to be significant where there are ver-

tical transactions in goods and services with no uncontrolled market price,

and it becomes insuperable as vertical integration becomes complete. Se—

cond, various kinds of interdependence may make it conceptually impossible

to determine the income of the individual firms.
                                                   Particularly important
are shared costs and other economies of scale and scope and shared

know—how. Though interdependence exists particularly in vertically

integrated production and distribution, it can also explain horizontal

diversification and demand a finding of unity.
                                                                         32.



    Neither of the difficulties described above is likely to be a signi-

ficant source of misstatement of income for tax purposes unless affiliated

firms are under common control, for in the absence of common control, af-

filiated firms can be expected to pursue their own objectives, much as

totally unaffiliated firms do. Thus it appears that a finding of common

control should be one sine qua non of a finding of unity. Conversely,

total autonomy of the individual firms would generally indicate the absence

of unity. Common ownership is usually, but not always, indicative of

common control.

     A. Substantiality

     For shared costs to justify a finding of unity the costs must be

substantial enough that how they are allocated between firms could ser-

iously affect the calculation of profits of the various corporate entities

sharing them. The same is true of interdependence and intercorporafe

transactions; they must be substantial enough that they could cause sep-

arate accounting to fail badly to isolate the profits of the various enti-

ties.78 In other words, it seems essential to have a de minimus provision

that prevents even commonly controlled affiliated firms with only insigni-

ficant amounts of shared expenses, interdependence, or intercorporate

 transactions from being swept into the net of unitary combination.

     The following example illustrates the need for such a rule, in the

 case of shared costs. Suppose that firms X and ? both operate in states A

 and B, only the former of which levies a corporate tax. Suppose further

 that the formula used by state A would result in that state's taxing the

 following fractions of the income of the two firms under separate account-

 ing and under combination: firm X, 66 2/3 percent; firm'?, 25 percent;

 combined, 50 percent. Suppose that each firm has sales of $2,400 and that
                                                                              33.


expenses directly allocable to firms X and Y are $2,000 and $1,LLOO,
                                                                        respec-
tively. Expenses that cannot be allocated are $200. (This could also be

the possible error in transfer pricing; see below.) Thus total profits of

the two firms are $1,200.

     If the two firms file a combined return, state A will tax $600 of this

income. If separate accounting is used, the allocation of the unallocable

expenses becomes important. Suppose, however, that these expenses are at-

tributed entirely to firm Y, the one with the least presence in state A,

the income tax state, as indicated by the apportionment formula.      (This

allocation maximizes the tax base of state A under separate accounting.)

Firm X would report $267 (66 2/3 percent of $400) of income to state A and

firm Y would report $200 (25 percent of $800). The total is only $467, or

substantially less than under unitary combination. Even if the unallocable

expenses were claimed as a deduction by neither firm, under separate ac-

counting the total taxable income in state A would be only $517, still less

than under combination. Combination of the high-income firm with      less
presence   in state A with the low—income firm with greater presence in state
A increases the base apportioned to state A by more   than   the amount of tax
base at stake in the arbitrary allocation of the unal]ocable expenses.
     Though this example was constructed to produce an extreme result, its

lesson is of general applicability. Minor amounts of unallocable expenses
—— with nothing more —— should
                               not be allowed to force use of a combined

report.79 Much the same argument can be made for potential errors in

transfer prices. If transactions between affiliated firms are so insigni-

ficant or the conceivable range of transfer prices is so small that no

imaginable amount of manipulation could seriously affect the division of

income via separate accounting, unitary combination should not be required.
                                                                        34.



    These de minimus rules should not be interpreted as emasculating the

unitary principle. They are intended to apply when there are minor un—

allocable costs, small potential errors in transfer prices, or insigni-

ficant amounts of interdependence, but little or no other interdependence.

In many instances the contribution to group profits cannot be adequately

recognized simply by adjusting transfer prices or the allocation of shared

expenses. Examples might include major benefits of technological know—how,

brand identification, unique managerial capabilities, and vertical inte-

gration. There generally are not well—defined market prices in these

cases, and even if there are, the increased profits such arrangements make

possible may be so considerable that separate accounting cannot adequately

deal with them.

     B. A Three—Stage Test

     The above line of reasoning suggests a three—level test of unity. At

 the first level a finding of complete managerial autonomy to act on the

basis of market—determined pricing signals for inputs and outputs (or

 transfer prices approximating them) would constitute presumptive evidence

 that a single unitary business does not exist. On the other hand, absence

 of autonomy, as evidenced by coimnon control, would suggest that a second

 level of investigation is warranted. At this second level of investigation

 the manipulation of transfer pricing, the impossibility of determining ac-

 curate transfer prices, or vertical integration would lead to a finding

 that a unitary business might exist and would lead to the third level in-

 vestigation into substantiality. So would important shared costs, other

 economies of scale and scope, and other forms of interdependence that make

 isolation of the profits of individual firms impossible. Commonly con—

 trolled firms between which there were few if any shared costs or other
                                                                        35.


economies of scale or scope, only minor amounts of transactions for which

transfer pricing could be an issue, and no other important interdependences

would not be found to be unitary.

     This three—level test can be presented schematically as in Figure 1.

                            FIGURE 1 GOES HERE

If test 1 reveals that there is no common control, a finding of unity can-

not be supported. Only if there is common control do we go to test 2,

whether there are shared expenses, other economies of scale or scope,

intragroup transactions, or other economic interdependence. Test 3 dis-

tinguishes cases in which minor interdependence or allocation of relatively

small amounts of income and expense are involved from those in which prob-

lems of shared expenses, transfer pricing, and interdependence are so vital

that separate accounting cannot be used; this test must also be answered

affirmatively for a finding that there is a unitary business.

     Any test of unity must provide a yes or no answer to the cuestion of

whether combination is appropriate. A determination that two or more firms

are "a little bit" unitary or "mostly" unitary cannot be employed to sug-

gest that a little bit of combination or a lot is proper.8° This is un-

fortunate, because the need for an all—or—nothing answer raises the stakes

involved in reaching the right answer. It a)so makes it especially de-

sirable to he able to specify conceptually clear and relatively objective

tests of what constitutes a unitary business.8'

     It might be relatively easy to legislate simple quantitative standards

for some kinds of shared expenses and intercorporate transactions. It

should also be possible to recognize whether common control exists in given

situations, though specifying the test in law might he more difficult. But

it seems almost impossible to legislate a quantitative standard for the

type or amount of interdependence of various types that would be required

for a ruling of unity.82 Here there seems to be no substitute for subjec-

tive consideration of the facts in individual cases.83

     C. Comparison With Other Tests

    Among the questions states have asked in determining whether groups of

affiliated firms are engaged in unitary businesses is whether the various

firms share insurance, legal, accounting, and tax preparation services;

purchasing; employee benefit plans; and training.84 In and of themselves,

these do not appear to me to be adequate predicates for a finding of a

unitary business. Many of these activities probably confer little benefit

(savings) on the group that would riot   be available to the individual
members. Only if there are substantial economies of scale, other sources

of saving (for example, quantity discounts from common purchasing) or

other reasons separate accounting would fail to isolate the income of the

members is a finding of unity in order. If, for example, the liability for

employee benefits became the joint liability of the group, it might be

impossible to untangle the profits of the various firms. At best, an

affirmative answer to any of these questions should he only the starting

point for further investigation of the economic reality of the matter; it

should not be dispositive.

     Whether firms are in a similar line of business is another commonly

mentioned test of unity that is suggestive but should not be dispositive.85

If vertical integration or market sharing exists, or if there are other

forms of interdependence, affiliated firms in a similiar line of business

are clearly unitary. But if 'there is simply common ownership of two firms

operating in totally different markets with no important economic

interdependence, there is no unitary business. This is true even if       there
                                                                          37.



is counon control, so long as there is no coordination of poflcies.     It may

be difficult to know how to split the cost of central management between

the firms. But in most cases the magnitudes are not large enough that the

split could significantly alter the results of separate accounting.

     Other tests are likely to he much more indicative of a unitary busi-

ness under certain circumstances. For reasons described earlier, joint

advertising and other common aspects of public relations, including logos

and stationery, intercompany finance and loan guarantees, interchange of

expertise, and coordination via shared officers and directors may make it

impossible to rely on separate accounting. These are also discussed brief-

ly in the next part of,this section.

     D. An Alternative Test: Operational Interdependence

      It   appears that the criteria suggested here are broad.ly consistent
with those    proposed by Jerome                though they may be some'what

 more judgmental and may result in a finding of unity in some instances

 where Hellerstein's would not.87 He has suggested that "a business is not

 unitary unless interdependent basic operations are carried on to a

 substantial extent in different states by the branches or subsidiaries that

 comprise the controlled enterprise."88 The italicized words show agreement

 that common control is necessary and that interdependence must be

 substantial.89 e appear to differ about whether sharing of certain

 activities that are not part of basic operating functions in and of itself

  could, in principle, lead to a finding that a unitary business exists.

  Hellerstein argues that:


            The non—basic operating functions of a business, such as
       providing managerial, accounting, personnel, legal, patent or
       similar services, centralized advertising, pension and bene—
       fit plans, and the like, or furnishing capital, important
       though they be to the profits of the enterprise, were not the
                                                                         38.


    types of activities that gave rise to, or that necessitated
    apportionment. In determining the profits of a branch or
    subsidiary, the costs of such internal, non—basi" •.'perations
    can, and often are, regularly determined and charged on a
    cost, gross receipts or similar basis. Obviously, the fair-
    ness of these charges needs to be scrutinized closely, but
    they present nothing like the virtually insurmountable prob-
    lems of determining arm's length transfer prices on sales of
    raw materials, or goods manufactured by one branch or con-
    trolled corporation and sold to another, or on resale by a
    mercantile company of purchased goods. Patents and know—how
    created and owned by one segment of the enterprise, secret
    processes, or the results of research done by one segment of
    the business and made available to the others, are more elu-
    sive and more difficult to pin down. Unless they are basic
    to the enterprise, these items can also be charged on a cost
    or similar basis, or if there is licensing to nonaffiliated
    interests, ona comparable basis.90


    As a practical matter, I would share Hellerstein's view on the items

listed in the first sentence, with the possible exceptions of management,

advertising, and finance. As noted in the previous part of this section,

it- is generally unlikely that any savings resulting from sharing the other

expenses listed or any possibility of manipulation of intercorporate

charges for them could be great enough to distort materially the

calculation of income of the various component firms. On the other hand,

basing combination on them could cause serious distortions of the division

of income, in the way illustrated by the example presented in the first

part of this section. The same may often be true of advertising; it is

unlikely that advertising ordinarily looms large enough to matter much.

But where advertising is an important expense or brand identification

spills over from one division or affiliated firm to another, it may not be

enough simply to charge for advertising costs.9' Like technical knowledge,

brand identification based on joint advertising may justify a finding that

a unitary business exists.

     Finance also causes me to worry, since manipulation of interest rates
                                                                           39.

is   a troublesome area in the administration of the federal tax on multi-

national firms. This concern is compounded by considerations that a sub-

sidiary of a major corporation may be able to borrow on substantially more

favorable terms ——    from its parent or externally —— than if it were totally
independent. Finally, it appears that one must look carefully at the type

and amount of control exercised by central management, along the lines

suggested in section IV. This may or may not be indicative of a unitary

business.

       In its brief to the Supreme Court, counsel, for the Container

Corporation, relying on Hellerstein's writing and its reading of the

decisions in ASARCO and Woolworth, requested that a substantial flow of

products between affiliates be made the bright—line test for the existence

of a unitary business. Such a test would, of course, be much more

restrictive that that proposed in this paper, since under it the various

other types of interdependence described earlier could not be used to

justify a finding of unity.92 Whether it would actually be less

restrictive that Hellerstein's is difficult to know, given the difficult of

defining    precisely the term basic operational interdependence, but it
appears that     it would   be.


VI. Mobil, AARCO, and Woolworth
       It   may be worthwhile to examine briefly the Mobil, ASARCO, and

worth cases to see how the U.S. Supreme Court's apparent views on what

constitutes a unitary business compare with those presented here.93 I con-

centrate on the tests of unity the Court seems to have applied, rather than

on whether it applied them correctly.94 Thus I base the discussion on the

descriptions     and appraisals of the factual situations found in the majority
                                                                          40.


and minority opinions.95

     A. Mobil

     In Mobil the U.S. Supreme Court provided a description of a unitary

business (and the need for the concept) that appears to be totally con-

sistent with what has been written above.

         Separate accounting, while it purports to isolate
         portions of income received in various States, may fafl
         to account for contributions to income resulting from
         functional integration, centralization of management,
         and economies of scale. Because these factors of
         profitability arise from the operation of the business
         as a whole, it becomes misleading to characterize the
         income of0he business as having a single identifiable
         'source.

     The Court seems tQ have found a unitary business in
                                                           Mobil largely by
default, since Mobil did not offer any serious argument that no unitary

business was involved.97 To the extent this is true, one can hardly fault

the Court on that part of its decision.98 It seems, however, rather far—

fetched to believe that Mobil is engaged in a unitary business with most of

the firms listed in footnote 9 of the dissenting opinion by Justice

Stevens, absent evidence that it controls these firms
                                                        (mostly public util-
ities), in which Mobil had only minority interests.99
                                                         At most, it would

appear to be engaged in a unitary business only with the three firms listed

in footnote 5 of the majority opinion, three
                                               wholly owned subsidiaries and

a joint venture (ARANCO), in which it had a 10 percent share. In these

cases one has little difficulty believing there was a unitary business,

even though ARANCO raises the special issue of how to treat joint ventures.

     B. Woolworth

     The majority also appears to have applied principles consistent with

those outlined above in the Woolworth case. It went into considerable de-

tail in documenting the absense of central control
                                                     ("eJach subsidiary per—
                                                                          41.



forms these functions autonomously and independently of the parent com-

pany"100) and the lack of important shared expenses, intercorporate

actions, or other interdependence ("'oolworth's operations ere not

functionally integrated with its subsidiaries"'0' and "There is no flow of

international business. Nor is there any integration or unitary operation

     l02.

     The minority opinion by Justice 0Connor gives three reasons for dis-

agreeing with the majority decision: frequent corunicaticn heteen the

managements of the parent and the subsidiaries, approval of major financial

decisions by the parent, and the publication of consolidated financial

statements.103 There is no suggestion that the frecuent corunications

either invalidated the judgment that the subsidiaries were independent of

the parent or otherwise rendered the firms unitary. The third objection

(consolidated statements) seems to lack substance. Only the second seems

to hold any possibility of being important; but even here there is no sug-

gestion how parent oversight of debt and dividend policy caused distortion

of the division of income between Voolworth and its foreign subsidiaries.

     L. ASA.KL)

     The Court considered that the relationship between ASARCO and Southern

Peru posed the closest question of the five affiliates considered in this

 case. ASARCO owned 51.5 percent of Southern Peru and bought 35 percent of

 its output. Even so, the court found that (1) ASARCO did not control

 Southern Peru and (2) intercorporate transactions occurred at prices over

 which the two firms had no control.104 It thus found no evidence of a

 unitary business.

      In the other parent—subsidiary relations under examination, the Court

 found that ASARCO owned 52.7 percent of a subsidiary but had never elected
                                                                           1L2.


an officer, was prohibited by a consent decree from voting it stock in two

companies in which   it   held roughly 34 percent interests, and had been re-

quired by the fexican government to divest itself of 51 percent of the sub-

sidiary's stock.105 In none of the four instances did the Court find that

ASARCO exercised control over the subsidiaries, all of whom were found to

operate independently. ioreover, the Court found no other     evidence of a
unitary   business and explicitly rejected the view that a uritarv   business
exists if stock is "acquired, managed, or disposed of for purposes relating

or contributing to the taxpayer's business,"106 noting that "this defini-

tion of unitary business would destroy the concept."107

     The dissenting opi,nion, again delivered by Justice O'Connor, argued on

three grounds that ASARCO was involved in a unitary business with its sub-

sidiaries: ASARCO used its knowledge of the nonferrous metals industry to

decide whether to invest in these firms;108 its investment may have

involved interim investment of idle funds from its own primary business;109

and it had effective operational control over at least three of the com-

panies.11° The first of these arguments appears to have no substance. The

second is more difficult to appraise hut is not one that I find convin-

cing.111 The third also seems lacking, except perhaps in the case of the

}iexican subsidiary. At any rate, it is interesting that even the dissent

emphasized control, not mere majority ownership.

     D. Appraisal

     It appears that the Supreme Court agrees with the need to examine the

facts in a given situation to determine whether a unitary business exists.

It said in Exxon, "The court looks to the 'underlying economic realities of

a unitary business,' and the income must derive from 'unrelated business

activity' which constitutes a 'discrete business enterprise.'"312 In
                                                                             43.


ASARCO   it   said, "(T)he application of the unitary—business principle re-

quires   in   each case a careful examination both of the way in which the

corporate     enterprise   is structured and operates, and of the relationship

with the taxing state.'413 The Court's language leaves considerable lat-

itude for alternative interpretations, but the issues to be determined

appear to be roughly those described in Figure 1 above.114 Unfortunately,

the answers to most of the crucial questions are not easily quantifiable.

As Walter Hellerstein has written, "While one can derive some guidance for

the future from the Court's discussion of the facts, the Court's approach

in ASARCO seems to invite an endless stream of litigation over the requis-

ite flow of goods, services, personnel and so forth, that are necessary to

constitute a unitary business."115

     1. This sentence is deliberately worded to preclude the need to con-

sider two issues, the treatment of arguably foreign source income and the

test of taxable nexus, in order to allow us to focus on a third, the def-

inition of a unitary bustness. On the first of these, see George N.

Carison and Harvey Galper, "Water's Edge Versus Worldwide Unitary

Combination," in This Volume, chapter   ,   and the references cited there.

Nor do I consider either the choice of the formula to be used In

apportioning income or the definition and measurement of the "factors" in

the formula. On these questions, see Peggy B. Musgrave, "The State

Corporate Income Tax: PrInciples for the DIvIsIon of Tax Base," This

Volume, chapter

     2. If separate accounting could be applied satIsfactorily on a

geographic basis, it could substitute for formula apportionment.    Func-.

tional separate accounting would presumably need to be supplemented by

formula apportionment to divide the income attributed to the various

functions among   the   states.

     3. This statement of the problem is found in George T. Altman and

Frank P4. Keesling, Allocation of Income in State Taxation (New York:

Commerce Clearing House, 1946), p. 101: "The essential test is whether or
                                                                             2.

not the operation of the portion of the business within the state is
dependent upon or contributory to the operation of the business outside
the state. If there is such a relationship, the business is unitary."
Virtually identical wording is contained in Edison California Stores,         30

Cal.   2d. 1472 (19147) at 1181, the classic case that gave this test judicial

sanction. For a brief history of the development of the unitary concept,

see, for example, Benjamin F. Miller, "Worldwide Unitary Combination: The

California Practice," This Volume, chapter       ,   or   William D. Dexter, "The

Unitary   Concept in State Income Taxation of Multistate—Multinational

Businesses," The Urban Lawyer 10, no. 2 (Spring 1978): 181—212.

       4 In a combined report income of the firms engaged in the unitary

business is added together and intercorporate transactions between the

 firms (most notably dividends) are eliminated. The income of the unitary

 group is then apportioned between the taxing state and others on the basis

 of the factors (e.g., payroll, property, and sales) of the entire group.

 For the distinction between a consolidated return and a combined report,

 see Miller, "Worldwide Unitary Combination."

described   in the text, there are instances in which   firms   wish to employ
unitary combination and states attempt to deny it; see especially the
peculiar   case presently before the U.S. Supreme Court (Chicago Bridge and

Iron Co. v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., U.S. No. 81 — 3149, Oct. 1981), in

which Chicago Bridge and Iron has taken up a case abandoned by the state

of Illinois in attempting to prevent Caterpillar from employing worldwide

combination.

Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Board (U.S. No. 81-523, Oct. 1982),

presently before the Court, is the first case (aside from Chicago Bridge

and Iron v, caterpiiiar, in which the record is quite skimpy) to reach the

Court in whiôh the legality of worldwide application of unitary

combination is explicitly challenged.

     8. Carlson and Galper, "Water's Edge," n. 11, state: "The major

remaining controversy in the domestic area surrounds the question of what

constitutes a unitary business operation." Walter Hellerstein, "Dividing

the State Corporate Income Tax Base," expresses a similiar sentiment:

"Since the existence of a unitary business is an essential predicate to a
                                                                                    z.

state's apportionment of income generated by that business, the criteria
for   determing whether a business is unitary are crucial."

        10. See the citations in note      7 above.   It may be well to note at this
point that Exxon involved primarily the question of whether separate
accounting could be used to determine the functional breakdown of
operating income     among   the various divisions of Exxon, a single
corporation.     By comparison, the other three cases involved the question
of whether nondomiciliary states could include intercorporate dividends in
the apportionable income of a taxpayer. The Court ruled that the answer
in each case hinged onthe existence of a unitary business.

states. Thus      we are, at best, dealing with what I consider a second—best

situation.

      12. See, however, the papers by Carison and Galper, "Water's Edge,"

by Miller, "Worldwide Unitary Combination," and by Walter Hellerstein,

"Dividing the State Corporate Income Tax Base" and the comments by

Franklin C. Latcham, Norman J. Laboe, and David R. Milton, all in this

volume, and references given there. Of course, the tests of economic

unity presented here are, in principle, as applicable to multinational

groups of affiliated firms as to wholly domestic groups it combination is

to be applied on a worldwide basis.

     13. Note the words of the California Supreme Court in Butler Bros.

v. McColgan 17 Cal.2d. 667—68 (191M): "It is only if its business within

this state is truly separate •and distinct              .   .   . so   that the segregation of
Income    maybe   made clearly and accurately, that the separate accountlng
method    may properly be used." The entire discussion of this paper is
framed    in terms of determining whether formula apportionment (and
combination,    in the   case of legally          distinct affiliates), rather that

separate accounting,   .s appropriate for the division of business income
between   states. It appears, however, that the same test of unity would                          be

applicable    in determining whether, in the           absence of combination,

intercorporate    dividends should be taxed to the payee corporation, as                     in

Mobil,   ASARCO, and Woolworth. Note 80             below argues that if two firms are
found to be    engaged in   a   unitary business, combination             should   be applied;
dividends   should not simply be included in apportionable income, as in

Mobil.

             I should    note   that   In   the   text of the version       of   the paper
presented at   the   conference, which has been extensively revised, but not

altered substantively, the following paragraph precedes this one:


                  The discussion that follows is predicated on the view
                  that the goal of state tax policy in this area is (or
                  should be) to tax   corporate   income where it   originates.

                  Various   Supreme Court pronouncements about the illegality

                  of taxing extraterritorla]. values leads one to believe

                  that   the Court agrees. In     this view of things, formula

                  apportionment   is a necessary evil forced upon us by the
                  inherent difficulty of using separate accounting to

                  divide the taxable income of a unitary business among the

                  various jurisdictions in which it .s earned.



  *   Jerome Hellerstein based his conference comments, which follow this

      paper, on that paragraph and also relied on it in his "The Basic

      really germane to the issue at hand, and, indeed, detracts from

      consideration of the central topic of the paper, defining a unitary

      business.    My reasoning is explained further in "Ctitle to be

                 14. The repeated use of "in general" and "generally," in

          combination with "accurately" or "satisfactorily," in these

         sentences is intended to indicate that the presence of the
         characteristics of a unitary business described here creates a
         presumption that separate accounting will not isolate the income of
         the constituent parts of a unitary business and that formula
         apportioent must be employed         in   such cases. It is not   proposed
         that separate accounting could be used to overturn this
         presumption, except in those cases in which the obstacles to
         isolation of the Income of the components are so minor that they

                 15.    Peggy Musgrave, in "The State Corporate Income Tax," also
         draws   this    distinction.

                 "The  need for combining firma into the so—called unitary
                 business . . arises under . . . two sets   of circum-
                 stances. The first occurs where the firms are in a
                 position to manipulate their accounts so as to shift
                 accounting profits . . . The second situation arises
                 where there is structural linkage among the firms which
                 renders the separatIon of their profits an arbitrary
                 procedure . . . It is to be noted that this second
                 situation provides the more fundamental rationale for
                 combination. In the absence of these structural inter—
                 dependencies, the need for combination merely rests on
                 the lack of administrative capability for enforcing
                 arm's—length pricing.
      This distinction helps to explain the reasoning that may lie behind the
      following statement by the staff of the California Franchise Tax Board in

      Provisions of Legislative Proposals," State Taxation of Interstate

Carlson and Galper, "Water's Edge": "The use of a combined report [unitary

method]   for determining income is not based upon the concept that members
of a unitary business have not acted at arm's—length. It is used because
separate accounting, regardless of its mathematical accuracy, does not
properly reflect the income of a unitary business."
       16. Of course, transfer prices may be manipulated for reasons other
than shifting taxable income between states. For our purpose what matters
is the possibility that income of the individual firms may be mismeasured,
not why ——   or even whether -— transfer prices are being manipulated. Any
inaccuracy of transfer prices, whether due to deliberate manipulation or
not, is reason   for concern, if it          is substantial. We also ignore the
possibility that different transfer prices may be reported in different
states, something made easier (and perhaps legal) by the failure of the
states to adopt uniform tax laws and to audit firms jointly.

     18. Implicit in this example is the assumption that both firms face
the same opportunity cost for funds in the capital market. If this is not
true, interpretation becomes more difficult.
      19. Note that firm A could sell to an unrelated third party at an ar-
tificially reduced price at the same time that firm B made an equivalent
purchase from the same party under identical terms (plus a small
commission). This subterfuge would shift income from firm A to firm B, but
would be more difficult      to spot than       simple use of artificially low

of Business 30 (July, 1956): 175 notes that where two integrated firms are

each other's only supplier and customer, the optimal transfer price is the

marginal cost (including normal return to capital) of the supplier. But

the marginal output, by assumption, yields no economic profit, and this

rule for profit maximization says nothing about the division of

inframarginal profits between the two firms, something that is important

for   tax purposes     and   depends   on the entire cost schedules of the two firms.

assumed to be competitive, none is yielding more than a normal return to

capital,     at least in the long run. As        the discussion of distortjons

alleged     to result from the use of one formula          in all circumstances (for
example, in the Container Corporation's brief) indicates, it is the

existence of arguably different profitability ——              relative   to payroll,

property, sales, or whatever else enters the apportionment formula —-                  in
varIous actIvItIes or locations that makes the proper definition of a

savings     that are   not captured by any of'    these approaches; see also the

intermediate—level textbook on industrial organization, such as F. M.

In what    follows we do not discuss such obvious technological reasons for
vertical    integration as the combination of the various hot—metal operations
in steel making. Of course, the economies involved in such cases would
render isolation of profits via separate accounting impossible.

Market Failure    Considerations," American Economic Review 61, no. 2 (May

somewhat artificially postponing until section III the discussion of
similar Influences that can lead to horizontal diversification; the two
will often be found together. See also note 1414 and literature cited there.

opportunism as the source of difficulties in contracting: "IHiuman agents

calculation and less trustworthy and reliable in action." Williamson would
therefore "assess alternative governance structures in terms of their
capacities to economize on bounded rationality while simultaneously

safeguarding against opportunism."

           26. Williamson notes that much of the success and failure of attempts

at vertical integration in        the nineteenth century can be explained in terms
of       three characteristics: economies of scope, asset specificity, and
externalities in demand (the potential debasement of quality) ibid., pp.
1551_5Z1.      Economies of scope are described in first part of section III

realize as much income as possible at the crude oil stage, the provision of'
percentage depletion in the tax code (now ended         for large integrated

relatively minor joint costs whose                                      allocation          could not possibly distort

the   measurement of income significantly and to what extent they truly
create interdependence that suggests unity. See also the discussions of'
interdependence                in section III and of quantitative substantiality in the
first part of'          the          concluding section.

tation costs;           see 100 S. Ct. 2115 (1980). There is no suggestion of'

"reciprocal buying" in the sense used in the fourth part of section III.

But it may be that such exchanges are a natural defensive response-to the

small—numbers environment in which the oil companies operate. They allow

the companies to hold each other hostage, so that a competitors denial of

supplies      in one market can be countered with                                         denial in other markets.

used   "in determining unity is whether or not the earnings of the group have
been materially greater because of affiliation than they would have been if
they   had operated separately."

       35.    For the present purpose, comments by Jack Hirshleif'er in
"Economics of the Divisionalized Firm," Journal of Business 30 (Apr. 1957):
 105—107 on the profitability of' abandoning a division are particularly

relevant. He notes: "rT]heapparent profit (or loss) of' any                                                                 division
   will      not equal the change in total profits for the firm as a whole when

the operations of that division are considered incrementally" (p. 108).
                                                                           13.

        36. Each of the two firms might market in only one state, with the

shared pipeline being the only interdependence between them.        If one firm
owned    the pipeline and carried the other's product for a fee, or if   a third
affiliated firm owned the pipeline,     it   is not obvious what transfer price

to employ, especially if there are no comparable uncontrolled sales.

Leaving aside the basic problem noted in the previous note, a case could be

made for. either average cost or marginal cost. Thus neither state could
accurately determine the income of either firm.
        37. This line of reasoning might seem to have been more persuasive be-
fore the development of money market instruments in which excess balances
can be placed for periods as short as one day. But the fact remains that
the possibility of pooling financial requirements can generate important
savings.
       38. Economies of scale generally give rise to decreasing costs-'
(average costs that fall as output increases). By comparison, constant
returns to scale (e.g., doubling Inputs doubles output) generally imply
constant average costs.
     39. If the savings from joint activity are so small, one might then
ask why the firms bother to share the facilities. In such cases there may



occur,

be other even stronger unitary ties.
           The   best examples must be in information; since crowding does not
         a given coat of obtaining information can be spread over an

arbitrarily large quantity of output. In making this argument we must       be
careful    not to decide that affiliates held together by the kinds of

economies    of transaction costs based on proprietary information discussed
in the next part of this section are not unitary just because shared costs
are small. This caveat is explained further there.

supply    (e.g., refining of crude oil into gasoline, kerosene, and various

other products), it would be hopeless to attempt to employ separate

accounting      to determine the profits attributable to the various products.

Modern Corporation." In this last           article Williamson notes that in the
absence       of' savings in transaction costs transfers will      be organized by
markets, rather than within firms, because scale economies may be             more

easily    realized (if     the   demand of' any firm   is small relative to the minimal

optimal       output), markets can aggregate uneorrelated demands to achieve
sharing of' risks, and markets may achieve economies of scope if various
firms do not need all services that can be provided more cheaply together
than   separately (p. 1547).

from them or be harmed     by them. Because of   the object of the present

discussion, that is ignored. The usual result is that externalities cause

economic resources to be nhlsallocated, in the sense that too few resources

are devoted to activities generating      external   benefits and too many   to
actvt1es causing external costs. For more on the nature of external

economies (benefits) and diseconomies (costs) and their tendency to cause

market failure, see any intermediate—level textbook in government finance,

such as Richard A. Musgrave and Peggy B. Musgrave, Public Finance in Theory

and Practice, 3d ed. (New York: McGraw—Hill, 1980), chaps. 3 and 311. At

this point we consider only technological externalities (those that involve

costs or benefits to society, as well as to the firm). But for the present

purpose, pecuniary externalities (those that cause the expenses of the

other firm, but not the costs to society, to be greater or less) are

equally relevant.

      50.   It may, for example, be upstream or upwind. For analytical

convenience we concentrate on the case where the potential for damage is

asymmetrical (unidirectional), to minimize the likelihood that the firms

would simply agree to limit mutual damage to each other.

      51. See R. H. Coase, "The Problem of Social Cost," Journal of Law and

Economics 3 (Oct.    1960):   ,_4Z4 and the voluminous literature it has spawned,

including D. M. G. Newberry, "Externalities: the Theory of Enviormental

Policy," in Public Policy and the Tax System, ed. G. A. Hughes and C. H.

Heal, (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1980), pp. 106149 and works cited

there. The market solutIon stated in the text would occur only If property

rights were such that firm A enjoyed the legal privilege of freely

disposing of its wastes, unless paid by firm B not to do so. If, by

comparison,    the law gave firm   B the right to   clean air and    water,   firm     A

might compensate firm B       to accept some pollution. In either event, under
the   Coasian view the level of pollution would probably be similar, but the

distributIon of income between the firms would be different.

       52. If the ProMax board acts in either of these ways, the external

 costs   are "internalized."     When   this occurs the   residual amount   of
 pollution    is presumably set at what the ProMax board considers the optimal
 level from the group's point of view.

       5l• It is interesting to note that on       the    first day of the conference
 at   which this paper was    presented I received a mass mailing from the
 President    of Mobil Oil Credit Corporation, encouraging me        to apply for a
 credit card from Montgomery gard, one of        Mobil's    subsidiaries. One must
 wonder whether, in such a case, separate accounting can accurately Isolate
 the income of the two firms. Many unaffiliated firms have also recently
                                                                              17.

engaged    in joint promotional efforts (for example, Disneyworld and Eastern

Airlines).       But in such instances commercial arrangements and market
transactions determine the division of costs and income between
participants. For similar arrangements between affiliated firms, the
division of costs may be set by top—level management and separate
accounting may not accurately split the resulting profits.
     55. See Teece, "Economies of Scope," for a discussion of how
proprietary technological information might be transferred within firms (or
between affiliates) engaged in the petroleum industry and in geothermal
energy,    nuclear power, or coal mining.
     56. This argument Is developed more fully in Charles E. MeLure,
                                                                              Jr.,

determines shares in output only with an eye toward minimizing state taxes.
     57. This is, essentially, the view underlying the support for geo-
graphic separate accounting for the oil industry in McLure, "Uniformity in
Interstate TaxatIon." For a very brief earlier statement of the argument
in the text, which was based on an example suggested by William Dexter, see
Charles E. McLure, Jr., "State Corporate Income Taxes," in State and Local
Finance    in   the '80s, ed.   George Break (MadIson:   University of Wisconsin
Press, forthcoming).

     58.We might anticipate an objection to the entire line of reasoning
based on risk and diversification: if individual investors can diversify
away risk by holding a portfolio of investments whose risks are         uncorre—
lat.ed, there is no social benefit from diversification within a firm.         It
seems, however, that this has little to do with the basic question at hand,
                                                                                 18.



whether   separate accounting should be used to measure the income of affil-
iated firms (or divisions) engaged in risky ventures in different states,
or they should be treated as unitary businesses for state tax purposes.
       59. This line of reasoning seems to have played a part in Superior Oil
Co. v. Franchise Tax Board, where the California Supreme Court said:
"[Ejach producing well in a particular state is the end product of
interstate activities which may involve many other unproductive wells in
many other states" (60 Cal., 2d ii6 [1963]). It is also part of the argu-
ment by W. J. Baumol in his testimony against Alaska's use of geographic
separate accounting for the oil industry (Superior Court for the State of
Alaska,   Third Judicial District, Atlantic Richfield Co. v. State of Alaska,

No. 3AN—79—1903 Civil and State of Alaska V. Exxon Corp., No. 3AN—80—15142

Civil.) Of course, it has little force if there is enough exploration in

each state to produce adequate diversification. Baumol also emphasizes

that   economies of' scope   in activities conducted in   the   lower 148   states,    but

benefiting     discovery and production in Alaska, including research on
technologies for exploration and production, make it impossible to isolate

ship   prima   fade evidence of the existence of aunitary business, and P.
Musgrave, "The State Corporate Income Tax," seems to be leaning in that
direction.     Frank M. Keesling, generally recognized as the father of
combined    reporting, has retreated from his earlier view that he could
recognize a unitary business and has written in "The Combined Report and
Uniformity in Allocation Practices," Seventh Annual Report of the -'
Multistate Tax Commislon, (Boulder, Cob.: Multistate Tax Commission, June
30, 19711), p. 112, "I am inclined to the view that all income from   commonly
owned business    activities should be combined and apportioned without in-
quiring as to whether such activities are unitary or separate in nature."
     65. Carlson and Galper, "Waters Edge," note that the interpretation
of control under section 1482 of the Internal Revenue Code can be quite
broad. I.R.C, regulation l.1482—1(a)(3) states that the term "includes any
kind           direct or indirect, whether legally enforceable, and
       of control,

however exercisable or exercised. It is the reality of the control which
is decisive, not its form or the mode of its exercise."
     66. It Is hardly novel to note that ownership and control are not
necessarily    identical. A variety of institutional arrangements provide

control without ownership. For example, under terms of debentures,
                                                                           20.


creditors may effectively   control a corporation, even though they do not
own a majority of Its stock. (There is little advantage in inquiring in
the present context whether under these circumstances debt instruments take
on the character of ownership claims.) Moreover, firms sharing majority
boards could engage in manipulation, even if not commonly owned. In what
follows we ignore these possibilities. An especially important question is
how to treat joint ventures where control is vested in a small group of
corporate owners, no one of which has majority ownership. In such cases a
finding of unity may be well founded, despite lack of majority ownership.
A conference celebrating the fiftieth anniversary     of   Eerie and Mean's The

Modern Corporation and Private Property, which emphasized the separation of
ownership and control, was   held at the Hoover Institution a week after the

conference at which this paper was presented. The proceedings of that

conference are forthcoming   in   a special issue of the Journal of Law and

Economics.

     68,   The varIety of (often unclear) meanings given to terms that are

virtually synonymous in common usage confuses discussion in this area. It

appears    that when the Supreme Court refers to "centralized management," it
has in mind centralized control, in the Fama-Jensen sense. The context
should indicate the meaning of terms used in this paper.

        73. A standard part of most courses in applied microeconomics is a

demonstration that under certain conditions households attempting to maxi-

mize their welfare and firms attempting to maximize profits will produce

outcomes that maximize social welfare. If those Conditions are not met,

the hedonistic instincts of households and entrepreneurs will generally not

gratuitously   result in achievement of   this outcome. A standard

nonmathematical presentation is found in Francis M. Bator, "The        Simple
AnalytIcs    of Welfare Maximization," American Economic Review 147, no.     1


(Mar.    1957): 22—59. Most intermediate—level textbooks on rnicroeconomjcs
also    present this argument. An analogous argument can be made about the

advantages of decentralized decision making within a firm. See, for

example,   William J. Baumol   and Tibor Fabian, "Decomposition, Pricing for

Decentralization and External Economies," Management Science 11, no. 1

(Sept. 19611): 1—32. For an earlier treatment, see Hirshleifer, "Economics

of the Divislonalized Firm." In what follows I      take as given the parallel
objectives   of the firm and the division   managers to maximize the profits of
the firm and of the divisions, respectively. I do not otherwise address
the agency problem of how the central management of the firm can induce its
divisional managers to share its objectives. On this, see, for example,
Stephen A. Ross, "The Economic Theory of Agency: The Principal#s Problel,"

of   Linear Profit—Sharing Incentives," Quarterly Journal of Economics           85,

no.   3   (Aug. 1971). The remainder of this section is written           in terms of a
firm   and its divisions. Analogous reasoning applies to a group of

affiliated firms and the affiliates.

          VL In what follows, behaving properly is used as a shorthand way              of
saying that profit maximization by division managers leads to profit max-

imization       by the firm. It is interesting to note the simplifying

assumptions on which Hirshleifer bases his initial analysis of the proper

prices to use for transfers within a vertically integrated firm:

                Unless stated otherwise, we shall assume that both
                technological independence and demand Independence apply
                between the operations of the two divisions.
                Technological independence means that the operating
                costs of each division are independent of the level of
                operations being carried on by the other. Demand
                independence means that an additional external sale by
                either division does not reduce the external demand for
                the products of the other. ("Economics of Transfer
                Pricing," p. 173; emphaSis in original)
Thus Hirshleif'er initially explicitly assumes away the first three problems
 listed in the text and then reintroduces them.
          75.    Hirshielfer   notes that "cost interdependence between products is.
 almost a necessary condition of           'divisionalization,'   that is,   the

 devolution       of   decision—making   authority among autonomous 'profit centers'
      ." ("Economics of        the Divisionalized Firm," p. 96.)     Similarly,    on

 interdependence in demand, he writes, "A firm producing both cameras and
 photographic film should consider, in setting its             prices   for cameras,
 the demand for film" (p. 99).
           76. In Exxon    the Supreme Court speaks of     "an umbrella of centralized

 management      and controlled interaction" 100 S. Ct. at 2120 temphasis added].
           77. We have argued above that the existence of minor shared costs,
 externalities, sharing of          risks,   and so   on, should not lead to a conclusion
                                                                                  23.

of   unity. The reasoning of this section would be that if interdependence

of this type is felt by central management       to   be so unimportant   that
divisions are   given     substantial autonomy despite its presence,      there   is a

strong case against a finding of unity.

       78. Thus Miller, "Worldwide Unitary Combination," quoting the

California Board of Equalization, notes, "Implicit in either test, of

course, is the requirement of quantitative substantiality."

       79. Where   this   would otherwise occur, perhaps firms should be given

the option of simply filing separate returns and taking no deduction for

such shared expenses in calculating taxable income they report to states

that require unitary combination. Similarly, states requiring unitary

combination could allow each firm with taxable nexus the optIon of setting

a value on transactions with affiliates (within a reasonable range) that

combined report. This is not meant to be an exhaustive consideration of'
the   form safe—haven rules such as this might take. It is intended to
support the view that minor difficulties with separate accounting should
not force unitary combination that might lead to quite artificial results.
       80. As has   been   suggested elsewhere, for example, in Jerome R.
Hellerstein, "Allocation and Apportionment of Dividends and the Delineation
of the Unitary Business," Tax Notes, 111, no. 11 (Jan. 25, 1982): 160 n. 112,
only the proportionate parts of       joint ventures might be combined with their
corporate owners. But that is really a different matter. For an argument
that combination of less than wholly owned subsidiaries, as currently
practiced, taxes extraterritorial income, see Norman Laboe's discussion at
Benjamin Miller's "Worldwide Unitary Combination" in this volume.

"Operational     Interdependence" that the Supreme Court should not adopt a
flow of products as the bright—line test of a unitary business, as
requested in the Container Corporation's brief. Yet one can hardly deny
the benefits of' a conceptually clear test of whether a unitary business
exists.    I have little sympathy with the view quoted by Carison           and Galper:
"[T)he proposal that each state publish the criteria to be applied in

determining whether a particular business is unitary, without major

clarification, would cripple if not destroy the concept . . .              We   do not

believe that the     states should be required to lock into a definition that
over   a period of time may be unrealistic" ("Water's Edge," n. 135).

       82. This difficulty is compounded when we ask how patterns of shared

costs, interdependence, and intercorporate transactions would be aggregated

in a single quantitative test.

       83. Thus Miller, "Worldwide Unitary Combination," writes of California

practIce   in    determining whether a unitary business exists, "tI]t involves a

subjective      examination of a variety of criteria."
       84. Among the many places such lists of characteristics commonly
attributed to unitary businesses may be found are Miller, "Worldwide
Unitary    Combination," and the questionnaires in        the   appendices to Revised

Procedures for Determining a Unitary Business: The States' Response to

ASARCO and Woolworth (Washington, D.C.: Federation of' Tax Administrators,

Dec. 1982), Research Memorandum 5117, mimeographed.

to the appearance of the Exxon tiger in advertisements for Exxon office
equipment or to Mobil Credit's endorsement of      Montgomery   Ward mentioned in
note 511 above.

      92. It is interesting to note that this bright—line test might

actually exclude the express companies (and their modern equivalents) to

which the unitary concept was first applied! For a critique of the

Container position, see my "Operational Interdependence." Jerome

Hellerstein has replied in "The Basic Operations Interdependence

finding that a unitary    business exists should imply that combination is

required. It is logically inconsistent to argue that dividends flowing

within a unitary business should be taxed to the recipient as part of its

apportionable income, without combination, as was done in Mobil and

attempted by the states in ASARCO and Woolworth. For further elaboration

on this view, see MeLure, "Uniformity in Interstate Taxation." Thus I
believe that the Court's now oft—repeated Identification of apportionabil—
ity   with a unitary business, while adequate in the context of a single
firm, should ideally have been stated as follows in a multifirm context:
"The linchpin of combination, and therefore apportionability .           .   . is   the

unitary business concept"      (underlined words added).
       95.   Note, however, the following perceptive comment by Walter Heller—

stein, "Dividing the State Corporate Income Tax Base": "While It may be a

matter of small moment, except to the parties, whether the majority or the

dissent more accurately portrayed the record, the considerable sparring in

the opinions over the proper perception of the facts and their

constitutional implications enhances the probability that the battle lines

of future     unitary   business controversies will be drawn   over   such factual

issues."

elected six directors, and the thirteenth was elected by the first twelve.

Eight votes were required to pass any resolution. Miller notes in

"Worldwide Unitary Combination" that in a California case ASARCO was held

not to control Southern Peru. As a result, there was no unitary bisiness

and the two firms could not be made to file a combined report.
