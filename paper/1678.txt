                    Monetary Policy Regime Shifts
                     and the Unusual Behavior of
                         Real Interest Rates

                                  ABSTRACT




     A striking phenomenon of the early 1980s is the climb jr real interest

rates to levels unprecedented in the post—World War II period.    In order to

understand this phenamenon, this paper investigates the nature and timing of

shifts in the real rate process to determine if the recent unusual behavior

of real rates is associated with monetary policy regime changes. We find that

not only are there significant shifts in the stochastic process of real

interest rates in October 1979 and October 1982 when the Federal Reserve

alters its behavior, but these dates are also found to be the mast likely

breakpoints in the real rate process. When we analyze another monetary policy

regime change with many similarities to that of October 1979, the sharp rises

in the discount rate in 1920, we also reach a-similar conclusion; there is     a



striking correspondence between the monetary policy regime change and the

shift in the real rate process.

     Other studies have examined competing explanations for the recent un-

usual behavior of real interest rates ——     e.g.   budget deficits or favorable

changes in business taxation. Although these competing explanations have     met

with mixed success, our evidence lends substantial support to the view that

monetary policy regime changes have been and continue to be an important

source of shifts in the behavior of real interest rates.

     A striking phenomenon of the early 1980s is the climb in real

interest rates to levels unprecedented in the post—World War 11 period.

In order to understand this phenomenon, it is not enough to focus on the

recent high level of real rates, as in several recent papers1 research

has also revealed a significant 5hift in the stochastic process of real

interest rates.    Modern monetary theory suggests that regime changes

have an important impact an the stochastic process of many economic

variables. Thus, a change in a policy regime (by which we mean a change

in the direction of policy or the way in which policy is conducted) may

explain the unusual real rate experience in recent years.

     In this paper, we investigate the nature and timing of shifts in

the real rate process to determine if the unusual behavior of real rates

is associated with monetary policy regime changes. We find that when the

Federal Reserve alters its behavior in October 1979 and October 1952,

there are statistically significant shifts in the stochastic process of

real rates. Statistical analysis designed to determine the timing of the

shifts in the real rate process indicates that these dates are also the

most likely choices for breakpoints.

     The above evidence suggests that the Feds changes in the monetary

policy regime are a likely candidate for explaining the recent unusual

behavior of real interest rates. Our search for an understanding of how

these changes might have altered real rate behavior proceeds along two

dimensions. First, since the Fed's 1979 changes in operating procedures

were associated with increased variability of interest rates, money

supply growth and inflation, we explore whether increased uncertainty

about these variables plays a significant role in real rate movements.'

We find little evidence supporting an important role for uncertainty in

the recent unusual behavior of real rates.

     Second, we look for other periods in which there is a clearly

defined change in the monetary policy regime that bears similarities to

the recent regime changes.4 In a sense, we are looking for other 1con—

trailed experiments" that provide information on how monetary policy

regime changes affect real interest rates. One such uexperimentll is in

1920, when the Federal Reserve sharply raised its discount rate twice.

This episode is a natural one to study because the economy was suffering

from a high and persistent inflation before the regime shift, while

afterwards a sharp disinflation occurred. This is similar to what we

have seen in recent years and thus we might expect to find parallels

between the two periods.

     Our analysis of the period surrounding 1920 reveals a significant

shift in the stochastic process of real interest rates which has many

similarities to the recent experience. For example, the 1920 monetary

regime change and the subsequent disinflation is associated with a




    Hascaro and tleltzer (1983) have argued that increased monetary
    uncertainty is an important factor in the recent rise in real rates.
    Fama (1976) has found a link between real interest rates, inflation
    uncertainty, and nominal interest rate uncertainty. Hartman and
    1akin (1982) also find a link between inflation uncertainty and
    interest   rates.

    Shiller (1980) has also examined historical episodes to see if a
   ctange in the monetary policy regime affects real interest rates.
   For the end of Fed—Treasury Accord he finds a noticeable change in
   the behavior of real interest rates.

weakening of the Fisher effect and a shift to a sustained higher level

of real interest rates, which are also characteristic of the recent

period. Although our analysis does not reveal the precise mechanism

through which changes in monetary policy regimes affect real interest

rates, it does suggest that disinflation is a more important factor in

the recent policy regime shift than is the increased variability of

money growth, inflation and interest rates.

     Other studies have examined competing explanations for the recent

unusual behavior of real interest rates ——      e.g.,   budget deficits, in-

vestment booms, favorable changes in business taxation, and the declin—

jag relative price of energy. Although these competing explanations have

met with mixed success, our evidence lends substantial support to the

view that monetary policy regime changes have been and continue to be an

important source of shifts in the behavior of real interest rates.

Future research should focus on how changes in monetary policy regimes

produce shifts in real interest rate movemetts.




                          II. The Methodology



     The real interest rate of concern to economists is more precisely

referred to as the ex ante real interest rate. t time t, this ex ante

rate is defined as the expectation at time t of the ex    past real return
or   an asset when it is held from time t to t+1. In the case of a one—

period, default—free, nominal band, whose expected nominal return is

equal to its nominal interest rate at time t, the ex ante real interest

rate is:

where,

                   rrt
                         =   the   ex ante real    interest   rate on the one—

                             expected at time t.




The ex post real rate is defined as,

                   eprrt i —            rrt

where,

                   eprrt =   the ex post real interest rate on the one—

                             period bond at time t: i.e., the reali:ed

                             real return from time t to t+1.

       Although   the ex post real rate is observable, the ex ante rate is

not. Thus, ic order to measure and make inferences about                the   ex ante

real rate, some identifying assumptions are needed. In this paper we use

the identifying assumptions that expectations of inflation are rational

and that the ex ante real rate can be reasonably approximated by linear

projection onto an observable information set. The assumption of ra-

tional expectations implies that inflation forecast errors are un—

forecastable given any information available at time t: i.e.,

As    shown in Mishkin (1981), ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation of

this regression equation yields consistent estimates of the parameters

in    p.   This cDnclusion stems from the orthogonality of the composite

error term             with

       Within the above framework, a logical way to test for a shift in

the stochastic process of the ex ante real rate is to test for the

constancy of p when equation (5) is estimated over different samples. We

do this with a conventional F—test (Chow test>. We date when the real

rate process shifts using a procedure proposed by Quandt (1958, 1960>.

This procedure involves finding the breakpoints that maximize the

likelihood of the ex post real rate regression. Specifically, for each

set of potential breakpoints, we calculate minus twice the lag of the

Ouandt likelihood ratio —— the maximized likelihood assuming there are

no breaks, divided by the maximized likelihood conditional on that set

of breakpoints. When this statistic reaches its maximum, we have found

the set of breakpoints that maximizes the likelihood function.

       Are the procedures testing for and dating of breakpoints meaning-

ful? How are they to be interpreted if there is information           in

that is relevant for predicting the ex ante real rate but is unknown to

the econometrician and has thus been excluded from Xt? To examine these

questions1 consider the hypothetical case in which the ex ante real rate

can be expressed as

This implies that the coefficient            in equation     (4) and           (5)   can   be

expressed as,

                    X =    the   regression coefficient of          a

       change in    represents either (1) a change in the way information is

used to predict ex ante real rates (a change in                or       i'),    or    (2> a

change in the relation between the variables in the information set (a

change in )J. Either of these changes can cause a change in the stochas-
                                                     -
tic process of real rates.

        We   are interested not only in verifying a break in the stochastic

process of real interest rates, but also in examining measures of the ex

ante real rate to see how the stochastic process changes. Given the

consistency of ,      it    is logical to estimate the ex ante real rate as the

fitted values obtained from OLS estimation of equation (5):



                                 4

rate defined in equation (8) will differ from the true cx ante real rate

by u, so that when u has small variance, t is an accurate measure.

       While it would be desirable to know that the variance of Ut

small, unfortunately its variance is not identifiable. However, there

may be information in the data concerning the variance of u. Our infor-

mation is limited to the variances and autocovariances of the regression

residual from the cx post real rate regression, u —               Under rational

expectations,       is serially uncorrelated, yet u may be autocorrelated

or correlated with past values of cr If this is the case and the

variance of u is large, then the regression residual, u —                 E,     is

serially correlated. However, if the variance of u, is small, then the

regression residual u —       is   dominated by      and is serially uncorre—

lated. Thus a diagnostic check of the         specification involves eamin—

ing the residuals from the ex post real rate regressions to see if they

are white noise.6

       The last remaining issue is how we choose the information set

As described above, the choice of the variables in X comprise part of

the identifying a;sumptions for measuring real interest rates. A variety

of previous research uses the identifying assumption that cx ante real

rates follow a random walk:' i.e., X =              and the coefficient        = 1.

Evidence in Litterman and Weiss (1985) is inconsistent with this assump-

tion: they find the cx ante real rate follows an AR(l) process with the

      Although the diagnostic check described here is worth doing, it is
      not powerful against certain alternatives. If u is not serially
      correlated or correlated with past , then the regression residual

      is large. For example, if the    specification includes many lags o
      rr then u will not display any serial correlation and the diagnos—
      ti check hill have little power.

AR coefficient significantly less than one.8

       In light of this finding and the lack of a compelling theoretical

justification for the random walk specification, we feel it appropriate

to use a less restrictive set of identifying assumptions about the time

series process for the ex ante real rate. This can be accomplished by

including a distributed lag of ex post real rates arid inflation rates in

       This methodology also allows us to relax another assumption used by

proponents of the random walk specification ——   that   unexpected inflation

between time t—1 and t has no explanatory power for the ex ante real

rate at t. Again, there is no compelling theoretical justification for

this assumption and it is inconsistent with evidence in Littermn and

Weiss (1985).10

       By including other economic variables known at time t in X, we

allow additional factors to help predict ex ante real interest rate

movements, making our approach even more general. Specifically, we can

include a measure of supply shocks which ma' affect ex ante real inter-

est rates by affecting current and/or expected future investment




      Evidence in Huizinga and Mishkin (1985) also suggests that the
      random walk assumption for the ex ante real rate is inappropriate.

      See Huizinga and Mishkin (1985).
 lv
      This assumption is not an assumption about monetary neutrality. Real
      factors can lead to unexpected inflation and have a lasting effect
      on the ex ante real interest rate. Litterman and Weiss (1985) es-
      timate the correlation coefficient between unexpected inflation and
      the innovation in the ex ante real rate to be —. 64.

      It is not clear a priori what effect a supply shock that raises the
      relative price of energy should have on ex ante real rates. The most
      common stary outlined by Wilcox (1983), has a rise in the relative
      price of energy decreasing investment opportunities, which lowers
      the demand for loanable funds and hence ex ante real rates. However,
      it is also possible that a rise in the relative price of energy
      might increase the returns to new capital even though it reduces the
      value of old capital. Then we miht expect ex ante real rates to

opportunities.'1 We can also include the nominal interest rate at time t

which may be able to capture other, hard to measure, influences on the

ex ante real rate. The nominal rate is likely to reflect these other

influences because it is composed of the ex ante real rate itself, as

well as expected inflation, which a variety of evidence has shown to be
                                            1"
negatively related to ex ante real rates.



                                III. The Data




      Two monthly data sets are used in this paper: one for the time

period from January 1953 to December 1984 and the other for the time

period from January 1916 to December 1927. We begin the postwar period

in January 1953 because the quality of the CPI was substantially

upgraded at this time. We stop in December 1984 because of data

availability. We begin the earlier period in January 1916 because this

is the beginning of the sustained inflation that lasts until the middle

of 1920. We end in December 1927 because data availability requires us

to use assets with risk premiums which begin to undergo substantial

fluctuations after this date.

      For the 1953—84 period, the nominal interest rates are conputed

from one—month U.S. Treasury bill prices (end of the month) obtained

from the bond file of the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP)

at the University of Chicago. The rates are continuously compounded



     rise rather than fall, with an increase in the relative price of
     energy. Both Wilcox (1983) and Huizinga and Mishin (1985) find that
     a rise in the relative price of energy is associated with a fall in
     ex ante real interest rates.

ratesc expressed at a monthly rate.

     The inflation rate is computed as the one—month change in the log

of the consumer price index (CPI). To obtain a price index that ap-

propriately treats housing costs on a rental equivalence basis, we use

four series to construct our CR1 measure. From January 1983 to December

1984, we use the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) widely reported CPI—U

series, which is on a rental equivalence basis. Before January 1983,

however, the CR1—U series is not on a rental equivalence basis which

leads to serious biases in measures of real rates in the 197Os) Thus,

from January 1954 to December 1982, we use the series CPI—UX, a series

which is consistent with the currently produced CPI—U series. This is

actually two series because the data from January 1967 ta December 1982

is obtained from the BLS, while the data from January 1954 to December

1966 is obtained from the Congressional Budget Office. Prior to January

1954, we use the CR1—U series.

     Our measure of supply shocks is calculated as the log of the rela-

tive price of fuel and related products in the producer price index. The

data were obtained from the BLS. Money supply growth is calculated as

the one—month change in the log of monthly averages of seasonally ad-

justed Ml. The money supply data was obtained from the Board of Sover—

nors of   the Federal Reserve System.      It   includes the February 1984

benchmark revisions, but not those of February 1985.

     For the 1916—27 period, we use three nominal interest rate series

because a series for a one—month government bond is unavailable. The

three series are monthly averages of the rate on 4—6 month prime commer—



    See Huizinga and Mishkin (1984). Note that the BLS does not revise
    earlier CPI—FJ data when it changes the procedures for its calcula—
    tions. This requires us to construct a consistent CPI series using
    the procedures outlined above.

average rate on stock exchange call loans (renewal rate). These data are

obtained from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System,

Banking and Monetary Statistics 1914_1941.14 Monthly averaged data is

used because last—week—of—the—month data is available only after 1919.

We have used the last—week—of—the—month data in the 1919—1927 period and

have obtained similar results to those found for monthly averaged data.

All rates are treated as though they were one—month rates and have been

converted to continuously compounded rates, expressed at a monthly rate.

        Inflation in the 1916—27 period is measured as the one—month change

in the log of the CPI—U series provided by the BLS.

       The timing of variables is as follows. The real interest rates we

examine are for a one—month holding period.15 The ex post real interest

rate (eprr) for 1953:1 is the realized real return for a one—month U.S.

Treasury bill over the month of January 1953. It equals the nominal

interest rate on the one—month bill        onDecember 31, 1952 minus the

inflation rate (irt) calculated using the December 1952 and January 1953

CPI. The supply variable for 1953:1 (SUPPLYt) is calculated using the

January 1953 fuel and related products component of the PPI and the

      these rates including a description of why they are the most repre-
      sentative of market—clearing interest rates in this period.
15
      In previous work EHuizinga and Mishkin (1984, 1985)) we have argued
      that one—month holding periods have timing problems that arise
      because the appropriate dating for the CPI is unclear. Although
      three—month holding periods have the advantage of reducing the
      relative magnitude of this timing problem1 they, have the disad-
      vantage of reducing the number of non—overlapping observations. In
      our empirical analysis here, which centers on dating breakpoints and
      thus requires estimation over short sample periods, we feel that the
      loss of degrees of freedom resulting from the use of three month
      holding periods outweighs the benefits from reducing the timing
      problem.

  IV. The Nature and Timing of Shifts in the Real Rate Process: 1953—84



     Our discussion of methodology in Section II suggests that        Xt the
explanatory variables in the ex post real rate regression, should in-

clude lags of ex post real rates and inflation, as well as other

economic variables known at time t, such as the nominal interest rate

and a supply shock variable. In practice, the number of variables that

should be included in X must be limited in order to avoid averfitting

the data. This is especially necessary in the present analysis because

we are examining time periods as short as 26 months.

     This need for parsimony has led us to terminate lag lengths and

omit variables when doing so does not significantly diminish the ex-

planatory power of the ex post real rate regression. To arrive at our

specification, we examined separate regressions for the 1953:1 to

1979:10, 1979:11 to 1982:10, and 1982:11 to 1984:12 sample periods. We

chose this division of sample periods to correspond with our            prior

belief that the changes in the Federal Reserve operating procedures ir!

October 1979 and October 1982 constitute regime shifts. Variables which

entered significantly at the SX level in any of the three periods were

included in our    final   specification for Xf. The resulting specification

        includes a constant term the one—month nominal interest rate

     the one—month inflation rate laged one and two months

                                                                           lo
         and the supply shock variable lagged one month (SUPPLIt1).

       Recall that a diagnostic check of the               specification involves

examining the residuals from the cx post real rate regression to see if

they are white noise. Table          1    reports the autocorrelations of the

regression residuals for the three sample periods mentioned above.              In


all three sample periods there is little evidence of serial correlation

of the residuals)7 The first twelve autocorrelations are small and tte

Liung—Box (1978) 0(12) statistic, which is distributed asymptotically as

x2(14) under the null hypothesis that the residuals are serially uncor—

related, is not significant at the            57.   level for any of the three

periods. Given that we have found no evidence which contradicts our

specification, we proceed to an examination of the nature and timing 0+

shifts   in the real rate process.

       The October 1979 change in operating procedures away from interest

rate smoothing is a natural candidate for a monetary policy regime



 16
      Variables which we have examined but have dropped from our final
      specification include lags of the ex.post real rate, additional lags
      of inflation and supply shocks, and lags of industrial production
      and detrended industrial production. Note that addjng lags of
      nominal rates is equivalent to adding lags of the cx post real rate,
      given that we have included lags of inflation. Other potentially
      relevant variables —— for example, the unemployment rate, invest-
      ment, budget deficits, and, most notably, money supply growth ——
      were not included in our specification search either because monthly
      data were unavailable or because previous research fails to find
      that these variables have any significant explanatory power for cx
      ante real rates. For example, Litterman and Weiss (1985) and Mishkin
      (1981) find that money supply growth does not help to predict cx
      ante real rates. However, it is important to realize this finding
      does not imply that monetary policy is unimportant for the deter-
      mination of cx ante real interest rates.
 1    There is some evidence of seasonality in the residuals. because the
      autocorrelation at lag 12 in the 1953:1 to 1979: 10 sample period is
      significantly different from :ero at the 57. level, although not at
      the 17. level. However, as pointed out in Mishkin(1931), we do not
      devote much attention to this seasonality because it may well be
      spurious because of the fixed—weight nature of the CPI.

shift. The deemphasis of monetary aggregates by the Fed in October 1982

•is another natural candidate. Our next set of results examine whether

there were shifts in the real rate process at these dates. The stability

test reported in the first column of Table 2 indicates tha.t there was a

highly significant change in the real rate process in October 1979. The

F(5,348)       12.14 statistic indicates that the null hypothesis that the

coefficients of the ex post real rate regression remain unchanqed from

the 1953:1—1979:10 period to the 1979:11—1982:10 period is rejected at a

marginal significance level of 1.7x1010)8

       The F—test presented in the second column of Table 2 shows that

there is a second significant shift in the real rate process in October

1982. The finding of a second significant shift is surprising. Although

the finding that there is a shift in the real rate process in October

1979 could have been guessed by a casual examination of dramatic rise in

ex post real rates in 1980, such an examination would not have revealed

a further shift in October 1982 because ex post real rates remained high

through the end of 1984.

       An additional interesting finding, reported in the third column of

Table 1, is that the stochastic process of real rates after October 1982

does not represent      a   return to the pre—October 1979 process. The F—

statistic which tests for coefficient equality in the pre—October 1979




 18
      We did not find any evidence ot significant hetercscedasticity
      across the sample periods examined in Table 2 and thus did not
      correct for it when computing the F—tests. (The test for heteros—
      cedasticity involved an F—test of the ratio of the estimated
      variances over the differing sample periods.) We also tested for
      equality of coefficients in the 1953l—1979:10 and 1979:11—1984:12
      sample periods, obtaining F(5,374) =     which is significant at a
      marginal significance level of S.7x10   . Our results are consistent
      with the finding of Clarida and Friedman (1984) that the relation-
      ship of nominal interest rates with other economic variables shifted
      after October 1979.

and post—October 1982    periods   is highly significant.

       Since we have found significant shifts in the stochastic process of

real rates after October 1979, it is interesting to ask whether similar

shifts occurred in our sample prior to this date. The final column

addresses this question by testing for coefficient stability in the two

halves of the pre—October 1979 period. The F—statistic does not reveal a

shift in the real rate process. We have also examined coefficient

stability over various three year samples in the 1953:1—1979:10 period.

4lthough we find one three year sample whose coefficients are sig-

nificantly different from those in the remainder of the period, the

change is not nearly as significant as the change in October 1979.19

Further, dropping this three year sample from the 1953:1—1979:10 period

does not alter the significant rejection of coefficient stability pre—

and past—October 1979.

       While we have found significant shifts in the coefficients of the

ex post real rate regressions, we have not yet determined the dates at

which the real rate process shifts: i.e, determined the breakpoints.

Table 3 reports minus twice the log of the Quandt likelihood ratio for

pairs of breakpoints surrounding the October 1979 and October 1982

dates. Remarkably, the Quandt procedure indicates that October 1979 and

October 1982 are the breakpoints that maximize the likelihood of the ex

      coefficient equality in each S—year sample and the subsequent 26—

      at the 5Y. level. This latter finding gives us some confidence that
      our rejection of equal coefficients in 1979:11—1982:10 and 1982:11—

past real rate regressions.20 The evidence in Table 3 reinforces that of

Table     2 by suggesting that the shifts in the monetary policy regime may

account for the unusual behavior of real interest rates in recent years.

        One reason why we have reported minus twice the log of the Quandt

likelihood ratio for so many pairs of breakpoints is to indicate that
                                                                                   Ii
the likelihood function around these breakpoints is quite flat.4                        For

example, the pair of breakpoints at (1979:4, 1982:10) has a value of

76.74 which is very close to the maximum of 77.48 found at (1979:10,

1982:10). Similarly, the pair breakpoints at (1979:10, 1983:4) has a

value of 75.40, again close to the maximum of 77.48. Therefore, although

we have found that the most likely breakpoints in the real rate process

coincide with the recent changes in the Fed operating procedures, the

evidence does not appear to be sufficiently strong to convince someone

with prior beliefs that the breakpoints occur at 1979:10 and 1983:4 that

they are incorrect.

      Given that the evidence is consistent with breakpoints at October

1979 and October 1982, we construct estimates of the ex ante real rate

using fitted values from three separate ex post real rate regressions,

estimated over the periods              1953:1—1979:10,             1979:11—1982:10,    and



     The pair of breakpoints            at     October 1979 and October 1982 is the
     global maximum.

October 1982, estimated real rates fluctuate around the 57.              level.24
            One striking feature of Figure 1 is that the Fed's switch to their

new operating., procedures in October 1979 is associated with               a notable

rise in the variability of cx ante real interest rates. Following the

Fed's abandonment of these operating procedures in October 1982 the

variability of cx ante real rates falls sharply to a level comparable to

that before October 1979. The standard deviation of estimated cx ante

real rates (annual rate) is 1.07. from 1953:1 to 1979:103 3.57. from

1979:11 to 1982:10, and .87. from 1982:11 to 1984:12.25

        nother interesting feature of Figure 1 is that our dating of the

first break in the real rate process at October 1979 does not coincide

with the substantial rise in the estimated real rates which occurs in

late 1980. This finding indicates why focusing solely on the level of

real    interest          rates does not provide an   accurate characterization of the
unusual behavior of real interest rates.
        Figure        1     provides one way of characterizing the nature of the
shifts in the real rate process. The regression results presented in
Table        4     provide another way. Table 4 describes the relaticirship of ax.

supply           shock variable in the three sample           periods defined by the

       rate      regressions at 1982:10.
       The standard deviation of the estimated cx ante real rate for                th'
       1953:1 to 1979:10 period cay give a somewhat misleading impression
       of        the variability of cx ante real interest rates because there is
       an apparent shift in the mean at the end  of 1973 (see Figure 1). The
       standard deviation of the estimated cx ante real rate (annual rate)
       for the 1953:1 to 1973:12 period is .67., while for tfla 1974:1 to
       1979:10 period it is .77.. These standard deviations suggest that the
       variability of cx ante real interest rates before October 1979 may
       La  slightly lower than the standard deviation for the 1953:1 to
       1979:10 period suggests.

breakpoints.26 The regression results of Table 4 indicate that in all
three sample periods, there is a significant negative correlation be-

tween ex ante real rates and expected inflatian.27 This finding is a

surprisingly robust one, having been found in previous research for many
                                                                28
different sample periods in the U.S. and for other countries.

       In contrast to the robustness of the relationship between expected

inflation and cx ante real rates, the relationship between nominal

interest rates and cx       ante real rates changes dramatically with the

policy regime shifts in October 1979 and October 1982.      In the pre—

October 1979 period, nominal rates are a misleading indicator of cx ante

real interest rates because the two rates are significantly negatively

correlated. With the Feds deemphasis of interest rate smoothing follow-

ing October 1979, the correlation of nominal and cx ante real interest

rates becomes significantly positive. Following the Fed's abandonment of




     The regressions of Table 4 use the cx post real rate as the depend-
     ent variable. The coefficient estimates would be numerically the
     same if the dependent variable were the estimated cx ante real rate
     because, by construction, the regressors are orthogonal to the
     difference between the ex post and the estimated cx ante real rates.
     Further, the coefficient estimates would be asymptotically the same
     as those obtained in regressions with the true ex ante real rate as
     the dependent variable. See Mishkin (1981).
27
     The expected inflation variable,       which is an explanatory vari-
     able in the regressions is calculates as the nominal interest rate
     minus our estimated values of the cx ante real rate. Since this
     involves the two step procedure of first estimating expected infla-
     tion and then regressing the cx post real rate on this measure, the
     standard errors of the coefficients typically reported will be
     incorrect. We have obtained consistent estimates of the standard
     errors by using the instrumental variables procedure outlined by
     1cCallum (1976) and Pagan (1984). Since same Of the Durbin—Watson
     statistics are low, we have also estimated the standard errors
     correcting for possible serial correlation of the error terms using
     the procedure outlined in Cumby, Huizinga and Obstfeld (1983).
     Although the standard errors rose slightly, there was no appreciable
     difference in the significance of the coefficients.

the new operating procedures, the correlation of nominal and estimated

ex ante real   rates   returns to being negative.

      The shifts in the real rate process re also reflected in the

changing strength of the Fisher effect (i.e., the positive correlation

between expected inflation and the nominal interest rate). The Fisher

effect is strong in the pre—October 1979 period, is nonexistent from

November 1979 to October 1982, and is strong again after October 1982;

the correlation coefficient between the nominal interest rate and our

measure of expected inflation is .95 for 1953:1—1979:10, .08 far

1979:11—1982:10, 81 for 1982:11—1984:12. The lack of a Fisher effect

from 1979:11 to 1982:10 is not surprising considering the dramatic

increase in the variability of the estimated ex ante real rate during

this period. Only if there was a similar rise in the variability of

expected inflation or a change in the correlation of expected inflation

with ex ante real rates could this fail to be the case.

      The relationship of ex ante real rates-and the supply shock vari-

able also shifts following October 1979. Whereas before October 1979 a

rise in the relative price of energy is associated with a significant

decrease in ex ante real rates, after this date it is associated with a

rise in ex ante real rates. Given the theoretical ambiguity associated

with the effects of supply shocks an ex ante real rates and this change

in sign of its regression coefficient, we have some concern that the



29
     Because of our concern about the interpretation of the supply shock
     variable, we have conducted the stability tests described in Table 2
     excluding the supply shock variable from the list of regressors. We
     continue to find significant shifts in the real rate process in
     October 1979 and October 1982. The test for equality of coefficients
     in 1953:1—1979:10 and 1979:11—1982;lQjelds F(4,350) = 10.73 (mar-
     ginal significance level = 3.3x10 ). The test for equality of
     coefficients in 1979:11—1982:10 and 1982:11—1984:12 yields F(4,54)

supply shock variable may be proxying for other economic factors.29

       Our characterization of the real rate process suggests that there

are strong similarities between the 1953:1—1979:10 and 1982:11—1984:12

periods. Both periods display a negative correlation between nominal

interest rates and ex ante real rates, a strong Fisher effect, and

similar variability in ex ante real rates.3° In contrast, the 1979:11—

1982:10 period, when the Fed deemphasizes interest rate smoothing,


3')
      Blanchard and Summers (1984) suggest that an upward shift in invest-
      ment profitability may have been an important source of high ex ante
      real interest rates after 1982. Following Blanchard and Summers, we
      have also examined forecast errors from time series models of real
      gross private fixed investment to see if investment has been strong
      since October 1979.
           Because residuals from a regression of investment on current
      and past values of real GNP appear to be nanstationary, our
      forecasting models regress the change in investment on the current
      and lagged changes in real BNP over the the 1953:1—1979:111 period.
      We then conducted dynamic simulations for the period beginning with
      1979:IV to obtain forecasts of investment to compare with actual
      investment. As long as four lags of real 6NP changes are included as
      regressors, further lags of real GNP and         alternative   ARIMA
      specifications for the error term produce very similar findings.
           For real gross business fixed investment (gross private fixed
      investment excluding residential investment), the dynamic forecast
      errors are positive after 1980 and grow in size in 1983 and 1984,
      averaging $20 billion (1972 dollars) for all of 1984. This evidence
      provides some support for Blanchard and Summers contention that
      investment spending has been strong recently. However, for real
      gross private fixed investment (including residential investment),
      there is much less evidence for buoyant investment spending before
      1983. Dynamic forecast errors are negative until 1983:IV, and they
      average only $5 billion (1972 dollars) in 1984.
           An upward shift in profitability may help to explain why the
      stochastic process of real rates after October 1982, although
      similar in many ways to that before October 1979, is significantly
      different. In particular, the overall level of ex ante real rates is
      substantially higher after October 1982 than it is before October
      1979 and this may be related to the strong investment performance in
      this period. A test for whether coefficients remain stable across
      these two periods if the constant terms are allowed to differ
      EF(4,338) = 1.41 (marginal siqnificance level = .23)] indicates that
      the source of the significant difference between the two periods is
      an upward shift in the level of ex ante real rates. (Note, however,
      that this test may not have very much power because we also found
      that,   when  comparing the 1982:11—1984:12 and 1979:11—1982:10
      peric.ds, we could not reject stability of the other coefficients
      besides the constant term.)

displays a positive correlation between nominal and ex ante real rates,

a weak Fisher effect, and variability in ex   ante   real rates that is

substantially higher than in the periods before or after.

     The characterization of the ex ante real rate process from 1979:11—

1982:10 is not totally without precedent, however. As found in Mishkin

(1984), West Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland also have a posi-

tive correlation between nominal and ex ante real rates, a weak Fisher

effect and greater variability of ex ante real rates than the U.S. in

the period 1967—79. Could it be that the change in the Fed operating

procedures in October 1979 produced a monetary policy regime similar to

that found in these countries before 1979?



                 V. Uncertainty and Ex Ante Real Rates



     Casual inspection of the data for the October 1979 to October 1982

period reveals that the adoption of the Fed's new operating procedures

led to increased uncertainty about interest rate movements, money supply

growth, and possibly inflation. This, combined with the results of the

previous section which suggest that the Feds change in operating proce-

dures may account for the shifts in the real rate process, makes it

worth examining whether this increased uncertainty is the critical

feature of the monetary policy regime shift that alters real rate move-

ments in recent years. Such a view has been espoused by Mascaro and

tleltzer (1983) who argue that increased money growth uncertainty caused

the rise in ex ante real interest rates after October 1979. Research by

Fama (1976) and Hartman and Makin (1982) has also pointed to uncertainty

about inflation and interest rates as possible factors that affect ex

ante real interest rates.

      Because the Mascaro and Melt:er (1983) results concerning the

effects of money growth uncertainty on interest rates are so striking,

we extend our analysis to include a measure of money growth uncertainty.

which was constructed using their procedure. Specifically, we have fit

univariate time series models to the Ml money growth series in order to

extract a series of forecast errors.1 The money growth uncertainty

measure () equals the square root of the average sum of squared

forecast errors over the previous twelve months.

      Table 5 presents estimates of ex post real rate regressions that

include       in the information set X. We look at the 1953:1 to 1979:10

period to see whether money growth uncertainty has any explanatory power

before the Fed adopts its new operating procedure. We look at the 1953:1

to 1984:12 period to see whether uncertainty can help explain the recent

unusual behavior of ex ante real interest rates. The results do not

support the proposition that money growth uncertainty is an important

determinant of ex ante real interest rates. in contrast to Mascaro and

Meltzer (1983), we find that the         coefficients enter with a negative

sign in three out of four cases so that they cannot explain the rise in

ex ante real rates after October 1979. In addition they are never sig—

      After performing Box—Jenkins (1970) identification procedures, the
      following ARIMA models were fit to data for the three periods: for
      1952:1—1979:10, an autoregressive model with AR parameters at lags
      2, 3, 4, and 6; for 1979:11—1982:10 and 1982: 101984:12, autoregres-
      sive models with AR parameters at lag 1. The u   measure constructed
      from the one—step—ahead forecast errors from these models is the one
      used in Table 5. in order to check for robustness, we also con-
      structed another        measure from the forecast errors of an
      autoregressive model with AR parameters at lags 1, 3 and 6, fit to
      the entire 1952:1—1984:12 sample period. Results of using this
      measure wer roughly similar: the signs of the estimated coeffi-
      cients on      were identical to those reported in Table 5 and were
      insignificant in all but the last regression where it entered with a
      coefficient of .12 and a t—statistic of 2.28.

     We have also tested whether the inclusion of this measure of money

growth uncertainty affects the conclusion that significant shifts in the

real rate process occur in October 1979 and October 1982. Not surpris-

ingly, the rejections of stability continue to be strong. For example,

the test for equality of coefficients in the 1953:1—1979:10 and 1979:11—

1982:10 periods yields an F(6,346) = 10.80 (marginal significance level

=   51x1011).      The test for equality of coefficients in the 1979:11—

1982:10 and 1982:11—1984:12 periods yields an F(6,50) =   2.69   (marginal

significance level =   2.4 x104).
     The failure of the results in Table 5 to provide evidence that

money growth uncertainty is an important determinant of ex ante real

interest rates may be attributable to econometric difficulties. Measur-

ing uncertainty with a weighted average of past squared forecast errors

and then including it in an OLS regression can be thought of as a clas-

sic errors—in—variables problem.33 A way around this problem has been

suggested by Pagan (1984). His procedure involves including the contem-

poraneous measure of uncertainty as a regressor and estimating the

equation by instrumental variables using lagged measures of uncertainty

as instruments.

     Table 6 reports results obtained when Pagans procedure is used to


    While negative coefficients on       are the "wrong" sign from the
    point of view of explaining the rise in ex ante real rates after
    October 1979, they are not inconsistent with some theoretical models
    of how uncertainty affects ex ante real interest rates. For example,
    see Bohn (1985).

    The uncertainty variable that presumably belongs in the regression
    is the true standard deviation of the forecast error which is
    measured imperfectly as the square root of an equally weighted
    average of past squared forecast errors. This mismeasurement never
    disappears, even if the sample size grows to infinity, because the
    number of forecast errors used in the estimation is independent of
    sample size.

examine the association of ex ante real rates with uncertainty not only

about money growth, but also about inflation and nominal interest rates.

The uncertainty variable for money growth (r), inflation                 and

interest rates          are contemporaneous absolute values of forecast

errors obtained from time series models.34 The results for the money

growth uncertainty variable are similar to those reported in Table 5.

The signs of the     coefficients are identical to those found for

and none of these coefficients is significant at the 5/. level.

      In all the regressions, the results on inflation uncertainty are

consistent with the premise that increases in inflation uncertainty

raise ex ante real interest rates. However, none of the        coefficients

is significantly different from zero. Results on interest rate uncer-

tainty are somewhat more mixed. The        coefficients are significant when




     For money growth, we use the same forecast errors that were used in
     constructing the Mascaro—Meltzer uncertainty measure.       Forecast
     errors for nominal interest rates were constructed from ursivariate
     time series models developed using Box—Jenkins identification proce-
     dures. The following ARIMA models for the change in the nominal
     interest rate were fit to data for the three periods; for 1952:1—
     1979:10, an autoregressive model with AR parameters at lags 1, 4,
     and 6; for 1979:11—1982:10 and 1982:10—1984:12, a white noise
     specification. Forecast errors for inflation were generated from the
     ex post real rate regressions estimated separately over the three
     periods. The results in Table 6 use four lags of the absolute values
     of the forecast errors as instruments. In order to check for robust-
     ness, we also estimated these regressions with only one lag and also
     twelve lags of the absolute of the forecast errors as instruments.
     We also obtained forecast errors from time series models estimated
     over the entire 1952:1—1984:12 sample period. The ARIMA model for
     money growth and the ex post real rate regression used to generate
     inflation forecast errors have already been described for this
     period, while the ARIMA model for the change in the nominal interest
     rate is an autoregressive model with AR parameters at lag 7 and 8.
     Results with all of these alternative specifications are similar to
     those found in Table 6. The signs of the    coefficients are typi-
     cally the same, and they are only significant in the same cases that
     they are significant in Table 8. These results are available from
     the authors by request.

no    other information is included in the regressions.3' However, when

other information is added to the regressions, nominal interest rate

uncertainty has no significant additional explanatory power for ex ante

real interest rates. Furthermore, in the specification in which the

coefficients of          are significantly. different from zero, the coeff i—

cients change sign when the 1953:1—1979:10 sample is extended through

1984:12.36

       In summary, uncertainty variables do not have much explanatory
                                 37
power for ax ante real rates.         Thus to understand how the recent

changes in monetary policy regime might have affected ax ante real

rates, it is necessary to look elsewhere.




         VI.   Ex Ante Real Rates and the 1920 Monetary Regime Shift



       We have presented evidence suggesting- that recent shifts in a


      1979;10 period is in agreement with the findings of Farna (1976).
 36
      Bodie, Kane and McDonald (1983) also fail to find evidence that the
      riskiness of nominal bonds can explain the recent rise of ax ante
      real rates on short maturity assets.

      Although a variable may not be statistically significant, it is
      alwaysworth asking whether the size of its coefficient might make
      it economically significant. Given that uncertainty for money
      growth, inflation and interest rates rose in the 1979:11—1982:10, we
      can see what would be the largest positive effect on ex ante real
      interest rates arising from increased uncertainty by applying the
      most positive coefficients in Table 6 to the change in the standard
      deviations of these variables from 193:1—1979:10 to 1979:11—
      1982: 10. The result of this exercise is that the largest positive
      effect an ex ante real rates from uncertainty is 10 basis points for
      monetary growth, 20 basis points from inflation and 189 basis points
      from nominal interest rates. The first two are clearly economically
      insignificant. Although the third can be considered economically
      important, recall that we must assume that no other information
      other than nominal interest rate uncertainty is helpful for predict-
      ing ax ante real rates (something we can statistically reject) in
      order to arrive at this figure.

monetary policy regime    have   been an important determinant of the be-

havior of real interest rates. If this is true, there should be breaks

in the stochastic process of real rates in other periods which contain

similar changes in the direction of monetary policy. One such period is

1916—27.   In January and June of 1920, the Federal Reserve carried out

the steepest rises in the discount rate in the first 50 years of its

Feds history —— raising the discount rate by 1 1147. in January and 17.

in June. Two aspects of this period make it especially attractive to

study. First, since discount rate changes were the primary tool for

conducting monetary policy in this period, the sharp rises in the dis-

count rate represented a definite change in the direction of monetary

policy. Changes in the discount rate were particularly potent at this

time because the total amount of member bank borrowing from the Fed

exceeded the amount of nonborrowed reserves. Second, this regime shift

has several similarities to the more recent regime shift. In both

periods, the U.S. had been experiencing a sustained high level of   infla-
tion and the dollar was facing foreign exchange pressure prior to the

shift. After the regime change there was a rapid disinflation in both

periods.

     Our analysis of cx ante real interest rate behavior surrounding the

time of the regime shift is conducted using the same techniques we

applied previously. The major difficulty we encounter when examining

this period is that reliable monthly data on one—month, default—free,

government bonds are not available. The only reliable interest rate data

are for 4—6 month commercial paper, 90 day stock exchange time loans

and stock exchange call loans. Since maturities of these assets span the

one—month maturity we desire, and also because they have different risk

characteristics, our strategy is to examine results based on interest

rates from all three assets. Findings that are consistent for all three

assets, would presumably extend to the ex ante real rate on a one—month

U.S. Treasury bill, had such an asset. existed. Another difficulty is

that inflation data for this period are of lower quality than current

inflation data. Nonetheless, the results for this period are so striking

that we doubt that they would be substantially altered if higher quality

data were available.

     Our specification of the    variables in the ex post real rate

regressions for the 1916—1927 period is the same as for the 193—84

period, with the exception that data were not readily available to

construct the supply shock variable so it was not included. This means

that for each asset, the information set X contains a constant term,

the nominal interest rate on that asset (it), and two   lags   of inflation

       and t—2 The results from the diagnostic check of                 the

Xe—specification for the 1916—27 period appear in Table 7. There is no

evidence of any serial correlation of the residuals from the ex post

real rate regressions for any asset in either time period. Thus, we have

found no evidence that we have omitted information relevant for predict-

ing ex ante real rates from our regressions.

     Table 8 contains the tests of coefficient stability in the ex post

real rate regressions in the 1916—27 period. Given the two sharp rises

in the discount rate in January and June of 1920, choosing a date for

the monetary policy regime shift is somewhat ambiguous. In practice it

does not make a difference: choosing either date, we find a highly

significant shift of the real rate process. Since timing evidence

presented in Table .9    indicates that the breakpoint occurs in June of

1920, the results of Table 8 use this dating.

is only one significant shift in the real rate process during the 1916—
              40
27 period.

      Table 9 presents the results of using the Quandt procedure for

dating the timing of the shift in the real rate process. In contrast to

the likelihood surface examined for the 1953—84 period, the likelihood

function is very well defined for all three assets in the 1916—27

period. Evidence for all three assets is in agreement that the most

likely date for the break in the real rate process is June 1920, the

date of the second large increase in the discount rate.

      The timing evidence for the 1916—27 period indicates that, just as

in October 1979, a monetary regime change is associated with a sig—

nificant shift in the stochastic process of real interest rates. This

evidence adds further support to the view that the recent changes in the




38
     The reason the results are so similar for all three assets is that
     there i very little variation in the nominal interest rates for
     each asset, with the result that most of the variation in the ex
     post real interest rates is attributable to changes in inflation.

     An F—test using the ratio of the estimated variances of the two
     sample periods reveals that that the variance of the residuals is
     significantly higher in 1916:1—1920:6 than in 1920:7—1927:12. Thus,
     we also conducted the stability tests correcting for heteroscedas—
     ticity. For 4—6 month commercial paper, F(4,136) = 12.54 for 90 day
     stock exchange time loans, F(4,136) = 11.58. for stock exchange call
     loans, F(4,136) = 11.73. These results lead to the same conclusion
     as those presented in Table 8.
40
     To check for the possibility of a second breakpoint, we used the
     Quandt procedure to locate the most likely pair of breakpoints in
     the 1916—27 sample period. The result was June 1920 and March 1922.
     When conducting the standard F—test for coefficient equality before
     and after the second breakpoint, we failed to find a significant
     shift despite using this search technique which maximizes the prob-
     ability of finding a significant shift in the real rate process.

monetary regime have been an important source of the unusual behavior of

real rates.

      We now proceed to examine the way in which the stochastic process

of real rates changes at the time of the 1920 regime shift. is the

nature of the changes in the real rate process at the time of the regime

shift similar to that found recently? We first examine this question by

generating estimates of ex ante real interest rates using fitted values

from the separate ex post real rate regressions for the 1916:1—1920:6

and 1920:7—1927:12 periods.41 Because the estimates are so similar for

all the assets, we only report those for stock exchange call loans in

Figure 2.

      We see that estimated ex ante real rates during the inflationary

period prior to June 1920 are persistently negative, just as                          they were
prior to October 1979. After the June 1920 monetary regime shift, they

climb to extremely high levels, sometimes exceeding 25X, and then settle

down to around the 4 1/27. level after mid 1922 when the deflation is

over and price stability is lnaintained.42 The variability of the ex ante

real rates also appears to be higher after June 1920 than before: the

standard deviation of the estimated ex ante real rate is 2.17. in 1916:1—

1920:6 and is       6.8'h    in 1920:7—1927:12. Even after price stability has

been achieved! the variability of ex ante real rates continues to be

higher than before June 1920: the standard deviation of the estimated ex

ante   real rate is 4.07..

       Although the rise in ex ante real rates is far greater after the

1920 regime shift than after October 1979, the general pattern we saw in

the post—October 1979 period seems to be repeated.43 After the regime

shift in both periods ex ante real rates climb to a temporarily high

level and then settle down to a level that is permanently higher than in

the pre—regime shift period. Although the securities used in Figures 1

and 2 are not strictly comparable, adjusting for these differences would

probably not change the conclusion that the ex ante real interest rates

we see currently are at a similar level to those found after 1922.

       Further similarities between the behavior of real rates after the

monetary regime shifts of June 1920 and October 1979 are evident in the

regression results of Table 10. As we found for the entire post World

War II period, ex ante real rates are negatively correlated with ex-

pected inflation, usually significantly so.       We also again find that

during the inflationary period before the regime shift, the correlation

between nominal interest rates and ex ante real rates is negative, while

afterwards the correlation becomes positive. Furthermore, during the



    rate at a breakpoint is likely to be an artifact of splitting the
    sample for the ex post real rate regressions at 1920:6.

    One possible reason why real rates climb to much higher levels after
    June 1920 than after October 1979 is that the disinflation after
   June 1920 was far more rapid than the recent disinflation.

inflationary period we find a strong Fisher effect —— a positive cor-

relation between nominal interest rates and our measure of expected

inflation equal to .74; while after June 1920, the correlation between

nominal interest rates and estimated expected inflation even becomes

strongly negative, equaling —.92.

     Our examination of the 1916—27 period reveals that the surprising

behavior of ex ante real rates that we have been experiencing in the

last ten years has historical precedent. In both periods, a central

feature of the changes in monetary policy regime is that they are fol-

lowed by a substantial disinflation. Our evidence that both regime

shifts are, closely associated with changes in the stochastic process of

real interest rates suggests that disinflation may well be an important

characteristic of   the regime changes affecting ex ante real interest
rates.




                            VII. Conclusions



     This paper has examined evidence that changes in monetary policy

regimes are an important factor in explaining the recent unusual be—




    fnother possible factor often cited as a source of the current high
    real interest rates are the current and prospective large budget
    deficits. although evidence analyzing the link between budget
    deficits and real interest rates does not support a strong connec-
    tion [Blanchard and Summers (1984), and Evans (1985)], the perspec-
    tive in this paper suggests that the possible link between deficits
    and real rates might be better understood by concentrating on a
    regime shift in the budgetary process. Evidence in Eisner and Pieper
    (1984) indicates that when the high employment budget surplus as a
    percentage of GNP is appropriately corrected for price and interest
    effects, it is rarely negative in the postwar period. Beginning in
    1982,  it swings sharply into the negative range and can be expected
    to remain there for some time in the future. This may indicate that
    there has been a shift in the budgetary regime which might be linked
    to recent behavior of real interest rates. However, Barro (1984)

havior of ex ante real interest rates.44 We find that not only are there

significant shifts in the stochastic process of real interest rates in

October 1979 and October 1982 when the Federal Reserve alters its be-

havior, but   these dates are also found to be the most likely breakpoints

in the real rate process.

     Although these results point the finger at monetary regime changes

as a factor explaining the unusual behavior of ex ante real rates, we

run the danger of fitting one historical episode with one tailor—made

theory. Truly convincing evidence that monetary policy is important must

rely on examining similar °controll.ed experimentsu in other time

periods. If we examine other time periods with similar monetary policy

regime changes and we fail to find a correspondence between shifts in

the stochastic process of ex ante real rates and the regime changes,

then the results from the recent experience become less convincing. In

contrast, if we do find such a correspondence, we have more confidence

that monetary policy regime shifts have played an important role in the

recent real rate experience.

     Our examination of another time period, that surrounding the 1920

monetary regime shift when the discount rate was raised sharply,

produces a striking correspondence between the regime change and the

shift in the real rate process. The shift away from an inflationary

monetary policy regime is associated with a change from a negative

orrelation between nominal and real interest rates to a positive cor-

relation. In addition, the Fisher effect significantly diminishes with

the change in monetary regime. Finally, the shift away from the infla-

tionary monetary regime is associated with a sharp rise in cx ante real



    presents evidence that no regime shift far fiscal policy has oc-
    curred.

rates,    while after the disinflation is complete, ex ante real rates

remain at a high level.

        In this paper, we have examined several pieces of evidence to

provide an explanation of recent real rate behavior. Although each piece

of evidence by itself may not be compelling, we find that taken

together,       there is strong support for the view that the recent shift in

real rate behavior is a monetary phenomenon. Althouqh our evidence does

not rule out affects from such factors as the high budget deficits or

financial deregulation in the 1980s,         it does suggest that monetary

factors are more important since high budget deficits or financial

deregulation were not a feature of the 1920s,a period which displays
                                                         45
real    rate behavior similar to that in recent years.

        Our findings also provide a different perspective on the recent

behavior of real interest rates. When many economists discuss the recent

behavior of real interest rates, they describe it as unusual. An impor-

tant conclusion that comes out of our analysis is that what appears to

be unusual behavior of real interest rates is only unusual from the

perspective of the post World War II U.S experience. In a wider histori-

cal context the recent behavior of real interest rates is not unusual at

all.




       Although  the federal government ran substantial budget deficits in
       the years 1917—1919 as a result of World War I, there were budget
       surpluses in every year from 1920 to 1927. (See the federal budget
