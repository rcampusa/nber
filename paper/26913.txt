On the Representativeness of Voter Turnout
Louis Kaplow and Scott Duke Kominers
NBER Working Paper No. 26913
March 2020
JEL No. D71,D72

                                          ABSTRACT

Prominent theory research on voting uses models in which expected pivotality drives voters'
turnout decisions and hence determines voting outcomes. It is recognized, however, that such
work is at odds with Downs's paradox: in practice, many individuals turn out for reasons
unrelated to pivotality, and their votes overwhelm the forces analyzed in pivotality-based models.
Accordingly, we examine a complementary model of large-N elections at the opposite end of the
spectrum, where pivotality effects vanish and turnout is driven entirely by individuals' direct
costs and benefits from the act of voting itself. Under certain conditions, the level of turnout is
irrelevant to representativeness and thus to voting outcomes. Under others, however, "anything is
possible": starting with any given distribution of preferences in the underlying population, there
can arise any other distribution of preferences in the turnout set and thus any outcome within the
range of the voting mechanism. Particular skews in terms of representativeness are characterized.
The introduction of noise in the relationship between underlying preferences and individuals'
direct costs and benefits from voting produces, in the limit, fully representative turnout. To
illustrate the potential disconnect between the level of turnout (a focus of much empirical
literature) and representativeness, we present a simple example in which, as noise increases, the
turnout level monotonically falls yet representativeness monotonically rises.

1       Introduction
Endogenous voter turnout and consequent voting outcomes are a focus of theoretical research
on voting behavior. Game-theoretic analysis has been used to examine a variety of models
in which turnout is driven by pivotality. For example, Ledyard (1984), Myerson (2000),
and Krishna and Morgan (2015) consider models in which more intense preferences generate
greater turnout, in light of voter's independently distributed costs, so as to produce utilitar-
ian outcomes in the limit. Pursuing a different angle, Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1996, 1999)
and McMurray (2013) show how, when voting is costless, endogenous turnout can efficiently
aggregate voters' information as a consequence of strategic abstention by less-informed vot-
ers. See also Kim and Fey (2007) offering an extension under which aggregation may not be
efficient in equilibrium and Martinelli (2006) examining costly information acquisition.
    It is understood, however, that the pivotality-focused literature is in tension with an
older, simpler line of work associated with Downs (1957). See, for example, the surveys
by Feddersen (2004) and Mueller (2003). Because voters incur a positive cost, C , and the
pivotality probability is extremely small in actual elections, there arises a paradox: voting is
ex ante irrational for almost everyone yet turnout is substantial.1 Theoretical and empirical
research supports the conjecture that pivotality probabilities are indeed quite small in large-
N elections with notable turnout. To explain nontrivial turnout, Riker and Ordeshook (1968)
introduce D, the utility from the act of voting per se (see also Harsanyi (1969)). But once
significant numbers of individuals turn out because D > C , the pivotality-driven effects
identified in the game-theoretic literatures become vanishingly small.2
    We undertake a positive, theoretical analysis of the determinants of voter turnout in
large-N elections with a focus on the representativeness of the turnout set. In the spirit
of work inspired by Downs (1957), we offer a perspective complementary to that in much
of the modern theoretical literature by investigating what may be viewed as an opposite
setting. Rather than taking C to be 0 or focusing on neighborhoods of 0 (when taking
limits), while setting D to the side--which makes pivotality central and (in some models)
turnout negligible--we instead employ a model with a continuum of individuals, where D >
C on a set of positive measure, so that turnout is infinite and therefore the probability
that any vote is pivotal is literally 0. We explore how different relationships among the
population distribution of preferences, C , and D map to turnout sets, with an emphasis on
    1
     A related paradox, with similar suggested resolutions, concerns why voters (and even many nonvoters)
undertake substantial information collection efforts. See, for example, Fiorina (1990).
   2
     See also Palfrey and Rosenthal (1985), who conclude by noting that the introduction of even a small
degree of uncertainty in their model produces a qualitatively different result, wherein only individuals with
D > C turn out.

its representativeness. Although not the focus, our results have straightforward implications
for voting outcomes and provide insights into candidate positioning.
    Section 2 reviews highlights of the literature on the probability of pivotality in large-
N elections and relates our enterprise to existing theory. Section 3 presents our analysis.
Like prior research, we seek to understand the composition of the turnout set, which is
a selected sample that is not in general representative of the population as a whole. In
our model, turnout is determined by the joint density function that characterizes the rela-
tionship between individuals' preferences and their C s and Ds. Our results concerning the
representativeness of turnout vary widely, depending on this density function, and they are
qualitatively different from those in existing literatures.
    Our first two propositions offer simple characterizations of polar cases. When preferences
are distributed independently of C and D, the turnout set is representative: that is, the
distribution of preferences in the turnout set is the same as that in the underlying population,
and this is so no matter how low turnout is (as long as it is of positive measure). For any
scale-invariant voting mechanism, such as majority rule or proportionality, the outcome is
accordingly the same as that with full turnout.
    By contrast, when no restrictions are placed on the relationship between preferences, C ,
and D, anything is possible. Specifically, starting with any given underlying distribution
of preferences (with positive density on a compact domain), it is possible that the turnout
set will have any other distribution of preferences. (For example, true preferences could be
skewed extremely to the left with the resulting turnout set just as skewed to the right, or
vice versa.) An implication is that, for any given true preferences, literally any outcome
within the range of the voting mechanism can arise.
    Our third and fourth propositions present the implications of particular interrelation-
ships between preferences, C , and D. When the joint distribution is (approximately)
deterministic--that is, when individuals with a given preference tend to have almost the
same C s and Ds--it is straightforward to characterize the turnout set. To take a special
case, if the relationship between D - C and preferences is linear (and such that a positive
mass, but not everyone, turns out), then there is a simple skew in the turnout set and,
accordingly, in the outcomes of simple voting schemes such as majority rule.
    We then introduce noise: sequences of mean-preserving spreads of the distributions for
C and D, conditional on preferences. In the limit, the turnout set is representative and
the turnout level is 50%. We further demonstrate that there exist simple cases in which
increasing noise causes the turnout set to become monotonically more representative (the
median voter in the turnout set monotonically approaches the median in the population) and
the turnout level to monotonically approach 50%. An immediate implication is that higher


                                               3
turnout does not go hand in hand with a more representative turnout set: here, whenever
turnout is initially above 50%, increasing noise monotonically raises representativeness while
monotonically reducing turnout.
    Section 4 discusses how our results cast much prior literature in a new light--and suggests
some reorientation of theoretical and empirical research on voting. Specifically, there is a need
for greater focus on how C and D may systematically vary with underlying preferences--
currently a feature of certain strands of empirical work on marginal voters, although without
the structure provided by our analysis. As an illustration from the theoretical literature, we
briefly return to the costly voting model of Ledyard (1984) and others. We explain how,
on one hand, allowing a positive D renders much of the analysis moot. Even so, we find
that putting certain structure on the joint distribution (allowing the magnitude of D to be
correlated with preference intensity) can generate results in the spirit of those in the original
papers, although other seemingly plausible assumptions produce quite different outcomes.
We also revisit empirical work by Funk (2010) on mail-in voting that reveals competing
effects on the level of turnout (it reduces C s but also Ds), suggesting that such reforms may
be unimportant. We consider instead the implications of these two distinct forces for the
composition of turnout, which could significantly influence voting outcomes through both
channels. More broadly, we explain how our emphasis on the turnout set illuminates a
number of additional subjects, from endogenous candidate positioning to the assessment of
a variety of voting reforms.
    Before proceeding, we offer the important caveat that our analysis is entirely positive.
A more representative turnout set need not generate socially superior outcomes for such
standard reasons as that majority rule does not weight preferences by intensity, underlying
preferences may not be equally well-informed, and they are subject to manipulation via elec-
tioneering. Nevertheless, understanding the determinants of the turnout set is fundamental
in analyzing a range of relevant behaviors and policies, particularly those aimed at influenc-
ing voter turnout--including activities of political campaigns and voting reforms aimed at
enhancing or suppressing the turnout of individuals likely to have particular preferences.


2     Literature
The voting literature is vast. Here we present some of the work related to pivotality, with
additional references more pertinent to the implications of our analysis deferred to section
4. We begin with analyses of the probability of pivotality in large-N elections, which pro-
vide a perspective on important lines of the theoretical literature and a motivation for our
investigation.

                                               4
    Chamberlain and Rothschild (1981) examine a model in which there is a majority vote
between two alternatives, voters' preferences are drawn from a binomial distribution, and the
pertinent probability for that distribution is itself drawn from another distribution. They
derive that the probability of an individual being pivotal is on the order of 1/N in large-N
elections.3
    Gelman, Silver, and Edlin (2012) offer an empirical analysis of the 2008 presidential
election and find that the probability of a vote being pivotal (taking into account complexities
due to the Electoral College) was approximately 1 in 60 million. In a number of states, the
probability was less than 1 in a billion; at the other end of the spectrum, in a handful of
states, the probability was around 1 in 10 million. Although the pivotality probability varied
by orders of magnitude across the states, the turnout differentials did not reflect even a sliver
of that difference.4
    Mulligan and Hunger (2003) assembled a substantial historical database of House elec-
tions and state legislative races, both of which have vastly smaller electorates than the nation
as a whole. The pivotality probability was roughly 1 in 89,000 for the former and 1 in 15,000
for the latter.5
    Enos and Fowler (2014, 310) aggressively advanced a general conclusion about the ex-
ceedingly low probabilities of being pivotal in large-N elections:6

       This model [in which individuals vote if and only if P B - C + D > 0] provides
       the basis for much of the current understanding of the decision to vote. However,
   3
      Specifically, in the limit as N   the probability of being pivotal is 1/2N times the magnitude of the
(assumed to be continuous) density of the distribution of true probabilities, evaluated at 0.5.
    4
      Some empirical work suggests that closeness influences turnout to some extent (Geys 2006), but even
those modest effects (relative to orders-of-magnitude differences in the pivotality probability) may be ex-
plained by the fact that closer races generate greater publicity, higher campaign expenditures, and more
aggressive get-out-the-vote campaigns (Cox and Munger (1989) and Enos and Fowler (2018)). And surveys
suggesting that voters who turn out have higher estimates of the probability of being pivotal may reflect
cognitive dissonance in providing ex post rationalizations rather than actual, behavior-inducing core beliefs
(Enos and Fowler 2014). Field experiments by Gerber et al. (2017) indicate that perceived closeness has
essentially no effect on turnout.
    5
      Their results are in an important respect the most convincing because they impute the likelihood of a tie
(or one vote from a tie) from the actual distribution of the vote differential in all of the very close contests
that occurred (in a sample of roughly 17,000 House elections and 40,000 state contests). Hence, they rely less
on the sorts of parametric assumptions that are required for most other empirical or theoretical exercises.
    6
      This literature understates pivotality probabilities by focusing on single contests in broader elections,
but scaling the probabilities by, say, a factor of ten does not significantly alter the conclusion. In addition,
Schwartz (1987) argues that individuals may vote because outcomes in their precinct may influence local
governments' distribution of benefits, which suggests (contrary to observed behavior) that local elections
should generate greater turnout than national ones. Similarly, it is notable that, even in jurisdictions where
one party is dominant, primaries usually have much lower turnouts (despite the implied higher pivotality
probabilities) than those in general elections; this phenomenon suggests that there are social determinants
of individuals Ds of the sort we elaborate in section 4.


                                                       5
       P is infinitesimal for any large election . . . , so changes to P should have little
       effect on turnout. As Schwartz (1987) aptly points out, "Saying that closeness
       increases the probability of being pivotal is like saying that tall men are more
       likely than short men to bump their heads on the moon." Gerber, Green and
       Larimer (2008), echoing Schwartz, note that "Because the probability of casting
       a decisive vote in an election is typically infinitesimal, the calculus of voting boils
       down to the relative weight of C and D."

     By contrast, much of the modern theory research on voting omits D and either takes
C to equal 0 or examines (in the limit as the population grows) C in neighborhoods of
0.7 Consider Ledyard (1984), which has been extended by Myerson (2000) and Krishna
and Morgan (2015), among others.8 The central model posits that individuals vote when
their utility from being pivotal exceeds their cost of voting, C . An equilibrium with positive
(although extremely small) turnout arises because, if almost no one turned out, the pivotality
probability would be large (generating a utility from pivotality exceeding C for those with
sufficiently low C ), whereas if many turned out, the probability would be too small to sustain
that turnout level. The key substantive result is that the outcome is utilitarian because the
turnout set accurately reflects preference intensity, whereas majority vote with full turnout
would not.
     The theoretical literature just discussed assumes that preferences and individuals' C s
are distributed independently and, moreover, that the density of the distribution of C is
positive on [0, 1] (with no point mass at 0). The intuition can be seen by recognizing that,
when one examines neighborhoods of 0, the density will be approximately uniform. In a
large but finite population (individuals with given preferences have their C s drawn from the
aforementioned distribution), the number who turn out for any given intensity is proportional
to that intensity. This can be understood by positing an equilibrium P (which, as N goes
to infinity, we can take to be small) and noting that the fraction of voters who have their
randomly chosen C fall below PB will (in the limit) be proportional to B, the individual's
benefit from swinging the outcome.
     Clearly, if one introduces even a very small D into these models in which all those who
vote have C s in the neighborhood of 0, a notable fraction of individuals will choose to vote
   7
     A sizable portion of a larger voting literature likewise emphasizes pivotality in some fashion. Enos and
Fowler (2014, 310) reviewed "all articles published on voter turnout since 1980 that appear in five leading
political science journals. Of the 70 articles . . . that addressed the causes of voter turnout, 41 made a clear
appeal to the importance of pivotality or electoral competition."
   8
     In Ledyard's paper that launched this line of work, candidates endogenously choose positions, and
equilibria can have the form that literally no one votes because both candidates choose identical positions
at the electorate's preferred point (in the sense discussed in the text to follow).



                                                       6
regardless of pivotality--indeed, an infinite number in the limit. The probability of pivotality
approaches 0 even more rapidly, implying that preference-intensity-based turnout in these
models becomes a negligible fraction of all voters.
    To take another example, Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1996, 1999), Kim and Fey (2007),
and McMurray (2013) explore when endogenous turnout can efficiently aggregate voters'
information as a consequence of strategic abstention by less-informed voters. In this model,
C = 0 and D = 0 for everyone. Hence, voting is motivated entirely by pivotality, and
individuals wish to vote only if their information indicates that they would gain from tipping
the election when their vote is decisive. If C were instead positive for almost everyone, few
would vote, as noted by Feddersen (2004).9 Moreover, as McMurray (2015) suggests, if many
have a positive D as well, large numbers of uninformed individuals will vote, which renders
the pivotality probability negligible and the information aggregation effect nil.
    In the foregoing literatures and others, the analysis and results would be undermined in
models that include both C and D, thereby yielding substantial turnout and, accordingly,
trivial probabilities of pivotality--consistent with the aforementioned literature on that sub-
ject. Pivotality effects are not merely supplemented by others but essentially vanish. This
is our point of departure: our model takes the pivotality probability to be 0 and focuses
instead on characterization of the turnout set when voters are those for whom D - C > 0. In
section 4, we return to the existing literature and explain how, under certain assumptions,
results similar to those obtained in the prior literature can be resurrected in our framework,
albeit through a different mechanism.


3       Model and Analysis
There is a compact set X of outcomes. Each agent i has a type consisting of a preferred
outcome xi  X , a personal cost C i  0 of voting, and a personal benefit Di  0 from the
act of voting itself.
    The distribution of agent types in the population has density function f (xi , Di , C i ), which
we assume to be continuous. Here and throughout, we abuse notation by writing f for an
operator to indicate corresponding marginal and conditional densities.10 Then, we denote
    9
     Compounding the conundrum is that the costs and cognitive challenges individuals face in determining
whether or how to vote in these information aggregation models may be far greater than the costs of simply
becoming informed to begin with and in any event likely outweigh their povitality benefit from voting.
  10
     We use the somewhat unorthodox convention of writing "xi =" in f (xi = x) and similar expressions,
to make the notation more intuitively comparable with probabilities.

throughout to be strictly positive.

is well-defined and non-degenerate. We say that the turnout is representative if tf (x) = f
for all x.
    The voting mechanism V can be taken to be a function that maps the set of agents that
turn out into a social outcome in X . We assume that this function is scale-invariant.

Assumption 1. The voting mechanism V is scale-invariant, i.e., V chooses an outcome
V (tf ) that depends only on the realized vote distribution.

Assumption 1 states that the outcome of the mechanism depends only on the distribution of
preferences of the voters who turn out. In particular, the chosen outcome does not depend
on the mass of voters that shows up. Thus we immediately obtain our first result, aggregate
turnout irrelevance : when the density of types, f , is suitably restricted, the outcome under
realized turnout matches the outcome under full turnout, no matter how low aggregate
turnout is.

Proposition 1. If xi is independent of (Di , C i ) under f , then turnout is representative and
             ~), that is, the outcome of the voting mechanism under the realized turnout is the
V (tf ) = V (f
same as the outcome that would be selected under full turnout.
   11
      Note that, by convention, we assume that agents who are indifferent regarding turnout (i.e., those agents
i for whom Di - C i = 0) do not turn out; this does not affect the turnout distribution because f admits no
atoms in Di - C i .

Proof. The representativeness of turnout is immediate by the independence assumption.
Indeed, we have

                      tf (x) = f (xi = x | Di - C i > 0)

                                 f (xi = x | Di - C i > 0) · Probf [Di - C i > 0]
                             =

                             =
                                       Probf [Di - C i > 0]

                             = f (xi = x)

implies that V (tf ) = V (f

   We now show that for an unrestricted type density f , in an important sense anything
can happen regarding voter turnout and voting outcomes.

bution f consistent with f such that tf = g~, which further implies that V (tf ) = V (~
                                                                                      g ).

Proof. For any given f~ and g
                            ~, we construct the desired type distribution f explicitly. First,
we let Z be any positive real number such that

                                                  g
                                                  ~(x)
                                         max                  < 1.12
                                         xX         ~(x)
                                                 Z ·f

To construct a type distribution with the requisite properties--matching both the underlying
preference distribution f~ and the turnout distribution g~--we proceed as follows: For each x,
our constructed type distribution f will equal the targeted f  ~ on a specified unit interval for
values of Di - C i and it will equal 0 otherwise, thereby replicating the underlying preference
distribution. Moreover, the unit interval for each x will involve a Di - C i that is positive
(meaning that individuals will turn out) on a fraction of the associated unit interval propor-
tional to the targeted g~, thereby generating the requisite turnout distribution. Specifically,
  12
      Such a number Z exists because both g   ~ and f~ are continuous and strictly positive, X is compact, and
continuous functions on compact sets achieve their maxima. Indeed, the assumptions on g            ~ imply that
                                                                                             ~ and f
g
~(x)
f~(x)  is continuous on X as well; hence, it achieves some  maximum   Z  on X  . Taking  Z >  Z  suffices.

    For the remainder of our analysis, we present some limiting results that further charac-
terize possible relationships between turnout and representativeness. In the first, where we
take the variance of individuals' voting costs and benefits to 0, we find that the costs and
benefits determine turnout for each x in a simple way. We let µf (x)  Ef [Di - C i | xi = x]
and f (x)  Varf [Di - C i | xi = x] be the (assumed finite) mean and variance of the net
payoffs to voting for agents who prefer outcome x. We denote by

assumption that {x  X : µfn (x) = µf (x) = 0} has measure 0 (so that outcomes x with
µf (x) = 0 do not affect our integrals); moreover, we omit characterizations of the limit for
any x in this set.

Proposition 3. Suppose that fn is a sequence of agent type distributions with f~        ~

Proof. By Chebyshev's inequality, for any x  X for which µf (x) = 0, we have

                                                                     fn (x)
                    Probfn |(Di - C i ) - µfn (x)|  k | xi = x                            (1)
                                                                      k2

for any k > 0. By assumption, fn (x)  0 as n  . Thus, fixing x  X with µfn (x) = 0
and taking k < |µfn (x)|, we have from (1) that as n  ,

                      Probfn |(Di - C i ) - µfn (x)|  k | xi = x  0.

Therefore, when µfn (x) < 0, we have, as n  ,

                             Probfn Di - C i > 0 | xi = x  0.

Likewise, when µfn (x) > 0, as n  ,

                             Probfn Di - C i > 0 | xi = x  1.

Thus, as n  ,

                         Probfn [Di - C i > 0 | xi = x]  1µfn (x)>0 .                     (2)

It then follows from (2) that, as n  , the total measure of agents who turn out,

                                    Probfn [Di - C i > 0],

as claimed.

   Let V med be a median voter mechanism --that is, V med (tf ) = xmed (tf ), where xmed (tf ) is
the median xi in the turnout set. It follows immediately from Proposition 3 that:

Corollary 1. As n  , we have V med (tfn )  xmed (hf ).

   To give a simple, concrete illustration of a limiting turnout set of the sort characterized
in Proposition 3, consider the following example.

Example 1. Suppose that X = [x, x] for some x, x  R (with x < x), with f               ~ uniform.
Suppose further that, conditional on xi , Di - C i is distributed  N(µf (xi ), fn ), that is, as a
normal random variable with (fixed) mean µf (xi ) and (common) variance fn , which, as in
the construction for Proposition 3, we take to be trending to 0. We furthermore assume that
µf (x) is linear and upward-sloping in x, with µf (x) < 0 and µf (x) > 0. We let xcut  µ-     1
                                                                                            f (0)
be the point x at which the mean of Di - C i is exactly 0, and let xmed n   be the preference of
the median voter in the turnout set. The setting just described is pictured in Figure 1.
    In examining Figure 1, we can see that the turnout set--and accordingly, xmed    n --will be
skewed toward the right. Moreover, as Proposition 3 indicates, in the limit turnout would be
determined entirely by the line itself: all those to the right of xcut turn out; all those to the
left do not. Given our assumed uniform (unconditional) distribution of xi , xmed
                                                                               n   would be half
                 cut
way between x and 1 in the limit. The configuration depicted in Figure 1--albeit more
plausibly a shaded version indicating significant dispersion of the distributions of Di - C i at

                                                   12

each xi --might arise, for example, if those agents i with higher xi tend to have more group
cohesion (and thus a higher Di ), or tend to have lower time costs of turning out (and thus
a lower C i ).

   We now introduce what may be regarded as a sort of inverse to Proposition 3, in which
we take dispersion to increase without bound rather than vanish in the limit.13 To do this,
we now let {n }                 
                  n=1 and {n }n=1 be sequences of random variables with the same strictly
positive (but finite) variance. We suppose that the variables n are identically distributed
and independent of each other, the Di , the C i , and the n ; we likewise suppose that the
variables n are identically distributed and independent of each other, the Di , the C i , and
(by our earlier assumption) of the n . Moreover, we suppose that

                                       E[n ] = 0,        E[n ] = 0.

We let fn be the distribution of agent types under which agents' costs and benefits of voting
are given by C i + 1 + · · · + n and Di + 1 + · · · + n , respectively. The distributions
of costs and benefits under fn are therefore mean-preserving spreads of the distributions of
costs and benefits under fn-1 ; we obtain f1 , f2 , . . . from f by iteratively spreading C i and
  13
    Our results in this setting bear a kinship to the phenomenon of attenuation bias due to classical mea-
surement error.

Proof. We denote n  n - n . We note that the {n }       n=1 have strictly positive (but finite)
                                                        
variance, which we denote by  . Moreover, the {n }n=1 are independent and identically
distributed, with E[n | Di - C i ] = 0 by construction.
    We let

       i    i                      i                      i   i

We have, as n  ,

     Most of the assumptions we use are for simplicity and are stronger than we need for the result. The
result we present is unchanged if the mean-preserving spreads differ within each sequence, as long as there is
a uniform and strictly positive lower bound on the variance of n - n . Additionally, the result is unchanged
if the mean-preserving spreads depend on xi (again, given the required variance lower bound).

where  is the cumulative distribution function of the standard Normal.15
   It follows from (6) that, in the limit as n  , exactly half of the agents of each
preference type x turn out. Indeed, the measure of agents of preference type x who turn out
is

       fn (xi = x | (Di - C i ) + 1 + · · · + n > 0) · Probfn [(Di - C i ) + 1 + · · · + n > 0]

The result on V (tfn ) then follows immediately by the continuity of V .

    To illustrate Proposition 4, we now return to a setting with a uniform distribution of
x and µf (x) rising linearly, akin to the setting we considered in Example 1. This example
will also present a case in which the convergence is monotonic; that is, turnout for every x
approaches 1 2
               monotonically, meaning that overall turnout does as well. Moreover, we will
show that the median voter in the turnout set monotonically approaches the true median
preference in the population.

Example 2. Suppose that, like in Example 1, X = [x, x] for some x, x  R (with x < x),
with f ~ uniform, and suppose that, conditional on xi , Di - C i is distributed  N(µf (xi ), fn ),
that is, as a normal random variable with (fixed) mean µf (xi ) and common variance fn .
But now, as in the construction for Proposition 4, we take fn to grow in n. As before, we
assume that µf (x) is linear and upward-sloping in x, with µf (x) < 0 and µf (x) > 0. We let
xcut  µ-   1                                        i    i
          f (0) be the point at which the mean of D - C is exactly 0. We now let d  |x
                                                                                          cut
                                                                                              - x|
                    cut
and assume that x + d < x. For notational simplicity, we abuse notation slightly by writing
µx  µf (x) and n  fn . The setting just described is pictured in Figure 2.
    To prove monotonicity in addition to convergence to 1  2
                                                             , we examine how turnout changes
                                                                                   cut
in different segments of the preference distribution. First, we observe that as µx = 0, the
linearity of µx and symmetry of the normal distributions N(µx , n ) (along with the uniformity
of f~) imply that, for any x  [x, xcut ), the mass of agents i with xi = x and Di - C i > 0 is
precisely equal to the mass of agents i with Di - C i  0 and

                           xi = [xcut + |xcut - x|]  (xcut , xcut + d],

where the containment of xi in (xcut , xcut + d] follows from the definition of d. This means
that as n  , however much turnout rises at any x  [x, xcut ), turnout falls by precisely
the same amount at the corresponding point [xcut + |xcut - x|]  (xcut , xcut + d]. Formally,
the mass of agents i that turn out with x  [x, xcut ) in the first interval is

                      xcut                                         xcut

        n is the CDF of a normal variable with mean µ and variance n . Meanwhile, the
mass of agents i with xi  (xcut , xcut + d] in the second interval that turn out is

                xcut +d                                            xcut +d

Now, for x  (xcut , xcut + d], we have xn (0) = 1 - n            (0) because µx = 0 and the
normal distributions N(µx , n ) are symmetric about their means. Thus, as we increase n,
the increase in turnout of agents i with xi  [x, xcut ) exactly offsets the decrease in turnout
of agents i with xi  (xcut , xcut + d].

where erf is the error function for the normal distribution.16 As µx > 0 for x  (xcut + d, x],
we see that (9) is decreasing in n . (Note that this logic regarding the integrand in (9)
implies that turnout monotonically converges to 1  2
                                                     for all x.)

    Now, let xmed
              n   be the preference of the median voter that turns out for a given n. Our
                  cut
assumption that x + d < x, combined with the preceding analysis, implies that xmed
                                                                                 n  > xcut
for all n. We let dn = |xmed
                           n  - xcut |. We suppose moreover that dn < d for all n, and let
dn = d - dn . A variant of the preceding argument shows that as n increases:

   1. The increase in turnout of agents i with xi  [x + dn , xcut ) = [xcut - dn , xcut ) is exactly
      offset by the decrease in turnout of agents i with xi  (xcut , xcut + dn ] = (xcut , xmed
                                                                                              n ].

     As can be seen in Figure 2, for any x  (xcut + d, x], the integrand in (9) indicates how much of the
                                                                     1
distribution of Di - C i falls above the axis; this, in turn, equals 2 (for the part of the symmetric distribution
              x
above the µ line) plus the portion falling between that line and the axis. The error function for the stated
value in (9) indicates how much of the density falls within that distance from the µx line (on either side of
the µx line), so half of that value indicates the mass between the line and the axis.
  17
     For the latter term in the numerator, because the erf in the integrand in (9) vanishes in the limit, we
just have 1  2 times the population fraction that falls in the interval given by the limits of integration. To
understand the first term in the numerator, d, note that this is both the portion in the leftmost interval,
[x, xcut ), and those at the corresponding middle interval, (xcut , xcut + d]. Those at any x in the left interval
turn out at a rate that is below 1   2 by the same amount that those at the corresponding x in the middle
interval turn out at a rate that is above 1 2 . Hence, for each corresponding pair of xs in the left and middle
intervals, we have combined turnout of 1, and the interval has width of d.

Observation 1 shows that changes in turnout of agents i with

have no impact on the median voter, since all agents i with xi in those intervals have xi < xmed
                                                                                             n
and the total mass of such agents that turn out is constant. Observations 2 and 3, meanwhile,
imply that the median voter xmed n   falls as n increases, since we see increased turnout of
agents i with xi < xmed
                     n    and decreased turnout of agents i with xi > xmed  n . Combining the

preceding three observations, we see that in this example, xn falls monotonically and, in the
limit as n  , xmed n    approaches the true median preference in the population. If V were
a median voter mechanism, therefore, the voting outcome would monotonically approach
the outcome that would arise with fully representative turnout. Note further that, in this
example, turnout becomes increasingly representative in the broad sense that all groups
with below-50% turnout (those to the left of xcut ) have monotonically increasing turnout
and all those with above-50% turnout (to the right of xcut ) have monotonically decreasing
turnout.18 Finally, when f induces low turnout (below 50%), we have both turnout and
representativeness rising with noise, but when f induces high turnout (above 50%), as in
Figure 2, turnout falls with noise, yet representativeness still rises.


Further Examples
Finally, we consider briefly and informally a couple additional illustrations of the phenomena
depicted in Proposition 3 and 4. Figure 3--which retains our uniform distribution of xi from
Figure 1 and Figure 2--depicts a situation in which the mean of Di - C i conditional on xi is
higher at the extremes and, as drawn, to a greater extent near xi = x. In the Proposition 3
limit in which the variance goes to 0, only the extremes would turn out and, because of this
skew, results under many standard voting mechanisms would be shifted strongly toward the
right extreme outcome x. Note that, as drawn, in the limit xmed   n    would be to the right of
  cut2
x . By contrast, in the Proposition 4 limit in which the variance goes to , turnout would
  18
    One may not, however, further infer that turnout as a whole becomes monotonically more representative
because, for example, among those who turn out at a below-50% rate (to the left of xcut ), we have not shown
that those who turn out less always have turnout rising more rapidly than those who turn out more.

would be higher or lower than that implied by the figure would depend on further particulars.
In general, the changes in both the turnout level and xmed
                                                        n  need not monotonically approach
their limiting values.




                        Figure 3: Nonlinear Mean; Extremists Turn Out

    Now consider Figure 4, which is identical to Figure 3 except that everywhere the sign
(but not the magnitude) of µf (x) is reversed. In the Proposition 3 limit, only the moderates
now turn out and--opposite to what we had before--the skew is toward the left extreme
                                              below x-   x                            1      2

                                                           , but in the interval (xcut , xcut )--and in
that sense the skew is more moderate than in the prior case. Again, if we instead take the
                                                        1
Proposition 4 limit, the turnout level approaches 2        and the turnout set is fully representative,
         med        x-x
with xn  2 .
    Of course, Figures 1­4 depict just a few of the many possibilities. For example, if µf (x)
were nearly horizontal and near the x-axis, perhaps a bit higher here and a bit lower there,
then there might be little systematic skew in the turnout set regardless of the amount of
noise. This case approximates that assumed in Proposition 1.
    The key takeaway from all four propositions is that the conditional density function,
f (xi , Di , C i ), determines representativeness. It also determines the turnout level, but know-
ing the latter tells us little about the former unless we make further assumptions. Likewise,
knowing how a reform influences the turnout level is not in general informative about how

                                                  20

it influences representativeness.


4     Discussion
In our model, the probability of pivotality is literally 0, which the literature in section 2
suggests may often be a good approximation of reality when there is a reasonably large
electorate. As a consequence, turnout is driven entirely by C and D. In this model, the
properties of the joint density function, f (xi , Di , C i ), determine the representativeness of
the turnout set, tf (x), which can differ radically from f     ~(x) , the unconditional density of
individuals' preferences. Our results cast prior theoretical and empirical research as well as
policy analysis of voting reforms in a new light.
    Regarding the theoretical literature, let us revisit Ledyard (1984), Myerson (2000), and
Krishna and Morgan (2015). We previously noted that introducing D, enabling the gener-
ation of the substantial turnout levels observed in practice, eliminates the driving force in
these models, which depends on turnout being very small and determined entirely by the
relative magnitude of each individual's preference intensities and their C s (for those whose
C is in a neighborhood of 0). With D, and maintaining independence of x in the joint
distribution, turnout is fully representative rather than intensity weighted. Of course, that
outcome is only one of many possibilities. If independence is relaxed so that individuals'

                                               21
expressive utilities from voting or senses of duty, captured by D, are positively related to
intensity, some degree of intensity-weighted turnout would be restored.19 On the other hand,
if individuals get greater expressive utility when casting a vote for candidates whose positions
are closer to their own, as suggested by Brennan and Hamlin (1998), then those with the
most extreme (and thus perhaps the most intense) preferences would be underrepresented
in an election with two moderate choices; majority voting outcomes might then be further
from the utilitarian (intensity-weighted) result than with full turnout, as assumed in simple
voting models. Of course, D may instead be high among certain groups for all manner of
reasons that have little to do with preference intensity and may or may not have a system-
atic relationship to preferences. For example, Ali and Lin (2013) suggest that individuals
may vote to be seen as ethical; Harbaugh (1996), Gerber, Green, and Larimer (2008), Funk
(2010), and DellaVigna, List, Malmendier, and Rao (2017) provide evidence that individuals
are more likely to vote if others will learn that they did so; and Bond et al. (2012) show how
individuals' social networks influence who votes. The nature of any dependence reflected in
f (xi , Di , C i ) presents an empirical question.
     Much of the vast literature on the empirical determinants of voter turnout (see the Geys
(2006) survey and Leighley and Nagler (2014) book) attempts to predict turnout levels. Our
analysis suggests that this focus is misplaced if one is interested in representativeness and,
ultimately, voting outcomes. Under the independence assumption underlying Proposition
1, the turnout level is irrelevant to representativeness and--under the scale-invariant voting
mechanisms that are commonly employed in large elections--to outcomes. In the setting of
our final proposition, increasing noise in the limit leads to full representativeness but turnout
of only 50%--with the further implication that, if one began with higher, nonrepresentative
turnout, that higher turnout level would be associated with less representativeness, not more.
     Funk (2010) examines the move to optional voting by mail in Switzerland, a practice
increasingly used in the United States. Funk finds that voting by mail not only reduced C s
but that it also must have reduced the social pressure on some individuals to vote (that is,
their Ds), resulting in only a small and statistically insignificant net increase in the turnout
level. We may also, however, be interested in how each component may have (differentially)
influenced the composition of turnout. Reductions in C may have mattered most to indi-
  19
     Likewise, if more informed voters, as in Feddersen and Pesendorfer (1996, 1999), Kim and Fey (2007),
and McMurray (2013), also had a stronger sense of duty, they would be more likely to turn out. However,
even if D were a precise reflection of preference intensity (or of informedness) and nothing else, the full
utilitarian (informed) result would not arise because, with strictly positive D, the relevant range of C would
no longer be confined to a neighborhood of 0, so the distribution of C in the relevant domain would no longer
be (essentially) uniform. For example, if the distribution of C trails off at higher levels, intensity-based (or
information-based) turnout selection would be attenuated as intensity (informedness) rises. That is, very low
levels of intensity (or informedness) may be mostly screened out, with decreasing differentiation thereafter.



                                                      22
viduals with high time value (typically higher-income) or with less flexibility (those whose
working environment and family responsibilities made it difficult to vote). The apparent
reductions in D were shown to be the greatest in small and, one might suppose, close-knit
communities, where being seen at the polls may previously have motivated turnout. Each
of these groups may well have atypical preferences, in ways that do not offset each other.20
    When turnout levels respond modestly to reforms or random shocks (such as the weather,
as in Fowler (2015) and Hansford and Gomez (2010)), individuals whose voting behavior
changes will be those near the margin, that is, with D - C near 0. Without independence
in the joint density function, these marginal voters will generally be an unrepresentative
group. What matters more for representativeness, however, is how they compare to those
who are inframarginal: who vote or do not vote, regardless. Consider our linear Example 1
and focus on Proposition 3's limiting case with no dispersion. In this special case, marginal
voters (those at xcut ) will be toward the left extreme of the turnout set but toward the right
extreme of the set of nonvoters, in both instances at the more moderate ends of those sets
when considering the population as a whole. Under these assumptions, greater turnout of
marginal voters would increase the representativeness of the turnout set.21 Intuition from
this sort of setting--combined with the simple point that, as turnout approaches 100%,
the turnout set must eventually become representative--probably underlies the common
supposition that higher turnout levels tend to be associated with more representative turnout.
Our analysis identifies conditions under which turnout levels and representativeness tend to
move together but also finds others in which they do not, including a simple setting in which
they move in opposite directions (as illustrated in Example 2 after Proposition 4).
    Consider now some important considerations outside of our model that are illuminated
by our analysis. First, we assume throughout that different levels of C and D may be
associated with different values of x but do not in any sense cause preferences to change; this
juxtaposition is best appreciated by considering the case in which f    ~(x) , the unconditional
distribution of preferences, x, is fixed, but the joint density of x with C and D may change.
When C or D move idiosyncratically and unexpectedly (say, due to the weather on election
day), this interpretation may be convincing, and it further suggests that empirical work
  20
     See also the work of Enos, Fowler, and Vavreck (2016), who show in a meta-analysis that get-out-the-vote
experiments tend to increase the disparity in turnout between high- and low-propensity-to-vote individuals.
  21
     Note that the change in representativeness would be misstated (and often overestimated) if one compared
the typical traits of those who do turn out to the traits of those who do not, precisely because, as explained,
most of these two groups are inframarginal and thus more extreme (in one direction or the other) than those
whose participation is most likely to shift. For theoretical and empirical explorations in a similar spirit,
see Grofman, Owen, and Collet (1999) and Brians and Grofman (1999), respectively. See also the work of
Ansolabehere and Hersh (2012), who find that prior studies based on surveys overstate differences between
voters and nonvoters.



                                                      23
using such instruments may plausibly identify the preferences of marginal voters, who in
turn may be most influenced by some reforms. However, changing voting policy may directly
influence the underlying distribution of x (the unconditional density). For example, many
have suggested that, because voting is irrational when viewed purely in terms of individuals'
private benefits from influencing the outcome, individuals who turn out must be motivated
by D and hence might be expected to cast their votes based on social rather than narrower
private preferences (see Goodin and Roberts (1975) and Margolis (1982)). However, if voting
became extremely easy, individuals were paid to vote, or enforced compulsory voting were
implemented, then f   ~(x) , the unconditional distribution of preferences that votes actually
reflect, may be directly influenced, in addition to D being altered, as noted above (see
Ariely, Bracha, and Meier (2009), Frey and Jegen (2001), and Gneezy, Meier, and Rey-Biel
(2011)). Voting policies--as well as electioneering (see Enos and Fowler (2018), Green and
Gerber (2015) and Issenberg (2012))--that are aimed at any one of the three variables may
influence the others or their interrelationships; moreover, these indirect effects could be more
consequential than the direct effect of the intervention.
    Our analysis also abstracts from what, precisely, is being voted on. If the choice is be-
tween candidates (or referenda that are costly to propose), our results have implications
for positioning, an original focus of Ledyard (1984) that has been pursued in other litera-
ture. If candidates choose positions to maximize their chance of being elected, then in a
two-candidate race under majority rule, they will choose the median location. Our work
shows, however, that the relevant median is not the population median (which is what much
applied work assumes) but rather the median of the turnout set, which our analysis aims
to characterize by reference to the density function f (xi , Di , C i ) . One could also take into
account that candidate positioning may influence various individuals' Ds, which would alter
the turnout set and thereby the median voter in that set. This channel is a qualitatively
different mechanism from that in prior work in which the influence of candidate positioning
on turnout is entirely through the pivotality channel.
    Our focus on how interdependencies reflected in f (xi , Di , C i ) influence the representative-
ness of the turnout set also bears on structural features of voting systems. For example, the
use of caucuses instead of primaries or the delegation of decisions (or influence) to commit-
tees often requires participants to incur a substantially higher C . A familiar benefit is that
some of that cost involves becoming more informed, but our analysis highlights a different
impact: if C is correlated with x, representativeness may be substantially altered. Indeed,
the selection effect can be perverse: for example, if those willing to serve on a committee to
design new laboratory facilities are those most interested in aesthetics relative to research,
the committee might produce a building that is beautiful but unconducive to intellectual

5       Conclusion
We analyze a model of voter turnout in which each individual's pivotality is literally 0 so
that all of the action is in C and D. When preferences are uncorrelated with C and D, the
level of turnout is irrelevant: as long turnout is positive, the turnout set is representative
and the outcome is unaffected by the turnout level. If we instead admit arbitrary correlation
between preferences, C , and D, then anything is possible: the distribution of preferences
in the turnout set can be anything and the outcome can be anything, irrespective of the
distribution of preferences in the population. Turnout sets and voting outcomes depend
on the specific relationship between preferences, C , and D. Systematic skews can arise
in straightforward ways (for example, if individuals with pro-left preferences tend to have
lower C s), but there is a tendency for noise in any such correlations to produce a more
representative turnout set. To illustrate the potential disjunction between the level of turnout
and turnout's representativeness, we provide a simple example in which, as noise increases,
the level of turnout monotonically falls while representativeness monotonically rises.
    We derive our results in a simple model so as to highlight our framing of the problem,
which we regard as our main contribution. By analyzing the case in which an individual's
probability of pivotality is 0 (approximating its negligible magnitude in many actual set-
tings), we are led to focus on determinants of the turnout set that are qualitatively different
from those that underlie much prior theoretical work. Moreover, in common with some of
that research, our framework emphasizes the representativeness of the turnout set rather
than the level of turnout, which can have different relationships to each other under different
assumptions about the joint distribution f (xi , Di , C i ).
    As emphasized in our Introduction, we take no normative stance on the value of represen-
tativeness as such, particularly because of the known limitations of various voting rules with
regard to preference intensity, voters' knowledge, and the manipulability of those preferences
(along with the aforementioned potential endogeneity of expressed preferences to the voting
mechanism itself). Indeed, when turnout is driven entirely by C and D, many of the po-
tentially appealing features of pivotality-driven endogenous turnout--reflection of preference
intensity and incorporation of information--vanish but others (high-D voters may be more
inclined to vote in the social interest) may take their place. Regardless of whether represen-
tativeness is taken to be the primary objective or is regarded to be problematic in important
ways, our approach leads to a different perspective on the analysis of voter turnout and

emphasizes different empirical questions from those explored in much of the prior literature.
Of particular interest is to understand how individuals' preferences (x) are related to their
C s and Ds as well as which individuals' C s and Ds may be influenced by various policies.
