                                         ABSTRACT

We review the literature that studies the dynamics of firms in foreign markets, both at the
intensive and extensive margins, and their aggregate implications. We first summarize a set of
micro facts on exporter entry, expansion, contraction, and exit and macro facts about the response
of aggregate trade flows to trade-policy and business-cycle shocks. We then present the canonical
model developed in the literature to account for these facts and discuss its connection to the
empirical evidence. We show how three model features -- future uncertain profits, an investment
in market access, and high depreciation of that access upon exit -- generate transition dynamics
and long-run aggregate outcomes from a cut in tariffs. The model and its extensions contribute to
our understanding of the dynamics of trade integration and the evolution of future trade barriers.
We discuss the key challenges faced by the canonical model, possible extensions, and
applications of the framework to recent global events.

1     Introduction
We review the literature on firm dynamics and trade, which has generally approached two
broad sets of questions. The first set is concerned with understanding firm dynamics in
trade along the extensive and the intensive margins. How do technology, trade barriers,
uncertainty, and learning help explain the observed exporter life cycle and entry and exit
patterns? A second set of questions asks how firm-level behaviors affect aggregate outcomes.
How do the welfare gains from trade liberalization depend on firm-level behavior? Do models
with firm-level dynamics help us understand the long- and short-run behavior of aggregate
trade in response to changes in tariffs or over the business cycle? What explains the delayed
response of the trade balance to a change in the real exchange rate?

    We start by presenting a set of facts about firm export behavior and aggregate trade
dynamics, organizing our approach around the extensive and intensive margins of trade.
Export entry rates increase and exit rates decrease with past exporting activity and export
intensity increases with time in the exporting market. We further decompose the intensive
margin by destination and find that, across individual destinations, past export participation
has a similar impact on exporter entry and exit. We summarize the high-frequency data and
show how individual firm shipments determine exporter growth. Finally, we discuss the
patterns in the aggregate data and find that the long-run response of aggregate trade to
changes in trade policy is larger than the short-run response.

    Motivated by several of these empirical facts, a canonical model of export dynamics
has developed in the literature. In this model, a firm facing a stochastic flow of potential
profits from exporting must make an upfront investment -- a sunk cost -- and a per-
period fixed maintenance cost to access the market. Skipping this maintenance cost leads
the investment to fully depreciate. This approach is closely related to the closed-economy
model in Hopenhayn (1992). These three features -- an uncertain future return, an upfront
investment in market access, and steep depreciation of that investment -- goes a long way in
accounting for some of the firm behavior observed in the data, especially the persistence in
export status, low entry and exit rates, and their dependence on past activity. This model


                                              1
also generates the differing short-run and long-run responses of aggregate trade to changes
in trade policy. Researchers have built upon the canonical model by adding other types
of frictions that further shape the trajectory of exporters. These models replace the large
upfront cost with repeated but riskier investments at the market-, product-, or customer-
level. We discuss how these extensions help explain other empirical observations and how
they change key implications of the canonical model.

        The firm dynamics and trade literature was born from questions about the behavior of
aggregate variables, but few studies have incorporated the frictions identified in the micro
literature into general equilibrium models.1 These papers use the micro data to discipline the
extra parameters in the firm's more-complex decision problem and consider the aggregate
outcomes from a broader set of shocks to trade policy and business cycles. We show that
static models of trade do not approximate the steady state of dynamic models and that
the welfare gains from a tariff cut are much larger in models with firm dynamics. The
specification of firm-level export technologies is the key driver of these findings. In an
extension of the model in which goods are storable (firms hold inventories), we find that a
shock leads to very different outcomes in the short-run. Getting the micro details correct
changes our understanding of macro phenomena.

        Our review is organized around data, models, and the interplay between the two. In sec-
tion 2, we present facts about firm export behavior and aggregate fluctuations that motivate
the canonical model and its extensions in section 3. In section 4, we discuss how to embed
these partial equilibrium models in general equilibrium and we evaluate the aggregate effects
of a trade liberalization. Section 6 discusses areas of future research and concludes.


2         Firm-level and aggregate facts
In this section, we discuss the salient features of firm and aggregate trade dynamics in the
data.2 We focus on firm-level facts that help us identify the frictions that impede trade (and
    1
     Motivated by the slow reversal of the U.S. trade balance following the depreciation of the dollar in the
1980s, Baldwin (1988) and Baldwin and Krugman (1989) proposed a role for market-specific investments in
product design, distribution, branding, etc., which they modelled as a sunk cost.

     Many data sets take the establishment as the unit of observation, while a few are organized at the firm
level. For expositional ease, we will refer to both kinds of data as being made up of firms.

the gains from trade) and the ways that firm-level dynamics affect the aggregate economy.3
The aggregate facts document important phenomena that we would like to explain, such as
the aggregate effects of business-cycle and trade policy shocks, and represent the ongoing
synthesis of international trade and macroeconomics.


2.1       Cross-sectional moments

We organize our analysis around a decomposition of the sales and export data of N firms.
We order firms so that only the first i = 1, . . . , n firms have positive export intensity,
exsit = exportsit /salesit , and derive an accounting identity for the share of total sales that
is exported,
                     n                            n                                n
                         exportsi           n-1         salesi × exsi       n-1          salesi
                    i=1               n           i=1                              i=1
                      N
                                    =   ×                n              ×           N
                                                                                                  .     (1)
                                      N
                           salesi               n-1           salesi        N -1         salesi
                     i=1                                i=1                        i=1

The first term on the right-hand side of (1) is the extensive margin. It measures the share
of firms that export. The second term is the intensive margin, which measures the average
share of total sales that is exported, conditional on exporting. The third term, the exporter
premium, measures the relative size of exporters compared to all firms.

       We summarize these margins for the United States and Colombia in Table 1: there are few
exporters; exports are a small share of an exporter's total sales; and exporters are relatively
large. In the remainder of this review, we focus on Colombia, as the data are easy to obtain
and widely used. We include the U.S. data to stress the generality of the results. Similar
facts have been documented in countries big and small, rich and poor (ISGEP, 2008).4

       The 1983­2013 and 1987­2007 periods were times of significant global integration in
Colombia and the United States; Trade almost doubled in the United States and nearly
tripled in Colombia. As policy and non-policy barriers fell, the extensive and intensive
   3
      We focus on the export decision, as research on this margin is most developed, but there is a nascent
literature on the dynamics of multinationals, importing, and the interactions of these decisions (Kasahara
and Lapham, 2013; Fillat and Garetto, 2015; Gumpert et al., 2018; Imura, 2019).
    4
      When comparing Colombia and the United States, we need to adjust for data coverage. The U.S.
data cover firms with more than 100 employees while the Colombian data cover firms with more than 10
employees. When we restrict the Colombian data to include only firms with more than 100 employees, the
extensive margin rises and the exporter premium falls to levels similar to those found in the United States.

margins grew. This integration brought smaller firms into exporting, which reduced the
exporter premium. What cannot be seen in Table 1 is the slow adjustment of the extensive
and intensive margins. We discuss the dynamics of this adjustment next.


2.2     The extensive margin

The literature on exporter dynamics has focused largely on understanding the forces that
drive firms into and out of the export market. The number of exporters in a country can be
described by the following laws of motion:

                           starter                                 stopper
                    nt+1 = t +1    [nt (Nt - nt ) + NE,t+1 ] + 1 - t +1    [xt nt ]                        (2)

                   Nt+1 = nt (Nt - nt ) + xt nt + NE,t+1 ,                                                 (3)


where n and x are the survival rates of firms and NE is the number of new firms. The
first term in the right-hand side of (2) is the flow into exporting by last year's surviving
nonexporters and newly-created firms. These are the export starters. The second term
measures the flow out of exporting by last year's surviving exporters, the export stoppers.
The export starter and stopper rates are  starter and  stopper . In a steady state, the flow into
and out of exporting must balance, but in a transition, they need not. In panel B of Table 1,


                                                      4

The sample covers 2008­2017. Columns 1­3 include industry and year fixed effects. Column 4 includes
year fixed effects. Standard errors, clustered at the industry level, are reported in parenthesis.  p < 0.05,

  p < 0.01,  p < 0.001.


Fact #1. Past export participation is the main predictor of current export participation.

    In Table 2, we report the coefficients of a linear probability model whose dependent
variable is one if the firm exports in period t and zero otherwise. Consistent with the
exporter premium, larger firms are more likely to export. Column two adds lagged export
status to the model, and the fit is greatly improved. A firm that exported last year is likely to
continue exporting, although the coefficient on lagged export status is significantly less than
one (Roberts and Tybout, 1997). The lagged export-sales ratio is also a significant predictor
of export status, but adds little explanatory power to the regression. Comparing the models,
size is a much less important predictor of export status once we control for a firm's export
history. In the last column we remove the industry fixed effects and find these were adding
very little explanatory power, suggesting it is primarily a proxy for export experience and
size.

    The importance of past export experience leads us to separately study the entry decisions
of nonexporters and exit decisions of exporters. Beyond export participation, we also study
additional aspects of a firm's export experience, such as previous export volumes or time
since export entry or exit.

                                                       5
Fact #2. Exporter exit rates fall with past export intensity and time in the export market.

    The first two columns of Table 3 report the coefficients of a linear probability model of
export exit. In column one, we see that firms with larger export volumes (and not larger
sales) and more experience exporting are less likely to exit the export market. If the firm
entered the export market in the preceding period, the probability of exiting increases by 24
percent, even after controlling for the scale of its exports. It is not uncommon to observe
a firm export for one period and then exit the market, even if it exported a large quantity
in that sole year. The probability of exiting is falling with experience. The exit rate data
suggest that export markets are difficult to crack for new exporters, but, the firms that do
survive the initial shakeout are more likely to continue in the export market compared with
those with less experience.

Fact #3. The exporter entry rate is low but is increasing in size and past export activity.

    Most nonexporters do not start exporting. In Colombia, the export starter rate ranges
from two percent in the 1980s to five percent more recently (Table 1). Table 3 reports the
results of a linear probability model of export entry. While size increases the probability that
a nonexporter starts exporting, so does past export experience and export intensity. Previous
export experience raises the probability of reentering the market by about 20 percent.


2.3     The intensive margin

The first three facts are about the binary export status of a firm: the extensive margin.
Fact #4 characterizes the evolution of a firm's export intensity, conditional on exporting:
the intensive margin. In the cross section, the distribution of export intensity across all firms
features a large mass of firms at zero -- the nonexporters -- and a non-degenerate distribu-
tion over the remaining export-intensity levels.5 Our focus is on the dynamic properties of
export intensity.




  5
    There is another mass of firms that only export. There is some debate as to whether this reflects different
competitive forces at home and abroad (Lu, 2010) or policy decisions (Defever and Ria~  no, 2017).

Fact #4. Export intensity rises with time in the export market.

    We regress the export-sales ratio on the previous year's export-sales ratio and variables
that describe the exporter's history in the export market,

                K                                                 K

The coefficient -k measures the persistence of an exporter's export-sales ratio k years prior,
and the d variables are indicators for an export starter, stopper, or a one-period lived "starter-
stopper." This approach allows us to trace out export-intensity dynamics and construct a
                                                                                       K

   We report the estimates of (4) in Table 4. The average export intensity is 21.6 percent
(column 1). Column two shows that a starter that continues into the next period will export
a smaller share of its total sales than a continuing exporter. This share is similar to that of
an exiting exporter in the last year of its exporting spell. A firm with a one-year exporting
spell will sell less than either of these other firms, about 12.5 percent.

   The third column shows that export intensity is persistent, with the sum of the coefficients
on lagged export intensity nearly 0.73. In the last column, we see that exiters have lower
export intensity in the years before they leave the market. Using the point estimates from
columns three and four, we can trace out the path of export intensity for a new exporter
that continues in the market and an exporter as it moves out of the export market (Table 5).
A new exporter increases its export intensity by about 50 percent over five years while a
stopper reduces its export intensity by a similar amount.

2.4     Decomposing the Intensive Margin

Much like splitting trade flows into an extensive and intensive margin, moving from firm-
level data to transaction-level data allows us to decompose the intensive margin into a series
of extensive margins in terms of destinations (Eaton et al., 2008; Lawless, 2009; Arkolakis,
2016) or shipments.6 This approach helps identify the frictions that determine the expansion
pattern of exporters within and across markets. It speaks directly to where, and at what
level, export costs are incurred and to the structure of these costs across markets and time
(Albornoz et al., 2012; Schmeiser, 2012; Morales et al., 2019). These finer decompositions
   6
     Two additional margins studied are products (Lincoln and McCallum, 2018) and customers (Eaton et al.,
2015; Monarch and Schmidt-Eisenlohr, 2018).



                                                      9
are useful to the extent that they provide a better understanding of the cost structure of
firms and their influence on aggregate dynamics.7

2.4.1      Destinations

We use the Colombian transaction data to evaluate how exit and entry rates by destination
depend on history (Albornoz et al., 2016) and how firms grow by expanding within and
across destinations (Eaton et al., 2008). The richer panel structure of these data allows us
to control for firm- and destination-specific shocks. In terms of stopper rates (fact #2), we
find a similar role for history (Table 3, column 2). We also find that stopper rates are falling
in the number of months a firm exported to a market and the number of other markets that
the firm is serving. This may indicate that entry costs in a market depend on the firm's
access to other markets or its export experience (Morales et al., 2019, Timoshenko, 2015).
In terms of entry rates, we again find that past exporting in a particular market is a good
predictor of entry into a market (Table 3, column 5).

       In Table 6, we study the dynamics of export growth at the firm-destination and firm
level. We find that a new exporter that exports for three years will grow nearly 25 percent
from their first to second year, but this growth-rate premium disappears by year two. Those
in their last year of exporting contract exports by almost 95 percent. Firms that sell to more
destinations tend to grow more slowly while those with larger foreign sales grow faster. In
column 2, we control for the change in the number of months with a shipment in a year and
find this greatly reduces the growth rate premium (discount) in the first year (last year).
In column 3, we aggregate the firm's exports across destinations and find a larger growth
rate premium in the first year. In column 4, we control for the firm's expansion across
destinations and the number of shipments within destinations. The smaller growth-rate
premium is similar to the within-market premium. These features suggest that the findings
in Table 4 represent both within-market gradual expansion and across-market expansion.
   7
    One could imagine, for example, a data set that provided the color of a shipment's container. Differ-
entiating between red and blue shipping containers would likely not yield new information about the cost
structure of a firm and would not be a useful decomposition.

2.4.2     Shipments

As we have seen, the frequency with which products are traded within a year is closely
related to exporter exit and growth. Most studies, however, use annual data that mask
significant within-year variation. Higher-frequency trade-flow data suggest frictions different
than those emphasized in the papers using annual data (Alessandria et al., 2010a; Kropf and
Saur´
    e, 2014; Hornok and Koren, 2015; B´
                                      ek´
                                        es et al., 2017; Blum et al., 2019). The unit of
observation in these data is usually an individual shipment, or the sum of shipments within
a month, to a destination or customer.

Fact #5: Most firms import or export a few times per year. Shipment size increases, and
frequency decreases, in distance. Trade grows through more frequent and larger shipments.

      For example, Hornok and Koren (2015) find that the median U.S. and Spanish product is
only shipped twice per year to a destination.8 Many products are shipped only once per year,
or even less frequently. This phenomenon is common to nearly all goods, even goods with
large annual trade flows. The long gaps between shipments suggest that some continuous
trading relationships may appear to stop and start when studied with annual data.

      The frequency and size of transactions differ by destination. For a select set of goods,
Alessandria et al. (2010a) find that, compared with international transactions, domestic
transactions are smaller and more frequent. Several papers emphasize that shipment fre-
quency falls and shipment size rises as distance increases (Hornok and Koren, 2015; Blum
et al., 2019). The rise in trade through more frequent and larger shipments holds at both
the firm and destination levels. Larger exporters to a market make both more frequent and
larger shipments (columns 2 and 4 of Table 6). Likewise, when considering markets with
more trade, we observe more frequent and larger shipments.

Fact #6: Firms hold larger inventories of goods from, or destined for, foreign markets.

      The discreteness of shipments can be explained by either discrete demand or discrete
purchases. Inventory data are useful in determining the sources of discreteness. Discrete

     The U.S. product is measured at the 10-digit Harmonized System (HS) level and the Spanish product
is at the 8-digit HS level.

purchases imply that importers must hold larger stocks of these inputs relative to their
usage or exporters must hold larger stocks of their finished goods relative to their sales.
Studies find that inventories of imported inputs are two to three times those of domestic
inputs (Alessandria et al., 2010a; Nadais, 2017). On average, firms will hold 2­3 months of
domestic inputs in inventory compared with 4­6 months of imported inputs.


2.5     Cumulative effects of firm dynamics

The relatively small size, high exit rate, and slow growth of new exporters means that it
takes time for export sales to be reallocated away from existing exporters. The cumulative
effects of the firm-level dynamics can be seen in Table 7. The columns labeled entrants'
share report, at different horizons, the share of all firms (panel A) or total exports (panel
B) accounted for by firms that did not export at the beginning of the sample. For example,
20 percent of all exporters did not export one year prior and that share grows to 36 percent
after five years. These new exporters account almost 11 percent of exports in year one
and this rises to 21 percent after five years. With transaction-level data, we find that new
exporter-destinations are more common: In one year, 40-percent of all firm-destinations are
new. The churning in the number of firms has a modest impact on export volumes. After
five years, new exporters account for 21 percent of total exports.


2.6     Aggregate dynamics

Models that address firm dynamics have proven useful in understanding aggregate trade
dynamics, measured either as net exports' share of trade or the trade share of expenditures,
following shocks to trade barriers or to business cycles conditions. Generally, net and gross
trade flows respond gradually following these aggregate shocks, although sometimes trade
moves sharply, such as in the Great Recession (Bems et al., 2013).

Fact #7: The long-run response of aggregate trade volumes to changes in trade policy is
larger than the short-run response.9

    Our focus is on the trade elasticity at different time horizons following a change in trade policy. This is
conceptually distinct from the idea that elasticities may depend on the level of trade (Head et al., 2014).

The sample covers 2006­2018. Panel A: Continuation rate is the share of exporters that remain exporters
across two windows, e.g., 80 percent of firms who exported in a 12-month window export in the next 12-
month window. Entrant's share is the share of total exporters accounted for by entrants, e.g., 30 percent of
exporters are firms that did not export 36 months prior. Panel B: The columns are defined analogously but
for export volumes, rather than firm counts.  From the customs transaction-level data.


    After controlling for the "phase-out" implementation of free trade agreements (FTAs),
Baier and Bergstrand (2007) find that trade growth is split equally over the first 10­15 years
of the FTA and growth continues at longer horizons (Jung, 2012). Figure 1(a) shows this
gradualness clearly in the U.S. data. It plots the growth in U.S. trade (exports plus imports
of goods) relative to expenditures on goods.

    A key source of the larger long-run response is the expansion in the extensive margin. At
the product level, Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) find that nontraded products, or products traded
very little before an FTA, grow faster than other goods following an FTA. They find that
the relationship between extensive margin growth and aggregate trade growth is stronger
at longer time horizons. Buono and Lalanne (2012) and Baier et al. (2014) reach similar
conclusions. At the firm level, the gradual expansion at the extensive margin occurs through
increased entry and reduced exit, as documented in Alessandria and Choi (2014a).

    The gap between the short- and long-run trade elasticity may be even larger than that
found in previous studies, as there are substantial anticipatory effects prior to a tariff re-
duction. Khan and Khederlarian (2019) find large decreases in trade leading up to the tariff

cuts, followed by large increases in trade once the tariffs are cut. Compared to conven-
tional estimates (e.g., Romalis, 2007), the one-year trade elasticity is 50 percent larger (2.8
versus 4.2) and the five-year trade elasticity is 10 percent larger (8.2 versus 9.0).

                 Most studies of open-economy business cycles consider the comovement of net trade
flows with international relative prices, which we plot for the United States in Figure 1(b).
The real exchange rate clearly leads net trade flows. The lagged response of trade to the
depreciation of the dollar in the 1980s is what motivated Baldwin and Krugman (1989) and
others to propose dynamic trade models. In U.S. data for 1980­2015, Alessandria and Choi
(2019) find that the real exchange rate leads net trade flows by about eight quarters. They
find a short-run price elasticity of trade of 0.20 and a long-run elasticity of 1.2, with only six
percent of the gap between the short-run and long-run response closed per quarter.

                 Despite the consensus that trade responds slowly to aggregate shocks, there are examples
where the adjustment is very fast. In the Great Recession, for example, international trade
fell about 50 percent more than expenditure on traded goods and rebounded sharply, even as
expenditure on traded goods rebounded by less. Figure 1(a), which plots the deviations from
trend for trade (exports plus imports of goods) as a share of expenditure on goods, shows
these sharp decreases and increases clearly. Boileau (1999) finds that total trade is cyclical
because it is intensive in durable goods, however, the high elasticity of trade to expenditure
exists, even when one controls carefully for the composition of expenditures. Alessandria


                                                                                            15
et al. (2010b), for example, show that U.S. imports of Japanese autos fell and rebounded
much more sharply than U.S. sales of Japanese autos in the Great Recession.

    The time-varying slow and fast responses of trade to shocks present an enormous challenge
to static models. When the trade data are interpreted through the lens of a static trade
model, such as the gravity model, gradual and sharp adjustments -- above and beyond
those captured by changes in expenditures or relative prices -- are captured in the error
term that is treated as an additional shock to trade barriers. Dynamic models provide some
structure for these shocks, and are naturally able to generate the adjustments observed in
the data. We turn to these models next.


3     Firm decision problems
We lay out the canonical dynamic model of exporting used to address the facts introduced
above (Das et al., 2007). We start with the firm's decision problem and move to general
equilibrium in section 4. Consider a firm i that already sells to the domestic market and is
contemplating exporting. Let xit be equal to one if the firm exports in t and zero otherwise.
The flow profit is  (xit , zit , dit ), where zit captures variables related to production efficiency
and dit is demand for firm i's product in the foreign market. Export fixed costs, fit (xit-1 , t ),
depend on the firm's past export participation and a random variable. These three factors
-- demand, production costs, and fixed export costs -- are meant to be very general and
we will discuss later how different mechanisms considered in the literature are captured by
these factors.

    A firm's foreign demand depends on factors that are common to all firms (the size of the
foreign market, the real exchange rate) and ones that are idiosyncratic to the firm or the
firm-destination pair (idiosyncratic demand shifters, shipping and distribution technologies
and capital). Demand for the firm charging price p is often written as

                                                             -
                                                        it        
                                 dit (pit ) = it   pit t         Dt ,                            (5)
                                                       Pt

where P  is the price of a composite industry or final good, D is total spending,    1 is


                                                   16
an ad-valorem tax paid by foreign consumers,  is a firm-specific demand shifter, and   1
is a firm-specific iceberg trade cost. We denote foreign variables with an asterisk. A firm will
not export if foreign demand is equal to zero or if the shipping cost is infinite.10 In practice,
the two firm-specific shifters,  and  , are redundant as they affect total sales identically; we
combine the two into jt  [0, ) and refer to the composite variable as an "iceberg" export
cost. This cost is stochastic and follows an AR(1) process.

       Firms operate a constant returns to scale technology. The production cost term, z , cap-
tures supply-side determinants of a firm's profit, including total factor productivity, phys-
ical capital, and intangible assets. Productivity has been a major focus of the literature.
Empirically, firms that export tend to have higher measured productivity levels and the
heterogeneous-productivity model in Melitz (2003) is a workhorse in the field. It is common
to assume that productivity follows an AR(1) process.

       Firms make an investment in foreign market access. Baldwin and Krugman (1989) mod-
eled this investment as a fixed cost, and much of the literature has followed suit. The fixed
cost is f = f0 when xt-1 = 0 and xt = 1 and f = f1 when xt-1 = 1 and xt = 1. When f0 > f1
we say that the difference between the two, f0 - f1 , is the sunk entry cost. When fixed trade
costs only depend on last period's export status, including export history in a firm's state is
redundant; however, with a richer model where experience wears off slowly or is accumulated,
one may need to keep track of that history to determine the evolution of other firm states.

       The firm's state variables are (z, , f ) and the value of the firm is


                        Vt (zit , it , fit ) = max Vt0 (zit , it , fit ) , Vt1 (zit , it , fit ) ,        (6)

                Vt0 (zit , it , fit ) = t (0, zit , it ) + it E            Vt+1 (zit+1 , it+1 , fit+1 )   (7)

    While CES demand requires an infinite variable cost to drive demand to zero, other models have a
reservation price at which demand falls to zero. See Arkolakis et al. (2018a) for a description of a class of
demand functions with this property.

where r is the interest rate and  is the probability that the firm survives to t + 1. Notice
that the value functions are functions of t. This most general case will be appropriate when
we consider transitions in general equilibrium settings. The partial equilibrium models are
almost always considered in stationary environments, so we drop the t subscript for now and
use the "prime" notation common in the stationary dynamic programming approach.


3.1    Decision rules

To simplify the exposition, we assume that f is deterministic. We also assume that profit
functions are increasing in z and that the incremental profit from exporting, compared with
selling only in the domestic market, is increasing in z . A common assumption that generates
this feature is that the firm is a monopolistic competitor producing a differentiated good and
z measures productivity, as in Melitz (2003).

   Under these assumptions, the policy function for exporting is a cutoff rule that depends
on the fixed cost, which depends on export history. For each  there exists a zm ( ) such
that a firm with variable export cost  and z  zm ( ) will export. This cutoff technology
level is determined by

                                                        
   fm - [ (1, zm ( ) ,  ) -  (0, zm ( ) ,  )] =              E V 1 (z ,  , f1 ) - V 0 (z ,  , f0 ) .   (9)
                                                      1 + r z ,

The left-hand side of (9) is the net cost of exporting: The export cost minus the extra profit
today from exporting. The right-hand side of (9) is the increase in the expected value of the
firm if it chooses to export, what we call the future benefit from exporting. The left- and
right-hand sides of this break-even condition are plotted in Figure 2(a) for f0 > f1 .

   In the sunk-cost model, f1 < f0 and z1 ( ) < z0 ( ). All else equal, it takes a more
profitable firm to enter than it does to remain in the market. In the fixed-cost model, f0 = f1

and the right-hand side of (9) is zero so that the firm chooses to export whenever the current
extra profit from exporting exceeds the fixed cost. This generates a static export decision,
and a single productivity threshold z1 ( ) = z0 ( ).

   The shape of the future benefit curve in Figure 2(a) is governed by two forces. The slope
is largely determined by the persistence of the productivity process: A more persistent z
implies a steeper slope. The level of the future benefit curve is driven by the size of the
sunk cost, f0 - f1 . When f0 = f1 , the future benefit curve is identically zero. If we hold f1
constant and increase f0 , the future benefit curve shifts up and z1 falls. Firms want to avoid
paying f0 again in the future, and may even earn negative profits in a period ( - f1 < 0)
to retain the positive future value of continuing in the export market. As we increase f0 , we
also increase the cost of entering the export market (the f0 -  (z ) curve shifts out) so that
z0 increases. Intuitively, with a larger sunk cost of exporting, there is a larger productivity
gap between firms that have and have not paid it.

   The threshold productivity levels are important determinants of the exporter premium
in (1). Holding fixed the firm-size distribution, when the thresholds are farther apart, there
is more scope for smaller exporters and larger nonexporters. This tends to decrease the
exporter premium. As the distance between the thresholds shrinks, sorting by productivity


                                              19
into exporting is stricter and the export premium rises. The exporter premium is one of the
key empirical moments that discipline the model's parameters.


3.2       Firm distributions

The cutoff thresholds and the processes for z and  determine the distribution of firms over
fixed cost, productivity, and demand levels, which we denote µ(z, , f ). The distribution over
nonexporters is µ(z, , f0 ) and µ(z, , f1 ) is the distribution of exporters. These distributions
allow us to aggregate firm-level decisions and determine the starter and stopper rates.

       In Figure 2(b), we plot the beginning-of-period distributions of firm productivity for
a given shipping-cost/demand (t ) realization. The distributions of exporters and nonex-
porters overlap when f0 > f1 . If f0 = f1 , the two distributions would be disjoint, which is
counterfactual. While the average exporter is larger and more productive than the average
nonexporter in the data, the smallest exporter is much smaller than the largest nonexporter.
In the range [z1 ( ) , z0 ( )] in the sunk-cost model, there can be firms with the same type
z who both export and do not export. In this interval, a firm's export status depends on
whether it has paid f0 in the past.


3.3       Dynamic properties

The dynamic properties of the sunk-cost model help us understand several features of the
data that would otherwise be difficult to explain.

Hysteresis. The sunk-cost model generates exporter hysteresis: An exporter will continue
to export even after its current conditions have worsened relative to the conditions it faced
when it started exporting. Holding its demand shifter constant, a firm will continue to export
even if its productivity has fallen below the entry threshold -- it will continue to export as
long as productivity is above z1 ( ).11

       The different thresholds that generate hysteresis can also help explain the low exit and
entry rates. With a persistent process for z , the probability that a marginal starter exits the
  11
    This idea was originally formulated in terms of the aggregate shocks from a real exchange rate change
but applies equally to idiosyncratic shocks.



                                                   20
export market depends on the probability that the firm receives a shock that takes it from z0
to z1 , which, holding the thresholds constant, is falling in the shock's persistence and rising in
the shock's variance. The key to identifying the entry (f0 ) and continuation (f1 ) costs is the
relatively low exporter premium and the relatively high persistence of export participation,
since these features only arise with a large gap in the entry and exit thresholds.

Current and future trade costs. The forward-looking problem that firms solve when
f0 > f1 implies that future, as well as current, changes in export profitability matter for
the export entry decision. Policy-related costs, such as tariffs and nontariff barriers, are
particularly interesting in this context because they are often phased in over several years
following the signing of a trade agreement.

       First, consider a decrease in  in the current period that permanently reverts in the next
period to its previous level. This decreases the left-hand side of (9) and leaves the right-hand
side unchanged. This is equivalent to shifting the downward-sloping curves in Figure 2(a)
down and both the entry and exit thresholds shift down. How much the thresholds change
depends on the size of the change in trade costs and the elasticity of profits with respect to
trade costs. This temporary shock persistently increases trade through increased entry and
reduced exit.

       Second, consider a decrease in future trade costs that holds current trade costs fixed -- an
announcement that a trade deal has been signed and will come into force in the future. The
left-hand side of (9) stays constant, but the right-hand side increases.12 This is equivalent
to shifting the upward-sloping curve up in Figure 2(a) and lowers both the entry and exit
thresholds, increasing the number of exporters and the volume of exports today. The reaction
to a change in trade costs will depend on the persistence of the change. Holding fixed the size
of the change, the more persistent is the change, the larger is the increase in the future value
of exporting. A one-period change has a very small effect on the future value of exporting;
A permanent change will have the largest effect. Thus, the current response to a unobserved
future change in trade barriers can be used to identify the expected path of future policy.
  12
    We have written (9) in the stationary steady state: There are no time subscripts on the value functions.
Changing future trade costs will change the value functions. For brevity, we do not rewrite the break-even
condition for this case.



                                                    21
Finally, consider a surprise permanent cut in the current and future trade costs. This will
have a larger effect on the thresholds as it combines the previous two experiments.

Uncertainty. As in other applications of sunk-cost models, uncertainty creates an incentive
to delay a costly action such as changing export status (Dixit and Pindyck, 1994). This leads
nonexporters to delay starting to export and exporters to delay stopping to export. An
increase in uncertainty is reflected in Figure 2(a) as a shift up and flattening of the upward-
sloping curve, increasing the band of inaction, [z0 ( ), z1 ( )]. This movement increases the
threshold for entering the export market but also lowers the threshold for exiting the market.
With both margins changing, the net effect on export participation and aggregate trade is
ambiguous, even though it is commonly stated that uncertainty reduces trade.


3.4    Successes and challenges in the model

The canonical model from section 3 can generate several of the facts that we document in
section 2. The model generates persistent export participation (fact #1) and low export entry
and exit rates (facts #2 and #3). The dynamic adjustment to shocks is slow, generating
an elasticity with respect to the shock that is larger in the long-run than the short-run
(fact #7). Despite these successes, the model misses on some important aspects of the data.
We consider the following four features since they speak directly to the timing and size of
the investments that firms make in market access.

Conditional exit rates. A new exporter is one that received a positive innovation to z ,
crossed over the entry threshold, and is far from the exit threshold. The persistence of z
implies that the entrant should not move to the exit threshold soon: An export entrant has
a low probability of exiting and, as z reverts to its mean, the exit rate increases with time
in the export market. In the data, however, we find the opposite: The exit rate falls with
time in the export market (fact #2), even when we control for other characteristics such as
export volume.

New exporter size and export intensity dynamics. Export starters are too large
compared with those in the data. The large f0 in the model generates too much selection on
firm size. The export-sales ratio is a function of  . If  is constant, so that paying f0 instantly


                                               22
lowers  from a prohibitive level to its final value, then the export-sales ratio counterfactually
jumps up on entry and displays no growth afterward. In the data (Table 4), the export-sales
ratio of a new exporter starts low and grows over several years (fact #4).

Destination churning and reentry. Models with destination-specific sunk costs can
capture the high persistence in destination-specific participation, but it is not clear why
participating in multiple markets decreases the probability of exit. A key challenge is that
dynamic models of these destination-specific investments are not well-developed.

   When a firm exits the export market, it must pay f0 again to export in the future. This
makes it rare to observe a firm exiting the export market and reentering soon after. In the
data, we find the opposite to be true. In Table 3, we see that a firm is more likely to enter
the export market if it exported two years prior (fact #3). When we consider the high-
frequency data, we see that many firms take short breaks from the export market within a
year (fact #5). Recall from Table 7, that the continuation rate of exporting in monthly data
is lower than in longer-horizon data.

High short-run elasticity. The high-persistence of firm-level exporting means that the
canonical model cannot generate the sharp changes in export volumes that we occasionally
observe (Figure 1).


3.5    Resolutions

The stark specification of the technology that governs foreign-market access drives the
model's key failings. The upfront investment in market access (f0 ) instantly lowers, with
certainty, the marginal cost of exporting ( ) and the cost of retaining market access (f1 ).
Exiting the market for one period fully depreciates this investment. Generating the observed
firm-level behavior in the data requires shifting more of the investment in market access to
the periods following entry and allowing this investment to depreciate slowly.

   Consider a richer fixed cost structure in which: 1) a firm that stops exporting can
pay fR < f0 to reenter the market, but a firm that has never exported must still pay
f0 ; and 2) the continuation costs, f1 (te ), fall with time in the export market, te . The smaller
"reentry cost" leads firms to temporarily leave the market when export demand is low and

                                                23
come back when it is higher, accounting for the reentry in the data. The reentry cost speci-
fication implies that, compared to the simple model, market access depreciates more slowly,
which tends to increase the estimated initial investment in market access, f0 . A gradually
falling continuation cost decreases the probability that a firm exits as it gains experience
in the market, accounting for the conditional exit rates in the data. This specification of
the continuation cost increases future market access costs, which tends to decrease the esti-
mated f0 . If the net result of these two forces is a decrease in f0 , then smaller non-exporters
will enter the export market, as in the data.

   If f0 = f1 and the firm's good can be stored with a cost, firms in the canonical model will
order infrequently and hold inventories. This parameterization of the model will account for
fact #5. This setup will also generate a large short-run elasticity. For example, when tariffs
are cut, export volumes grow quickly because firms can use their inventories to immediately
meet increased demand.

   Changing the fixed cost structure cannot address the observed export-intensity that rises
with time in the market. One approach is to modify the iceberg-cost technology to allow
the cost to fall with export experience. Alessandria et al. (2014), for example, assume
new exporters start with an inefficient shipping technology H that stochastically falls to
L < H , as would be the case with a firm building a better foreign distribution and sales
network. Alternatively, demand could grow with experience in the export market from the
accumulation of customers or habit (Fitzgerald et al., 2016; Piveteau, 2016; Ruhl and Willis,
2017; Rodrigue and Tan, 2019). Both approaches imply that the costs incurred to continue in
the export market when young include an investment in better future market access. These
extensions generate paths of rising sales and profits. When profits are more backloaded than
in the sunk cost model, the entry cost is estimated to be lower. The smaller entry cost,
again, leads to smaller new exporters and higher exit rates by new exporters.

   When we turn to our general equilibrium analysis, we will consider two versions of the
canonical model. The first model assumes that firms pay a cost to export that gradually and
stochastically leads to a falling iceberg cost and call it the export-investment model. This
model captures a firm's export life cycle but does not distinguish exporter dynamics within


                                                24
destinations and across destinations. The second model assumes all firms are exporters but
must decide when to export subject to a fixed shipment cost and a holding cost on unsold
stocks held abroad. We call this the inventory model.


3.6    Extensions

A growing literature has built on the sunk-cost model by incorporating additional frictions
and opportunities that affect firm dynamics in an open economy.

   In general, input adjustment frictions affect the export participation decision and a firm's
overall growth, but have no impact on export intensity dynamics, because they affect the
cost of producing for the domestic and export market symmetrically. Alessandria and Choi
(2007), Ria~
           no (2011), Rho and Rodrigue (2015), and Rho and Rodrigue (2016) introduce
physical capital adjustment in the form of convex and nonconvex costs of adjustment and
time to build. These frictions create decreasing returns to scale in production that reduce
the benefits of export expansion. The growing literature on trade policy in the presence of
labor market frictions has largely abstracted from dynamic export decisions. Co¸
                                                                               sar et al.
(2016) develop such a model to study how job turnover and unemployment change with
trade integration in Colombia. Fajgelbaum (2020) studies how the timing of export entry in
a firm's life cycle is affected by labor frictions.

   In the data, firms that export are often firms that import. Kasahara and Lapham (2013)
study the link between sunk costs of importing and exporting, and estimate a strong com-
plementarity between the two. Several papers treat the import decision as subject to sunk
costs and irreversibilities (Lu et al., 2016; Ramanarayanan, 2017; Imura, 2019) and find that
these frictions are large and severely inhibit the adjustment of trade flows.

   The contribution of export participation to firm-level productivity has been hotly de-
bated. Most work argues for selection in export participation, although some evidence for
learning from exporting exists. More recent work has focused on the link between R&D and
firm-level productivity. Aw et al. (2011) estimate a dynamic, structural model of exporting
and productivity-enhancing R&D. They find a complementarity between exporting and R&D
activities--both of which are undertaken by relatively high-productivity firms. Starting with


                                                 25
Atkeson and Burstein (2010), several papers explore the interaction between innovation and
trade in models of firm dynamics that focus on trade's role in aggregate growth.13

       Recent work has studied the impact of financial conditions on export outcomes. In
general, financial constraints delay export participation, but this finding depends on the
structure of the constraint (Brooks and Dovis, 2019). Kohn et al. (2016) introduce working
capital constraints into a sunk-cost model and, motivated by data, assume that the constraint
is tighter on a firm's export operations. Since export markets are more constrained than
domestic markets, export-intensity grows more slowly than in the sunk-cost model. Caggese
and Cu~
      nat (2013) show that financing constraints reduce the productivity gains from trade
liberalization, as productive firms cannot borrow to finance exporting costs. Leibovici (2018)
shows that cross-country differences in financial development determine comparative advan-
tage with minimal effects on overall trade flows.

       In the canonical model, firms are uncertain about the future, while knowing the current
state. Following Jovanovic (1982), several papers have introduced uncertainty and learning
to explore the pattern of expansion within markets (Eaton et al., 2014; Timoshenko, 2015;
Cebreros, 2016; Arkolakis et al., 2018b) and across markets (Albornoz et al., 2012; Schmeiser,
2012). Within a market, uncertainty about demand leads firms to start small. If sales come
in strong, firms update their beliefs and make larger shipments. Across markets, firms learn
about the fixed costs of making foreign sales. As firms update their beliefs over their fixed
costs of exporting, they enter into markets where they expect the fixed costs to be lowest.


4        Aggregate dynamics
In models with firm dynamics, the aggregate response to a shock differs substantially from
that in static models. We study two extensions of the canonical model that differ in their
sources of exporter dynamics and operate at different frequencies: the export-investment
model and the inventory model. Unlike static trade models, which generate nearly linear
relationships between tariffs, trade flows, and consumption, these dynamic models generate
  13
    See Alvarez et al. (2013), Perla et al. (2015), and Sampson (2016). Baldwin and Robert-Nicoud (2008)
discuss many of the ways that trade affects growth in heterogeneous-firm models.



                                                  26
highly non-linear, and sometimes perverse, relationships between these variables.

       The two models share the same general structure. The economy is made up of two
countries in general equilibrium. Firms produce differentiated varieties and a representative
firm aggregates domestic and imported varieties to create a final non-traded good. The
elasticity of substitution between varieties is the demand elasticity faced by firms. To the
firms' problems, we add household optimization, market clearing conditions, and laws-of-
motion over firm distributions. With symmetric countries and policies, trade is balanced
regardless of the financial assets available.14 The complete details of the models are reported
in the online appendix. We consider the effect of a once-and-for-all, global, unanticipated
elimination of a ten-percent tariff. While surprise once-and-for all global tariff cuts are rare,
they cleanly separate the impact and lagged effect of a policy reform in the model.


4.1       Aggregate effects in export-investment models

In section 3, we described a variety of frictions that make exporting a dynamic decision. Here,
we consider a variation of the sunk export-cost model that allows the exporter's variable
trade cost to fall with export experience. Alessandria et al. (2013) show that this model
closely matches the size, survival, and export intensity dynamics of exporters in the data.
In the online appendix, we consider alternative models. Besides the export technology, we
add free entry of firms. A new firm is created by paying fe units of labor, after which,
its initial productivity is realized. A free-entry condition, as in Hopenhayn (1992), equates
the expected value of entry with the entry cost. Firms face idiosyncratic productivity and
survival shocks. Production requires physical capital, labor, and intermediate inputs. To
highlight the implications of modeling trade dynamics, we compare the outcomes from the
dynamic model to a static one in which all firms export with a single variable export cost.

       The key dynamic feature is the overshooting of consumption in the transition, with
consumption substantially above its long-run level 25 years after the tariff cut (Figure 3(a)).
This arises because the cut in tariffs leads to a drop in firm creation (Figure 3(d)), which frees
  14
    Recent work emphasizes that the response to a change in trade barriers depends on the financial assets
available. See, for example, Alessandria et al. (2014); Reyes-Heroles (2015); Alessandria and Choi (2019);
Eaton et al. (2016); Alessandria et al. (2017); Brooks and Pujolas (2018); Ravikumar et al. (2019).



                                                   27
resources up along the transition and lowers the number of firms in the new steady state. The
drop in firm creation arises because the time and costs of exporting lead potential entrants
to strongly discount export profits and mostly consider domestic profits that are negatively
affected by the increased foreign competition. The slowly evolving structure of the firm
distribution drives the slow transition in consumption.

   The transition paths in the two models are radically different, resulting in different rela-
tionships between welfare and steady-state consumption (Table 8). In the static model, the
welfare change is 77 percent of the steady-state consumption change. The economy accumu-
lates capital to reach its new steady state, even as the trade share jumps to its new level. In
the dynamic model, the welfare change is almost 10.4 times the change in steady-state con-
sumption. Comparing steady states in the static model is somewhat informative of welfare
gains--in the dynamic model it is not.

   Trade also behaves very differently across the two models. In the static model, the long-
run trade elasticity is four, which is the parametric elasticity in the function that aggregates
varieties. In the dynamic model, this elasticity is more than twice as large, even though the
elasticity of substitution in the aggregator is the same as that in the static model. This is
the result of an increase in exporters (extensive margin) and investments that lower average
export variable costs (intensive margin). Lower tariffs induce firms to stay in the export
market longer, increasing the possibility of acquiring a lower variable export cost. The
larger increase in trade takes time to develop, as is evident in Figure 3(b).

   Comparing the static and dynamic models, we see that the paths of aggregate trade
differ substantially. To better understand the implications of aggregate trade dynamics, we
recalibrate the static model so that its aggregate trade path following trade reform matches
exactly that in the dynamic model. To do so, we increase the elasticity of substitution ()
to match the long-run growth in trade in the dynamic model and we add an adjustment
friction on aggregate trade to match the transition path of aggregate exports in the dynamic
model. The report the results from this model in the third column of Table 8. While this
alternative model generates a larger increase in steady-state consumption and welfare, the
path of consumption is quite different from the dynamic model, suggesting that one should


                                              28
be cautious of using static models to measure the aggregate effects of changes in trade policy.

4.2                                                   Factors influencing aggregate results

The dynamics of consumption and trade following a tariff cut will depend on a wide range of
features related to firm dynamics, preferences, accumulable factors, trade policy dynamics,
and country characteristics. In terms of firm dynamics, we generally find that any of the
mechanisms that involve an investment in market access that make exporting a dynamic
decision will lead to slow transitions and overshooting in consumption and output, provided


                                                                                                                              29
firm entry is endogenous. For preferences, the amount of overshooting is usually increasing
in the Intertemporal Elasticity of Substitution (IES) and the interest rate. The IES does
not affect the long-run impact of a cut in tariffs, but the consumption response is generally
falling in the interest rate. The interest rate, which is determined by the consumer's discount
factor, determines the weight of uncertain, future export opportunities in the value of firm
entry. Alessandria et al. (2014) show that when r = 0, the Arkolakis et al. (2012) formula for
the change in steady-state consumption given a marginal change in trade costs, holds. Given
the drawn out transitional dynamics, however, the steady-state change in consumption is a
poor approximation for consumption early in the transition, and this approximation worsens
as the interest rate increases.

   Many of the results on trade and aggregate transitions we describe apply to experiments
with global tariff declines in symmetric countries, but there are some results in other cases.
Unilateral reforms generate smaller gains for the reforming country but also feature over-
shooting so that the welfare gains may actually have a different sign from static trade models.
Recently, Mix (2019) shows that the welfare gains of global reforms in multi-country models
with rich geography are well approximated by two-country symmetric models, although the
transitions and long-run effects are shaped by geography and country size.

   The transitional dynamics will depend on the presence of capital and whether trade is
capital-intensive, the precise structure of fixed costs, and industry heterogeneity. When trade
is capital-intensive, a source of the welfare gains from trade is lower capital prices, which
generate capital deepening. With slow trade dynamics, this dampens overshooting and raises
the long-run growth in the economy. With heterogeneous industries, comparative advantage
forces offer an additional source of gains boosting long-run effects. Finally, when fixed costs
are denominated in goods, rather than in labor, which is necessary for a stable firm size
distribution, the model features more-neoclassical transitions and larger welfare gains.


4.3    Aggregate effects in inventory models

The slow transitions in the export-investment model are at odds with the sharp collapse and
rebound of trade common to recessions and their recoveries. The canonical dynamic model


                                              30
can easily incorporate frictions to generate these large movements in trade. Suppose that
exporters sell y units from a stock of goods z held in the foreign market, z  y , and these
stocks are subject to a storage cost z . Replenishing this stock with an export shipment,
x > 0, incurs a fixed cost and the shipment arrives the next period. The law of motion is


                                                    zt+1 = (1 - z )(zt - yt ) + xt .                                       (10)


For simplicity, assume that firms have a common productivity, but face idiosyncratic demand
shocks each period. The solution to this decision problem is a reorder threshold and reorder
level. The reorder threshold is a function of realized demand and current inventory level. The
shipment fixed cost, storage cost, and demand process are calibrated to match the frequency
and size of shipments, which we summarized in section 2.4.2. There are similar, but smaller
frictions for domestic transactions. The model period is a quarter. A complete description
of the model is available in the online appendix.

               We compare trade dynamics in the inventory model to a similar, but static, model with
no shipment lags and full depreciation (z = 1). The static model is calibrated to match the
same initial trade share as in the dynamic model. To highlight the novel features here, and
separate them from the features in the export-investment model, we eliminate the free-entry
decision for firm creation and consider a fixed set of firms. Production only uses labor.

               In the first quarter following the tariff cuts, trade more than doubles, overshooting its
long-run level. This drives the sharp decrease in the domestic expenditure share in Fig-

                                                                  31
ure 4(b). After the initial surge, trade drops below its long-run level and non-monotonically
converges to its long-run level. Surprisingly, even though trade rises on impact, consumption
falls by 3.4 percent before gradually rising to nearly 0.6 percent above its initial level (Fig-
ure 4(a)). This is the result of firms shipping more to the foreign country (to build inventory
levels), which requires paying fixed costs. On impact, a larger-than-long-run share of firms
place orders, creating a short-run investment in market access. In the static model, trade
immediately adjusts and consumption increases on impact. The transition's half life lasts
about one year, which is much faster than the model in the previous section. The source
of trade dynamics in the two models are different and they produce qualitatively different
transitions. The relatively sharp movements in trade in the inventory model are observed in
response to business cycle shocks and thus explain some of the high cyclicality in recessions
and recoveries.15

       The exercises in the section make it clear that the nature of the firm-level trade frictions
determine the nonlinear aggregate trade dynamics we observe in the data, in terms of both
the slow and fast adjustment to shocks. Comparing the static and dynamic models, we find
that the consumption dynamics in the static models differ substantially from the dynamic
models. These findings imply that the sufficient-statistic formulas for the gains from trade
derived from static models do not apply to models with firm-level trade dynamics. Put
differently, if the true data-generating process is one of these dynamic models, applying
the static formulas period-by-period would provide a poor approximation of the aggregate
impact on consumption or welfare. Likewise, the path of shocks estimated from a static
model would be quite different than the true shocks.


5        Uncertainty and the future
Once we move from static to dynamic trade models, we can address questions regarding the
firm-, industry-, and aggregate-level uncertainty that firms face in the foreign market. In
the dynamic models we have reviewed, the expected level and variance of future shocks will
influence the current level of trade, although the direction and magnitude of these effects
  15
     Khan and Khederlarian (2019) find evidence of this type of short-run overshooting in response to NAFTA,
followed by a gradual increase in the trade elasticity over the next 5 to 10 years.


                                                    32
depend on model specifics. A nascent research agenda focuses on identifying, empirically and
theoretically, the effects of future shocks on current outcomes and uses current outcomes to
identify the expected path of future shocks. A key open challenge is to separate the impact
of expected future changes from the uncertainty over these changes.

       The evidence on the effects of idiosyncratic uncertainty on trade flows is mixed. The
empirical work mostly emphasizes differences across products, rather than the overall level
of trade. Using French customs data, B´
                                      ek´
                                        es et al. (2017) find that firms export less in
products with higher demand volatility, and do so by exporting less frequently but in larger
shipments. Clark et al. (2014) find that goods with greater uncertainty in ocean freight
delivery times have lower trade flows. In a theoretical exploration, Alessandria et al. (2015)
find that an increase in the volatility of idiosyncratic productivity will increase trade flows,
even if it reduces the export participation rate: Greater dispersion in outcomes makes the
most productive exporters more profitable, boosting their size and returns to exporting.

       With respect to aggregate uncertainty, the evidence, again, is mixed. Most work has
focused on the role of exchange-rate uncertainty and trade flows. Bahmani-Oskooee and
Hegerty (2007) review this largely inconclusive work. Merga (2019) proposes novel meth-
ods to identify stochastic exchange-rate volatility, and finds that greater volatility decreases
trade. He shows that a sunk-cost model, expanded to include shipping delays and financial
constraints, can generate such an outcome. In contrast, Caldara et al. (2020) and Steinberg
(2019) study trade-policy uncertainty in general equilibrium sunk-cost models and find in-
creased trade-policy uncertainty may increase trade and even output, although Caldara et al.
(2020) find a negative impact of trade-policy uncertainty when there are price rigidities.

       There is a renewed interest in the aggregate and idiosyncratic uncertainty surrounding
trade policy.16 Influential work by Handley and Lim~
                                                   ao (2017) uses the granting of permanent
normal trade relations (PNTR) to China to identify a dampening effect of uncertain future
tariff increases on trade. In a sunk-cost model, trade volumes fall as uncertainty rises, and
  16
    An early example is Ruhl (2010), who studied the ban of Canadian beef exports following the discovery
of "mad cow disease" in Canadian cattle. This ban was unexpected, instantaneous, and of an uncertain
duration, providing a clean experiment. This type of uncertainty, however, is less common than uncertainty
over future tariff levels.




                                                   33
they use this relationship to estimate the likelihood of a future tariff increase. Alessandria
et al. (2019) revisit this episode using within-year variation in trade flows and the timing of
annual U.S. congressional votes on Chinese-good tariffs. They find that, in the lead up to a
congressional vote, trade expanded more in products with a potential tariff increase. This
behavior implies a smaller likelihood of non-renewal of China's PNTR than Handley and
Lim~
   ao (2017) estimate. Caldara et al. (2020) construct a firm-level measure of trade policy
uncertainty from earnings calls and identify heterogeneous expectations of future trade policy
across firms. Firms most concerned about future policy have weaker investment growth.
Crowley et al. (2018) show that firm entry rates fall and exit rates rise in the presence of a
future, uncertain increase in tariffs identified through the tendency of anti-dumping duties
on a product to spread across countries.

    A related issue is the differential response of export decisions to temporary and permanent
changes in the economy. Trade policy can be long-lived (free trade agreements) or temporary
(antidumping duties); business cycles can induce high-frequency changes in the exchange rate
and economic crises can generate long-lived changes. Long-lived changes will have a larger
effect on the future value of a firm and induce a larger response on the extensive margin.
This is the argument made by Ruhl (2008) to explain why observed trade volumes are more
responsive to tariff changes (which are permanent) compared with movements in the real
exchange rate (which are transitory).


6     Conclusions and future research
We have reviewed the overwhelming evidence that firms are making dynamic decisions to
participate in foreign markets. The nature of these investments is identified through entry,
exit and the expansion within and across markets. The analysis of general equilibrium
models with firm dynamics has been limited, but the aggregate outcomes of these models
differ substantially from static models. Put simply, static models do not approximate the
short-run or long-run outcomes of a dynamic adjustment processes.

    We view this as an opportunity to revisit many of the findings in the literature and to
ask questions that cannot be answered in static models. Perhaps the most important are


                                              34
questions regarding trade policy. How does uncertainty in policy, temporary policy, and
preannounced future policy influence firm choices and, in turn, aggregate quantities and
prices? How do we measure the effects of policy on aggregate trade and output growth?
This last question is probably the most important, since, after nearly 40 years of sustained
integration, the transition seems complete and the future direction of trade policy is in doubt.

   Isolating the effects of a change in tariffs from other shocks remains an open question.
The anticipation effects of announcements, such as Britain's vote to leave the European
Union, are vivid in reports of Londoners stockpiling Nutella, but remain to be carefully
studied. The large movements in stock prices and exchange rates on news of the U.S.-China
trade war will need to be reconciled with theory, and there are growing concerns that the
trade war may substantially slow growth and even plunge the world into recession. There are
exciting opportunities to explore these and previous episodes in dynamic models of trade.

   Finally, despite the careful modeling of entry costs, the literature has largely avoided
the treatment of a firm's dynamic decisions across multiple destinations. The literature on
(static) quantitative trade and firm heterogeneity has focused on the impact of geography
on those costs. Merging these two approaches is a relatively unexplored, but promising,
avenue of future research. Answers to the key questions referenced above, such as the effects
of bilateral trade wars, may be critically affected by the exact nature of trade costs across
destinations and the opportunities for market switching.
