               Why don't prices rise during periods of peak demand?
                           Evidence from scanner data
Introduction


        In the textbook model of price determination, in which price is equal to marginal cost,

demand-cycle price dynamics are relatively simple. Specifically, if the production function

exhibits diminishing returns, prices should rise as demand expands. Thus, if one finds that prices

are not rising during a demand boom, some aspect of the textbook model must be incorrect. The

first contribution of this paper is to provide evidence that prices do not rise in response to

predictable increases in demand, and fall on average in the market we study.

        Counter-cyclical pricing could occur when imperfect competition creates a wedge

between price and marginal cost. If the size of this wedge is time-varying, then prices might or

might not rise in response to a positive demand shock. However, in order to arrive at a specific

prediction for how prices move over a demand cycle, one needs to specify the exact nature of the

imperfect competition.

        To explore these issues we draw on a unique dataset taken from a large supermarket

chain in the Chicago area. There are several reasons for looking at supermarket data. First, the

grocery-retailing sector is huge, with sales totaling $435 billion in 1999, accounting for 25% of

non-durable retail sales. Second, the consumer-retailer interactions mimic conditions present in

many other types of purchases (e.g. purchases are frequent and small relative to search costs),

making the patterns that we uncover potentially relevant for other parts of the economy.

        The most important reason for focusing on supermarkets, however, is that several novel

aspects of our dataset allow us to overcome measurement problems that have plagued previous

studies of price-cyclicality in imperfectly competitive markets. One advantage of our dataset is

the availability of a very accurate time series on the transactions prices of thousands of goods.
                                                                                                        3
Second, we are able to observe retail prices, quantities, and the wholesale prices paid by the

supermarket, giving us a better-than-usual measure of the retailer's marginal cost and profit

margins. Previous researchers have been forced to infer markup cyclicality using data on prices

without direct measures of costs. Finally, we exploit the fact that the demand for many

supermarket goods follows a predictable seasonal or holiday cycle. The response of prices to

these foreseeable demand shocks provides a method of discrimination between alternative

theories of retailer and manufacturer competition. It is typically difficult to disentangle the price

changes resulting from demand shocks from price changes resulting from supplier behavior.

        We explore the empirical implications of several types of imperfect competition models

in our data. Two main classes of hypotheses based on imperfect competition have been put forth

in the literature to explain why markups may be counter-cyclical. First, for example, Bils (1989)

and Warner and Barsky (1995) both propose different mechanisms by which demand might be

more elastic than usual during demand peaks, leading optimal markups to be counter-cyclical.

The Bils (1989) model focuses on durable goods purchases and may be inappropriate to our

particular setting. Warner and Barsky generate cyclical demand elasticities by modeling

economies of scale in search. With a fixed cost of searching, it is optimal to search more during

high purchasing periods. This makes consumers more price-sensitive when overall demand is

high. Consistent with their hypothesis, Warner and Barsky find evidence that prices for many

consumer goods fall at Christmas and on weekends, periods when consumers are intensively

engaged in shopping.

        Second, counter-cyclical markups may also stem from cyclical behavior in firm conduct.

Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) and Rotemberg and Woodford (1991,1992) suggest that markups

may be counter-cyclical because tacit collusion is difficult to sustain during booms. Haltiwanger

and Harrington (1991) extend this logic to a deterministic demand cycle, such as the seasonal
                                                                                                        4
cycle on which we will focus. The logic of these models is simple: tacit collusion is sustainable

when the gains from defection in the current period are low relative to the expected future cost of

being punished for the defection. The temptation to cheat from a collusive arrangement is

highest during a temporary demand spike, because the gain from cheating is increasing in current

demand, while the loss from punishment increases in future demand.

        We also explore a third model of imperfect competition that focuses on the importance of

imperfect information about prices, giving rise to a role for advertising. This model also gives

rise to a form of counter-cyclical pricing, although this feature of the model has not been

emphasized in the literature. Our formalization of this mechanism is based on Lal and Matutes

(1994) and presumes that, if a retailer has to advertise to inform consumers about prices (and pay

a fixed cost per ad), then it will be efficient to advertise (and commit to a low price) on the items

that are in high demand, regardless of whether the aggregate volume of shopping is high or low.

Thus, for example, it pays to deal tuna at Lent and turkeys at Thanksgiving.

        In order to explore which of these models of cyclical pricing behavior best conform to

our data, we present a simple model that nests three alternative theories of cyclical prices. We

highlight the differing empirical predictions of these models. Our ability to apportion price

changes into changes in retail margins and changes in wholesale prices will be a crucial input to

testing these theories in our data.

        Our work is related to empirical work in industrial organization that has focused on

testing implications of the Rotemberg and Saloner model. For example, Borenstein and Shepard

(1996), for retail gasoline, and Ellison (1994), for railroads, present evidence consistent with

Rotemberg and Saloner (1986). In particular, both papers show that, holding current demand

constant, prices are lower, the lower is expected future demand. They do not model possibly

time-varying elasticities, as suggested by Bils (1987) or by Warner and Barsky (1995). We
                                                                                                                        5
depart from these papers by testing different implications of the Rotemberg and Saloner model

and by explicitly testing this model against alternative models of markup cyclicality.

         In the supermarket context, this paper is closely related to MacDonald (2000) and to

Hosken, Matsa, and Reiffen (2000). These papers document counter-cyclical movements in

supermarket prices over the seasonal cycle. However, these authors did not have access to both

retail and wholesale prices and thus, were not able to attribute markup changes to changes in

retail behavior, changes in manufacturer behavior, or both. As we explain below, the

observation that different models have different implications for retailer and manufacturer

margins for different types of goods is at the core of our identification strategy.1

         Overall, our findings suggest a clear role for retailer behavior in generating counter-

cyclical pricing and much less clear evidence of counter-cyclical pricing by manufacturers.

However, the pattern of retailer markup variation that we observe appears to be inconsistent with

retailer behavior being driven by the mechanisms described by either Rotemberg and Saloner

(1986) or Warner and Barsky (1995). We supplement these findings by examining directly

whether consumers are more price-sensitive during peak demand periods. In general, we find

that they are not, casting further doubt on cyclical demand elasticities as an explanation for the

counter-cyclical pricing in our data. Overall, our findings are most consistent with a loss leader

pricing model, such as Lal and Matutes (1994).

    The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In section 1, we present the theoretical framework

and identification scheme. In section 2, we describe the dataset and document important features

of the supermarket retail environment. In section 3, we show evidence about the seasonality of

supermarket prices. In section 4, we examine retail margin behavior and its consistency with the

 In spirit, our exercise is close to Ghosal (2000) who attempts to separately check for the impact of cost and demand
shocks on markups. Although he uses aggregated, non-transactions prices and considers monetary policy shocks
and energy shocks as his demand and supply disturbances.

theories of price fluctuations. Section 5 describes wholesale price changes. Section 6

investigates the Warner and Barsky (1995) model more closely, reporting evidence on changes in

the price-sensitivity of purchases at peak demand period. Section 7 investigates the Lal and

Matutes (1994) model more closely, investigating seasonal advertising patterns. Section 8

outlines our plans for future research and concludes.



1. Theoretical framework

    We will consider three classes of models that may generate counter-cyclical pricing: a model

of counter-cyclical collusion, a model of cyclical elasticity of demand, and model of advertising

by multi-product firms. All three of these models are roughly consistent with the basic

observation that supermarket prices tend to fall on average during the seasonal demand peaks for

a particular good. The goal of this section is to slightly extend each of these models to suit better

the characteristics of our particular empirical application, and to draw out the more subtle

implications of these models, in order to illustrate their differing empirical predictions.

1.1 General framework

        We will utilize a single basic set-up to illustrate the predictions of the three classes of

models. Consider a Hotelling linear city of length one, with N consumers located uniformly

along the city. Retailers A and B are located at the endpoints of the linear city. Each retailer

carries two goods, labeled i and j. Depending on the demand state, consumers wish to consume

0,1, or 2 units of each good. We denote the demand state as QD(i,j), the quantity demand of good

i and good j. In each state in which they demand a good, consumers' reservation price for each

unit is R. Consumers bear a travel cost t per unit distance when they travel to a store. The travel

cost does not vary with the number of units purchased at the store, although consumers who do
                                                                                                            7
not wish to purchase anything at all do not bear a travel cost. Retailers bear a marginal cost c for

each unit sold.

        To restrict ourselves to the case where firms serve all customers in the city in all demand

states, we require R ≥ t/2 + c.

        There are three possible states of demand. In state 1, QD(i,j) = (1,2). In state 2, QD(i,j) =

(2,1) and, in state 3, QD(i,j)=(2,2).



1.2 Cyclical elasticity of demand.

        Warner and Barsky (1995) consider a model similar to our basic setup sketched above,

except they consider retailers selling a single good, the demand for which varies over time. It is

easy to see how their results translate to our multi-product context.

        Consider demand state 1, where QD(i,j) = (1,2). A consumer located at x∈(0,1) is

indifferent to shopping at store A vs. store B if:

        piA + 2pjA + xt = piB + 2pjB +(1-x)t

The total number of customers choosing store A is thus:

                      piB + 2 p Bj − piA − 2 p Aj + t
        Nx = N
                                      2t

Firm A's problem, then, is to maximize total profits with respect to piA and pjA

                                                       pi B + 2 p j B − pi A − 2 p j A + t 
                         A
                              (
         Max p A , p A Π = pi + 2 p j
                                  A        A
                                                    )
                                               − 3c N 
                                                                       2t
                                                                                            
                                                                                            
              i   j




Firm A's reaction function is thus:

        piA + 2pjA = (1/2) (piB + 2pjB + t +3c)                                                       (1)
                                                                                                       8
Notice that the problem is totally symmetric for Firm A and Firm B. Thus, the equilibrium in

demand state 1 is characterized by:

        piA + 2pjA = t + 3c                                                                  (2)

Similarly, in demand state 2, the equilibrium is:

        2piA + pjA = t + 3c                                                                  (3)

Finally, in demand state 3, the equilibrium is:

        2piA + 2pjA = t + 4c                                                                 (4)

         In all cases, the individual prices for items i and j are indeterminate. This is obvious,

given that the consumers' decision of which store to visit depends only on the total price that they

will pay, not the individual item prices. Thus, demand states 1 and 2 are effectively identical,

the per-item markup charged must average t/3 in both states.

        However, and this is the main intuition of the Warner and Barsky model, demand state 3

is different from demand states 1 and 2, because aggregate demand is greater in state 3. With the

higher demand, the average per item markup must total only t/4, so markups fall in aggregate

demand peaks.

        The model has no prediction for the relative prices of the various goods offered by the

retailer. For each state of demand, many pairs of prices (pi,pj) would satisfy the equilibrium

condition. In the presence of any costs of adjusting prices, however, the retailer would prefer to

change prices as infrequently as possible. Under those circumstances, the retailer may choose

prices pi=pj= (t/3)+c in demand states 1 and 2, and arbitrarily choose one price to move

downward to (t/6)+c in state 3.

        Lastly, notice that price is a function of the total quantity purchased per consumer;

changes in the number of consumers are irrelevant to pricing decisions.

1.3 An Advertising Model

        Lal and Matutes (1994) present a model of a multi-product retailer very similar to that

which we have outlined, although they do not consider demand cyclicality. In contrast to

Warner and Barsky (1995), a main feature of the Lal and Matutes model is the assumption that

consumers do not know the prices that are charged until they arrive at the store. This creates the

following conundrum: once consumers arrive at the store, the transportation cost is sunk. Thus,

as long as the transport cost between the two stores is large enough, it makes sense for the

retailer to charge the consumer's reservation price R for each good. Foreseeing this problem,

consumers will not go to the store.

        The solution to this conundrum proposed by Lal and Matutes (1994) is price advertising.

Advertising serves to commit the retailer to charge particular prices. If advertising were costless,

this model basically collapses into the model that we sketched out above: retailers would

advertise all of the prices, and the prices would obey the equilibrium conditions that we have

sketched out above.

        In practice, however, advertising is not costless. We do not observe supermarkets, for

example, advertising the prices of all of the goods that they sell. The typical supermarket

circular advertises the prices of roughly 200 items, although the typical store carries on the order

of 25,000 items. Lal and Matutes (1994) point out that, if the retailer only advertises a subset of

the products, consumers will correctly infer that all unadvertised products are being sold for their

reservation price, R. Lal and Matutes further assume that retailers pay an advertising cost A per

good advertised. They show that, if advertising costs are high enough, the sole equilibrium

features one good being advertised, with the unadvertised good being sold for R.

        Consider the retailer's decision of which good to advertise in demand state 1 in the

framework developed above. The retailer is going to extract the same amount of surplus from
                                                                                                         10
the consumer regardless of which good is dealt. This means the retailer could charge R for good

2 and t+3c-2R for good 1, or R for good 1 and (t+3c-R)/2 for good 2. Recall, however, that the

only restriction that we placed on R is that R ≥ (t + 2c)/2. Obviously, if there is free disposal, the

retailer should avoid negative prices and thus, if (t+3c)/2 < R < t+3c, the retailer will advertise

the more popular item, item j, and charge R for item i.

        This same intuition, that the more popular good is more likely to be advertised, also holds

true if the seasonality that we have described occurs because more consumers purchase a

particular good during a seasonal boom. Hosken, Matsa, and Reiffen (2000) extend the Lal and

Matutes model to this case.

        While we couch our discussion in terms of the Lal and Matutes's (1994) setup,

separating it from other loss leader models is beyond the scope of this paper. For example,

Simester (1995) proposes a signaling model in which advertised prices are somewhat informative

about unadvertised prices, as only low-cost firms advertise very low prices. Although not

highlighted in Simester's model, with non-negativity constraints on prices, the model requires

that the advertised very-low-priced items be items for which demand is fairly high. Thus, we

take the Lal and Matutes model as representative of the class of loss leader models.

1.4 Countercyclical collusion models

        Up to now, we have only considered the equilibria of static price-setting problems.

However, if retailers compete with one another repeatedly, then tacit collusion may emerge.

Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) consider tacit collusion in an environment with variable-demand.

They show that the temptation to "cheat" will be high during aggregate demand peaks and that

only lower markups may be sustainable during these periods of peak demand. Bernheim and

Whinston (1990) extend this analysis to a multi-product environment. While their focus is on
                                                                                                          11
conglomerates in multiple lines of business, their analysis extends directly to the case of the

multi-product retailer.

         Tacit collusion is sustained by the threat to revert to the static Nash equilibrium forever if

either firm deviates from the collusive solution. Thus, collusion can be sustained as long as:



                             δ
         (Π COLL - Π SN )           ≥     Π DEV - Π COLL                                      (5)
                            1− δ



where:

Π COLL = the per-firm profit at the collusive choice of prices.

Π DEV = the profit that a firm can earn via the optimal deviation from the collusive price.

Π SN     = the per-firm profit in the static Nash equilibrium.

δ        = the rate used to discount the future periods

         If R is high enough relative to t, the monopoly price solution upon which the two firms

would like to collude is:

         pi + 2pj = 3R - t/2 in demand state 1

         2pi + pj = 3R - t/2 in demand state 2 and

         2pi + 2pj = 4R - t/2 in demand state 3.

(Recall that we have restricted our attention to the case where R≥t/2+c in order to insure that the

entire market is served in all demand states. This is also sufficient to assure that the monopoly

prices exceed marginal cost).

         A price of pi=pj=R - t/6, for example, would suffice as a collusive price for both demand

periods 1 and 2. A price of pi=pj = R - t/8 would suffice as a collusive price for demand period 3.

Since an optimal solution can be found for each demand state such that pi=pj, let pM[k] denote the
                                                                                                                    12
optimal symmetric monopoly prices in demand state k, where k∈(1,2,3). For simplicity, we

normalize the retailer's marginal costs to zero for the rest of this example.



Each firm's collusive profit is:

         Π COLL[k] = 3pM[k]/2 for k∈(1,2) and

         Π COLL[3] = 4pM[3]/2.

         Suppose that firm B is charging the optimally collusive price. The optimal deviation for

firm A is given by its reaction functions from equation (1) above:

         piA[1] + 2pjA[1] = (1/2) (3pM[1] + t)

         2piA[2] + pjA[2] = (1/2) (3pM[2] + t)

         2piA[3] + 2pjA[3] = (1/2) (4pM[3] + t)

The deviating firm A's profits, would then equal:

         Π DEV[k] = (1/8t) (3pM[k]+t)2 for k∈(1,2) and

         Π DEV[3] = (1/8t) (4pM[3]+t)2

When collusion breaks down, the firms will revert to the static Nash solution:

         Π SN[k] = t/2 for k∈(1,2,3).

We can consider various deterministic seasonal patterns and their potential impact on

cooperation. For concreteness, consider the following seasonal cycle: demand state 1, demand

state 3, demand state 2, demand state 3, demand state 1, demand state 3, …

    We show two important features of this type of demand cycle: 2



2
   This set-up makes having a low demand state and having a high demand state equally likely, and having the two
low demand states equally likely. Obviously, if low demand states were modeled as more common, this would
make collusion more difficult to sustain in the high demand states because stealing market share during a boom
would be more attractive relative to the presented discounted value of all future profits. Conversely, if high demand
states were more common, this would make collusion easier to sustain. If either of the two low demand states were
more likely than the other that would also pin down which good to discount.
                                                                                                                              13
    1. Tacit collusion can support the same prices in demand state 1 and demand state 2 under

this seasonal cycle.

    2. For some discount rates, tacit collusion can support only lower prices in demand state 3

than it will in demand state 1 or 2.

The first feature is easy to see. Equation (5) implies that the monopoly prices pM[1] are

sustainable in demand state 1 as long as:

                            δ                              δ2                               δ4
(ΠCOLL[3] - ΠSN[3] )             + (Π COLL[2]
                                              - Π SN[2]
                                                        )        + ((Π COLL[1]
                                                                               - Π SN[1]
                                                                                         )        ≥ ΠDEV[1] - ΠCOLL[1]        (6)
                          1− δ                            1− δ                             1− δ
                               2                               4                                4




Similarly, prices pM[2] are sustainable in demand state 2 as long as:

                            δ                              δ2                               δ4
(ΠCOLL[3] - ΠSN[3] )             + (Π COLL[1]
                                              - Π SN[1]
                                                        )        + ((Π COLL[2]
                                                                               - Π SN[2]
                                                                                         )        ≥ ΠDEV[2]- ΠCOLL[2]         (7)
                          1− δ 2                          1− δ 4                           1− δ 4

If we consider pM=R - t/6, and pSN = t/3, these conditions collapse for BOTH demand states 1

and 2 to:

                           δ        3 p M[ 1, 2]        δ 2 + δ4     1                           3 p M [1, 2]
         ( 2 p M [ 3] )         + (              − t )(          ) ≥    ( 3 p M[1 ,2 ]
                                                                                       + t ) 2
                                                                                               −                        (8)
                          1−δ 2         2                1−δ 4       8t                              2

         Thus, if the monopoly solution is sustainable in demand state 1, it is sustainable in

demand state 2. This is identical to the logic in Bernheim and Whinston (1990). In a multi-

product environment, it is the pooled incentive constraint that matters, not the incentive

compatibility constraints for the individual goods. Thus, if the demand shocks to good i and

good j are perfectly negatively correlated, as they are in demand states 1 and 2, then regimes 1

and 2 are equally collusive.

         Demand state 3, however, has a different incentive compatibility condition. Suppose that

the discount rate δ is such that the incentive compatibility constraint in (8) just binds. We show

now that the monopoly price is not sustainable in demand state 3.
                                                                                                              14
        Incentive compatibility in demand state 3 requires that:



                          δ2       3 p M[ k ]        δ +δ 3    1
        ( 2 p M [ 3] )         + (            − t )(        ) ≥ ( 4 p M [ 3] + t ) 2 − 2 p M[ 3]       (9)
                         1−δ 2
                                      2               1−δ 4
                                                               8t




It is easy to see that the left hand side of Equation (9) is smaller than the left hand side of (8). To

see that the right hand side of (9) is larger than the right hand side of (8), one has to insert the

optimal monopoly prices for both demand states, given above, into the right hand side.

        For the low demand case in (8) case, the deviator's profit less the collusive profit is:

         9 R2 t
          (  + − R)                                                                                    (10)
         8 t  4

For the high demand case in (9), the deviator's profit less the collusive profit is:

         2 R 2 9t 3R
              +   −                                                                                    (11)
           t    32 2

The difference between the "deviation premium" for the high demand case minus the low

demand case is thus:

         7 R 2 3R
              −                                                                                        (12)
          8t    8

        Recall again that, in order to restrict ourselves to the case where the entire market is

served, we have required R≥t/2. This is a sufficient condition for (12) to be positive. This

implies that the right-hand side of equation of equation (9) is greater than the right-hand side of

equation (8). If the right hand side of (9) is unambiguously greater than the right-hand side of

(8) and the left-hand side of (9) is unambiguously smaller than the left hand side of (8), then it

must be the case that, if δ is such that the incentive compatibility constraint at p=pM[1,2] is
                                                                                                                   15
                M[3]
binding, then p        cannot be supported as a tacitly collusive equilibrium. This is exactly the

logic in Rotemberg and Saloner (1986).

         Thus, tacit collusion may lead markups to be lowered at points in the seasonal cycle

where aggregate demand is high, but, holding aggregate demand fixed, idiosyncratic seasonality

of individual goods should not affect the maintenance of tacit collusion.

         This unified treatment of the models suggests the following relevant distinctions between

their empirical predictions: All the models predict that the prices of high-demand goods will fall

during high-demand periods. Where the models show some differences is in their predictions for

demand elasticities, and for the behavior of retailer margins for high-demand goods during low-

demand periods. The loss leader models predict that retailer margins will fall for high-demand

goods even if the demand increase for that good is totally idiosyncratic.

         Neither Rotemberg and Saloner (1986), nor Warner and Barsky (1995) predict that

retailer margins will fall during these idiosyncratic demand peaks. However, applying the logic

of either model to competition amongst manufacturers may predict that manufacturer margins

will fall during product-specific demand peaks. That is, for example, we might expect that

Rotemberg and Saloner would predict that tuna manufacturers will compete fiercely during Lent,

a seasonal spike in demand for tuna. One could similarly tell a within-store variant of the

Warner and Barsky model and predict that consumers will be more elastic across brands of tuna

during Lent, causing manufacturers to lower markups.3

         Notice that we have ignored models based on increasing returns (even though these

models could explain falling prices in booms). We exclude these models for several reasons.

First, and most importantly, it seems most likely that if there are any increasing returns they stem


3
  In this variant, the two endpoints of the linear city would be substitute products by different manufacturers. One
could set up the model so that consumers are more likely to bear the costs of engaging in price comparison across
brands if these costs are amortized over multiple units.
                                                                                                      16
from some sort of fixed cost (e.g. better use of overhead labor to more efficiently stock shelves

or to more quickly process customers at the checkout stand). This sort of fixed-cost can lead to

higher profits in booms for the store as average costs fall. But, this will make no difference in

pricing decisions unless the number of competitors in the market changes. It seems doubtful to

us that at the seasonal frequency the number of competitors would change, so the presence of a

fixed cost cannot explain falling prices at seasonal demand spikes.

        One might instead argue that the increasing returns causes falling marginal costs during

the aggregate demand peaks. This would matter for pricing. But, with higher crowds in the store

and hence more congestion during the booms, what would explain why per-unit costs would fall

for the retailer? Furthermore, most of the cost savings that one could conceive of for the retailer

would be across-the-board cost savings, not cost savings accruing particularly to holiday items.

Since we don't have data on all of the prices in the store, we cannot test whether markups rise or

fall on average. However, as we discuss below, for the part of the store that we can measure,

overall prices are, if anything, higher during the holidays. This casts further doubt on the

increasing returns conjecture at the store level.

         Finally, one might consider increasing returns for the manufacturers. Again the most

plausible cost savings that we can imagine are fixed-cost savings, rather than marginal. Some

savings could arise from efficiencies in the distribution system. However, since many of these

manufacturers are sending multiple products to the store, these cost cuts should apply to the

bundle of goods. We will show that prices of goods with the same manufacturer and presumably

the same cost structure often diverge.

        For these reasons, we do not consider increasing returns models in our subsequent

analysis. For the models on which we do focus, their predictions for various types of goods and

demand shocks are outlined in Table 1.

2. Data description and basic facts about Dominick's Finer Foods

        Dominick’s Finer Foods (DFF) is the second-largest supermarket chain in the Chicago

metropolitan area; they have approximately 100 stores and a market share of approximately 25%.

Dominick’s provided the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business with weekly store-

level scanner data by UPC including: unit sales, retail price, profit margin (over the wholesale

price), and a deal code indicating that the price reduction is accompanied by some sort of

advertising (typically a feature ad or special shelf tag). This UPC-level database does not cover

all items that DFF sells; approximately 30% of the dollar sales at DFF are included in the

database, we provide details on the specific categories below.

        To complement the data on retail prices, we inverted the DFF's data on profit per dollar

of revenue that is contained in the database to calculate the chain's wholesale costs and retailer

percentage margin (defined as (p-c)/p). Note however that the wholesale costs that we can

recover do not correspond exactly to the desired theoretical construct, the replacement cost of the

item. Instead we have the average acquisition cost of the items in DFF's inventory. DFF's

generally knows that a trade deal is coming in advance of the first day of a deal. Our

understanding is that optimal inventory management on DFF's part results in a trade deal being

incorporated in the acquisition cost relatively quickly. Of greater concern is the fact that DFF

may stock up its inventory during trade deals; this means that the acquisition cost may remain

depressed for some time after a trade deal has expired.

        In addition to the category-level data, DFF also provided data on total customer count at

each DFF store and total sales by department. We will use these data to measure the aggregate

level of store traffic. We construct total sales by adding total sales from the grocery, produce,

dairy, frozen foods, meat, fish, deli, bakery, and frozen meat departments. Sales from other
                                                                                                                     18
departments are not included due to missing data problems. Next, we calculate total sales per

store day for each week. We use this measure rather than simply total sales to adjust for store

openings, closings, and reporting problems.4

        The standard time period for our analysis are the 400 weeks starting with the week of

September 14, 1989 (when the DFF relationship began). However, data collection began and

ended at different times for some of the categories. All of the DFF data are publicly available,

and can be found, along with a thorough description of the collection of the data, at:

http://gsbwww.uchicago.edu/research/mkt/MMProject/DFF/DFFHomePage.html. 5

        We supplement the data from DFF with information on weather and the dates of certain

holidays. We measure weather-induced cycles by constructing two temperature variables. To

construct these, we first obtained historical (hour by hour) climatological data from the National

Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Chicago temperatures -- these data can be found at

www.noaa.gov. From these, we calculated a mean temperature for each week of the year based

on the historical data. This series appeared to be influenced by outliers, so we smoothed the

weekly data to obtain a smooth seasonal temperature series.6 We used this smoothed mean

temperature (TEMP) series to generate two variables:

        HOT = max(0, TEMP - 49)


4
  For four weeks in the sample, none of the stores reported data for several days of the week, despite the fact that
those stores were open. Because total sales tend to be much higher on weekends than on weekdays, those
observations containing only partial weeks were adjusted. So, for example, if the data reported for the week
contained Wednesday-Sunday, but not Monday and Tuesday, the data were scaled up by the sample average ratio of
full week sales to Wednesday through Sunday sales.
5
   We found that DFF made some errors (in our opinion) in classifying cookies, crackers, and snack crackers. In
general, "Crackers" encompasses saltines, graham crackers, and oyster crackers, while "snack crackers"
encompasses, Ritz, Wheat thins, Triscuits and other party-type crackers. We reclassified products when there were
inconsistencies in what we understood to be DFF's intended scheme. For example, all Snackwells brand chocolate
cookies had been classified by DFF as snack crackers; we reassigned them to cookies.
6
 We believe that the expected or average weather conditions matter for our purposes, since given the lead times in
promoting items and/or coordinating price changes across the chain there is no way to respond to a short-lived
abnormal blip in temperatures.
                                                                                                      19
        COLD = max(0, 49 - TEMP)

        Forty-nine degrees Fahrenheit is approximately both the mean and median temperature in

Chicago. Moreover, in addition to this parametric specification of changing weather conditions,

we also experimented with using dummy variables to isolate the warmest (and coldest) 6 or 8

weeks and found very similar results to those that we report here.

        We also generated dummy variables that equal one in the shopping periods before each

holiday. DFF's database contains weekly data in which the weeks commence on Thursday and

end on Wednesday, the same period for which a store sales circular is typically active. Because

the day of week that different holidays might land on can vary across years, we generate a

dummy variable which takes the value one for two shopping weeks before each holiday. For

Thursday holidays, then, the variable was set to one for the two weeks prior to the holiday, but

zero for the week including the holiday. For holidays taking place on all other days, the dummy

variable was set to one for the week before the holiday and for the week including the holiday.

We allow the Christmas dummy to remain equal to one for the week following the holiday, since

shopping in preparation of Christmas and shopping in preparation for New Year's will be very

difficult to disentangle. We also construct a variable "Lent", which will be important later in our

analysis of tuna sales. The religious season of Lent lasts for 40 days prior to Easter, so our Lent

variable takes the value of one for the 4 weeks preceding the 2 week Easter shopping period.

Finally, we construct the variable "Post-Thanks" which takes the value of one for the week

following Thanksgiving.

        While DFF provides all data to us at the store level, in many cases we will aggregate

these data across stores in order to characterize chain-level pricing decisions. Given that DFF

uses essentially only three pricing zones for the entire Chicago area, this aggregation procedure
                                                                                                                   20
obscures very little across-store heterogeneity in prices. For more information about DFF's

pricing zones, see Hoch et. al. (1995).

        In general, pricing at DFF (and, we believe, at all supermarkets) is characterized by

temporary discounting.7 Prices frequently drop to a temporary sale price and return again to the

"normal" price. The path of prices for a typical good (9.5 ounce Triscuit crackers) in our study

can be seen in Figure 1. Notice that, during the 7.5 years of our study, Triscuits appear to have

only eight “regular prices". Upward deviations from the regular price are virtually nonexistant;

temporary downward deviations are frequent.

        Total demand at Dominick's is extremely volatile around holidays. Figure 2 shows

weekly sales per store day at the chain level. The two-week shopping periods preceding

Christmas, Thanksgiving, and the fourth of July are highlighted with squares. The week

following Thanksgiving is highlighted with triangles. It is apparent that Christmas and

Thanksgiving represent the overall peak shopping periods for DFF, while the week following

Thanksgiving represents the absolute trough.

        A closer view of holiday shopping behavior can be seen in a regression framework.

Table 2 presents a regression of total sales per store day on a linear and quadratic time trend (to

adjust for overall growth), our temperature variables, and dummies representing the shopping

periods for Lent, Easter, Memorial Day, July 4th , Labor Day, Thanksgiving, the week following

Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Easter, Memorial Day, July 4th , Thanksgiving, and Christmas

represent statistically significant increases in total sales at DFF. However, the magnitudes of the

revenue increases for Easter, Memorial Day, and July 4th are very small relative to Thanksgiving

and Christmas. Neither the predictable changes in temperature, nor Lent are associated with

7
 Ariga, Matsui, and Watanabe (2000) show that a similar pattern holds in Japanese supermarkets, see Figure 1. To
explain the sales they propose (and find support for) a Pesendorfer-style (1998) dynamic model of price
                                                                                                             21
aggregate spending surges. As seen in Figure 2, the week following Thanksgiving is

characterized by a huge, statistically significant decline in sales.

        While some holidays constitute times of peak aggregate demand, the seasonal patterns of

demand can differ greatly across goods. Since our goal is to examine the pricing of goods at

times when they experience demand shocks, we identified a subset of our categories that, on a

priori grounds, we believed would experience some sort of seasonal demand shifts. A summary

of each category we considered on these a priori grounds and the expected peak demand periods

are described in Table 3.

        It is essential that our proposed demand shocks make sense to the reader on an a priori

basis. If we are not certain that these quantity movements are driven by shifts of a demand

curve, then we could be mistakenly uncovering movements along the demand curve because of

changing prices. Since one goal of our project will be to determine whether prices rise or fall

during these demand peaks, this distinction is crucial.

        MacDonald (2000) takes a different approach, regressing quantity sold on monthly

dummies for a wide variety of items, and then selecting items with large observed quantity peaks

in a particular month. This potentially allows demand shocks to be confounded with supply

shocks. That is, he could be identifying cases where demand is high because prices are low.

        We will compare the seasonal categories discussed above to a group of goods for which

we expect no seasonal demand shifts: analgesics, dish detergent, cookies, and regular crackers

(which includes saltines, graham crackers, and oyster crackers).

        We can obtain a crude measure of the seasonality of our categories and compare them to

the seasonality of the other categories in the Dominick's database. To do this, we regress total

category-level quantity sold for each product on a linear and quadratic trend terms, the cold and


discrimination. However, both papers abstract from the multi-product aspect of the pricing problem that we
                                                                                                                     22
hot variables, and the dummy variables representing the shopping periods for Lent, Easter,

Memorial Day, July 4th , Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Post-Thanksgiving, and Christmas.

         One complication to this procedure is that the Dominick's data do not provide category-

level quantities. Indeed, quantity is a somewhat ill-defined concept at the category level, given

that the items in the category are not all identical. To generate a quantity index, we take the

weekly revenues reported by Dominick's for the category, and divide it by a category-level price

index series. The price index is constructed using a fixed-weight procedure. Each price is

weighted by that item's average market share over the entire time period of the sample.

         To assess the importance of the weather and holidays for different categories we present

several regressions. The R2 s for a set of baseline regressions including only the linear and

quadratic trends are reported in column 2 of Table 4. The next column in the Table reports the

incremental contribution to the R2 that comes from including the temperature variables. The last

column in the table shows the incremental contribution to R2 generated from adding the holiday

variables (Easter, Memorial Day, July 4th , Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas).8

         The last columns of the table show that are high incremental R2 s associated with the

addition of the temperature and holiday dummies in the categories where we expected these

periods to be important. There are, however, other categories that also have high incremental

R2 s associated with the holidays, which may mean that our a priori screen missed some seasonal

goods. On closer inspection, however, it appears that most of these are cases driven by the

presence of "anti-holiday" goods. For example, this explains the high incremental R2 s associated




emphasize.

  This procedure is much cruder than the methodologies that we use below. In particular, we are forced to
renormalize the index whenever the price for a UPC is missing. If the missing items are particularly high or low
priced, this can disturb the index. We partially address this problem by using size factors to convert the prices into
per unit prices.
                                                                                                       23
with the holiday dummies in the cookie and breakfast cereal categories; these goods experience

large declines in sales at Thanksgiving and Christmas.

           The regressions underlying Table 4 also suggest some departures from our a priori

classifications. Firstly, analgesics, one of our a priori non-seasonal categories, does, in fact,

have a modest cold-weather seasonal. Secondly, as mentioned above, cookies appear to have a

counter-holiday seasonal, with sales falling at Christmas. Finally, the hot weather seasonal for

soft drinks was much smaller than we had anticipated. In fact, a closer inspection of the soft

drinks data suggested to us a number of coding problems that lead us to exclude soft drinks from

all of our subsequent analysis.

           Having selected categories for study, there are essentially two ways that one could

proceed. First, one could study the behavior of individual UPCs or items within each category.

Second, one could attempt to study category-aggregate behavior (as we did in Table 4). Both of

these avenues have potential pitfalls.

           Examining only a few individual UPCs could be misleading due to the multi-product

nature of the retailer's problem; retailers may only choose to deal only one or a few items in a

category (that is, if store traffic is driven by having some tuna on sale at Lent, not by having all

tuna on sale). If this is so, the UPCs chosen for study by the econometrician could be highly

non-representative and could lead one to over- or under-estimate the size of holiday and weather

effects.

           Examining category-level data is also problematic; small share items tend not to be

stocked at all stores at all times. Trying to include all category members in a price index can

lead to a price index that is not consistent over time. This is particularly challenging for our

analysis because stores may well expand their offerings in a category during a peak demand
                                                                                                      24
period. For example, the cookie category contains several pfeffernuesse UPCs, but only at

Christmastime.

        For these reasons, we choose a hybrid approach. For each category in our study, we

construct a list of the top-selling UPCs. We use this list to construct narrowly defined price

aggregates within each category representing the leading products in each category. So, for

example, we constructed seven price aggregates for the tuna category. Each aggregate contains

only those items that have extremely high price correlations with one another. For instance,

Chicken of the Sea 6 oz. Chunk Lite Tuna in Oil and Chicken of the Sea 6 oz . Chunk Lite Tuna

in Water have a price correlation of 1.000 in the dataset. Thus, we move them into a single item

aggregate. For each category, we constructed aggregates focusing on the top-ranked UPCs in a

category. For all of our categories, we have constructed aggregates that comprise a market share

of 30 to 70 percent of the category. The construction of the price aggregates for each category is

described in the data appendix.

        Constructing the data in this painstaking fashion has allowed us to make some

"corrections" to the data. For example, manufacturers often use a separate UPC to denote a

"special 75 cents off" package or a "get an extra 2oz free" package types. Typically, when one

of these "specials" is introduced, the regular UPC disappears for a few weeks. Then, eventually,

the special UPC disappears from the data and the regular one reappears. By clipping these UPC

series together, we get a better picture of the relevant price path of the product. This can make a

difference to our analyses. For example, in our beer series, the Old Style 24 pack is replaced by

a 30-pack at the 24-pack price in most summers.

        Using only the UPCs assigned to aggregates will allow us to examine the behavior of

individual items. This behavior can be very different across aggregates within a given category.

However, to summarize category-level behavior, we will also want some category-level
                                                                                                      25
measures. Rather than use the data for the entire category, we construct category-level measures

using all of the UPCs that form the aggregates for the category. We do this because these large

UPCs tend to be stable without a lot of entry and exit problems and because the items composing

the aggregates have been inspected carefully for data continuity problems (like the 24-pack/30-

pack Old Style). It would have been impossible for us to conduct these investigations for each of

the over 4500 UPCs in the 11 categories that we study.

        Table 5 shows regressions using the (log) quantity index for each of our eleven limited

categories as the right hand side variables. Of course, the quantity changes for any event are a

function of the exogenous demand shift caused by the event and the purchaser's optimal

responses to the supply behavior of retailers and manufacturers. Thus, we are hesitant to

interpret the results in Table 5 as informative about the relative size of the demand shocks caused

by different holidays. Nonetheless, these regressions generally are consistent with our a priori

hypotheses about demand seasonality.

        In interpreting the size of the weather variables it may be helpful to compute the

predicted differences at the hottest and coldest weeks (which are about 20 degrees different than

the average). By this metric beer consumption around the peak is roughly 30% higher, while

oatmeal is roughly 18% higher. Table 5 also reveals the large difference in the pattern of

seasonality between eating soups and cooking soups. Sales of cooking soups skyrocket at

Thanksgiving, while sales of eating soups have a much smaller movement. Sales of cooking

soups are less sensitive to cold weather than sales of eating soups. Furthermore, Table 5 is

consistent with our suspicion that Thanksgiving is a bigger demand shock for cooking soups than

is Christmas.
                                                                                                                   26
3. How do prices move over the demand cycle?

        We consider prices at two levels, for item-aggregates and for the overall category. The

price of each item-aggregate is constructed by aggregating the prices for each store for each item

in the aggregate. The weight assigned to each item's price in the aggregate is the average market

share of that item throughout the entire sample period. The weight assigned to each store is also

the average market share of that store throughout the entire sample period.9

        In Table 6, we present results from regressions of the log of the price of each item-

aggregate on a linear and quadratic trend, the temperature measures, and the holiday dummies.

Due to the large number of aggregates, we present results only for the temperature/holiday

coefficients of interest (coefficients for all variables will be presented for the category indices

below). To summarize the evidence, we report a pair of additional statistics. One indicator is the

mean of the coefficients within a category for each holiday/seasonal shock. A second measure of

the average coefficient is shown in the right-most column of Table 6. These estimates were

calculated by estimating the price equation for each item-aggregate in the category using a

restricted Seemingly Unrelated Regression. Each item-aggregate was allowed to have its own

coefficient for trend terms and the weather and holiday variables that were expected to be

unimportant for that category. The coefficient for the predicted demand spikes were constrained

to be the same for all items in the category. These restricted coefficients are shown in the

rightmost column of Table 6.

        Table 6 shows that, in general, prices tend to be lower rather than higher during the

periods of peak demand for an item. Indeed, thirteen of the fourteen average coefficients


9
  The price index must be renormalized whenever a UPC or store exits the data. However, by selecting large share
items that are almost always stocked and by stringing together UPCs when the UPCs are changed, we have
attempted to minimize the importance of renormalization on the dataset. Because prices comprising each aggregate
are extremely highly correlated, the results using a variable weight price index are (by construction) virtually
identical.
                                                                                                       27
corresponding to hypothesized peak demand periods are negative, with the exception of the

average coefficient of cold weather for cooking soups (and one might well anticipate that

demand for cooking soups would not be as temperature-sensitive as for eating soups). The

restricted regression coefficients show the same pattern, although by this metric July 4th also

shows no price change for beer.

        The pronounced tendency for retail prices to be lower at these demand peaks is

unexpected given the standard textbook case of price equal to marginal cost and constant (or

decreasing) returns to scale. These results are consistent with two possibilities: (1) despite the

care we took in attempting to identify demand shocks, we have merely uncovered seasonal

patterns in marginal cost, or (2) markups are moving counter-cyclically over the seasonal cycle.

        The first hypothesis---seasonal cost patterns that happen to coincide with our a priori

notions of seasonal demand patterns-- seems particularly unlikely. First, some evidence against

this particular hypothesis is identified in a similar setting by MacDonald (2000). He finds that

many grocery prices are lower during high purchase months and that during these same months

the typical price of the raw agricultural commodities that serve as inputs are usually higher. So

at least one important component of costs does not seem to be falling.

        Second, the final two panels of Table 6 are highly suggestive that this hypothesis is false.

Presumably, the marginal costs of producing and distributing cooking soups and eating soups are

extremely highly correlated. Nonetheless, the pricing patterns for the two types of soups are very

different. All five of the cooking soups experience price declines at Thanksgiving, while only

one of the 7 eating soups declines in price at Thanksgiving. The cooking soup prices show little

response to cold weather, while six of the seven eating soup prices decline during the cold

weather.
                                                                                                     28
         Similarly, in unreported regressions, we examine the holiday price responses of regular

crackers. Again, we expect the marginal cost of producing and distributing regular and snack

crackers to be extremely highly correlated. However, we find that, in sharp contrast to the

behavior of snack crackers prices reported in Table 6, all six of the regular cracker aggregates

show price increases at Christmas. Furthermore, two of the six regular cracker aggregates have

price increases at Christmas that are statistically significant at the 5% level. Thus, we have two

examples of products that should have very similar production functions but different demand

patterns. In both cases, prices fall for the seasonal good during the peak demand period.

        One important observation about the findings in Table 6 is that both the individual coef-

ficients and the restricted SUR coefficients are generally quite small and often indistinguishable

from zero. Furthermore, even when the average coefficient for a category is negative, the

coefficients for most categories/holidays are not uniformly negative. However, the methodology

of Table 6 likely understates the importance of seasonal price declines to both retailers and

consumers.

        Suppose (contrary to fact) that the items within a category were perfect substitutes and

that the retailer offered a special seasonal discount on just one of the items in the category. In

this case, all consumers would only purchase the discounted item. Thus, under the strong

assumption of perfect substitutability, from both the consumers’ and retailer's perspectives,

holding a sale on one item is identical to holding a sale on all items. Therefore, examining

average price responses to a seasonal demand shock for individual aggregates, or even at the

category-level using any fixed product weighting methodology, will understate the importance of

the price reductions.

        To explore the possibility that substitution across items leads to price declines that are

effectively larger than those implied by Table 6, we must construct a multi-item index that has
                                                                                                                29
varying weights. To do this, we construct a divisia price index for each category using all those

items in our aggregates. This index weights each item in the category by that item's market share

in that week. As one would expect, the variable weight category price index deviates most from

a fixed weight category price index when some item in the category has a temporary sale.

During a deal, purchases of the temporarily discounted items typically spike, often stealing

purchases from other items.

        Regression results with variable weight price indices for these constructed categories are

contained in Table 7. An inspection of OLS regressions using the aggregated data shows clear

evidence of non-normality of the error terms. This is especially true when we use the noisy

margin data described below. Thus, for all regressions in which we undertake aggregation, we

perform the estimations using an iterative GLS procedure. The GLS procedure will attain about

95% of the efficiency of OLS when errors are distributed normally and will outperform OLS

when the error distribution is heavy-tailed, as appears to be the case for our data.10 In general,

the unreported OLS results show larger holiday and seasonal price declines than the robust

regression results that we present here.

        In the category-level, variable-weight price regressions, all fourteen of the coefficients

corresponding to hypothesized demand spikes are negative. The negative coefficients for many,

including beer during the hot weather, beer at July 4th and Labor Day, tuna at Lent, snack

crackers at Christmas and Thanksgiving, cheese at Christmas and Thanksgiving, eating soup in

the cold weather and cooking soup at Thanksgiving, are statistically different from zero at the

five percent level. The magnitudes of the coefficients for most of the holiday variables are




10
  Specifically, we calculate starting values and then perform Huber iterations (Huber 1964) until convergence
followed by biweight iterations (Beaton and Tukey, 1974) until convergence. A description of the procedure can be
found in Hamilton (1991).
                                                                                                      30
substantial. Both tuna at Lent and snack crackers and cheese at Christmas have estimated price

declines of at least ten percent.

        The coefficients for the temperature variables remain small. The coefficient for "hot" for

beer implies that, from April 25 when the temperature should be approximately 49 degrees until

July 1st, when the temperature should be approximately 74.5 degrees, the price of beer is

predicted to fall by 4.8% due to the temperature change. Since the hottest week is also, in fact,

the week of the July 4th holiday, the total price predicted price difference between April 25th and

July 1st is 9.9%. For eating soup, the difference between the predicted April 25th price and the

price on January 25 (the coldest week of the year, with a predicted temperature of 20 degrees) is

3.8%. Estimated price declines for cooking soup and oatmeal are smaller still, with price

declines of 1.2% between April 25th and the coldest week.

        While at this point we have investigated only prices, not margins, we are still in a

position to make some judgements about the theoretical models. We have found price declines

for goods at all demand spikes for that good. This finding is inconsistent with price

determination being governed solely by the considerations stressed by either Rotemberg and

Saloner (1986) or Warner and Barsky (1995) for the retailers. Both are models in which retailers

would respond to overall increases in demand by cutting prices. Neither model predicts price

cuts by the retailer during idiosyncratic demand shocks such as the increase in demand for tuna

during Lent. Thus our finding of price cuts during idiosyncratic demand surges runs counter to

the predictions of these models.

        Also, recall that both of those models of retail competition would predict overall margin

cuts during aggregate demand shocks such as Christmas. Of course, in a multi-product

environment, those models give no predictions about which products will experience declines in

margins. Since we don't have data on every product in the store, we can never reject the
                                                                                                         31
hypothesis that margins declined overall at the biggest aggregate demand shock, Christmas.

However, we did generate an overall price index containing prices from the 29 categories for

which we have data. Regressions using an overall price index (with either variable or fixed

weights) suggest that prices are slightly higher at Christmas.

        The observation that price declines are far from being pervasive is especially evident for

the goods in our study for which we expect no Christmas demand shock. Notice in table 7 that

six of these seven prices changes are positive, four of these significantly so at the 5% level. This

casts further doubt on the hypothesis that retailer margins are typically declining significantly

during these aggregate demand peaks.

        These patterns of coefficients are also suggestive that the price patterns are not due to

overall increasing returns to scale on the part of the retailer. The efficiency gains at times of

high shopping could explain the price drops for the goods whose demand peaks occur at times

with high overall purchases. But this mechanism cannot explain why the idiosyncratic demand

surges are accompanied by price declines.

        The results in this section are consistent with several theoretical hypotheses. First, if the

price declines largely reflect declines in retail margins, the results are consistent with the Lal and

Matutes (1994) and other loss leader models. Retailers are choosing to advertise goods that are

popular in any given week. On the other hand, if the price declines appear to be largely the

result of seasonal changes in manufacturer margins, this could be evidence for Rotemberg and

Saloner or Warner and Barsky behavior on the part of manufacturers rather than retailers.

        To further distinguish between competing theories, we need to separately examine the

behavior of retail margins and wholesale prices over the seasonal and holiday cycle.
                                                                                                                     32
4. The movement of retail margins over the demand cycle

           In principle, the price movements observed in Tables 6 and 7 could be the result of either

manufacturer price changes or retailer price changes. To explore this, we use data obtained from

DFF for each UPC-week to calculate an estimate of the retail margin. The margin that we

calculate, the price minus the wholesale cost, divided by price is presumably an overestimate of

the true margin, since it includes no retailer marginal costs other than the wholesale price.

While, we would like to calculate the manufacturer's margins as well, we have no estimates of

the manufacturer's marginal costs, and thus, we can only calculate changes in the wholesale

price.11

           Results for regressions using retail margins are found in Table 8. The methodology used

here is identical that in Table 7. That is, we use our category-level variable weight price indices

to calculate retail margins. This seems most relevant given the Table 7 findings that category-

level prices seem to be responding much more than item-level responses (and the because the

retailer’s profits are driven by the total category sales.)

           Consider first the changes in retail margins at holidays for holiday-seasonal goods. All of

the theories that we highlight predict falling retail margins at those holidays that correspond to

aggregate store level demand spikes. Clearly, Thanksgiving and Christmas can be defined as

store-level aggregate demand spikes. Arguably, July 4th , Memorial Day, Labor Day, and Easter

are also store-level aggregate demand spikes, albeit smaller ones.

           The fall in retail margins during these holidays for these holiday-sensitive goods is clear.

Negative price responses, significantly different from zero at the 5% level, are found for cheese

and snack crackers at Thanksgiving and Christmas, and beer at Memorial Day, July 4th , Labor

11
  Kadiyali, Chintagunta, and N. Vilcassim (2000) and Chintagunta, Bonfrer, and Song (2000) provide some
evidence on this by looking at profits all the way through the distribution channel for several categories. Overall for
these categories they find that profits are split roughly half and half between the retailers and manufacturers.
                                                                                                      33
Day and Christmas (New Year's). The only good not demonstrating this pattern is cooking soup.

Cooking soup has a tiny and statistically insignificant retail margin decline at Thanksgiving, its

primary demand shock. Margins on cooking soup actually increase slightly at Christmas, the

secondary demand shock.

        More interesting from the perspective of separating out the theories are the results for

retail tuna margins at Lent. Retail margins on tuna decline 5% at Lent. This decrease is

statistically significant at the one percent confidence level. Recall that Lent is not a positive

aggregate demand shock for the supermarket. The fact that tuna margins decline and that the

decline is on the same order of magnitude as the declines observed for the other holiday goods

strongly suggests that the aggregate demand driven models of imperfect competition amongst

retailers (Rotemberg and Saloner and Warner and Barsky) do not appear to be at work here.

        The retail margin behavior for the cold/hot seasonal products provides some further,

albeit weak, support for this view. Beer, oatmeal, and eating soup all show margin declines

during their peak demand seasons. These declines are statistically significant at the 5% level for

oatmeal and for soup. However, the magnitudes are tiny. The predicted decline in margin is

2.0% from the median temperature week to the coldest week for soup and 1.2% for oatmeal. The

predicted decline in margin for beer is less than one percent from the median temperature week

to the hottest week.

        The results for the non-seasonal goods casts further doubt on the Rotemberg and Saloner

and Warner and Barsky models for the retailers. These models would suggest that retail margins

at Christmas should be lower on average across all categories. This is impossible to judge given

that we don't have data on all categories. However, it is suggestive that at Christmas, the largest

aggregate demand shift, retail margins are higher for 6 of the 7 goods that are not expected to
                                                                                                                      34
have Christmas demand surges. This increase is statistically significant only for eating soup,

however.

         Altogether, the evidence on retail margins is most consistent with loss leader models such

as Lal and Matutes (1994). These models produce a rationale for why retailers would accept

lower margins on any good experiencing a demand surge, whether or not that demand surge

corresponds to an aggregate demand peak. Furthermore, their model suggests that prices are low

on advertised items but the shopper's reservation price is charged for the unadvertised items.

Thus, their model has no difficulty with our finding that the margins on non-holiday seasonal

items appear to rise on average at Christmas, the largest aggregate demand shock in the dataset.

         One further possible explanation for falling retailer margins at both aggregate and

idiosyncratic demand peaks is that true marginal cost is falling due to reduction in inventory

costs.   If the items in our analysis turnover more frequently at the demand peaks than the

inventory component of marginal cost will decrease.                 Of course, it is not obvious that items

turnover more rapidly during a demand spike, as retailers may adjust shelf space allocations

when the demand for a particular item spikes (such as by allocating "aisle caps" to a item in high

demand). However, it is instructive to consider how large these reductions in inventory costs can

plausibly be.      If the supermarket's overall capital investment decision is optimal, the cost of

inventorying a product is the lost interest on the capital invested in the product plus the rental

cost of the space that the item takes up.12 The second of these is negligible for the products that

we are discussing.       How high can the interest cost of turning over an item more quickly be?

Suppose that the typical item is held in inventory for one month and that a demand spike doubles

sales, leading the item to be held in inventory for only 2 weeks. Both of these assumptions are


12
    That is, during a period of "normal" demand, we would expect that the shadow cost of the space is set equal to
the actual cost of space in the market. During an aggregate demand peak, of course, is space is not adjustable, the
shadow cost of shelf space may be higher than the market rental rate.
                                                                                                  35
biased to make the cost savings look large, as the items in are study are generally "turned" more

than 12 times per year, and a doubling of demand in a month is much larger than the spikes that

we observe for any of our products. At an annual simple interest rate of 12%, the interest cost of

carrying inventory is 1% per month. The cost savings of turning over the inventory twice as fast,

then, amounts to a savings of about 0.5% over the one-month demand spike.              This is small

relative to the reductions in margins of about 5% on average that we find at holiday spikes for

our goods.



5. The behavior of wholesale prices over the cycle

        The acceptance or rejection of any particular model of retailer behavior does not narrow

down the set of possible theories governing manufacturer behavior. We know that the observed

price declines for goods at their seasonal demand peaks are at least partially the result of

declining retail margins for those goods.       However, these price declines could also be partially

due to changes in manufacturer margins or costs over the seasonal cycle.

        In Table 9, we examine changes in wholesale prices over the seasonal cycle. Changes in

wholesale prices are generally negative at demand peaks for a good; ten of the fourteen point

estimates are negative for the peak periods.        But only four of the estimates (beer in the hot

weather, snack crackers at Christmas, cooking soup at Thanksgiving and tuna at Lent) are

statistically different from zero at the 5% level. Moreover, most of the estimates are small, not

only in absolute terms, but also in relation to the retail margin changes. On balance, we read the

evidence as saying that manufacturer behavior plays a more limited role in the counter-

cyclicality of prices than retailer behavior.

        Because we lack data on manufacturer costs, we cannot definitively answer why

manufacturer prices show a tendency to fall at seasonal demand peaks for some of our products.
                                                                                                       36
These price drops could have many causes-- increasing returns to scale in production, tacit

collusion amongst manufacturers, or increased within-category price sensitivity at seasonal

demand peaks.

        Although all of these explanations are possible, we are disinclined to accept tacit

collusion amongst manufacturers as an explanation for the observed seasonality of wholesale

prices. The list of manufacturers participating in the cookies, crackers, and snack crackers

categories are virtually identical. Yet, the demand cycles for these products are not very well

synchronized. For example, the (de-trended) quantities sold of cookies is negatively correlated

with purchases of snack crackers and regular crackers, and the correlation between snack cracker

and regular cracker purchases is only 0.10.

        The logic of Bernheim and Whinston (1990) suggests that multi-market contact can

mitigate the counter-cyclical margins effect identified by Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) if the

demand peaks for goods are asynchronous. We illustrate this in our model of retailer behavior

above, but the same logic applies to manufacturers. One would expect that colluding

manufacturers who meet in several markets would face a significant temptation to cheat only

when aggregate demand across those markets is high.

         Yet, while wholesale prices for snack crackers decline 2.7% at Christmas, wholesale

prices for regular crackers increase a statistically significant 4.3%. If the counter-cyclicality of

manufacturer prices is due to countercyclical collusion, then manufacturers must be colluding on

a suboptimal product-by-product basis.



6. Seasonal Patterns in Price Elasticity

    One clear implication of the Warner-Barsky theory is that price sensitivity should vary

systematically with seasonal demand peaks. Consumers appear more price-sensitive due to
                                                                                                      37
increased search activity. Warner and Barsky suggest that this search activity occurs across

stores so that in periods of peak aggregate demand consumers are willing to shop more outlets.

In this case, the retailers would find it in their interest to cut margins. Alternatively, we could

also interpret the search explanation as applying to search within a category at a given store. If

so, this could lead manufacturers to compete with each other to have their products dealt. This

possibility means that we could expect to see price sensitivity increasing (and manufacturer

prices falling) when there is a peak in seasonal demand for a category even if that peak does not

coincide with peaks in aggregate grocery demand.

    While the heightened price sensitivity is central to the Warner and Barsky mechanism, the

Lal and Mantutes or Rotemberg-Saloner explanations do not require any seasonal variation in

price elasticity. To the extent to which time-varying price elasticities can be measured, we

should be able to use this to further discriminate between the Warner-Barsky view and the other

explanations.

        To estimate time-varying price elasticites, we employ a simple random coefficient

demand specification with store level data. We use category-level quantity and price indices in

this specification.


         lnq jt = α + α j + γ 'sjt + β p lnpjt + βthx Thx × lnp jt + βxm Xmas × l n pjt +
                 βhot Hot × lnp jt + βcoldCold × lnpjt + β lent Lent × l n pjt  + εjt       (11)
                                                                               
            α j ~ N ( 0, σα ) ; ε jt ~ N ( 0, σε )

where j is the store index, the terms in brackets are added only for those categories with weather-

or Lent-related expected demand peaks, and sjt is a vector of time trend variables and seasonal

variables. In this specification, we are exploiting variation in seasonal prices over calendar

years and over stores to estimate seasonal price elasticities. Importantly, the variation in

seasonal pricing across stores is mostly occurs because “normal” prices are set at (as many as)
                                                                                                       38
three levels, while promotions generally involve advertising that fixes the same price for a good

at all stores. Given the lower “regular” or long-run prices in the price zone designed to “fight”

discount stores, the price reduction from promotions at the seasonal frequency would be less than

in the other Dominick’s price zones.

        Table 10 provides the results of estimation of this random coefficient model. For all

categories, estimates of the change in price sensitivity at Thanksgiving and Christmas are

reported. For those categories with idiosyncratic peaks in demand such as the weather-sensitive

products, we also report estimates of the change in price sensitivity for these seasonal effects.

We present both the raw change in price sensitivity, a standard error and a percentage change in

sensitivity. Note that for the Hot and Cold variables, we consider a temperature change of 20

degrees in computing the implied change in price sensitivity.

        The results in table 10 provide very little support for the basic mechanism underlying the

Warner-Barsky theory. Only 5 of the 22 possible Thanksgiving/Christmas represent any

appreciable increases in price sensitivity with several instances of significant reductions in price

sensitivity. For the great majority of possibilities, there is no detectable large change in price

sensitivity. It should be emphasized that our store level data provides sufficient information to

estimate these coefficients quite precisely as revealed by the small standard errors.

        The results in table 10 should be interpreted with two caveats in mind: 1) we assume that

the regression errors are conditionally independent across stores and time and 2) we assume that

there is no correlation between the price variable and the regression error. The first assumption

seems reasonable in light of the random intercept specification that induces a pattern of

correlation across stores.

        The assumption of price exogeneity should be called into question in any situation in

which prices are set in anticipation of some common demand shock. For example, if retailers
                                                                                                     39
were aware of a manufacturer coupon drop at some future date, they might adjust prices. In our

situation, we are concerned with the possibility that price endogeneity would bias the price-

seasonal demand interaction terms reported in table 10. We are not concerned with biases in the

level of price elasticity but in the change in elasticity between the seasonal and non-seasonal

periods. Since we include seasonal dummies and temperature variables in (13), the simultaneity

problem can arise only if retailers (manufacturers) are exploiting year-to-year variation in the

nature of the seasonal demand shocks. That is, retailers can systematically cut prices on

Christmas without creating simultaneity bias; it is only if they can predict this particular

Christmas is going to have an unusually high or low demand and use this to inform the pricing

policy that simultaneity bias can occur. While we cannot eliminate the possibility that year-to-

year changes in the seasonal demand shocks occur, we think it unlikely that these are large

compared to the average level of seasonal shocks and the supply shocks that are identifying our

model. Moreover, it is hard to imagine that correction for endogeneity bias would change the

mixed nature of the results in table 10 in which we observe both large increases and decreases in

price sensitivity.



7. Seasonal patterns in advertising

         Our results thus far have been very consistent with a "loss-leader" model such as Lal and

Matutes (1994). But, this evidence has been indirect since it does not relate to advertising

activity. A key prediction of these models is that “loss leaders” will be items in relatively high

demand and that the prices of these items will be advertised. In an effort to more directly

corroborate the loss leader models, we explore DFF advertising.

         Hosken, Matsa, and Reiffen (2000) confirm this prediction by showing that high demand

items are more likely to be placed on sale. In our data set the most popular types of goods are
                                                                                                      40
also most prone to be advertised. For instance, among the 31 categories shown in Table 4, there

is a positive correlation between category-level sales and the fraction of goods sold on deal.

        More significantly, Table 11 confirms that advertising also varies with the seasonal cycle

in the accordance with the predictions of the loss leader models. Table 11 shows GLS regression

specifications in which the left hand side variable is the percentage of the category revenues

accounted for by items that are advertised by Dominick’s. The right hand side variables are our

usual temperature and holiday variables. The magnitudes can be interpreted as the change in the

percentage of the category on advertised special during the seasonal period.

        In general, seasonally peaking items are significantly more likely to be advertised. The

largest increase is for the snack cracker category, where an additional 34% of the category is put

on advertised deal. The main exceptions to the seasonality pattern are the failure of beer to be

advertised more in the hot weather than in the median temperature and the failure of soups to be

advertised more in the coldest weather than in the median temperature week (although soups are

significantly more likely to be advertised in the coldest weather than in the hottest weather).

Thus, there is some direct evidence in favor of the loss leader models.



8. Conclusions and further research

        Both the Warner and Barsky (1995) and Rotemberg and Saloner (1986) models have

gained currency in the macroeconomics literature as potential explanations for countercyclical

pricing. In this paper, we examine a sector of the economy that exhibits significant

countercyclical pricing over the seasonal cycle. High travel costs between stores and high

supermarket concentration ratios at the local level make it plausible a priori that either of these

imperfect competition models could explain pricing dynamics over the cycle. Nonetheless, we

find little support for these models in our dataset. In particular, contrary to the predictions of
                                                                                                        41
both models, we find that retail margins fall for foods at their seasonal demand peaks, even when

the demand peak is an idiosyncratic demand peak for the good rather than an aggregate demand

peak for the store. Furthermore, we show that prices do not fall in general at Christmas, the

largest aggregate demand spike and, indeed, appear to rise. Finally, with regards to the Warner

and Barsky (1995) model, we find no evidence that the elasticity of demand for the products in

our sample rises at seasonal demand peaks.

         Instead, we show that the data are more consistent with loss leader pricing. These

models can explain our finding of lower prices for those goods experiencing an idiosyncratic

demand peak. Our finding of increases in advertising for seasonally peaking items offers direct

support for models such as Lal and Matutes (1994) that emphasize the role of advertising in loss

leader pricing.

        While it remains to be seen whether the effects that we have found have any analogue at

business-cycle frequencies, our results at least suggest that retailer is not an neutral pass-through

from the manufacturer to the consumer. Since the important contribution of Hall (1988), the

literature on measuring markups and markup variation with macroeconomic data has focused on

differences in markups across manufacturing industries. For example, Rotemberg and Woodford

(1991) examine whether manufacturer concentration ratios are related to the degree of markup

cyclicality in final goods prices. However, the price dynamics of final goods may be strongly

influenced by the particular retail environments through which those goods pass. Furthermore, it

is not obvious that existing evidence from the literature about the behavior of markups will hold

constant as the level and type of retail competition is altered by changes in sales technology.

        Our paper finds clear evidence that retailers play a role in markup cyclicality. However,

we find more mixed evidence on the importance of manufacturers in generating counter-cyclical

prices. In subsequent work we hope to look more deeply at manufacturer behavior and attempt
                                                                                                    42
to determine whether the extent of the manufacturer response to a demand surge is a function of

the structure of the market for the product and the manufacturer's strategic position within that

market.

          Another direction for future work is to look more closely at the substitution patterns

amongst our goods. While it is widely recognized that substitution amongst goods could lead to

an upward bias in the cost of living as measured by price indices that allow limited substitution

across goods such as the Consumer Price Index, it is difficult to quantify this bias. Since our

data provide quantity as well as price data, we are well-positioned to examine the extent of

intertemporal and across-good substitution actually induced by the high-frequency price changes

that characterize our data.

Data Appendix:

We used 4 general principles in forming the “aggregates” (i.e. the bundles of UPCs that would be treated as a
composite good) within each category. We begin by discussing these principles and then comment on any
particularly relevant considerations for each category.

First, we wanted to make sure that the leading items within each category would be included in the analysis. This
was done by calculating the market shares of the individual UPCs and then trying to include as many of the top 10
UPCs as possible, subject to the other constraints discussed below.

Second, we chose the groupings so that all pairwise cross-correlations of the price movements within each aggregate
would be quite high. Except in the two cases described below, we never bundled UPCs whose cross-correlation was
below 0.7. In almost all the aggregates the correlations were above 0.85.

Third, we sought form our aggregates to bundle the UPCs according to a couple of key characteristics. The identity
of the manufacturer was always one of the characteristics, and we never aggregated across manufacturers, although
we often had several aggregates for the same manufacturer. A second consideration was package size. In most
cases we grouped only identical or very similar sizes. When we did use non-identical sizes we sometimes rescaled
the prices to move the prices within an aggregate closer together – as explained earlier this can be important if an
observation on any of the items in an aggregate are missing. A third factor was the style of the good (e.g. low fat,
extra-strength, lemon-scented, etc.). Using just these traits we were able to form aggregates that we believe are both
homogenous and simple to describe.

Finally, we used our judgment to make sure that there was some diversity in the selection of items whenever we
believed that a category was heterogeneous. In many cases this meant that we sometimes built aggregates that
would capture a premium or discount good whose pricing might differ from the market leader. Including these
niche items with potentially low market shares meant that we occasionally omitted other potential groupings with
higher market shares but whose behavior is likely to have been very similar to the behavior of other aggregates in
the analysis.

The following table summarizes the basic characteristics of the items.

The following particular choices were made for the categories.

Analgesics: The two UPCs within the top ten that are not included were Tylenol 100 count extra strength tablets
and Dominick’s 100 count coated aspirin. The Tylenol was the 5th largest selling upc, but we already had the 100
count caplet as a solo item in an aggregate and we opted not to have a second solo item aggregate. The Dominick’s
aspirin was the 10th largest upc, but the only other large-selling Dominick’s aspirin was a 500 count bottle and did
not want to bundle these two items since the price per tablet was likely to be quite different (which would cause
problems when one item or the other was missing.) Instead we formed an aggregate around the 12th largest upc,
Dominick’s 100 count ibuprofen, which allowed us to bundle caplets and tablets. We also rescaled all of the prices
in this category to be on a per-100 count basis.

Beer: All 10 of the top 10 UPCs are included. The cross-correlations within the Miller, Budweiser, and Heineken
aggregates are all above 0.97 – in some of these aggregates we opted to exclude ‘Ice” beers from the aggregates
because the cross-correlations were noticeably lower (even though they may have been above 0.7.) Since the shares
of the Ice beers are so low even the weeks where they we being sold this would make little difference to the results.
The main difficulty in this category is the treatment of the Old Style aggregate that we described in the text. All but
two of the cross-correlations below 0.85 in the category come from the low correlations between the Old Style 24
packs and 30 packs, which co-exist only occasionally.

Cookies: All 10 of the largest UPCs are included. All but two of the cross-correlations that were below 0.85 are in
the Pepperidge Farms aggregate that has 17 types of cookies (but still only a total share of 1.4%). We built this
aggregate to add diversity to the category. In the Fig Newton aggregate (coo7) we rescaled prices to be on a 16
ounce basis. In the Keebler aggregate (coo5) we rescaled prices to be on an 18 ounce basis. As described below,
the Snackwell brand cookies (and several other types of cookies) were classified by Dominick’s as crackers. We
moved these items into the cookie category and computed market shares according to this expanded definition of the
category.

Crackers: Nine of the top 10 UPCs are included. The omitted one is the eighth highest seller and is a small-sized (8
ounce) Nabisco Saltine cracker that did not aggregate with the larger size. We already had several other single item
aggregates, two saltine aggregates, and two Nabisco aggregates, so we chose not to include this item.

This category had to be reconstructed from the original Dominick’s category because we found a number of
inconsistencies in the way in which items were allocated between crackers and snack crackers. For instance,
Dominick’s put some items with different size packages into different categories. We reviewed all the UPCs in the
original Dominick’s categories and assigned them to our re-constituted cookie, cracker, and snack cracker
categories. The majority of our reclassification involved creating more homogenous categories for crackers and
snack crackers. The items transferred to the cookie category were identified based on words like "sweet" or
"chocolate" appearing in the description. For instance, all Snackwell's brand cookies had been classified into
crackers. The separation between crackers and snack crackers is a little less well-defined. We included saltines,
graham crackers and oyster crackers in crackers. All other crackers (Ritz, Triscuit, etc.) were included in snack
crackers.

Canned Soup: Nine of the top 10 UPCs are included. The missing one is number 10, a campbell’s vegetarian
vegetable soup which was not highly correlated with the other campbell’s soups. All but 5 of the cross-correlations
below 0.85 are in two large campbell’s aggregates (campbell’s chunky, and campbell’s other chicken which have 10
and 13 UPCs respectively.) By skipping the Campbells vegetarian vegetable we made room for a Swanson broth
aggregate and a Progresso bean aggregate.

Liquid dish detergent: Nine of the top 10 UPCs are included. The item is the tenth largest seller, 42 ounce Joy Dish
Detergent. We excluded this item because it could not be grouped with any of the higher share items and we already
had both a 22 ounce Joy aggregate and two 42 ounce aggregates by other manufacturers (Dawn and Ivory). For both
the Dawn and Ivory 42 ounce aggregates we included some UPCs that existed for only a few weeks. These UPCs
did not have high cross-correlations correlations with the main UPCs in the aggregates, but we included them
nonetheless because this seemed to be an artifact of the short period of overlap with the main UPCs. The market
share data we use is for this category comes from eliminating all the items in the full detergent category which were
                                                                                                                    47
intended for use in dishwashing machines. We eliminated these machine detergents based on the manufacturer
(cascade, jet dry are always dropped) and the upc description (dropping any items where the description included the
words “auto”, “gel”, or “powder”).

Oatmeal: All 10 of the top UPCs are included. By building around these top 10 we are able to capture 70 percent of
the market and yet did not have a single cross-correlation in any of the aggregates below 0.85. In the Quaker Instant
Oat aggregate (Oat5) we re-scaled the prices to be per 12.5 ounces.

Snack Crackers: Nine of the top 10 UPCs are included. The omitted item is a Ritz Bits Peanut Butter Sandwich
which we believed was not actually a snack cracker. We did include several type of crackers with lower market
shares (Sunshine Cheeze-its, Pepperidge Farm Goldfish, Keebler Clubs, and Nabisco Socialables) that added
diversity to the aggregates. As mentioned above, our snack cracker category was formed by combining the original
Dominick’s cracker and snack cracker categories

Canned Tuna: Seven of the top 10 UPCs are included. The omitted UPCs are the 8th through 10th best selling UPCs.
The first of these is a 6.12 ounce Star Kist variety, whose prices does not closely co-vary with the other top-selling
Star Kist UPCs. Rather than create a second Star Kist aggregate we opted to drop this upc. The 9th and 10th best
sellers were large cans (12+ ounces) which did not have any other UPCs that either could be bundled with. We had
already included created one single item aggregate of this type using the best-selling large can (12.2 ounce Bumble
Bee) so we skipped these UPCs. Instead we formed an aggregate around the 12th best selling item, which was the
house brand and could be grouped with several other UPCs to form a relatively large aggregate. The market share
statistics we calculated by excluding all of the UPCs in Dominick’s canned seafood category that did not include the
word “tuna” in the description.

Cheese: All 10 of the largest UPCs are included. The Dominick’s cheese category also includes sliced cheeses
which have a very different seasonal pattern. So we removed any cheeses that had the word “sliced” in the
description. The seasonal purchase patterns for the remaining cooking and snack cheeses appeared to be quite
similar.

Notes:

1) Neoclassical demand theory: The zeros correspond to the possibility of perfect competition with constant returns to scale

2) Rotemberg and Saloner: The idiosyncratic demand shocks should be irrelevant for retailers because they will not initiate price wars unless total spending
is high; the negative wholesale margins prediction arises because the demand spikes make it impossible for the wholesalers to maintain collusion.

3) Warner and Barsky: The idiosyncratic demand shocks should be irrelevant for retailers because such spikes do not tempt customers to shop a second
store; the wholesalers might cut margins if they believe consumers become more price elastic when buying many units, hence they fight to have their
product dealt.
