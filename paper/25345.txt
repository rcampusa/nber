                                          ABSTRACT

In the first half of the twentieth century, the rate of death from infectious disease in the United
States fell precipitously. Although this decline is well-known and well-documented, there is
surprisingly little evidence about whether it took place uniformly across the regions of the U.S.
We use data on infectious disease deaths from all reporting U.S. cities to describe regional
patterns in the decline of urban infectious mortality from 1900 to 1948. We report three main
results: First, urban infectious mortality was higher in the South in every year from 1900 to 1948.
Second, infectious mortality declined later in southern cities than in cities in the other regions.
Third, comparatively high infectious mortality in southern cities was driven primarily by
extremely high infectious mortality among African Americans. From 1906 to 1920, African
Americans in cities experienced a rate of death from infectious disease greater than what urban
whites experienced during the 1918 flu pandemic.

   In the first half of the twentieth century, the rate of death from infectious disease
in the United States (U.S.) fell precipitously. Although this decline is well-known and
well-documented (Armstrong et al. 1999; Haines 2001; Cutler et al. 2006), there is
surprisingly little evidence about whether it took place uniformly across the regions
of the U.S. In this article, we use data on infectious disease deaths from all reporting
U.S. cities to describe regional patterns in the decline of urban infectious mortality
from 1900 to 1948.
   The fall in infectious mortality in the first half of the twentieth century was one
of the last phases of what public health scholars call the epidemiological transition.
Starting in the eighteenth century, mortality rates in the U.S. and Europe began to
fall and life expectancy began to rise. Life expectancy in the United States increased
by nearly 20 years between 1900 and 1948 alone (Carter et al. 2006, p. 1-440–1-441).
Some scholars attribute the initial drop in mortality to improved nutrition (McKeown
and Record 1962, p. 115; Fogel 2004), but others emphasize the introduction of public
health initiatives instead (Szreter 1988). Improvement in public health has been the
leading explanation for the decline in mortality after 1870 (Cutler et al. 2006; Haines
2001, p. 45; but see Anderson et al. 2018). Cutler et al. (2006, p. 102) divide
public health interventions into large public works projects like water filtration and
chlorination (Cutler and Miller 2005), sanitation infrastructure (Alsan and Goldin
2018; Melosi 1999), milk pasteurization (Lee 2007), and mass vaccinations, on the
one hand, and changes in behavior promoted by the public sector, such as “boiling
bottles and milk, protecting food from insects, washing hands, ventilating rooms and
keeping children’s vaccinations up to date,” on the other. After 1930, the introduction
of antibiotics played an important role (Smith and Bradshaw 2008).
   Cities led the way in the fight against death from infectious disease. In 1900,
mortality rates were higher in cities than in rural areas. By midcentury, the opposite
was true (Haines 2001). As deaths from infectious disease fell, they made up a smaller


                                           1
proportion of total urban deaths. In 1900, a median 37% of urban deaths were due
to infectious causes; by 1948, this figure had fallen to 6%.
       A small number of studies have used city-level data to study mortality in the first
half of the twentieth century.1 Crimmins and Condran (1983) report regional differ-
ences in deaths from several diseases in 1900 using data from 129 cities. They find
that southern cities had the highest mortality rates at the turn of the century. Con-
dran and Crimmins-Gardner (1978) show that the extent of sewers and waterworks
in 28 cities in 1900 was negatively correlated with mortality rates in middle to old age
groups, although these results varied by region. The correlations between cities’ use
of sewers and waterworks and their death rates from typhoid and diarrheal diseases,
moreover, were weak. Cutler and Miller (2005), in contrast, find that the introduc-
tion of clean-water technologies was responsible for nearly half of the total mortality
decline in thirteen cities from 1900 to 1936.2 Ferrie and Troesken (2008) report sim-
ilar results using data from Chicago from 1850 to 1925. Anderson et al. (2017) show
that municipal reporting requirements and the opening of state-run sanatoriums re-
duced the rate of death from pulmonary tuberculosis, although other aspects of the
tuberculosis movement had no discernible effect.
       Although some previous research has used samples of cities to study declines in
total, infant, and cause-specific mortality, none has documented regional variation
in infectious mortality over time using data on all cities for which it is available.
Consequently, we know very little about how much the urban infectious mortality
decline varied across regions. Studying regional variation in deaths from infectious
disease may help to direct research on the causes of the decline. The regions of
the U.S. varied in the compositions and densities of their populations, their climates
   1
     Using state-level Vital Statistics, Moehling and Thomasson (2014) find that home nurse visits,
spending on health and sanitation, and the establishment of health centers reduced infant mortality
from 1924 to 1929.
   2
     Using a larger sample of cities, Anderson et al. (2018) find that these technologies reduced
typhoid mortality, as reported by Cutler and Miller (2005), but had a much smaller effect on total
mortality.


                                                2
and disease environments, and the extent of the public health interventions they
introduced. Observing variation in infectious mortality over space gives researchers
a warrant to search for causes of the decline that vary from city to city and region to
region. In an influential review essay on the urban mortality transition in the United
States, Haines (2001, p. 47) concludes, “There is a need to look at more disaggregated
data (e.g., states, counties, and specific cities).”
   There are two common ways to measure the decline in infectious mortality. One
is to examine year-to-year volatility in life expectancy and mortality. When deaths
from infectious disease make up a large proportion of all deaths, waves of infectious
disease influence the total mortality rate (Deaton 2013, p. 63; Meeker 1971, p. 359).
Smith and Bradshaw (2006, 2008) take this approach, showing that yearly variation
in period life expectancy narrowed substantially in the 1940s. The second approach,
which we use here, is to measure mortality from infectious diseases directly. We use
historical data on deaths by cause to estimate the rate of infectious mortality in all
reporting U.S. cities. To construct the data set we use for this analysis, we digitized
49 years of death-by-cause data for all reporting cities, classified causes as infectious
or not, and indirectly age-standardized the data using a separate series of death-by-
cause-and-age data and newly-available complete-count census data (Ruggles et al.
2018).3
   We restrict our analysis to cities to ensure that we compare like with like. There
was a clear urban penalty in mortality at the beginning of the twentieth century
(Higgs 1973; Condran and Crimmins 1980; Haines 2001; Cain and Hong 2009). Using
other units of analysis, such as states, could lead us to mistake differences in the ur-
banization of regions for other regional differences.4 Condran and Crimmins (1980, p.
   3
     The complete-count census data cover the decennial censuses from 1900 to 1940 and come from
IPUMS-USA at the University of Minnesota. Without the very recent release of complete-count
census data with clean city and age variables, our analysis would not have been possible.
   4
     For instance, Boustan and Margo (2016, p. 734) point out that national black life expectancy
estimates derived from Vital Statistics data in the early twentieth century are likely understated
because they are based primarily on northern states, whose black residents predominantly lived in

202) argue that “differentiation of space by rural and urban characteristics is essential
to understanding the decline in mortality.” States also varied in the completeness of
death registration within them (Condran and Crimmins 1980, p. 186).
   We report three main results. First, urban infectious mortality was higher in the
South in every year from 1900 to 1948. The higher rate of death from infectious disease
in southern cities in 1900, originally documented by Crimmins and Condran (1983),
lasted at least through mid-century. Second, urban infectious mortality declined
later in the South than in the other regions: deaths from infectious disease fell at an
accelerated pace in cities outside the South in the early 1930s; a steeper decline in the
South began instead in the late 1930s. Finally, the regional differences we document
were driven mainly by the extremely high risk of infectious mortality among African
Americans, who made up a far larger share of the southern urban population than
the urban population of other regions throughout this period.
   Research in history, economic history, and demography has documented how bar-
riers that African Americans faced in acquiring safe housing (Du Bois 1908; Galishoff
1985; Acevedo-Garcia 2000; Collins and Thomasson 2004; Roberts 2009; Boustan and
Margo 2016; Eriksson and Niemesh 2016; Zelner et al. 2017), accessing urban social
programs (Preston and Haines 1991) and medical innovations (Jayachandran et al.
2010), and establishing economic security (Ewbank 1987) put them at greater risk
of death from infectious disease (Sen 1998). Our results point to a need for more
research in this area. The risk of death from infectious disease among urban African
Americans was so high that it was primarily responsible for regional differences in the
infectious mortality of all residents of U.S. cities.

Data

To measure regional and city-level mortality from infectious disease, we digitized and
standardized a variety of historical records. In this section, we describe the data we
collected, how we classified causes of death, and how we age standardized the data.
       We digitized city-level data on the number of deaths by cause from published
volumes of the Vital Statistics of the United States.5 States and cities were not legally
required to register deaths until 1933 (Haines 2006, p. 381). However, starting in
1900, ten states and the District of Columbia made up an official Death Registration
Area (DRA), which grew to cover the entire country by 1933 (Haines 2006, p. 381).
Between 1900 and 1933, cities gradually enter our dataset as they entered the DRA,
often before their entire state entered. In 1900, the DRA contained 332 cities; by
1948, that number had grown to 1,044.6
       The DRA data enable us to study in fine detail the decline in deaths from infectious
disease in U.S. cities. However, the urban mortality decline should not be considered
representative of the national mortality decline. In 1900, child mortality was much
higher in the DRA than it was in the entire nation (Preston and Haines 1991, p.
86). Moreover, regional differences in total mortality in 1900 differed from regional
differences in urban mortality. For instance, the South as a whole had a relatively low
child mortality rate in 1900, but this rate was pushed up by the high child mortality
rate of its black population and pushed down by its rurality (Preston and Haines
1991, p. 111). The urban child mortality rate of the South—excluding the region’s
rural areas—was much higher.
       Reporting infectious mortality rates entails classifying causes of death as infectious
or not. This is more complicated than it may first appear. In some cases, such as
   5
     We were able to minimize errors in our digitization by checking that cause-specific deaths sum
to total deaths in each city and each year.
   6
     Our own panel ranges from 329 to 982 cities due to data restrictions described below and in
Appendix A.1. In Figure A.4, we map the cities in our sample within their corresponding regions.



                                                5
“childbirth deaths,” the cause-of-death categories used in the Vital Statistics leave
ambiguous whether the cause was infectious or not. We code causes conservatively,
excluding from our infectious counts categories that mix infectious and non-infectious
causes.7 Wherever possible, we follow the infectious classifications used in Armstrong
et al. (1999).8
    There are two additional challenges to constructing a consistent series of infectious
mortality. The first is that the Vital Statistics updated its cause-of-death reporting
with each new International List of Causes of Death (ICD).9 Some ICD changes were
more extensive than others. Fortunately, the ICD revisions made from 1900 to 1948
are relatively small: the earliest extensive change was the sixth revision in 1948,
which was adopted in the 1949 Vital Statistics (Moriyama et al. 2011; International
Institute for Vital Registration and Statistics 1993). For this reason, we end our
series in 1948. The second challenge is the coarseness of cause-of-death categories
in the city-level Vital Statistics data. Often, specific causes of death listed in the
ICD codes are grouped into coarser categories at the city level. Usually the Vital
Statistics changed its coarser categories only when the ICD codes changed. This
magnifies the differences between ICD coding regimes in our data. In most of our
    7
      The most consequential of these categories is rheumatism and rheumatic fever. In our main
results, we exclude these causes, but in Figure A.2 in the Appendix we reproduce our results with
both causes classified as infectious. Reassuringly, Figure A.2 is nearly indistinguishable from our
main result reported in Figure 1b. Acute rheumatic fever is the only infectious cause that we exclude
even when it is reported separately from non-infectious diseases (chronic rheumatism and gout)
because rheumatism and rheumatic fever move back and forth between being reported separately
and in a combined category and because deaths from these causes combined made up a relatively
large share of total deaths. The median death rate from “rheumatism” in 1910, when the category
first appears, was 7 per 100,000.
    8
      Specifically, we classify the following causes of death as infectious: Appendicitis, Assorted
infectious, epidemic, or parasitic causes, Bronchitis, Diarrhea, Diphtheria, Erysipelas, Influenza,
Malaria, Measles, Meningitis, Pneumonia, Polio, Puerperal fever, Scarlet fever, Septicemia, Small-
pox, Syphilis, Tuberculosis, and Whooping Cough. Not all of these causes appeared in every year
of the Vital Statistics we used, and many appeared in multiple variants (e.g., specific forms of
tuberculosis).
    9
      The ICD provides standardized guidelines for coding causes of death. The first ICD was devel-
oped by Jacques Bertillon in 1893 and adopted by many countries. Now called the International
Classification of Diseases, it has subsequently been revised many times to incorporate changes in
terminology and medical knowledge (Anderson 2011, p. 472–473). ICD revisions were implemented
uniformly across cities in the Vital Statistics.


                                                 6
analysis, we are concerned with differences in the rate of infectious mortality across
regions within years. In those parts of our analysis where we focus instead on the
pace of the infectious mortality decline, we break the data into periods corresponding
to the ICD coding regimes to minimize the effect of changes in the classification of
deaths on our results. In these parts of the analysis, we also exclude 1918–1920,
the flu pandemic years. This yields five periods corresponding roughly to decades:
1900–1909; 1910–1917; 1921–1929; 1930–1938; and 1939–1948.
   In some cases, the Vital Statistics changed the way it grouped causes even within
ICD regimes. This occurred in 1904, 1905, and each year from 1936 to 1944, excluding
1939, when a new ICD took effect. For instance, puerperal fever/puerperal septicemia
is coded as a distinct cause of death from 1910 to 1942, but it is collapsed into the
general “childbirth” category from 1900 to 1909 and from 1943 to 1948. The 1910
shift coincides with a shift in the ICD regime, but the 1943 shift takes place within
the 1939–1948 regime. Because the Vital Statistics made so many changes to the
coarse categories of death it reported from 1936 to 1944, it is impossible to create
periods with no changes in the categories. But dividing the data at the ICD changes
ensures that the most consequential changes in the classification of death occurred
between intervals.
   Because infectious mortality is almost always highest at very young and very
old ages, it is possible that differences in infectious mortality across regions or time
periods actually reflect differences in how much of a region’s population is very young
or very old. To estimate regional differences in infectious mortality over and above
regional differences in the age distribution, we report infectious mortality rates that
are indirectly age-standardized. We construct a standard age structure of infectious
mortality based on urban age-specific mortality data in the years 1922-1933 and use
that schedule to predict the “expected” infectious mortality of each city-year based
on its age schedule. This procedure is described in detail in Appendix A.1. The main


                                           7
outcome in the figures and regressions below is the log of the ratio of actual to expected
infectious mortality in each city-year, a ratio known as the “comparative mortality
ratio.” An unlogged comparative mortality ratio of 1.5, for example, reflects infectious
mortality 50% above what we would expect given a city’s age distribution and a
standardized mortality schedule. For simplicity, we refer to the logged comparative
mortality ratio as “infectious mortality.”



Results

Southern cities differed from cities in other regions in both their rate of infectious
mortality and in when that rate declined. But the South’s distinctiveness had less
to do with causes affecting all residents of southern cities than with the fact that
southern cities were populated by greater proportions of black residents, who suffered
extreme risks of death from infectious disease in cities in all regions.


Urban infectious mortality was higher in the South every year

from 1900 to 1948

In Figure 1, we plot median infectious mortality in the four census regions. The first
panel, Figure 1a, shows the raw infectious mortality rate per 100,000 people. The
most notable feature of the plot is that the urban South’s infectious mortality rate
exceeded that of the other regions for the entire period. Only in the 1940s were there
signs of convergence.


                                 [Figure 1 about here.]


   In 1900, the beginning of our series, the median infectious death rate in southern
cities was 1,053 per 100,000—almost twice that of midwestern cities (529 per 100,000).



                                             8
It took at least twenty years for the urban South to cut its rate of death from in-
fectious disease to what the urban Midwest’s was at the beginning of the twentieth
century.10 To make the South’s infectious mortality rate in 1900 comparable to that
of the Midwest in the same year, we would have to remove all southern deaths from
tuberculosis (the top killer in 1900), menigitis, and malaria combined.
       In 1948, the urban South still had a higher infectious mortality rate than the other
regions, with a median death rate of 102 per 100,000, compared to 58, 61, and 72
in the Northeast, Midwest, and West, respectively. Infectious mortality in southern
cities could be made comparable to infectious mortality in midwestern cities only by
excluding southern deaths from tuberculosis (the second-biggest killer in 1948) and
diarrhea. But the general convergence across regions, and the greater pace of decline
in the 1940s, meant that the urban South was many fewer years behind in 1948 than it
had been at the beginning of the twentieth century. The burden of infectious mortality
in southern cities in 1948 is very similar to that of midwestern cities just seven years
earlier. The lag between southern and midwestern cities’ infectious mortality declined
by about one third of one year per year between the beginning and the endpoint of
our series.
       To check that our results do not simply reflect regional differences in the age
distribution, the logged comparative mortality ratios shown in Figure 1b describe, in
a proportional scale, age-standardized mortality. The comparative mortality ratios
(unlogged) in 1900 range from a median of 1.7 in the Midwest, reflecting infectious
mortality 70% above what we would expect given midwestern cities’ age distributions
and a standardized mortality schedule derived from age-specific mortality in 1925,
  10
    In our series, the southern median urban infectious death rate exceeded the 1900 urban mid-
western median in every year from 1900 to 1920. However, there is a sharp break between 1920
and 1921, in which infectious mortality appeared to fall in all regions, coincident with a change in
ICD codes. (For example, meningitis was reported separately before 1921 but collapsed into “all
other causes” afterward.) Some of this apparent mortality decline likely reflected the ICD change,
although some likely reflected the resurgence of influenza in 1920. We say that the regional differ-
ence in 1900 represented “at least” twenty years of the southern mortality decline to come because
mortality in all regions might have been higher in years after 1920 absent the ICD change.


                                                 9
to 3.4 in southern cities, or infectious mortality nearly three and a half times what
southern cities’ age structures would predict. In 1900, southern cities’ standardized
infectious mortality, like their raw infectious mortality rate, was about double that
of midwestern cities. By 1948, midwestern cities had infectious mortality only 18%
of what their age structures would predict from the standardized mortality schedule,
and southern cities’ infectious mortality had fallen to 30% of what their age structures
would predict, about 1.7 times the standardized midwestern rate.
       Does the fact that our sample changes as new cities entered the DRA affect our
results? Figure 1c addresses this question. Instead of using an unbalanced panel
of cities, as in Figure 1b, here we reproduce our results using a balanced panel of
cities for which we have data in all years.11 Despite the smaller sample size, including
just fourteen southern cities, the broad pattern of our results remains very similar:
southern urban infectious mortality continues to be higher than that of the other
regions, but converges considerably by 1948.


Infectious mortality declined later in southern cities than in

cities in the other regions

The urban South differed from the other regions not only it its level of infectious
mortality, but also in the timing of its infectious mortality decline. The pace of
the infectious mortality decline in cities in the other three regions was gradual and
constant from 1900 to 1930, accelerating from 1930 through the end of the series.
The urban South’s decline, in contrast, stayed gradual until the late 1930s, when it
became much sharper than that of the other regions.
       Figure 2 gives a more detailed look at the data, allowing us to see more clearly how
the pace of the infectious mortality decline varied across regions. Each dot represents

   We report the sample sizes for all panels in Appendix A.3. Some cities exit and re-enter the full

one city-year observation, with darker dots indicating the median city in each year.
Here we divide the data into the five periods described above, each corresponding to
an ICD regime. We draw linear trends within each period. The figure makes especially
apparent the sharp discontinuity in the fall of infectious mortality in southern cities
after the late 1930s.


                                    [Figure 2 about here.]


       To examine the timing of the decline more formally, we fit a simple regression
model, regressing log age-standardized infectious mortality on region indicators and
the interaction of region and year trends, clustering the standard errors at the city
level.12 Figure 3a plots the region indicators. Dots represent the mean infectious
mortality in each region in each period. Bars plot 95% confidence intervals. Look-
ing down the figure, the regional means move gradually to the left, indicating the
infectious mortality decline across all regions. The urban South’s distinctively high
infectious mortality stands out in this figure: despite the dramatic decline in infectious
mortality in the South in the 1939–1948 period, southern cities still lagged behind
cities in other regions at midcentury.

       Figure 3b plots the slope coefficients, measuring the pace of the decline within each
region and ICD regime. Here, the gradual infectious mortality decline through the
late 1920s is particularly salient. Across all periods from 1900 to 1929, the (unlogged)
annual declines in the mean comparative mortality ratio ranged from 0.7% in the 1920s
urban South to 3.6% in the 1920s urban Northeast. The northeastern, midwestern,
and western slopes grew sharper in the 1930s. But most notable is the distinctive

pattern of the decline in southern cities: compared to the other regions, infectious
mortality in the urban South fell most gradually in the 1930–1938 period, but most
sharply in the 1939–1948 period, with an annual decline in the comparative mortality
ratio of 10.1%.
       The broad timing of the 1930s decline across all regions in our data is consistent
with previous studies. Catillon et al. (2018), for instance, document a trend break in
1936 using national data on influenza and pneumonia mortality. Jayachandran et al.
(2010) find that sulfa drugs reduced maternal mortality by 24–36 percent, pneumonia
mortality by 17–32 percent, and scarlet fever mortality by 52–65 percent from 1937
to 1943. These diseases accounted for about 12 percent of total mortality in the
pre-sulfa period.


High infectious mortality in southern cities was driven pri-

marily by extremely high infectious mortality among African

Americans

In Figure 4, we show that the regional differences documented in Figures 1, 2, and 3
primarily reflect differences in the urban infectious mortality of African Americans and
whites.13 African Americans in cities across the United States often lived in segregated
and crowded housing (Du Bois 1908; Galishoff 1985; Acevedo-Garcia 2000; Collins and
Thomasson 2004; Roberts 2009; Grigoryeva and Ruef 2015; Eriksson and Niemesh
2016; Zelner et al. 2017), had high poverty rates (Ewbank 1987), and were prevented
from accessing many urban social programs (Preston and Haines 1991) and medical
innovations (Jayachandran et al. 2010), all of which increased their susceptibility to
  13
    The Vital Statistics report mortality for whites and nonwhites, but in this period nonwhites
overwhelmingly were African American. In all years except 1930-1934, “Mexicans” were classified
as white (United States Department of Commerce 1941, p. 2). The change in the classification of
“Mexicans” had a minimal effect on the nonwhite mortality rates of the North, Midwest, and South.
In the West, it causes a spike in nonwhite infectious mortality from 1930 to 1934, visible in Figure
4c.

                                   [Figure 4 about here.]


       The sample of cities for which the Vital Statistics reports deaths by cause sepa-
rately for whites and nonwhites is smaller than the full sample we used to generate
Figures 1, 2, and 3. These data span the years 1906 to 1942, excluding 1938. Black
urban mortality remained high throughout the period; it took until 1939 for it to fall
to the median infectious mortality of urban whites in 1906. Figure 4a plots logged
comparative mortality ratios for all groups in this smaller sample. As in Figure 1,
southern mortality exceeds that of the other regions and sharply declines in the late
1930s. In Figures 4b and 4c, we examine infectious mortality among whites and non-
whites separately. The regional differences reported in Figures 1, 2, and 3 are much
less pronounced when we examine infectious mortality among whites and nonwhites
alone. The lagging decline in urban infectious mortality in the South appears to be
less a consequence of causes of death that affected all urban southerners than of causes
that especially threatened the life chances of black city dwellers, irrespective of what
region they lived in.14 In the non-southern regions, the median percent nonwhite in
cities in our full panel ranged from half a percent to 4%; in the South, it fell from
37% in 1900 to 22% in 1940. Still, it is notable that white urban infectious mortality
in the South exceeded that of the other regions from the late 1920s to the late 1930s.
This may reflect the relative poverty of the region’s white residents.
       Most striking, however, is how much higher infectious mortality was among ur-
ban African Americans than it was among urban whites. Nationally, the (unlogged)
median comparative mortality ratio for whites from 1906 to 1920 ranged from 1.4 to
a peak of 3.0 at the height of the flu pandemic. The (unlogged) median comparative
mortality ratio for nonwhites, in contrast, never fell below 3.1. African Americans in

   According to Troesken (2004, p. 39), northern and southern cities had similar rates of public
water and sewer connections in the early twentieth century.

cities faced such a high risk of death from infectious disease that it is as if they lived
through the flu pandemic experienced by urban whites in every year from 1906 to
1920.15
       National medians smooth over volatility in infectious mortality that is more ap-
parent at lower levels of aggregation. Median urban nonwhite mortality between
1906 and 1920 exceeded median urban white mortality in 1918 in 15 of 15 years in
the Midwest, 9 of 15 years in the Northeast, 15 of 15 years in the West, and 13 of 15
years in the South.
       How much of the regional disparity in urban infectious mortality is driven by the
racial composition of each region? To quantify this, we decompose the difference
                                                                                            s   n

two components, given in Equation (1) (Preston et al. 2000, p. 28–30):

       The first term reflects the contribution that regional differences in the racial com-

This term represents the difference between racial group i ’s share of the population

      Although median infectious mortality among African Americans from 1906 to 1920 was higher
than that among whites during the flu pandemic, the age pattern in deaths during the flu pandemic
was unique. Infectious mortality is usually highest among the very young and the very old, but
the flu pandemic killed many people in the prime of their life (Noymer 2009). As discussed above,
between 1920 and 1921, a change in the cause of death coding made infectious mortality appear to
fall in all groups; median nonwhite comparative mortality ratios are 3.3 in 1920 but 2.4 in 1921 and
remain below 2.8 for the remainder of the series. Some of the infectious mortality decline between
1920 and 1921 likely also reflects the resurgence of influenza in 1920.
   16
      Both the racial population shares, csi (t) and cni (t), and the race-specific mortality rates, msi (t)
and mni (t), are calculated as unweighted means across cities.

ferences in racial-group-specific mortality make to the regional difference in infectious
mortality. This term represents the difference between the average city’s infectious
mortality in the South and the average city’s infectious morality in the non-South for
each racial group i, msi (t) − mni (t), weighted by racial group i ’s average share of the

       The difference between the racial composition of cities in the South and the non-
South is responsible for most of the difference between infectious mortality in the
South and the non-South over our period. Figure 5 shows these results, plotting
the compositional component (the first decomposition term) as a proportion of the
total southern excess.17 When this proportion exceeds .5, compositional differences
account for most of the difference between infectious mortality in the South and
the non-South. Across years, the racial composition of the population contributes a
median proportion of .58 of the total southern excess mortality and more than half
of the total in two-thirds of the years we study.

       Like Figures 1a and 1b, Figures 4 and 5 are based on an unbalanced panel of
cities. The sample of cities for which we have data for whites and nonwhites in every
year from 1906 to 1942, excluding 1938, is small and predominantly southern. In
Figure 6, we plot city-specific trends in infectious mortality in the cities for which we
have data for whites and nonwhites in at least 30 years. The dashed line indicates
median infectious mortality during the 1918 flu pandemic among urban whites in
cities present in the data for at least 30 years. As shown in the right panel, in many
cities, infectious mortality among nonwhites from 1906 to 1920 was comparable to

    The racial composition measures are generated from IPUMS population measures, which in
some cases generate city population totals that differ from published city population totals. In each
city in our racial-group-specific sample, these discrepancies never exceed 2.5% in either direction.
When we generate the proportions shown in Figure 5, we estimate the total regional difference as
the sum of the two decomposition terms so that a consistent population size is used in the numerator
and denominator of this proportion.

Conclusion

In this article, we document regional variation in the decline in urban infectious
mortality in the United States. The decline in total mortality in the United States
in the first half of the twentieth century is well known, but regional variation in both
the level of infectious mortality and changes in it is not. Our results point to three
main conclusions.
       First, the level of infectious mortality in southern cities exceeded that of cities in
other regions for the entirety of our study period. Previous research documented that
southern cities had comparatively high rates of death in 1900 (Crimmins and Condran
1983). We show that these differences lasted at least until midcentury. Second,
southern cities differed from cities in other regions not only in their levels of infectious
mortality, but also in the timing of their infectious mortality decline. Infectious
mortality in northeastern, midwestern, and western cities gradually declined until
the early 1930s, then declined more steeply. In southern cities, a sharper fall in
infectious mortality did not take place until the late 1930s.
       Third, and most strikingly, southern cities’ distinctiveness can be explained pri-
marily by the fact that African Americans, who suffered extremely high risks of death
from infectious disease in cities in all regions, made up a comparatively large share of
their populations. Until 1920, median infectious mortality among African Americans
in cities was higher than that of urban whites at the peak of the flu pandemic.
       Our objective in this article has been to document regional differences in the fall
  18
    Three cities had infectious mortality among whites in some years from 1906 to 1920 that exceeded
median urban white infectious mortality in 1918: Key West, FL (two years), San Antonio, TX (5
years), and Asheville, NC (7 years).

of urban infectious mortality. Future research should attempt to explain these dif-
ferences. Roberts (2009) and Zelner et al. (2017) present evidence linking African
Americans’ high rate of death from tuberculosis in the early twentieth century to seg-
regation and crowded housing. Other well-known causes of black infectious mortality,
in contrast, are unlikely to explain the gap in the infectious mortality rates of black
and white city dwellers. For instance, by 1900, malaria, a common cause of death
in the South (Kitchens 2013), was rare in southern cities (Humphreys 2009; Boustan
and Margo 2016, p. 742). Research by Black et al. (2015) and Eriksson and Niemesh
(2016) has shown that the great migration increased mortality among African Amer-
icans at young and old ages. But a large part of this effect was due to the fact that
migrants left rural areas for cities, where the risk of death from infectious disease was
comparatively high at the beginning of the twentieth century (Eriksson and Niemesh
2016).19 The great migration may have accounted for some portion of the regional
convergence in urban infectious mortality for all groups, as black migrants, with com-
paratively high risks of death from infectious disease, left southern cities for cities in
the other regions. But it should account for a smaller portion of the difference in in-
fectious mortality between urban whites and urban African Americans because black
infectious mortality rates in southern cities were similar to black infectious mortality
rates in cities in the other regions. In future work, we plan to study infectious mor-
tality among urban African Americans in closer detail, focusing especially on which
causes of death were primarily responsible for their extreme mortality rates.
  19
    Eriksson and Niemesh (2016) find that moving North increased the infant mortality rates of
African Americans in 1920, but that this effect had disappeared by 1940, due mostly to the disap-
pearance of the urban mortality penalty.

Figure 2: Logged, Age-Standardized Infectious Mortality in U.S. Cities by Region. Infectious
mortality is standardized to eliminate variation in the age distributions of cities. Each dot represents
the logged ratio of actual to expected infectious mortality in one city in one year, based on the city’s
age distribution. We plot the median city in each year using darker dots. We draw linear trends
within five periods. Each period is defined as a set of years during which the cause of death categories
are relatively stable. We omit 1918–1920 to avoid distortions from the flu pandemic.

A         Appendix

A.1        Age-standardization

For the large group of cities we study, the historical Vital Statistics report only total
cause-specific mortality, not age- and cause-specific mortality.20 If we had age-specific
infectious mortality rates for each city in our dataset, we could construct directly age-
standardized mortality rates, analyze the resulting counterfactual infectious mortality
a city would be estimated to have given a standard age distribution, and decompose
differences in infectious mortality across cities into differences in their age structures
and differences in their age-specific infectious mortality. Unfortunately, the city-level
data available in the historical Vital Statistics make that impossible.
       However, using data described below, we are able to construct indirectly age-
standardized rates. Instead of applying a standard age structure to each city’s actual
age-specific infectious death rates, we apply a standard set of age-specific infectious
death rates to each city’s actual age structure and compare the resulting “expected”
total infectious mortality rate to the actual infectious mortality rate (Preston et al.
2000, p. 24–28).
       Estimating the age-standardized rates entails estimating two quantities: an age
distribution for each city-year and a “standard” schedule of infectious mortality over
age. We estimate the age-specific population of each city and each racial group using
the complete-count censuses of 1900–1940. For 1950, when the complete-count census
is unavailable (and the 1% sample is insufficient for generating age-specific population
counts in individual cities), we estimate age structures for urban populations at the
state level using the 1% sample.21 We interpolate the logged age-specific populations
  20
     A handful of cities report age-by-cause mortality statistics in some years, but these cities are
highly selected: they are mostly very large cities that vary little by region.
  21
     In some cases from 1900 to 1940, the age-specific populations do not add up to the published
total populations of each city. This is driven by data digitization errors in the complete-count census,
including under- or over-enumeration or incorrect city coding. We drop cities in which the two sources
disagree by more than 5% in either direction. This removes 45 cities from one or more census years,


                                                  28
to the intercensal years.22 This interpolation will work well when a city’s age distri-
bution changes gradually and less well when it experiences sudden shocks, such as
when a disproportionate number of people in their 20s died in the 1918 flu.23 The
proportion under 5 (a group particularly vulnerable to death from infectious causes)
declines over time until the Baby Boom, ranging in Census years from 10% in 1900
in the Midwest, Northeast, and South to a low of 6.5% in the Northeast in 1940,
before rising as high as 12.6% in the South in 1950. Conversely, the proportion over
65 grows over time until the Baby Boom, ranging from a low of 3% in the West in
1900 to a high of 8% in the West and Midwest in 1940. These variations motivate
the standardization. Age distributions vary more by region and year than by racial
group.
    To estimate the standard age schedule of infectious mortality, we use age- and
cause-specific death counts, as reported in the Vital Statistics. These death counts
were collected on selected cities from 1900 to 1933, but the age categories changed
in 1922. We use the 1922–1933 series because its age categories are smaller and
extend to an older age (75) than the earlier series. The number of cities in this
series increases over time, ranging from 72 to 98. Using these counts of death and
for a total of 70 dropped city-years. The raw infectious mortality rates we report use the published
total city populations. To construct indirectly standardized infectious mortality, we estimate cities’
proportionate age distribution for each racial group as the age-specific population divided by the
total population, both derived from the complete-count census. We then scale this proportionate
distribution by the published total city population to estimate age-specific population counts to
match the age-specific death counts in the numerator. In subsequently using those age schedules to
derive the “expected” total infectious mortality for each city, we simply use the proportionate age
distribution in each city with the standard age-specific rate and need not commit to any population
size estimate.
   22
      Seventy cities do not appear in the 1940 IPUMS. To avoid interpolating age distributions over
long periods, in the case of those 70 cities and the 70 dropped observations described above, we
extrapolate the IPUMS data that remain only to the end of the ICD period. For this purpose, we
treat 1920 as included in the 1921-1929 ICD period. Thus, a city with good IPUMS data for 1920
but IPUMS data dropped in 1930 due to data error would have its 1920 age distribution extrapolated
to the 1921-1929 ICD period, but would be missing from the 1930-1938 period. Additionally, for
all populations, we can interpolate age distributions only for cities present, without data error, in
IPUMS data for at least two Census years.
   23
      For racial-group-specific data, which are collected only through 1942, we extrapolate from 1940,
rather than interpolating using data from 1950, to avoid drawing age distributions from the Baby
Boom that begins in 1946.


                                                 29
age-specific populations derived from the census, we estimate age-specific infectious
mortality rates for each year in each city included in this smaller series. Then we
take the median infectious mortality rate in each year at each age to construct annual
mortality schedules by age. Finally, we smooth these schedules over years using a
lowess tricube-weighted smoother with a bandwidth of 10 years (essentially the full
series). As our standard, we use the smoothed schedule for 1925, because it is close
to the midpoint of our full time series and is not near an endpoint (where smoothers
can behave differently) of the age-schedule series. Figure A.1 shows this age schedule
of mortality compared to other years, with infectious death rates reported in deaths
per 100,000.24

       Although the age- and cause-specific data include far fewer cities and a slightly
different list of causes of death than the main data, neither difference significantly
distorts total infectious mortality rates. The cities included in the age-specific data
and the much longer list of cities in our main analysis have a similar mean and median
infectious mortality rate in each year.25 Likewise, the total infectious mortality rate
estimated for cities in both the age-specific and the full dataset are similar in the two
sources.26 Because the purpose of the age standard is to apply a consistent standard
to purge total mortality of the age composition—not to provide an ideal estimate of
age-specific mortality in any given year—these small differences need not concern us.
       With the 1925 mortality schedule and the estimated age-specific population in
each city, we estimate an “expected” total infectious mortality rate for each city in
  24
      In constructing the 1900–1921 schedules, which were estimated separately because of their dif-
ferent age categories, we omitted 1918 and 1919 from the smoothed rates to avoid distortions from
the flu pandemic.
   25
      In 1925, the main year we draw on in constructing our standard mortality distribution, cities in
the full dataset have a mean infectious mortality rate of .0034 and cities in the age-specific dataset
have a mean infectious mortality rate of .0032. Both have a median rate of .0031.
   26
      In 1925, the cities included in the age-specific dataset have a mean infectious mortality rate of
.0031 in that dataset and .0032 in the full dataset. The corresponding medians are .0029 and .0031,
respectively.

                                                  30
each year in the full dataset. The ratio of actual infectious mortality in that city
to this “expected” mortality—dubbed the Comparative Mortality Ratio by Preston
et al. (2000, p. 28)—reflects how high or low infectious mortality is, given the age
distribution in that city. This ratio allows us to compare infectious mortality across
regions and years even when the age distributions differ. The Comparative Mortality
Ratio is given in Equation (A.1.1):

                                 µactual (x, t)        µactual (x, t)
                 CM R(x, t) =                    =                               (A.1.1)
                                µexpected (x, t)
                                                   P
                                                     c(x, t, i)µ∗ (x, t, i)
                                                    i


for city x in year t, where c(x, t, i) represents the share of the city’s population in
that is in age group i and µ∗ (x, t, i) represents infectious mortality at age group i in
the standard mortality schedule.


A.2     Death Classification Robustness Checks

A particularly important change in the cause of death codes during our series concerns
the handling of rheumatic fever, which typically resulted from strep throat or scarlet
fever, but in our series is often conflated with the broader inflammatory category
of rheumatism. Rheumatic fever is collapsed into “all other causes” in 1900–1909,
reported as “rheumatism,” which might be infectious or chronic, from 1910–1929 and
“rheumatism and gout” from 1930–1936, and reported separately as “acute rheumatic
fever” from 1937–1948 (alongside separate categories for “chronic rheumatism,” with
some other diseases, until 1942).
   Rheumatic fever is likely a consequential cause of death. For example, in 1910,
the general category “Rheumatism” had a median death rate, in each region, of
around 7 per 100,000. By the time acute rheumatic fever was reported separately
in 1937, median deaths from that cause were zero per 100,000 in each region, while
chronic rheumatism still killed a median of 4–7 per 100,000 in each region. “Chronic


                                           31
rheumatic diseases of the heart” killed 11–22 per 100,000 in each region from 1939 to
1942, the only years it was reported. Unfortunately, acute rheumatic fever began to
be reported separately as a cause in exactly the same period when sulfa drugs likely
made rheumatic fever recede in importance.
   In our analysis, we omit every variation on rheumatic fever and rheumatism be-
cause of the inconsistent handling of this category of death over the course of the
series. Figure A.2 shows the infectious mortality rates by region, re-classifying infec-
tious deaths to include every variation on rheumatism and rheumatic fever in both
the city rates and the standard age schedule of mortality. Including rheumatism and
rheumatic fever does not change any of our main results: the relatively flat infectious
mortality before the 1918 flu, the steep decline in the 1940s, the exceptionally high
southern mortality across the series, and the partial southern convergence with other
regions during the 1940s all remain.

A.3     City Samples

The sizes of each data panel, by region and year, are shown in figure A.3. The full
panel ranges from minimums of 91, 140, 16, and 27 for the Midwest, Northeast,
West, and South, respectively, to highs of 321, 364, 117, and 244. The balanced panel
includes 52 midwestern, 99 northeastern, 12 western, and 14 southern cities. The
panel with data on specific racial groups ranges from lows of 4, 6, 2, and 27 in the
Midwest, Northeast, West, and South, respectively, to highs of 34, 150, 67, and 244,
in years between 1906 and 1942 (excluding 1938, when data on specific racial groups
were not collected).
