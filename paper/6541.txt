Introduction

       Nationally representative studies consistently report significant gender and racial

differences in youth smoking rates. According to data presented in the 1994 Surgeon General

Report, white youth are more than twice as likely to report smoking in the previous month than

black youth. Although smoking rates among females were higher than males during the 1980s,

this trend has reversed itself in the 1990s, with more young men reporting that they currently

smoke than young women.1 Although the differences in smoking rates are well documented,

little research has been done to help explain why these differences exist or whether they are

persistent over time.

       An examination of historical trends in smoking rates among a nationally representative

sample of high school seniors reveal that the differences we see today in smoking rates have not

persisted over time. Figure 1 shows thirty-day smoking prevalence among high school seniors

by gender and race from 1975 to 1997. Although smoking prevalence among all four groups

declined from 1977 to 1980, the smoking rates move in very different directions throughout the

1980s. Young black smokers continue to dramatically decrease their thirty-day prevalence

throughout the 1980s. Similarly smoking rates among young women smokers fall throughout the

1980s, but the declines are not nearly as large as among black smokers. Smoking rates by men

and whites, however, level off in the early 1980s and start to moderately climb throughout the

1980s. Interestingly, from 1991-1996 there is again a parallel movement in the smoking rates of

these four groups, but now smoking rates among young men are higher than smoking rates

among young women.

       What caused these dramatic differences in youth smoking rates during the 1980s? One

possible explanation is that there was a large change in a significant predictor of youth smoking
during this time period that influenced these four groups differently. For example, between 1981

to 1990 the average real price of a twenty-pack of cigarettes rose from a twenty-five year low of

$0.69 to $1.10.2 This represents a 63% increase in the real price of a pack of cigarettes.

Previous economic research shows that smoking by youth is sensitive to changes in the price of

cigarettes.3 It may be that this significant price increase influenced smoking rates of youths

differently.

        In this paper we examine differences in youth responsiveness to changes in price and

specific tobacco control policies using a nationally representative sample of youths from the

Monitoring the Future surveys. We find that significant differences do exist both by gender and

by race. For example, men are much more responsive to changes in the price of cigarettes than

women; the participation elasticity for men is almost twice as large as that for women. Further,

we find that smoking rates of young black men are significantly more responsive to changes in

price than young white men. We also find that there are significant differences in youths’

responsiveness to tobacco control initiatives by race. Smoking rates among white youths are

much more responsive than black youths to anti-tobacco activities and clean indoor air

restrictions. Smoking rates among black youths, on the other hand, are significantly influenced

by smoker protection laws and restrictions on youth access whereas smoking rates among white

youths are not.


Methods

        Data on youth smoking prevalence come from the 1992-1994 Monitoring the Future

surveys of eighth, tenth, and twelfth grade students conducted by the Institute for Social

Research (ISR) at the University of Michigan. Every year since 1975, ISR has collected data on

tobacco, alcohol, and other drug use from a nationally representative sample of approximately



                                                 2
17,000 high school seniors. In 1991, comparable surveys of eighth and tenth grade students were

added. The survey is conducted in school and addresses youths’ attitudes, perceptions and use of

legal and illicit drugs. Given the sensitive nature of the subject matter, great care is taken to

ensure reliable and valid responses. For example, parents are not informed of their child’s

responses.

       From responses to these surveys it is possible to construct a dichotomous indicator of

smoking participation that is set equal to one for youth reporting any cigarette consumption in

the previous 30 days and zero otherwise. In addition, various other socioeconomic and

demographic variables can be constructed from the general background data that are collected.

Variables used in this analysis include: gender (male or female), race (white, Black and other

race), age, average weekly income from all sources (employment, allowances and other), current

grade (eighth, tenth or twelfth), marital status (married/engaged or single), parental education

(less than high school graduate, high school graduate, more than high school graduate), family

structure (live alone, only mother present, only father present, both parents present, live with

other(s)), mother’s work status while the youth was growing up (not employed, employed part-

time, employed full-time), existence of siblings, average number of hours worked weekly, living

in rural/urban area, and frequency of participation in religious services (no participation,

infrequent participation and frequent participation).

       Based on each youth's county of residence, measures of cigarette price and state and local

tobacco control policies are added to the survey data. The cigarette price measure reflects the

average state level price for a pack of 20 cigarettes and is taken from the Tobacco Institute's

annual Tax Burden on Tobacco .4 It is a weighted average of the prices of single packs, cartons,

and vending machine sales and includes state level excise taxes and the price of generics. To




                                                  3
capture potential cross-border shopping for cigarettes that, if excluded, may bias estimates of

price towards zero, an additional variable representing the largest price difference between the

youth's state of residence and states within 25 miles of the youth's county of residence is also

included. This variable is set equal to zero for those youth that live in states with lower prices

than nearby states and for youth living in counties more than 25 miles from another state.

        Four variables capturing state and local tobacco policies are also merged into the data.

The first is a dummy variable set equal to one in those states that earmark a portion of cigarette

tax revenues for anti-tobacco activities and zero otherwise. Those states that set aside these

funds are generally believed to be more aggressive in discouraging smoking. The second is

another dummy variable set equal to one in those states that have some form of smoker

protection legislation and equal to zero otherwise. States that have enacted smoker protection

laws are generally believed to be less aggressive in their efforts to discourage smoking. The

final two variables are indices of clean indoor air restrictions and youth access laws passed at the

state and local level. The index of clean indoor air restrictions represents the sum of five

independent variables capturing the fraction of the population in the youth’s county of residence

subject to state or local restrictions on smoking in private work sites, restaurants, retail stores,

schools, and other public places. The index of youth access is constructed similarly by summing

five different variables capturing different aspects of youth access. The first two variables

included in this index are dummy variables set equal to one if the state has a minimum legal

purchase age of at least 18 and if the states requires point-of-sale signage stating the minimum

legal purchase age. Two other variables included in this index represent the fraction of the

county population in the youth’s county of residence that is subject to restrictions on vending

machine sales and distribution of free samples. The last variable included in this index




                                                   4
represents the fraction of the county population that is living in areas where tobacco licensing is

required. The data on state level policies were taken from the Coalition on Smoking OR

Health’s (CSH) annual State Legislated Actions on Tobacco Issues.5 Similar information on

county and city level restrictions was obtained from the National Cancer Institute’s monograph

summarizing major local control policies, updated with information from CSH.6

       Descriptive statistics of the variables of interest by gender and race are provided in Table

One. As has been found in other surveys, smoking rates among black (8.0%) are significantly

lower than those of young whites (25.6%) in our sample. There is not a significant difference in

smoking prevalence by gender, however. Approximately 23% of both males and females report

currently smoking. Only a few of the policy variables differ across the groups. On average,

fewer black youth are found in states that pass smoker protection laws. Similarly, fewer black

youths live in states with tougher restrictions on smoking in public places.



Results

       Using as controls the variables described above, the probability of smoking in the

previous thirty days is estimated for males, females, blacks, whites, black males and black

females using separate probit maximum likelihood specifications. Each specification includes a

measure of the price of cigarettes along with the border-purchase variable. However, since the

tobacco control policies are highly correlated, only one policy variable could be included in the

regression equation at a time. We therefore estimate each of the six gender/race specific

specifications five separate times, once with just the price included and four times with price and

a different tobacco control policy. Since most of the policy variables are measured at the state




                                                 5
level, standard errors are corrected for correlation created by having multiple observations within

a single state using the cluster option in STATA 5.0.

       Tables Two (A-D) report the marginal effects obtained from each of these separate

regressions for the key policy variables, and then Table Three summarizes the main findings. In

Table Three, two dashes indicate that the marginal effect of the variable on the probability of

smoking was negative while the plus sign indicates that the marginal effect of the variable was

positive. The average price elasticity resulting from the five different policy specifications of the

models is reported in the final column. Although earmarking of state cigarette tax revenue to

promote anti-tobacco activities has a negative and significant effect on smoking prevalence for

young men and women, it is only smoking by white youth that are affected by this policy. State

earmarking had no significant effect in any of the model specifications run separately for blacks.

Smoker protection laws, on the other hand, have the largest positive effect on smoking rates by

young blacks, and in particular black males. Smoking prevalence of white youth, male and

female, is not affected by the existence of smoker protection laws. Clean indoor air laws

significantly decrease smoking prevalence among young white males, but has no significant

effect on any of the other groups of adolescents. Stricter youth access laws, on the other hand,

significantly decrease smoking rates among young black males and females but have no

significant effect on the smoking prevalence of white youth.

       Economists use the price elasticity of demand as a way of measuring the responsiveness

of consumption of a good to changes in the price of that good. It is measured as the percent

change in the quantity of the good consumed, or in this case the percent change in the probability

of smoking cigarettes, given a one percent change in the good’s price, or ηd = %∆Q / %∆ P.

When a change in the probability of using a good is examined instead of the actual quantity




                                                  6
consumed, we refer to this as a participation elasticity. A value greater than one in absolute

value indicates that the change in the probability of smoking is greater in percentage terms than

the change in the price of the good, and we say that consumption is very responsive to changes in

price. A value less than one in absolute terms would indicate that the change in the probability

of smoking was smaller in percentage terms than the change in price, meaning that consumption

is not very responsive to price. Looking at the average price elasticities reported in the final

column of Table Two we see that smoking participation among young men is much more

sensitive to changes in price than smoking rates by young women, regardless of race. Smoking

by young black men is the most price sensitive; a ten percent increase in the price of cigarettes

will result in a 16.5% decrease in smoking prevalence among young black men, holding

everything else constant. The same price increase would only result in a reduction in smoking

participation of 8.6% among young white men. Smoking participation rates among women are

the least responsive, although it is still significant for at least white young women. In most of the

models run, the price of cigarettes had no significant effect on the probability of smoking for

young black females.



Discussion

       It should be kept in mind when interpreting these findings that most of the tobacco

control policies included in this analysis only measure the existence of a policy and not its actual

enforcement. There is considerable evidence in the recent literature suggesting that it is the

enforcement of these policies and not the policies themselves that change behavior.3, 7- 8

Nonetheless, when the youth population is broken into these subgroups by race and gender it is

interesting to see that many of the policies become significant for particular groups of young




                                                  7
smokers. The most consistently significant policy variable is the price of cigarettes, which has a

negative and significant effect on smoking prevalence for all the groups except young black

women. This perhaps explains why it is the only variable that is consistently found to have a

significant effect on youth smoking rates in general.

        To what extent do the observed differences in price sensitivity explain the divergence in

smoking trends that occurred in the 1980s? Assuming that youth smoking participation

elasticities are fairly constant over time, it is possible to use the elasticities reported in Table

Three to predict the change in smoking participation rates expected given the 63% increase in

price that occurred from 1981 to 1990. In Table Four, we record the actual and predicted

change in smoking participation for the four basic subgroups represented in Figure 1. It is clear

given the difference in predicted and actual values that the change in price alone does not

adequately explain the actual patterns of consumption for all of the subgroups. Given the

elasticities calculated in Table Three and the enormous change in price during the 1980s, we

would have expected to see smoking rates among all four groups decline, with smoking among

black youths falling the most and smoking rates among females falling the least. Although

smoking rates among blacks did experience the largest decline during the 1980s, the decline was

not nearly as large as our model predicts. The same is true for females. Smoking rates among

males and whites actually rose during the period, however, contrary to what our model predicts.

        The poor performance of our model at explaining the shifts in smoking rates during the

1980s is not that surprising since it assumes that everything else that may influence youth

smoking is held constant throughout the period. This was certainly not the case. For example, at

the same time that the tobacco industry started raising the price of cigarettes, it dramatically

increased its spending on advertising and promotions. Between 1981 and 1990 total advertising




                                                    8
and promotional expenditures for the industry nearly tripled.1 This increase in advertising and

promotion is not accounted for in our analysis and may be offsetting the effect of price on

smoking rates. To the extent that advertising and promotional activities target specific youths

more than others, this increase in expenditure is likely to influence youth smoking rates

differently as well. There may be other missing determinants as well.

       Even with these shortcomings, it is clear from this analysis that youths respond

differently to changes in price and public policies. Significant differences exist by gender and

race which suggests that public health professionals and policy makers keep in mind who their

target user is when determining policy. There is clearly not a “one-size fits all” strategy for

discouraging youth smoking.
