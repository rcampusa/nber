                Structural Changes in Unionization: 1973-1981




                                   ABSTRACT



     This paper presents a decomposition of the decline in union density into

structural and within sector components using CPS data for private sector

workers. We find that 58 to 68 percent of the decline in private sector

unionization between 1973 and 1981 can be accounted for by structural changes

in the economy, particularly in the occupational, educational and gender

distribution of the workforce. This is a large impact, but we fnd that whMe

structural change is important, its importance was not appreciah'y greate

during the 1970s than during previous decades. At the same time, we find that

the decline of private sector unionization within sectors has been pervasive,

accounting for 32 to 42 percent of union decline. As part of thS   analysis we
find that the decline in union density has been greater in those sectors of

the economy where employment decline has been greater. This fact can help

reconcile previous divergent findings on the importance of structural change.

 I.   Seven Simple Explanations of the Decline in Unions


      The proportion of the workforce that is unionized (union density) has

been falling since the mid-1950s. Recent declines have raised the spectre of

the death of collective bargaining, and provoked questions about the long-term

growth and decline of unionism.

      There are a numbe'- of common beliefs that offer simple and plausible

sounding explanations for the decline in the unionized proportion of the work

force during the 1970's:

      1) Industry has been moving to the South and the West from the

North-East and North-Central regions. Since the South and West have always

beer relatively anti-union, this geographic shift explains the decline in

unioni zat ion.

      2) The U.S. manufacturing sector has been in decline, and that this

sector has always been organized labor's chief stomping ground. The unions

are simply dying out along with their prime habitat.

      3) White-collar employment is on the rise. As blue-collar jobs fade

away, so do unions which have never found the key to white-collar

organization.

      4) The wcrkforce is becoming more highly educated, and so less desirous

of unions.

      5) Women have never welcomed unions. More women in the labor force

means less room for union organization.

      6) Blacks have been receptive to unions, but as the black proportion of

the workforce fades, so do unions' hopes.
                                          -2-



        7) The young don't appreciate the security unions provide to senior

workers, and the workforce has become younger.

        Other explanations have been offered in terms of B) increasing managerial

resistance prompted by union-wage premiums, 9) an exogenous change in worker

preferences, 10) a shift in NLRB politics, and 11) relatively slower

employment growth in union plants. We focus on the first seven explanations

here.

        In many   of these cases, the premise of the argument is correct. The

proportion of the workforce employed in the South and West, outside

manufacturing, and in white-collar jobs is increasing. And indeed, unions

have traditionally been weak in these sectors. At the same time, the female;

white, and highly-educated fractions of the workforce have been increasing.

        What each of these arguments presumes is that each type of worker or job

has some normal or equflibriuni level of unionization which tends to remain

unchanged even as the composition of the workforce changes. In practice this

may not be too bad an assumption. As the data in Table 1 show, the proportion

of different labor market groups who are union members varies widely in the

cross-section but little over time. This has led several authors to attempt

to assess the extent to which changes in the composition of the labor force

are responsible for the decline in union density by regressing union

membership on dummy variables for job and personal characteristics to obtain

predicted union density for subclasses of workers. These values are then

multiplied by the change in the percent of each type of worker in the labor

force to obtain a predicted decline in union density. This is then compared

to the actual decline to determine what percent of the total decline was due
                                       —3-


to the changes in labor force composition. This approach implies a great deal

of faith in the initial assumption that each worker attribute or job type has

a fixed level of union density associated with it.

     It   is also possible that there are important interactions between the

dimensions considered by past authors. Women in production jobs in

manufacturing may have much the same probability of being union members as

males, while women in the service industry may be much less likely than men to

be unionized. Further, while the densities in Table 1 are very stable there

are some substantial changes, and the amount of change differs between groups.

Again, it would not be unreasonable to expect that the same forces which are

causing the manufacturing sector to shrink relative to the service sector may

also be making unions in those industries less viable. If either of these

problems is significant, existing estimates of the role of structural shifts

in the decline in union density may be inaccurate.

     This paper examines the appropriateness of the standard method for

discerning the importance of structural change. We find that it has led some

authors to overstate the extent of structural change though not by a great

deal. We conclude that between 1973 and 1981 between 58 and 68 percent of the

total decline in union density in the private sector is due in some sense to

structural change.

    The rest of this paper proceeds in five sections. Section II discusses

the current population survey samples used in the analysis. The changing

locus of unionism, and the pervasive nature of union decline are shown in

Section III. Section IV presents our basic framework for decomposing the

impact of structural changes on the percent unionized. The importance of
                                      -4-


individual dimensions of structural change are analyzed in Section V. Section

VI presents our main results from a simultaneous structural decomposition. To

shed some light on the extent to which structural change in the late 19705 and

early 1980s was unusually great, Section VII compares our results with those

of other economists for earlier periods, our conclusions are presented in

Section VIII.



U. The Current Population Survey Data


     The analysis here is based on union membership reported annually in the

May Current Population Survey (CPS) sample. Our study starts in 1973 because

that is the first year in which the union queston was asked. To augment

sample size and insulate from cyclical variation, we group CPS observations

for the years 1973, 1974 and 1975 (hereafter referred to as Y74), and for

1979, 1980 and 1981 (hereafter Y80). We then compare changes between these

two sets of grouped years in employment and unionization across and within

sectors. In each year the sample is limited to employed people reporting

union status, region, industry, occupation, race, sex, age, and education.

     Starting in 1977 the CPS changed the "union" question from "Does

(respondent) belong to a labor union on this job?" to "On this job, is

(respondent) a member of a labor union or of an employee association similar

to a union?" To create a consistent series across time, we had to eliminate

association members from our analysis. in 1970, the BLS reported 2,635,000

association members, 96.7 percent of whom were employed by governments (BLS

Directory 1979, Table 16, p.67). The privately employed remainder were in the
                                         —5—



 service sector, represented by the National Education Association (private

 schools), the American Nurses Association, and the National Federation of

Licensed Practical Nurses. Since the union-like associations are found in the

professional service and government sectors, we eliminated these sectors from

our analysis.

        While this does result in a more consistent series of unionization data

over time, it will overstate the decline in uniorHzaton over-all becse

these association-rich sectors are precisely the ones in which the incidence

of collective bargaining has been increasing. The union movement is far-   frorr
dead.    In the two sectors not examined here, professional service and

government, we see compelling evidence that unions are redirecting their

organizing energies successfully towards growing parts of the economy. The

analysis here focuses only on the private sector, and so does not treat, for

example, the growth of AFSCME to become the largest union within the AFL-CIO

today.

     There are 110,200 CPS observations in Y74, and 104,700 in YSO. The Y80

sample is smaller because in 1981 the CPS only asked the union question to

that portion of the respondents who were leaving the revolving CPS sample.

The results reported here are basedon these weighted samples.



III. The ChangiriQ Locus of Unionization, 1973-1981


    Only 22.4 percent of this weighted sample were reported as union members

in Y80. This is a 2.4 percentage point, or 10 percent decline from the 24.8

percent that were union members roughly six years previously in Y74. This 2.4
                                      -6-



percentage point drop during the late 1970's is striking when placed in

historical perspective, and marks a major decline in unions' fortunes. For

comparison, Dickens and Leonard report that between 1974 and 1980 the

proportion of private non-agricultural non-construction wage and salary

workers organized fell from 26.2 to 21.2, a 5.0 percentage point drop, or 34

percent of the 14.9 percentage point drop from the peak 36.1 percent organized

in 1954. Similarly, Pencavel and Hartsog report that between 1974 and 1950

the fraction of full-time equivalent employees represented by trade unions

fell from 27.2 to 23.8 (Table 1, p.5), a 3.4 percentage point drop, or 37

percent of the 9.3 percentage point drop from 33.1 percent represented in 1958

(the earliest year they report).

     In contrast, Kokkelenberg and Sockell (K&S) (1975, Table 4, p. 533) using

three year moving averages of CPS data report that the percentage of workers

unionized rose slightly from 1974 (24.7 percent) to 1980 (25.0 percent). We

also report three year averages of CPS data for Y74 and Y80. K&S find a

slight (0.3 percentage point) increase where we finds a decline (2.4) because

they include the professional service and government sectors, although they

also note (p. 501) the change over time in the CPS question from union

membership to membership in a union or union-like employee association. This

undoubtedly accounts for a substantial part of the astounding 9 percentage

point increase in "unionization" that K&S observe (p. 501) among technical,

professional and kindred workers. With the exceptions of communications and

utilities, personal and professional service and public administration, K&S

find, as other researchers have, that unionization has declined across

industry.
                                        —7—


      This decline in unionization has been a pervasive phenomenon. Table 1

 shows that the percentage of the private workforce has declined since 1973

just about any way it is cut. In all the industries, occupations, regions,

age groups and sexes considered here the unionized proportion of the workforce

fell. This proportion even fell in some of the unions' strongholds: the

primary metals and automotive industries, and the mining and construction

sectors. Further disaggregation would do little to change this picture of

pervasive overall decline in unions' fortunes. The rays of hope for unions in

Table 1 are a nearly stable share of non-white workers and a slightly growing

share of college graduates.

     Table 1 carries a simple but important lesson for those who would argue

that unions are in decline mainly because of structural changes that have

reduced employment in traditionally union intensive sectors. Since the

proportion unionized is falling within nearly every sector, the overall

proportion unionized would have fallen substantially even if the structure of

employment were frozen at 1974 levels.



IV. Framework for Structural Decomposition


     All of the factors presented in the introduction have one thing is

COmmOn: They   all   explain the decline in the aggregate percent unionized in

terms of a shift in the composition of the economy or the workforce from

sectors in which unions are strong to sectors in which unions are weak. They

all explain the decline of unions by reference to structural changes in the

composition of industry or the workforce.
                                                                   -8-


        This lends itself to a mode of analysis that is straightforward, although

it may be difficult to operationalize. The aggregate proportion of the

workforce organized at time t 'is                  given           by the identity:



(1)          Ut =




where       is the ratio of employment in sector i to total employment and

is the ratio of unionized workers to all workers in sector i. The change

over time in the proportion unionized is                               then          given by:



(2)          U
                 +1 -Ut = E.[S.U.
                              t
                                           +    t

                               11      1       1       1                 1       1




where U. = ut         -
                           t
                          U.,      etc. Using this standard identify, the change in

aggregate proportion unionized can be divided into:

        (1) within sector changes in                   proportion                    unionized,

        (2) structural composition effects due to changes in the share of

             employment across industries, and

        (3) an interaction term.

Dividing equation (2) through by tU we get

                                                           1       1         1
(3)          1 =                   +               +



We    shall refer to these three terms as the within sector, composition, and

interaction effects respectively. The second term is structural change
                                        -9-



  weighted by initial unionization. The sum of the last two terms is structural

 change weighted by last period unionization.

       The value added of this paper is in applying this decomposition

 simultaneously and consistently to a number of the most prominent structural

 explanations for the recent decline of unions. Previous work in this area

  (reviewed in Section VII) examines structural change along fewer dimensions

 and at a rougher level of aggregation. More important, they do not account

 fully for interactions along different dimensions. The regressions typically

 used in the past ignore such interactions, and so may either under— or

 over-predict the importance of structural change along a given dimension. In

 addition, past studies use the maintained assumption that unionization has

 beer fixed over time within cells. Here, we allow explicitly for both within

 and across cell changes, for their interaction, and for interactions along a

 number of dimensions of structural change.



 V.   What Accounts for Union Decline in the 1970s?


      The proportion of the workforce organized has been in continual decline

 since 1954, and this decline accelerated during the 1970's. This section

 measures the role played in explaining this recent decline by seven structural

 factors: changes in region, industry, occupation, education, sex, race, and

 age. The interaction of these seven factors is analyzed in Section VI.

 Here we consider the impact of each factor in isolation.

      Table 2 shows the results of seven separate one-variable simulations.

'The categories used in the seven simulations are those shown in Table 1.     For
                                       -10-


example, the first row of this table shows how much the unionized percent of

the workforce would have fallen if:

      (1) the percent unionized within each industry (in Table 1) were held

fixed at 1974 levels while employment shares across industries shifted •in

their historical patterns,

      (2) the distribution of employment across industries were held fixed as

in 1973, while within-industry percent union followed its historical pattern,

and

      (3) only the interaction of changes in employment share and changes in

within sector unionization mattered.

      All of the structural changes are less important than the within—sector

•changes. The shift in the workforce away from blue-collar and towards

white-collar work has been the single most important structural change, and

can itself account for 33 percent of the overall decline in unions. The other

important structural changes, and the share of the overall union decline each

can respectively explain (ignoring interactions) are: education (22 percent),

industry (12 percent), and gender (19 percent). The movement of employment to

the young plays only a minor role (9 percent) as does the shift to the South

and West (5 percent), and shifts in the race of the iorkforce are

inconsequential.

      The third column of Table 2 shows a positive interaction effect in many

cases. On average the percent unions is falling within sectors, and

employment is shifting to low union sectors. Importantly, unionism is

decreasing where employment is decreasing. At the same time, unions are

making headway in some growing sectors, particularly in white-collar and
                                           —11—


clerical jobs, and among the highly educated.



VI. The Interact-ion of Structural ChanQes


     Considered individually, structural changes each account for a

substantial portion of the decline in unions, but none of these changes have

occurred individually. Between 1974 and 1980 a larger fraction of the

workforce did move into sectors that have traditionally had low union-ction

such as the South and West, services, and white—collar work. If summed

together, these changes appear to explain a great deal of the declin€ -ft.

unionization. But by summing them, one would make the error of double (or

worse) counting, and so overstates the importance of structural changes.

Seven one-way decompositions will Count a job that moves from North to South,

from manufacturing to service, from blue-collar to white-collar, from old to

young, from high-school dropout to college graduate, from male to female and

from black to white seven times. The seven-way decomposition used in this

section counts this single change once.

     We cross-tabulate employment and union membership across eight

industries, three occupations, three regions, two education levels, two age

groups, two races and just two sexes, for a total of 1152 cells. The

groupings, and    the   marginal distribution of percent union are presented in

Table 1.

     how much of the 2.4 percentage point decline in unionization can be

accounted for by structural changes? If the distribution of jobs across

sectors    had been frozen in 1974, we would expect the proportion unionized to
                                      —12-


fall to 23.8. In other words, the within-sector decline in the percent

unionized can account for 42 percent of the overall decline in unionism. We

could stop here and still have reached a very important conclusion regarding

the decline of unionism. Even if not a single job had moved to the South or

out of manufacturing, etc., unionization would still have fallen by 42 percent

of its actual decline.

     The structural changes by themselves can account for 68 percent of the

decline n unionism. If the percent unionized within each sector were frozen

at its 1974 level, structural changes alone would reduce unionization to 23.1

percent in 1980. Together the within and between sector changes account for

over 100 of the change. The next section explains why.


The Interaction Effect: Declining Unionism in Declining Sectors

     A new ingredient here is the interaction term, which has been missing

from previous analyses. It is true that employment share is growing in

low-union sectors and that on average the percent unionized is falling within

these sectors. But, the percent unionized is decreasing even more where

employment share in decreasing. The interaction of S and U is .0024, and

this positive interaction balances against both the negative composition, and

the negative within sector effects. In other words, unionism is declining in

most sectors —— enough to account for 42 percent of the overall decline, and

employment is moving into low percent-union sectors -- enough to explain 68

percent of the drop in unionism. But where employment is declining, so is the

percent union, enough to undo 10 percent of the pure structural effect. In

other words, weighting by end period unionization, structural change can
                                              —13-


account for 58 percent of the union decline, and within sector declines can

account for 32 percent of total union decline. In a peculiar but not

inconsequential sense then, the decline in the percent unionized within many

of the traditionally union intensive sectors is of secondary importance

because these sectors are in decline themselves. The cause of this phenomenon

deserves further research.

      Consideration of the interaction effect suggests and ambiguity in the

estimation of the amount of change which can be attributed to structural

factors and the amount of change taking place within sectors. Structural

change as given by equation (2) is simply:

(4)       EU74S.


This weights the structural changes by initial period unionization in each

sector. Alternatively, one could weight by end period unionization, but this

is simply the sum of the above structural effect and of the interaction term:

          u!°s. = Eu4As.        +
(5)
                                    EuiSi
Weighting by end of period unionization then, we find that structural change

can account for 58 percent of union decline. Similarly,

(6)       ES!°aU. =
            1   1
                      Es74u.
                        1  •I
                                +
                                      1   1




So weighting by end period structure, within sector declines can account for

32 percent of union decline.

 VII. Comparisons to Earlier Analyses


      Are the structural changes we have observed here a new development

 accelerating the decline in percent unionized in the late 70s and early 80s,

 or are they rather just a continuation of past trends? For the period from

 the mid-SOs to 1977, similar decompositions are reported by Henry Farber

 (1985, Table 2.5, p.22). In simple one-way decompositions of the type

 reported here, Farber's and our results for the percent of the decl'ne n

 unionization accounted for by structural changes are given in Table 4. We

 decompose in greater detail and along more dimensions than Farber, but for a

 shorter period than the mid-50s to 1977 period that he analyzes. This

 difference is important since the late   70s and early 80s we concentrate on
 here are a period in which the decline of unions accelerat€-tl, and in

 particular because the blame for this acceleration has often been placed or

 the decline of manufacturing industries. Yet Farber's calculation of the

 importance of this factor since the mid-SOs is larger than our analagous

calculation for the more recent period -- .17 compared to .12 of the union

 decline   accounted for by industry shifts.    It is by no means obvious from this
comparison that the restructuring of American industry has contributed to a
greater decline of unions recently than in the 60s or late 50s.      If anything,

 these results suggest the opposite. We also find a similarly diminished role

 for shifts in the regional or gender distributon of the workforce in recent

years, compared to Farber. In contrast, we find that occupational shifts are

of greater importance in recent years. In addition, while Farber presents no

                                       —15-


 of negligible importance, while increases in educational levels are the second

 most important single factor in accounting for the decline in percent

 unionized.

     The sum of Farber's individual shifts can account for 79 percent of the

overall decline in union density. As Farber notes, however, this is likely to

be an overstatement because of the correlation of changes along different

dimensions. To address this issue, a cross-section regression frorr the 1977

Quality of Employment Survey (Q.E.S.) is presented. This is a regression of

uflion status on dichotomous variables for race, sex, the South, manufacturing,

and clerical, service, professional and technical occupations. Using this

method and making the strong assumption that the propensity to unionize with

these groups has not changed between the mid-1950s and 1977, Farber concludes

that only about 41 percent of the drop in the extent of unionization can be

accounted for by gross shifts in the industry, occuptiLn, region and gender-

of the labor force. This is less than the 68 percent we calculate here using

a more detailed decomposition, more dimensions, and a different technique for

a more recent period.

     Comparing Farber's regressions with his decomposition, we see that

changes in occupation, sex and industry are correlated with each other. The

importance of each of these factors is reduced in the regression that controls

for all of them at the same time. Comparing Farber's regression with our

decomposition, shifts in the occupational and gender distribution of the

workforce appear to have become more important recently. Recent industry

shifts appear either to have dominated Farber's results for the longer period,

or else to be a continuation of post—war trends in accounting for union decline.

     Richard Freeman and James Medoff (1984, p.225) report an analysis simi'ar

to that of Farber. In a pooled 1973-1975 May CPS sample, they calculate

linear probability estimates of the probability of unionization as a function

of industry, occupation, region, gender, age, race and educatior!. They then

ask how changes in the distribution of employment across these classes,

holding the within class union propensity fixed, would be expected to change

the overall percent unionized, between 1954 and 1979. As Table 4 shows, the

Freeman and Medoff results, which are most directly comparable to Farber's

regression results, show a greater impact of industrial and occupational

shifts. Freeman and Medoff's results also imply that part of the effect we

find here for education is correlated with other factors, such as

occupation.

     Comparing the three sets of findings, the greatest difference is between

Farber and the other two. Table 5 summarizes the proportion of union decline

that Carl be accounted for in total by each of the three studies. Weighting by

initial period unionization, we find that 68 percent of the decline of unions

can be accounted for by structural change. This is quite close to Freeman and

Medoff's 72 percent, for a longer period but with less disaggregation. These

two studies, using different techniques for different periods of time, are in

close agreement in finding that structural shifts in employment across

industries, occupations, regions and genders can account for the greater part

of the decline in the percent unionized. A comparison of the two studies

suggests that the period from 1973 to 1981 was not greatly different from

the entire post 1954 period in the role played by structural shifts in

accounting for the decline in percent unionized.
                                       —17--



      In contrast, Farber finds 41 percent of union decline attributable to

structural change. The greatest differences are found in the role attributed

to industry and occupation. This may be explained in part by differences in

populations studied. We eliminate workers in the government and professional

service industries. Most of these were government workers. Freeman and

Medoff's analysis is of all private sector workers, and so also excludes

government employees. The same is not true of Farber's analysis, which

includes government employees. Because the white—collar blue-collar

differential in union density -is much lower among government employees, it

stands to reason that Farber, by including government employees without

interaction terms, finds that occupational structure is less important.

Concerning the varying importance ascribed to industry, Farber's regression

divides employment into manufacturing, and non-manufacturing, while we use

eight industries and Freeman and Medoff use seven.

     The interaction term we have calculated in this paper is not negligible,

and can also help explain the difference between Farber, and Freeman and

Medoff. We observe here that sectors with larger declines in shares of total

employment also tend to have started with high unionization and to exhibit

larger declines in percent unionized. Now consider two cross-section

regressions of union membership of a vector of dichotomous variables

representing industry, occupation, etc., estimated for two different years.

Because of the type of interaction observed here, the regression estimated in

the later year will tend to find smaller coefficients, and so less scope for

structural change. This is because in the sectors that have experienced the

greatest structural decline, the percent unionized has fallen (from the above
                                      -18-


mean) the greatest. This is why the positive interaction terms (largely the

product of two negatives) we observe here is important. In particular,

Freeman and Medoff's results hinge on a cross-section regression on 1973-75

data, while Farber's depend on a 1977 cross-section. In view of the

interaction effect, it is not entirely surprising that the analysis based or

the later cross-section finds smaller structural effects.

     What our finding indicates is that if Farber had used an earlier year to

estimate his union density regreiori, he would have attributed more of the

change to structural factors. If Freeman and Medoff had used a later year,

they would have attributed less of the change to structural factors. As it

is, they estimate their regression using the same sample we use to construct

our base year estimates for union density. When we use those base year

estimates to compute the importance of structural change, we get results very

similar to theirs.

     In a very different approach to examining the decline of unions, Dickens

and Leonard argued that fully 63 percent of the decline between 1950 and

1979 in the percent organized among private non-construction,

non-agricultural, wage and salary workers could be explained by the decline in

union organizing and success rates. A residual 35 percent was explained by

"economic factors," presumably differential employment growth rates in the

union and non—union sectors. In other words, one might read the Dickens and

Leonard results to argue that structural change could at most explain 35

percent of the union decline.

    A key to reconciling our results might be to recognize that the changes

in organizing and success rates measured in O+L may be in part due to
                                        -19-


structural changes. We expect them to decline as unions' "natural territory"

declines. However, Freeman (1985, p. 50) reports that structural changes have

contributed only marginally to the decline in unions' success rate in NLRB

certification elections. Our results here then suggest that much of the

decline in union organizing rates previously observed may be due to structural

changes that reduced employment in sectors in which unions had historically

organized.

     Dickens and Leonard also presented evidence suggesting that the

structural changes of the late 1970s were not out of line with previous

experience. In this light, our results here may be interpreted as the most

recent manifestation of an ongoing structural change since 1950.


Criticisms of the Structural Approach

     The structural approach is limited. It can tell us where changes are

occurring, but it does not attempt to explain why they occurred. Three

examples will illustrate the limitations this imposes. First, structural

change is itself the product of larger economic forces. In particular, the

decline of total employment in some industries may itself be related to the

presence of unions. This would be accompanied by a declining unionization

rate within the affected industries -- much as we observe here -- as union

plants within the industry are particularly hard hit. Second, as mentioned

above, union organizing and success rates may themselves be endogenous to

structural change. Organizing and success rates may fall as union's

traditional territory contracts. Third, as Freeman and Medoff (1984, p.227)

point out, much the same structural changes we observe here for the U.S. have
                                             -20-


also taken place in Canada, but without the same consequent decline in

unionization.       This serves as an important warning that other factors are at

work beyond those considered in structural models.



VIII. Conclusion


       The period between 1973 and 1981 wa not so different from the previous

two decades concerning the importance of structural change in accounting f0r

the fate of unions, judging by a comparison of our results with earlier work

by Freeman and Medoff. These studies find that structural change can account

for more than      half   but less than three quarters of the decline in union

density. What does appear to set the 1970s apart from earlier periods is not

greater shifts in employment across industry lines, but rather greater shifts

across occupations, and greater changes in the education level and gender of

the   workforce.
