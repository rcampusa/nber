                                           ABSTRACT

       This paper presents Robert Gallman’s classic, but heretofore unpublished annual series for US
national product over the 1834-59 and 1869-1909 periods. The “Volume 30” series, reported as decadal
averages, underlie much of what we know about American income growth and capital formation before
1909. This paper briefly documents Gallman’s construction and use of the annual series, offers
corrections for minor errors found in the previously circulated versions, compares the series with
alternative national product estimates, and explores promising avenues for further research. Most
importantly, this paper lays out why Gallman considered his annual “Volume 30” series unsuitable for
business-cycle analysis.

                            GALLMAN’S ANNUAL OUTPUT SERIES
                              FOR THE UNITED STATES, 1834-1909


        Robert Gallman’s annual series on the US Gross National Product over the 1834-
1909 period represents one of the underground classics of American economic history.1
Building on over a decade of hard labor, Gallman assembled his national product
estimates in the mid-1960s to provide a clearer picture of long-run performance of the US
economy.      The data were originally published as overlapping decade averages in his
1966 article in Volume 30 of the Studies in Income and Wealth series.2 Over the next
three decades, Gallman continued to refine and elaborate his value added and final flow
estimates as part of a long-term project on capital formation and national product.
Gallman never published his annual data, in part because he worried that they would be
used to analyze business cycle movements, a purpose for which they were not designed.
In the best scholarly tradition, he did make his numbers available through the avenue of
personal correspondence, with the appropriate caveats, to other economists and economic
historians “for testing purposes.” Since the mid-1960s, these series have passed from
hand-to-hand in mimeo, Xerox, and worksheet form.
        This paper takes Gallman’s series out of the underground.3 It presents his two
major annual series for US GNP calculated on the final flow (i.e. spending) side for the

collected the papers given at the Chapel Hill, NC conference in Sept. 1963.
           This work relied extensively on Robert E. Gallman, “Commodity Output, 1839-1899,” in William

  There is ample evidence that Gallman intended eventually (perhaps after further modifications and
testing) to publish the Volume 30 series. For example, his 1981 proposal to the National Science
Foundation (which received funding) listed among the tasks “to prepare the annual GNP series for

main sub-components in 1860 prices over the 1834-59 and 1869-1909 periods; and (2)
national product in current prices over the 1869-1909 period.                       It goes beyond the
spreadsheets that have circulated since the mid-1960s by incorporating Gallman’s more
recent work on inventory changes and discussing whether their inclusion is justified. It
also uncovers and corrects a small number of errors appearing in the circulated
spreadsheets.     The paper briefly documents the methods employed in making the
estimates, with special emphasis on the reasons why Gallman thought the resulting
annual series were unsuitable for business cycle analysis. Finally, this paper discusses
Gallman’s later efforts to improve the Volume 30 series and explores promising avenues
for further revisions.
        Gallman’s numbers are among the best we have for the nineteenth century and
provide important material for any attempt to create better national product estimates. In
his modest way, Gallman gave a sense of their value in his 1996/97 “Notes for the File on
National Accounts”:


                 The annual series underlying Volume 30 have several virtues... It has been
        extended into the ante-bellum years—on an annual basis, to 1834, and on an intermittent
        basis, to 1800—and it links with twentieth century series, rendering a quantitative
        account of virtually the entire national history of the United States; in most of the period
        with which we are principally concerned, it is available in considerable detail,
        distinguishing the various forms of consumption and of capital formation; (and) it lies
        within a consistent scheme of national accounting, which includes both the sectoral
        values added series... and the capital stock estimates... 4


The Volume 30 series represent the product of decades of painstaking labor and careful
judgment by one of the best economic historians. One motivation behind this paper is the
belief that the best way to prevent the abuse of these series is greater openness,
publicizing their limitations as indicators of the business cycle while highlighting their

publication.” His 1983 NSF proposal (again funded) was to compose a monograph on “Capital and
American Economic Growth” in which the “Annual G.N.P. and N.N.P. figures, not presently in print, will
be published” in Appendix A. “Proposal to the National Science Foundation: U.S. Capital Stock and
National Income in the Nineteenth Century,” August 19, 1981, p. 14 and “Proposal to the National Science
Foundation: Capital and American Economic Growth in the 19th Century,” August 4, 1983, p. 24, Gallman
papers. His passing in November 1998 prevented this intention from being realized.

value for other scholarly endeavors. To prevent their misuse, I ask that those using the
series presented in this paper include the following statement in their citation: “These
data were not constructed for analysis as annual series.”
        This paper has the following form. The first section introduces Gallman’s annual
series and documents why these figures, among those in Gallman’s files, are his most
“finished” product. It also notes and provides corrections for several minor errors in the
circulated series. The second and third sections discuss Gallman’s efforts to construct
and further develop the Volume 30 series. The fourth sector lays out the limitations on
their usefulness for business-cycle analysis while the fifth section compares the Volume
30 estimates to other available pre-1909 series for GNP and the implicit price deflator.
Gallman’s work on extensions and promising areas for future research are explored in the
sixth section. The seventh section concludes.


I. The Annual Series


        Contrary to conventional practice, this paper offers the soup before the sermon.
Table 1 and 2 show Gallman’s annual series in constant 1860 prices for national product
and its major spending sub-components over the 1834-1859 and 1869-1909 periods,
respectively. The 1834-59 series are for census years – that is, 1839 refers to 1 June 1839
to 31 May 1840 – and those for 1869-1909 are for calendar years.5 Table 2 also includes
Gallman’s newer (1990s) estimates of annual changes in inventories for the 1870-1909
period and reports on various corrections to the post-bellum real product series. Table 3
displays Gallman’s series on annual national product and its major spending sub-
components over the 1869-1909 period in current prices. Gallman did not develop annual
current-value national product series for the ante-bellum period in Volume 30 because the
relevant price deflators were available only intermittently.6 Because Gallman made a

  Gallman generally believed that as decadal averages the “estimates for the latter years are more reliable
than those for the earlier years.” Notes for Table 3 of Robert E. Gallman, “Economic Growth and
Structural Change in the Long Nineteenth Century,” in Stanley Engerman and Robert E. Gallman, [eds.]

  Tables A-2 and A-3 of his Volume 30 article provide current-value estimates, broken down by major
spending category, for the years 1839, 1844, 1849, 1854, and 1859.


                                                    3
number of revisions over time, the series reported in this paper differ somewhat from
those underlying the published decadal averages. Nonetheless, I will follow Gallman’s
practice of referring to these numbers as the “Volume 30 series.”7
        The data in Table 1 are, with Gallman’s minor revisions, fundamentally the same
as those underlying the overlapping decennial series published in his 1966 article in
Volume 30 of Studies of Income and Wealth. The differences resulted from (1) small
discrepancies in rounding and (2) small revisions to the estimates for manufactured
producer durables in the post-bellum period, especially for 1884-1903 period.8
        Apart from the inventory investment estimates, the figures using the 1860 prices
are from a typeset mimeograph found in Gallman’s files dated June 1965 with “Master-
Final Version” penciled in his hand.9 We have several solid pieces of evidence that
Gallman considered these series his most “finished.” First, he was using these
spreadsheets as the basis for his work on national product and capital formation in the

          In 1985, Gallman had his research assistant, Mike Butler, create annual current-value product
estimates for the ante-bellum period using the current-price benchmarks, the constant-value product
interpolators, and relevant series from the Warren-Pearson wholesale price indices. Gallman apparently
intended to use these data in his work estimating the capital stock using the perpetual inventory approach.
When the trend in the Warren-Pearson prices differed in sign for that of the price benchmarks (e.g. for
several categories of commodities during the 1849-54 period) they used straight-line interpolation. I do not
judge these series to represent Gallman’s “finished product” and do not report them.
7
  There is another set of series in Gallman’s notes including constant 1929-price values for the 1869-1909
period. These series appear to represent Gallman’s revisions of Kuznets’ series, which he used for
intepolation among other purposes. Because Gallman does not treat this series as his own creation, I have
chosen not to include them.
8
  Gallman revised his post-bellum manufactured producer durable series between the preparation of the
Volume 30 paper for publication and June 1965. The June 1967 spreadsheets note that manufactured
producer durables "may be slightly different from the series underlying Vol. 30." During the 1990s,
Gallman was apparently unable to locate the exact spreadsheets used in the Volume 30 tables. In a 21 Jan.
1994 letter to Richard Sutch, Gallman recounted having “a dim recollection of making minor changes of
this cost (of manufacturing durables) after the Vol. 30 paper was in press.” Similarly on 15 Aug. 1995,
Gallman wrote to Benjamin Friedman that "The series I am sending you differ slightly, but only slightly--
from those that figure in the Volume 30 paper."
          As Gallman’s notes for 13 March 1985 indicate, manufactured producers’ durables series from the
June 1965 worksheet “misses consistently—clearly modestly different series.
                   Vol. 30 Work Sheet                          Vol. 30 Work Sheet
1869-78            .389              .391     1889-98          .637               .639
1874-83            .490              .497     1894-03          .860               .858
1979-88            .591              .590     1899-08          1.30               1.30”
1884-93            .616              .614

While spreadsheets exist that perform some of the interpolations used in the new series, I have not found
anything fully documenting the changes. It is likely that they were the result of Gallman’s creation of new
benchmarks using better price series. One extant set of spreadsheets in the manufacturers producer durable
files contains the notes “price data... found after conf(erence) paper series completed." Gallman papers.

1980s and 1990s. One copy has a pencil note “Checked—May 24, 1993.”10 Second, he
apparently sent the 1860-price national product series for 1834-59 from the June 1965
sheets to Robert Margo as late as 7 February 1996.11 Third, Gallman sent the 1834-1909
national product series to Benjamin Friedman as late as 15 August 1995.12
         There seems little doubt that Gallman intended to revise the annual series
underlying Vol. 30 to include the newer inventory investment estimates. In the document
“Notes for the File on National Accounts,” he states “the annual series underlying
Volume 30 ... has an important, but easily eliminated, shortcoming: it does not include
changes in the value of inventories. New estimates have now been made, however,
removing this shortcoming.”13             Indeed, Gallman incorporated the inventory change
figures in the national product series that he reported in his 1997 “Economic Growth and
Structural Change” paper.14            Moreover, he included his later estimates of annual
inventory changes in the series sent to B. Friedman.
         The current price series for the 1869-1909 period are from handwritten
spreadsheets dated June 1967 found in Gallman’s files.15 Again, there is evidence he
used these sheets as the basis for his subsequent work.
         Gallman’s efforts to construct and improve his national product estimates spanned
more than five decades, his entire professional life. The paper trail he left, while not
complete, is amazingly thick. There are feet after feet of files, containing drafts of
articles and huge paper accounting spreadsheets filled with hard-written entries,
calculations, and source notes. Many of the exercises are repeated ad infinitum, with

   I have contacted several of the research assistants involved in these efforts (including Colleen Callahan,
Michael Butler, and Debin Ma). Specifically in a 29 Feb. 2000 conversation, Butler indicated that to his
knowledge, Gallman produced no series in the 1980s to replace the Volume 30 series.

numbers transferred by hand from one sheet to the next. Gallman and his research
assistants were usually very thorough in outlining the steps used to produce a given
number on a given sheet, but less helpful in bridging between the sheets or in dating the
calculations. And because the numbers created or used in one branch of his work built on
and required modifications to numbers created or used in other branches, the records are
not always in chronological order. There are several instances where gaps appear in the
paper trail.16 Research leaves, changes in research assistants, and movements between
offices no doubt explain some of these gaps. Though one cannot exactly replicate the
series from the background material available (or, at least, my efforts have not
completely succeeded), one can usually come quite close and the published
documentation of the sources and procedures employed is remarkably good.
         As noted above, I have discovered a handful of errors in Gallman’s original data
underlying Tables 2 and 3. The most notable errors occur in the data on gross investment
in new railroad construction in 1860 prices for the 1875-77 period. The supporting
documents suggest that the problem arose because a research assistant misplaced the
decimal point when deflating the current dollar investment series by the construction cost
index.17    I also found several typos and inconsistencies in the Gallman’s inventory
investment series.18 Given that the original data are used in much of Gallman’s later
work, it seems desirable to present them without revision and include my suggested
corrections separately (in the bottom rows and far right columns of the Tables). The
corrections, while important for the component series, have a negligible effect on the
national product estimates; the differences in the resulting GNP estimates are always less
that 3.5 percent.       All of the subsequent discussion in this paper will be based on
Gallman’s original series.

   The errors were not offset by corresponding errors in the series on “all other construction” and, as a
result, carry through to Gallman’s total construction, capital formation, and GNP estimates for these years.
There is some evidence that Gallman found the movements of the railroad series suspicious because there
is a check next to the numbers. As noted below, Gallman produced in 1994 a new set of railroad
construction estimates that avoid these problems entirely.
18
   In addition to minor typos, I found an inconsistency in the current-price inventory estimates for livestock
over the 1869-79 period. Gallman and his research assistants employed the Historical Statistics values for
farm animals, K 564-573. These series use gold rather the greenback values (although this is not explicitly
noted in the source). For consistency, I converted the livestock values into greenbacks using prices from
the Annual Reports of the US Commissioner of Agriculture, 1869-78.

II. Construction of the Series


        Gallman produced his estimates for the 1834-59 and 1869-1909 periods using the
same basic methodological framework, but those for the ante-bellum period required
substantially more original work.             Construction of the series generally involved
establishing solid benchmarks every five or ten years and then using a less
comprehensive set of annual time-series to interpolate values for the intervening years.
        For the post-bellum period, Gallman largely adjusted estimates made by his
teacher, Simon Kuznets, who in turn had built up his estimates from the work of William
H. Shaw.19       Gallman made the following adjustments to the Kuznets series:                        (1)
substituting new estimates for firewood, animal products, and federal excise taxes for
Shaw’s series (thereby, substantially raising estimated national product in 1869 and
lowering growth rates over the 1870s and 1880s relative to Kuznets series); (2)
incorporating new estimates of distribution costs based on Harold Barger’s 1955 NBER
publication;20 (3) splitting off railroad construction from other building activity and
creating a more appropriate markup series; and (4) deflating the current-value GNP series
by Dorothy Brady’s detailed final price indices (using an 1860 base).21
        Gallman constructed his ante-bellum national product series by (1) taking his
benchmark figures for commodity (agriculture, mining, and manufacturing) production

1946); William H. Shaw, Value of Commodity Output Since 1869, (New York: National Bureau of
Economic Research, 1947). Shaw provided annual estimates of commodity production after 1889 and
single-year estimates for 1869 and 1879. Kuznets then interpolated between the 1869, 1879, and 1889
benchmarks using annual series for available components; see his National Product, pp. 90-117 for details.

Employment, and Productivity in the United States after 1800, Studies in Income and Wealth Vol. 30 (New
York: Columbia Univ. Press, 1966).
         To deflate the value of production of perishables, semi-perishables, consumer durables, and
manufactured producers’ durables, Gallman used detailed information on commodity flows from Shaw and
his own Volume 24 piece and on prices from Brady to create benchmark estimates for 1869, 1879, 1889,
and 1899 using 1860 prices. He then employed the yearly variations in the corresponding Kuznets constant
1929-price annual series to interpolate between the benchmarks. The 1900-09 figures were simply
extrapolated based on the Kuznets series. Simon Kuznets published his series on national product and its
sub-components only as 5-year moving averages.

for the years 1834, 1836, 1839, 1844, 1849, 1854, and 1859; (2) adding estimates for the
value of services based largely on capital stock series;22 and (3) interpolating the series in
the intervening years using scattered annual data on numerous economic activities. The
appendix of Volume 30 extensively documents the procedures employed. The “major”
benchmarks (1839, 1849, and 1859) were primarily based on materials from the US
census whereas the “minor” benchmarks (1834, 1836, 1844, and 1854) used several state
censuses. The benchmarks for commodity production relied primarily on the sectoral
value added data described in Gallman’s Volume 24 Studies in Income and Wealth
article.23   There were only small adjustments and shifts of commodity production
between categories.
         Two points deserve our attention here. The first is that these series incorporated
the most up-to-date data available in the early 1960s. In his acknowledgements for the
Volume 30 article, Gallman thanked Albert Fishlow who generously provided his
unpublished statistics on the annual production of locomotives and estimates of
investments in railroad construction, Paul David for his unpublished series on agricultural
implement production, Robert Fogel for his iron output series, Maurice Gottlieb for
figures on residential construction, and Dorothy Brady for her final price series. To the
extent that researchers over the past four decades have generated new statistics on the
production or prices of individual goods and services, it should be possible for today’s
scholars to produce improved national product figures, especially for the ante-bellum
period. Robert Gallman would have heartily applauded any serious new research based
on the collection and analysis of real economic data.
         Second, the annual national product series between the benchmark years are
interpolated or extrapolated using a less comprehensive set of products. The main issue
is not the number of series used— for his ante-bellum estimates, Gallman employed data
on over thirty commodities drawn from an amazing array of primary and secondary



22
   Gallman’s method of estimating service flows in the ante-bellum period differed substantially from that
used in the post-bellum period. For the 1869-1909 period, he followed the procedure of Kuznets who used
budget studies to derive the ratio of consumer expenditures on services relative to commodities and then
multiplying the commodity flow series by this ratio. Volume 30, p. 37. For the ante-bellum period,
Gallman built up service flows primarily from capital stock estimates, particularly on the value of housing.

sources—but how representative their movements are.24                          Regarding his use of
interpolators and extrapolators, Gallman noted in Volume 30 that the statistics on net
imports “receive relatively too much weight,” industrial equipment is “inadequately
represented,” many of the major groups rely on one or a few underlying series, and that
the flow of materials into production (e.g. wheat, corn, raw cotton and wool, and lumber)
tended to dominate the series. He adds, lest these warnings “raise too many doubts, bear
in mind that the interpolations and extrapolations generally carry over only four years,
and frequently fewer years than this. The estimates produced are only used in decade
averages... to reduce our dependence on benchmark year estimates to establish prewar
levels of performance.”25
         The main point is that these interpolation/extrapolation procedures are useful for
determining long-run trends, but as Gallman noted, problematic for analyzing business-
cycle fluctuations.26 This is especially true for investigations of the changing volatility of
the macro-economy or for comparison of one specific cycle with another. And this
message carries double weight for analyses contrasting the behavior of the ante-bellum
and post-bellum series, which at the detailed level are constructed in meaningfully
different ways. One key difference is how non-commodity production is estimated. As
Gallman was keenly aware, the results of business-cycle analysis on the annual Volume
30 data would depend more on artifact as fact.27



24
   In particular, see the long Table A-10 in “Gross National Product.”
25
   “Gross National Product,” pp. 64-71.
26
   In a world with high compound growth rates, the use of straight-line interpolation also introduces biases
in the timing of the expansion. The direction of the bias depends on whether the interpolator series grows
faster or slower than the benchmark series.
27
   For these reasons, Gallman was generally opposed to work using his annual national product series to
compare the volatility of nineteenth and twentieth century business cycles. But he also took strong issue
with claims that his procedures to estimate non-commodity production over the 1839-59 period were
“flawed” and generated excessively volatile series. In his view, any bias in volatility due to his
construction procedure was likely to be weak or work in opposite direction from what is usually suggested.
The ante-bellum series were not constructed using the Kuznets’ ratio-method to estimate service flows, but
rather using the growth of housing stocks, which was far smoother. Note services accounted for about 24
percent of Gallman’s real value estimate of national product (excluding changes in inventories) over the
1834-59 period. In addition, the estimates for firewood production, which accounted for about 6 percent of
national product, relied on straight-line interpolation. One offsetting force was the interpolation using net
imports, which tended to “oscillate fairly widely” over the 1834-42 period (p.64). But as p. 71 notes, he
“attempted to dilute the effect of these oscillations by bringing the leather series into the interpolator.”
Clearly, the volatility displayed in the annual series was the product of explicit, conscious data collection
and assembly choices.

III. Gallman’s Subsequent Use of the Volume 30 Series


        From the mid-1960s on, Robert Gallman produced a long stream of articles--often
in collaboration with Lance Davis, Edward Howle, or Thomas Weiss-- that further
developed and analyzed the Volume 30 national product estimates (see Table 4). For
example, in “The Social Distribution of Wealth in the United States of America,”
Gallman added estimates of annual changes in inventories (based on decadal averages of
differences in the capital stocks as estimated in his work with Howle.)28 The paper
“Trends in the Structure of the American Economy Since 1840,” written with Howe for
Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman’s Reinterpretations, explored the sectoral
distribution of income in greater detail.29
        One of Gallman’s early collaborative efforts with Lance Davis, “The Share of
Saving,” reported new estimates of capital consumption and net investment flows,
although this seems hidden by the article’s other important contributions.30 Calculating
these figures involved depreciating the annual investment flows of equipment and
structures estimated in the Volume 30 series. Chapter 2 of L. Davis, et al., American
Economic Growth entitled “Pace and Pattern of American Economic Growth” took the
next logical step by generating estimates of net national product for every decade from
1840 on.31 And in their masterful “Capital Formation in the United States during the
Nineteenth Century” published in the Cambridge Economic History of Europe, Davis and
Gallman used the net investment and the net national product statistics to provide
evidence on the timing and extent of the rise of capital formation.32 In each case, the

article fundamentally was a work of economic analysis and interpretation, but there was
usually some “value added” to the income or investment concept under examination.
         The original Davis-Gallman “Share of Saving” piece is also noteworthy for
beginning to incorporate the research of Gallman and Weiss on the service sector. In his
summary appraisal of the ante-bellum series in Volume 30 (p. 62), Gallman had
observed:
         Of all the estimates, the poorest are those of the value of services flowing to consumers.
         We do not know what margin for error to assign to these figures. If they are in error, the
         chances are that they are too high. Services account for roughly one-quarter of GNP in
         the prewar years. Consequently, an error as large as 20 per cent in the service component
         would throw GNP off by only 5 per cent.


Around 1966, Gallman began working with Thomas Weiss to create new estimates on
non-commodity production. These efforts led to the estimates of the value added of the
service sector measured at the census years from 1839 to 1899 reported in Volume 34 of
the Studies in Income and Wealth.33 Given that the new series used data from a far more
comprehensive collection of service activities, Gallman and Weiss regarded the Volume
34 estimates as “stronger” (p. 290) that those derived from the Volume 30 statistics. As
Gallman had anticipated, the new series was 5-18 percent lower than the Volume 30
current-price series for the “service” sector over the 1839-79 period and about 10 percent
higher over the 1889-1899 period. Consequently, the growth rate of service output as
revealed by the new series was faster than shown in the old, especially over the late
nineteenth century.34

Ottawa, Ont. in 1967. Together with the commodity production estimates in Volume 24, this paper
provides the basis for estimate GNP on a decadal basis over the nineteenth century on the sectoral income
or value-added side.
34
    The Volume 30 series as reported in Volume 34 actually was calculated as a residual of national product
minus net income originating from agriculture (including firewood production), manufacturing, mining,
and construction. In addition to services, it included fishing and forestry exclusive of firewood production.

           Although the subsequent articles built on the Volume 30 product series, the
revisions were generally not incorporated in the annual estimates. That is, the changes
were made as adjustments to the decadal averages rather than as revisions to the
underlying series. But I hope this discussion also makes it plain that the Volume 30
series form the core part of our best estimates of US GNP, NNP, and capital formation
before 1909. Thus they underlie much of what we “know” about nineteenth-century
American growth.


IV. Limitations on the Uses of the Estimates


           During his long career, Gallman circulated his unpublished Volume 30 series to
other scholars, but they always came with a warning. As a 1963 mimeo put it, "NOTE:
These figures should not be regarded as reliable, annual estimates. They were derived for
the purpose of computing decade averages and are supplied to interested technicians for
testing, not for analysis as annual series."35 While this warning was not included the June
1965 mimeo that is the source for the data presented here, there is little doubt that his
feelings had not changed substantially. When he provided his annual series for the 1834-
59 and 1869-1909 periods to Benjamin Friedman on 15 August 1995, Gallman wrote:
           the bases for these annual series are by no means strong, which is why the series
           have never been published. I needed series that would give me some way of
           placing the benchmark estimates—which are pretty strong—in the context of cycles
           and long swings. I thought (and think) that the annual interpolations are good
           enough for that, but not close analysis of the cycles, themselves. (Emphasis in the
           original).36


Gallman’s background materials underlying the “Chapter 3: Appendix US Estimates of
National Product” in Davis and Gallman, Evolving Financial Markets re-iterated these
concerns. These drafts noted that neither Simon Kuznets nor John Kendrick published
their annual GNP series. “Kuznets thought the series would be useful in the study of
trends and long swings, but he had doubts with respect to their ability to properly
describe business cycles. For this reason, he never published annual series for the years
before 1889. These annual series were available in mimeographed form, however, and

have been used by other scholars in their work on national product.” Gallman further
wrote that the explanation for publishing the Volume 30 series “only in the form of
decade average...was the same as Kuznets had used earlier.” 37
        Because the research community abhors a vacuum as much as nature does,
analyses of the annual Volume 30 series did appear in print. Where Robert Gallman
refused to go, others would.38 And eventually Gallman did allow Milton Friedman and
Anna Schwartz to publish a “somewhat revised” version of his series over the 1869-1909
period in their Monetary Trends in the United States and the United Kingdom.39
Essentially, they created a net product series from Gallman’s Volume 30 series by adding
inventory changes back in, estimating and deducting depreciation, and shifting the price
base to 1929. But as Gallman noted on occasion, his 1834-59 national product series
were never published in annual form.
        In an important sense, Gallman’s objective in creating his annual series was
exactly the opposite of business-cycle analysis. He wanted to control for short-run
fluctuations so they would not cloud our assessment of longer-run economic
performance. Simple comparisons of the benchmark estimates, available only on a five
or ten-year basis, risked comparing peaks with troughs. Table 5 provides a better sense
of differences resulting from using the benchmark estimates and the decadal averages.

Also see “Notes for the File on National Accounts, ” Gallman papers. Gallman is presumably referring to
Kuznets’ T-tables.
          Kuznets observed that “the series available as annual interpolators were most frequently the more
sensitive indexes and would yield annual series exaggerating the short-term changes.” His annual gross
product estimates “would not be acceptable measures of the amplitude of short-term changes” and,
therefore, “are not shown.” Simon Kuznets, Capital in the American Economy, Its Formation and

decadal averages are less volatile than those based on comparisons of the single-year
benchmarks.40


V. Comparisons with Other Estimates


         To assess the Volume 30 series more fully, it is useful to compare them with the
other available annual series. This is rather easily done for the ante-bellum period
because the only other annual series in general circulation are Thomas Berry’s.
(Actually, Berry authored several series; I focus on his 1978 and 1988 versions.)41 He
constructed income estimates for the 1789-1889 period using regression analysis and
back-projection. Basically, he found a number of long time-series of economic variables
extending from the time when reliable national product estimate exist back into the
earlier “statistical dark age.” Berry empirically estimated the relationship between these
variables and the national product series during the period of overlap and then used these
coefficients to back-cast the product series for the earlier period. This procedure is
problematic if these relationships shift over time, that is, if as almost every observer
attests, the US economy experienced significant structural change over this period.
Given that Gallman’s national product estimates over the 1834-59 period are based on a
firmer empirical foundation than Berry’s numbers, this comparison is best viewed as a
test of Berry.
         Figure 1 and 2 compares the annual constant-dollar product 1978 and 1988
estimates of Thomas Berry with those of Robert Gallman over the 1889-1834 and 1834-
59 periods, respectively.         For the early period, Figure 1 includes Gallman’s GNP
estimates for 1793, 1800, 1807, 1810, 1820, and 1830 from Table 3 from the “Economic
Growth and Structural Change in the Long Nineteenth Century” (which added estimates
for inventory changes). For the later period, Figure 2 compares the Gallman and Berry


40
   The contrast between the ante-bellum and post-bellum periods is largely the result of using benchmarks
every five years in the early period and every ten years in the later period. It also helps that few of post-
bellum benchmark years coincided with peaks or troughs of the business cycle.

series directly.42 For the 1834-59 period, Gallman’s series starts lower that either of the
Berry’s series and it displays considerably more variability than the Berry 1978 series but
less than the Berry 1988 series. Also note that for the earlier 1789-1834 period, Berry’s
figures are initially lower than Gallman’s, implying higher rates of growth.
        Making comparisons for the post-bellum period is more difficult because there
now exists a plethora of alternative series. Among the series pre-dating the Volume 30
series are those of Kuznets and Kendrick. Kendrick’s main contribution was to adjust the
concepts underlying Kuznets’s series to make the national product estimates more
comparable to the official Department of Commerce series.                     Specifically, Kendrick
treated the government sector differently.              This adjustment resulted in unimportant
changes over late nineteenth century because government spending was small. Figure 3
compares the real Kuznets Variant 1 annual GNP series with Gallman’s counterpart over
the 1869-1909 period using 1909 as the base date. (Note Kuznets aggregated using 1929
prices whereas Gallman employed 1860 prices.)                   As the discussion in Volume 30
indicated, the rate of growth implicit in the Kuznets series well exceeded that in the
Gallman series during the period after the Civil War.
        Post-dating the Volume 30 series are those of Christina D. Romer and of Nathan
S. Balke and Robert J. Gordon.43 Both series accepted the revisions that Gallman made
to Kuznets’ series and made further changes which affected the cyclical movements of
the series rather than its general trend.           Romer used regression analysis to replace
Kuznets’s less formal procedure for establishing the relationship between commodity
production and the output of the service sector. Balke-Gordon also used regression
analysis, in a different form, to estimate non-commodity production. In addition, they
developed new interpolators for the construction, transportation, and communications
sectors and constructed new annual deflators, based on movements in consumer prices.
        Comparing his series with the newcomers, Gallman concluded that the three
series “differ chiefly in the methods used to estimate non-commodity production, and the

differences in methods chiefly affect undulations in the series, not trends.” Figure 3
introduced above also includes Romer and Balke-Gordon constant-value GNP series. As
Gallman observed, there were important differences in the annual movements of the
series around 1894 and again in 1903/04, but that over the long run the series can be
regarded as telling roughly similar stories. He further argued that because only the
Volume 30 style series offered details regarding the composition of GNP, it retained
substantial value in any putative competition with the newcomers.44 Elsewhere Gallman
concluded the three series exhibited “quite similar” decennial rates of change. The most
visible discrepancies occurred in the 1870s when the Balke-Gordon series displays a
markedly different pattern from the Romer, Gallman, or Kuznets series.                    But note
correcting the typos appearing in Gallman’s railroad construction series in the 1875-77
period creates a series closer to Balke-Gordon during the second half of the 1870s.
        Another important point of comparison between the various national product
estimates for the nineteenth century is their implicit price deflators relating current-dollar
to constant-dollar GNP. Figure 4 graphs the deflators (set at 100 in 1909) implicit in the
Gallman, Kuznets Variant I, Balke-Gordon, and Romer product estimates for the post-
bellum period.45 The Gallman and Romer series follow roughly similar patterns. The
Balke-Gordon series, which is based primarily on the consumer price indices of Hoover
and Rees, displays a consistently different picture as the authors note.46 The Kuznets
series initially tracks the Balke-Gordon series, but shifts to the Gallman-Romer pattern
from the 1880s on. The year-to-year movements of all four series largely coincide.


VI. Extensions and Promising Areas for Future Research


        Gallman considered the annual estimates of nineteenth century US national
product, which he made in the 1960s, “incomplete” and he worked over the subsequent
decades to make improvements. A memo from 20 May 1985 highlighted the following
limitations with the Volume 30 national product series:


44
   “Notes for the File on National Accounts” pp. 7-8, Gallman papers.
45
    Gallman did not create any current-value estimates for the 1834-59 period that should be consider
“finished work,” so no implicit price deflators exist for the ante-bellum period.
46
   Balke and Gordon, “Estimation,” pp. 71-75.


                                                 16
        “(a) They are missing one element of investment—changes in inventories.
       (b) There is a gap in the series from 1859 to 1869.
       (c) The current price components of the series are intermittent before the Civil War.
       (d) The series do not extend back of 1834.
       (e) There are no net national product estimates.
       (f) Also, it would be helpful to complete estimates expressed in, say, 1929 prices to facilitate
       long-term analysis.”47


Gallman and his research assistants engaged in a project in the summer of 1985 to
address several of these issues, specifically (a), (b) and (c). With the exception of the
estimation of inventory changes, these initiatives apparently did not reach such a finished
stage as to merit incorporation in the annual series Gallman sent to scholars in the 1990s.
        Most of this work in the mid-1980s focused on adjustments relevant to Gallman’s
capital stock project. For example, to create estimates comparable to those of Raymond
Goldsmith and to check his own census-based capital stock estimates, Gallman pursued
the perpetual inventory approach of accumulating and depreciating annual investment
flows.48 As part of this research, he produced and published a variety of new annual
series on investment in manufactured producers’ durables and construction.                            This
endeavor required filling the gap in his annual product series during the Civil War decade
and projecting the series back from 1834 to 1790 (addressing points (b) and (d) above).
For this purpose, Gallman relied on Berry’s 1978 national product series, which explains
in part his thoroughgoing analysis of this work. Gallman concluded that the Berry series
suffered from two weaknesses: (1) investment was derived as residual of product minus
consumption; and (2) “the empirical bases for the Berry estimates become ever more
fragile as the series extends into the early nineteenth century and the late eighteenth.”49
This project produced several new investment series, but there is little or no evidence
Gallman believed that these should replace the figures in his Volume 30 series. Indeed
regarding the perpetual inventory estimates, he wrote: “I publish the annual data with
some misgiving – in view of the weaknesses of the evidence on which they are based—
and refuse to warrant them for any particular purpose. Future users are on their own and

are asked not to blame me if the series do not perform up to expectations. On the other
hand, I am willing to accept the credit if they do.”50
        Gallman also actively but intermittently worked to revise his transportation
investment series. The original Volume 30 estimates of the value of railroad construction
relied on the work of Melville Ulmer, which never truly satisfied Gallman. He reported
using Ulmer’s cost index with “some hesitancy.”51 In the mid-1980s he set his research
assistants on the task of re-calculating ante-bellum canal and railroad investment. Part of
the goal was to incorporate Fishlow’s superior construction cost estimates. Part was to
correct problems in Cranmer’s canal investment series, which as Segal noted included
some of the Pennsylvania Mainline System’s early investments in railroads.                       More
generally, Gallman wanted to derive series on railroad construction consistent with his
decadal railroad capital stock estimates.           A notebook from the mid-1980s entitled
“Measurement of U.S. Nineteenth Century National Product” concluded that these
adjustments were “not of great quantitative significance.”52
        Spurred on by communications with Richard Sutch in 1993/94, Gallman re-
visited his attempts to revise capital formation estimates in American railroads over the
late nineteenth century.53 The nature of the problem in the annual Vol. 30 series is
apparent in the constant-value railroad construction series appearing in Table 2. In the

components, Gallman used Ulmer’s estimates of gross capital expenditures (excluding
land) by steam railroads and then subtracted estimates of equipment spending based on
Shaw’s output data to derive his series of annual gross investment for railroad
construction.54     This procedure apparently yielded negative residuals in the 1896-98
period, leading Gallman to replace these estimates with the zeros shown in the Table.
(As noted above, the original series also contain errors resulting from misplacing the
decimal point during the 1875-77 period.) As Figure 5 illustrates, the timing of the
original residual-based series is poorly correlated with numbers of mileage constructed
available from Railway Age.55 Over the 1869-1909 period, the correlation coefficient
was only 0.07.
        Based on better data on the cost of construction from Albert Fishlow and
information on the number of miles of railroads built, Gallman produced in 1994/96 a
revised series on railroad construction investment over the 1870-1909 period.56 Although
Gallman did create some GNP series using the revised figures, it is questionable whether
these data should be considered a “finished product.” From personal conversations, I
know that Gallman believed that re-estimating railroad investment was a highly fruitful
subject for future research. For the convenience of those who would prefer to use the
revised series (and avoid the obvious problems inherent in the original railroad series), I
have included Gallman’s 1994/96 revisions for railroad construction in Table 2. Again,
the effects on the annual GNP estimates are small.
        Throughout his work Gallman relied on what he considered the best available
price series, chiefly Dorothy Brady’s numbers. But he clearly noted that the “prices
count a lot” and having “more reliable” price series would improve our ability to form
                                                                   57
better estimates of both constant and current GNP.                      The differences between the

   Based on Series Q 329, 321, and 287 from Bicentennial Edition Historical Statistics. The Q 329 series
had an unexplained gap between 1879 and 1893. Gallman instead interpolated using the changes in Q 321,
and 287 series, the number of railroad miles operated. The correlation with the Railway Age series is close,
but not exact. Using his improved capital stock estimates, Gallman created a revised series on railroad
construction investment over the 1870-1909 period. He allocated his decadal estimates of real gross
investments in railways over the years based on the miles of track constructed annually (or on the changes
in railroad miles operated). Letter to Sutch, 14 Jan. 1994 and spreadsheet dated 27 Jan. 1996, Gallman

movements of the implicit price deflators displayed in Figure 4 highlight the importance
of treating prices with care.
         Another area that seems ripe for reconsideration is the estimation of the product
of the service sector, especially for the ante-bellum period.                     As noted above, the
estimation of non-commodity production and its impact on measured volatility figure
prominently in the debates between Romer, Balke-Gordon, and others.                              Moreover,
Gallman considered the service sector estimates for the antebellum sector the weakest in
the series and worked with Thomas Weiss to improve the benchmark estimates in their
Volume 34 paper. The Volume 34 decadal estimates, which include data on distribution,
transportation, public utilities, banking, insurance, professional and personal services,
education, government, and housing, could usefully serve as benchmarks for more
comprehensive interpolations and extrapolations than those conducted to estimate the
service flows in Volume 30.58
         A further area that warrants further examination is the estimation of inventory
changes over the 1870-1909 period.                  During the 1990s, Gallman endeavored to
supplement his decadal inventory estimates with annual figures (see below).                               By
differencing the inventory stocks, Gallman formed estimates of annual inventory
investment, which he added to his Volume 30 series to create a GNP series closer to the
conventional definition.          The work to estimate inventory levels was conducted,
principally by his research assistants, in the mid-1990s and has not been subject to the
same scrutiny as the Volume 30 numbers.


          The common practice of presenting real GNP, nominal GNP, and the implicit price deflator as
separate columns in tables misstates their interdependence. Obviously any two aggregate series yields the
third, but the procedures used to the aggregates typically involve combinations of all three. That is, for
some components, price indices and quantities are multiplied to derive values; for others, quantities are
estimated from values divided by a price series; and for still others, implicit prices are derived from values
divided by quantities. This implies that decisions about the price concepts must be made in the process of
generating the real product series.
58
   My understanding of the procedure used to derive the ante-bellum service flows is as follows: Gallman
had estimates for the 1869 value of services in 1860 prices and three extrapolating series: (a) the value of
churches (available in 1870 and 1860); (b) the value of tax receipts of state and local governments (running
back to 1849); and (c) the value of residential housing (with existing estimates available back to 1850 and
Gallman’s extrapolation to 1840). He first converted all of the extrapolators into 1860 dollars and then
uses all three to estimate the 1859 benchmark from the 1869 value. Then he used real values of (b) and (c)
to derive the 1849 benchmark and finally (c) alone to calculate the 1839 benchmarks. To interpolate
between the 1839, 1849, and 1859 levels, Gallman employed Gottlieb’s estimates of the stock of residential
housing (which must be a fairly smooth series) and to extrapolate back of 1839, he used his lumber series
(pp. 57-60, 63-64).


                                                     20
           An additional concern centers on how the inventory stocks were estimated. They
were estimated separately the stocks of animals (cattle, swine, sheep, horses, and mules)
and of other goods (imported goods, crops, mined and manufactured goods).                              The
procedure for estimating inventories of other goods followed “one employed by Kuznets
(National Product Since 1869, 1946, 228) (where) inventories were taken as a fixed
fraction of the value of imports and the value of outputs of the agricultural,
manufacturing, and mining sectors.”59 Note that this procedure, while reasonable over
long periods, builds properties into the high-frequency time-series that may be
misleading.        Specifically, it assumes that the relationship between production and
inventory accumulation does not vary over the business cycle.
           Also note that if the ratios translating output into inventories fail to capture the
effects of improvements in transportation and communications or organizational changes
(such as the rise of modern business enterprise), these inventory figures may paint
misleading picture of secular growth. As the Volume 30 paper observed that:


                    “Kuznets’ estimates of changes in inventories are, in considerable measure,
           extrapolations on rates of change of output. Since we have altered these rates of change,
           the inventory figures should be adjusted. But Kuznets himself has limited confidence in
           the procedures he used. Application of these procedures to pre-Civil War data would
           appear to be even more dubious, but no other method is presently available.
           Consequently, we decided to leave this component out of both the pre- and post-Civil
                       60
           War series”

I leave it to others to judge whether to include or exclude the recently added series on
annual inventory changes.            This discussion serves to highlight that assembling and
analyzing data on the evolution of inventory-output relationships over the nineteenth
century is a potentially high-value area for future research.
           Finally, Gallman made a number of estimates of the value of non-conventional
output, including the value of improvements to farmland and of home production
activities.     To evaluate economic performance over the nineteenth century requires
paying full attention to these important activities and to the shifts between market and
non-market production.

VII. Concluding Remarks


        The Volume 30 series were the product of decades of painstaking labor and
careful judgment by one of the best scholars ever to work in the field of American
economic history. They form a key part of our best estimates of nineteenth-century US
GNP, NNP, and capital formation and thus underlie much of what we know about
America’s economic growth. In his modest, scholarly way, Robert Gallman wanted to
make his Volume 30 estimates better before releasing them to the world. Even without
all the improvements he hoped to make, they remain among the best numbers we have for
this period.     Gallman worried that making his annual series available would only
encourage their further misuse by business-cycle analysts, which angered him greatly.
Again to address this concern, I ask that those using the series presented in this paper
include the following statement in their citation: “These data were not constructed for
analysis as annual series.”

where he express concern that using the inventory-output ratios from the 1920s “may have introduced a
false stability” into key economic relationships.

Notes: Examination of the underlying spreadheets converting current-value railroad investment estimates into constant-value estimates reveals a decimal-place error occurs in the original
calculations for 1875-77. The affected series are indicated by underlining. The corrected series adjusted railroad construction, total construction, total capital formation, and GNP.
The Gallman's revised railroad construction estimates may be used to replace this original series. The revised inventory series differs by rounding and errors in the underlying data.
