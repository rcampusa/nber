This paper surveys major issues in the theory of tax incidence. These
include the incidence of taxes in dynamic as well as static economies and
open as well as closed economies. The survey does not represent a corrDrehensive
review of the literature, rather it is offered to the reader as a pedoqogical
piece that may be of use in teaching the theory of tax incidence.

INTRODUCTION

     The incidence of taxes is a fundamental question in public economics.

The study of tax incidence is, broadly defined, the study of the effects of

tax policies on the distribution of economic welfare. It bridges both the

positive and normative aspects of public economics. Studying tax incidence

requires characterizing the effects of alternative tax measures on economic

equilibria. Tax policy decisions are based, at least in part, on their

effects on the distribution of economic welfare. It is, therefore, little

wonder that the study of tax incidence has attracted the attention of economic

theorists, at least since Ricardo's discussion of taxes on rent. Certainly

the study of the incidence of different types of tax policies in various

economic environments continues to be an area of active research.

     The distinctive contribution of economic analysis to the study of tax

incidence has been the recognition that the burden of taxes is not necessarily

borne by those upon whom they are levied. In general, the introduction of

taxes, or changes in the mix of taxes, changes the economy's equilibrium.

Prices of goods and rewards to factors a'e altered by taxes. In assessing the

incidence of tax policies, it is necessary to take account of these effects.

Changes in prices can lead to the shifting of taxes. Thus, for example, a tax

on the hiring of labor by business may be shifted backwards to laborers in the

form of lower wages or forward to consumers in the form of higher prices. The

measurement of tax incidence is not an accounting exercise; rather it is an

analytical characterization of economic equilibria under alternative

assumptions about taxation.

     Tax incidence -is a part of the very broad study of how exogenous

interventions affect the economy and is necessarily predicated on a theory

of economic equilibrium. As such, tax incidence conclusions are critically

dependent on which theory of economic equilibrium is chosen. We follow the

main thrust of the literature in studying the effects of taxes in competitive

economies where markets clear. This assumption has been adopted extensively

not so much for its realism as because of the absence of widely accepted,

fully articulated alternatives to the competitive paradigm.

     Even maintaining the assumption of perfect competition and market

clearing, the question of tax incidence has been approached in many ways.

This is a consequence of both the richness of the problem and the generality

of models of competitive equilibrium. The incidence of a wide variety of tax

instruments ranging from estate taxes, to excise taxes, to the corporate tax

is of interest. Incidence has many dimensions that have attracted attention.

These include the effects of taxes on the distribution of factor incomes, the

degree of income inequality, the welfare of members of different generations,

and the consumers of different products. Given the choice of model and the

issue of concern, tax incidence results are generally ambiguous without

additional restrictions on the precise nature of preferences and technology.

As Arrow and Hahn (1971) emphasize, without further assumptions, virtually all

comparative static experiments have ambiguous effects in the standard model of

competitive equilibrium.

     Our survey of the tax incidence literature is organized as follows. The

first section reviews traditional approaches to the study of tax incidence.

These include partial equilibrium analyses and studies based on the judgmental
                                     -3-



allocation of tax burdens to different population groups. A number of issues

 in the tax incidence literature, including the proper alternative to be

considered in defining the incidence of a tax and the dimensions along which

incidence should be measured, are also discussed. The second section

introduces the general equilibrium analysis of tax incidence. A general

equilibrium approach is necessary to treat the incidence of taxes which impact

on large parts of the economy. The sensitivity of judgments about the

incidence of taxation to a large number of elasticities is stressed.

     The third section takes up the incidence of taxes in open economies.

These may be thought of either as regions within a single country, or as

different nations. We show that the incidence of alternative taxes hinges on

what is assumed mobile. We also discuss the controversial question of the

incidence of local property taxes.

     The fourth section places the analysis of tax incidence in a dynamic

context. This step is important for several reasons. The long run incidence

of any tax change will depend critically on its effects on capital

accumulation and the resulting marginal productivities of capital and labor.

The short run burdens borne by the owners of productive assets will depend, in

large part, on the instantaneous revaluation of these assets arising from both

current and anticipated future tax changes. Perhaps most importantly,

studying the intergenerational incidence of tax changes (the tax burden on

successive generations) requires a dynamic model.

I.      PRELIMINARIES


A.      The Partial Equilibrium Analysis of Tax Incidence

        Many of the fundamental principles of tax incidence may be illustrated in

the simplest partial equilibrium setting. We therefore begin by considering

the partial equilibrium analysis of an excise tax on a product. As discussed

below, for partial equilibrium analysis to be appropriate, it is necessary

that the product in question have a market that is small relative to the

entire economy. The        analysis   is depicted in Figure 1.   In the absence of

taxation, equilibrium is attained where supply equals demand and the

equation:


(1.1)        D(p) = S(p)


is satisfied. Now consider the introduction of an excise tax at rate T.              If

the tax is collected from buyers, the new equilibrium will satisfy the

condition that:


(1.2)        D(p!÷T) =   S(p')

while if the tax is collected from sellers, the new equilibrium will satisfy

the condition that:


(1.3)        D(p") = S(p"—T)


Comparing equations (1.2) and (1.3), it is clear that the determination of the

equilibrium quantity, the price paid by consumers, and the net of tax receipts

of producers does not depend on which side of the market the tax is levied;

                                               —5—


 i.e., Pr' =   p'     +   T.   Diagramatically, the imposition of a tax can be analyzed

as a shift in the demand curve facing suppliers, as in Figure 1, or as a shift

in the supply curve facing consumers. The resulting equilibrium is the same

in both instances. This principle, that the incidence of a tax does not

depend on which side of the market it is levied, carries over to much more

general contexts and underlies the general equilibrium tax equivalence results

that we discuss below.

        It follows immediately from this tax equivalence principle that the

ultimate incidence of a tax cannot be assessed simply by looking at here the

tax is proximately levied. For, as we have seen, shifting the tax assessment

between consumers and producers has no real effects. The real equilibrium is

invariant to whom the government requires mail in the tax payment.

        In order to examine the incidence of an excise tax we begin by

characterizing the change in equilibrium that results from the imposition of

the tax. For convenience we think of the tax as being collected from

consumers. Differentiating (1.2) yields:


 14         42        ____
            dT




where 0' = dD(p)           and s' = dS(p)    More conveniently, we can write:
            dp                       dp



(1 5)             =
            d-r
                      sD
where 0 represents the elasticity of demand, and
                                                            i   represents   the elasticity

of supply. At this point we are ready to assess the incidence of an excise
                                       -6-


tax. Consider the changes in consumers' and producers' surplus arising from

introducing a small tax. For a small tax the change in consumer surplus

equals, minus the change in the consumer price times the initial quantity

demanded, and the change in producer surplus equals the change in the producer

price times the initial quantity supplied. Hence, we have:


             dCs    _715D(p)
             di -
(1 6
                     sD
and


             dPs
(1.7)        di - ______
                    sD
where Cs and Ps represent, respectively, consumers' and producers' surplus.

Note that for a small tax change starting with no tax, minus the sum of the

changes in consumers' and producers' surplus equals the tax revenue since

D(p)=S(p), and the change in tax revenue equals dTS(p). In terms of Figure 1

the change in consumer surplus is the area abcd, and the change in producer

surplus is dcef. For very small taxes the sum of these taxes is essentially

abef, the tax revenue.

        Equations (1.6) and (1.7) illustrate a fundamental principle that will

recur frequently in our discussion of tax incidence. Taxes tend to be borne

by inelastic suppliers or demanders. It is instructive to consider the

limiting cases of (1.6) and (1.7).     If demand is completely inelastic or

supply perfectly elastic, consumers will bear the entire burden of an excise

tax. Conversely, if supply is perfectly inelastic or demand is perfectly

elastic, the entire excise tax will be borne by suppliers. More generally,
                                     -7--




taxes are borne by those who can not easily adjust. The greater buyers'

abilities to substitute other commodities for the taxed commodity, the greater

their ability to shift taxes. Likewise, if producers have no fixed factors

and can leave an industry where taxes are being levied, their supply curve is

perfectly elastic and the tax must be borne by consumers. For if sellers were

forced to bear the tax, they would earn a sub-normal rate of return leading

then to cease production. Hence, in the new equilibrium producers receive the

same price for producing as in the old equilibrium, while the price paid by

consumers r-ises by the full amount of the tax.

     While this analysis accurately describes the effects of introducing an

excise tax in a small market where there are no pre—existing distortions, it

-is difficult to extend to other cases. In general, shifts in the demand curve

such as would be caused by a tax change will be associated with changes in the

demand for other products. This will alter their prices leading to changes in

factor prices which will affect the position of both the supply and demand

curves in Figure 1.   In considering taxes which affect a large part of the

economy, it is therefore necessary to adopt a general equilibrium perspective

rather than the partial equilibrium view taken above. Two principles which

emerge from this partial equilibrium analysis will remain valid. First, tax

incidence does not depend on which side of a market the tax is assessed.

Second, taxes will be shifted by those agents and factors that are more

elastic in supply or demand.


B.   Methodological Issues

     Before turning to the general equilibrium analysis of the effects of
                                               -8-



alternative tax instruments, it is useful to comment on several important

methodological issues which arise in the study of tax incidence. The first

question that arises is how should incidence be measured. A natural, but

difficult to implement answer is that the incidence of a tax change can be

assessed by looking at the compensating variation associated with the tax

change for each participant in the economy. As discussed in detail in Alan

Auerbach's contribution to this handbook (Chapter 2), the compensating

variation provides a dollar measure of the impact of a given tax change on

individual economic welfare. It equals the additional income needed to

restore the consumer to his or her initial utility level given a change in

consumer prices. The compensating variation may be computed as follows:


(1.8)      CV =                 -
                     e(q1,u0)       e(q0,u0)

where e(    )   is    the minimum expenditure function, which depends on the consumer

price vector q, and the initial utility, u0. In (1.8) q1 is the post tax

price vector, and q0 is the pre-tax price vector. Alternatively, similar

measures discussed by Auerbach, such as the equivalent variation that replaces

   in (1.8) with the post tax utility level, may be used in assessing tax

reforms.

        While the computation of the compensating variation associated with a

tax change for each affected person reveals its incidence, actual compensating

variations are not explicitly calculated in most theoretical or empirical work

on tax incidence. In part, this is because of the difficulty involved in

specifying individual expenditure functions. It is also due to the fact that

most studies of tax incidence focus on the effects of taxes on different
                                    -9-



classes of individuals. Studies concerned with vertical equity focus on the

differential effects of taxes on after tax incomes of persons with varying

levels of pre-tax income. Much of the literature studies the effects of

alternative tax policies on the after tax payments to different factors. This

is thought to indicate how different tax changes affect workers, capitalists,

land owners, etc. Other dimensions along which incidence is sometimes

measured include region and date of birth. Intergenerational issues have been

a particularly active subject of research in recent years. Studies of

incidence along all these dimensions are best thought of as providing

indications of salient features in the distribution of compensating variations

associated with alternative tax policies.

     In the partial equilibrium incidence calculation described above no

attention was devoted to the question of what is done with the revenue raised

by the excise tax. Specifying the use of the revenue was unnecessary given

the partial equilibrium character of the analysis. Implicitly it was assumed

that the revenue was not spent on the taxed good, but no more needed to be

specified. In general equilibrium the effects of a tax change will depend on

whether the tax is used to finance changes in government spending, rebates to

consumers, or changes in other taxes. Thus the incidence of a tax cannot be

considered in isolation. Its incidence must be assessed along with a feasible

disposition of tax revenue. This has led to the development of several

different incidence concepts in the literature. The term differential

incidence is used to describe comparisons of the incidence of different tax

instruments that raise the same amount of revenue. The term balanced budget

incidence is used to describe the effects of increased government spending
                                       -10-


financed by increases in the tax under consideration. No single concept is

uniformly appropriate in assessing the incidence of a tax. The appropriate

assumption about the use of tax revenue will depend on the nature of the tax

reform being studied. In discussing tax incidence, however, it is critical to

be clear about the nature of the experiment being considered.


C.   Empirical Incidence Evaluations

     Analytical work on tax incidence in various economic models of the type

surveyed in this chapter has been complemented by empirical studies that have

sought to evaluate the overall incidence of the tax system. Major studies of

this type include Pechman and Okner (1974), Musgrave and Musgrave (1976), and

Pechman (1984). Their approach and that of other authors working -in this

tradition is to postulate an incidence for each type of tax, and then use

microdata on individuals to calculate the distribution of total tax burdens by

income class. The striking finding of all these studies is that despite the

apparent progressivity of the income tax, the share of income paid in taxes

does not rise with income. The total tax system appears to be roughly

proportional over much of the income range.

     A number of problems have been raised with empirical incidence studies of

this sort. Perhaps most serious is the need to make assumptions about the

ultimate incidence of various types of taxes. As our subsequent analysis will

make clear, this is very difficult to determine. And conclusions about the

effects of taxation on the distribution of income can be no better than the

judgments about the incidence of individual taxes on which they are based.

Devanajour, Fullerton, and Musgrave (1981) do, however, provide some evidence
                                     —11—


suggesting the results of judgmental studies are fairly close to those of full

scale general equilibrium simulation exercises of the type described below.

     A related problem with these incidence evaluations -is that they measure

taxes collected by the government from various income classes, but these tax

collections may differ substantially from the tax burdens that are imposed on

them. A good example is provided by the municipal interest exclusion in the

United States. Taxpayers in high tax brackets tend to hold municipal bonds

which are tax—free. But these bonds have lower yields than taxable bonds.

Hence high bracket tax payers bear a burden imposed by the tax system even

without transferring revenue to the government. Similar reasoning applies to

investments -in any tax favored activity.

     An understanding of the distributional impact of the tax system must be

predicated on an understanding of its general equilibrium effects. We now

turn to this question.



II. STATIC GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM MODELS OF TAX INCIDENCE


     Static models of tax incidence take the economy's aggregate supplies of

productive factors, such as physical capital, as given, and consider changes

in equilibrium prices arising from commodity and factor taxes. While ignoring

the -intertemporal issue of human and nonhuman capital formation, static models

can provide considerable insight into the incidence of taxation in the short

run, i.e., before capital stocks have adjusted to changes -in after tax prices.

In addition, many of the conclusions of static tax analysis can be directly

applied to the case of long run dynamic incidence.
                                            —12—


        In contrast to the implicit model underlying Figure 1, in which producers

and consumers of goods are distinct agents, this section examines models in

which all agents have identical consumption preferences, i.e., the producers

(actually the owners of productive factors) are also the consumers. Hence,

interest shifts from the question of whether producers or consumers bear the

burden of a tax to the question of the division of the tax burden among the

owners of productive factors.

        As one would expect, the aggregate supply elasticities of and demand

elasticities for particular factors play key roles in the analysis of the

incidence of uniform commodity and factor taxation. In the case of

differential commodity taxes or industry-specific factor taxes the structure

of industrial demands for factors is of great importance for incidence; the

ultimate incidence of industry-specific factor taxes depends not only on the

demand conditions in taxed industries, which will typically attempt to reduce

their demand for the taxed factor, but also on the demand conditions for that

factor in untaxed industries which will absorb factors released from the taxed

sector.

A.      Tax Incidence in a One Sector General Equilibrium Model

        1.   Factor Taxes

        A one sector general equilibrium model is useful for highlighting

several of the main results in static tax incidence analysis. Let X be the

economy's single commodity, which is produced using labor, L, and capital, K.

The linear homogeneous production function is given by:


(2.1)        X =   F(K,L)

where FL >    0,   and FK >   0.   The supply of capital, K, is totally inelastic in
                                         —13—


the short run, but the supply of labor is positively related to the real wage,

W/P, where W is the wage rate, and P is the price of good X:



(2.2)        L =   L(W/P),

where Lt(W/P) > 0.        In competitive equilibrium, marginal revenue products are

equated to factor costs, giving:


(2.3)        PFL(K,L) =      W




(2.4)        PFK(K,L) =      r,

where r is the rental rate on capital. Equating labor supply and labor demand

in (2.3) determines the equilibrium real wage and the equilibrium level of

labor; i.e.:


(2.5)        FL(L(W/P),K) =W/P


Given the equilibrium level of L, r/P, the real rental on capital is deter-

mined by (2.4).

        Consider first the incidence of a tax at rate T on the rental of capital.

Equation (2.4) becomes:


(2.4')       PFK =   r(1+T)

Since neither the supply nor the demand for labor are affected by this tax,

the equilibrium values of W/P, L, and FK are unaffected. Capital, in this

case, bears the full burden of the tax, since its real rental, r/P, falls from

FK to FK/1+T. The change in the real rents received by owners of capital is
                                                           -14-


(FK -    ((FK/1+T))K which equals T(rK/P), the real taxes paid on the rental of
capital. The entire incidence of the tax falls on capital since it is

perfectly inelastic in supply to the economy and since it is taxed at the same

rate in all its uses, which in this case is a single use, namely the

production of X.

        The results are different in the case of taxing elastically supplied

labor at rate T. Producers now equate the marginal revenue product of labor

to the after tax cost of hiring labor, i.e.:


(2.3')             =   W(1+T)


The demand and supply relations, equations (2.3') and (2.2) respectively,

determine the new equilibrium wage. The percentage change in W/P arising from

an increase in T, evaluated at T= 0, is given by:


              (W/P)                     D
               aT           —   _______
                            —
                   W                S         D
                ()              T -fl


where      is the (positive) elasticity of labor supply, and                        is the (negative,

since FLL < 0) elasticity of labor demand. Evaluated at T = 0, the change in

real tax revenue (T()L) is simply ()L. The marginal losses in rents to labor,
(W/P)
           L, and to capital,
                                .

                                                           K, expressed as a ratio of the marginal

tax revenue, ()L, are given by:

Note that the two ratios sum to -1, indicating that the full incidence of the

tax falls on either capital or labor.

        If labor supply -is               perfectly   inelastic, r = 0, labor bears the full

burden of the tax; i.e., the right hand sides of (2.7) and (2.8) are -1 and 0,

respectively. This result also holds if the demand for labor is perfectly

elastic (riD =         cc). At       the opposite extreme labor may be perfectly elastic in

supply (riS =      cc), or    the demand for the labor may be perfectly inelastic

(n0   = 0),   in which case capital bears the full burden of the tax. Note that

capital always bears some burden of the tax provided S 0 and                             cc.   In
general, the larger the supply elasticity and the smaller the demand

elasticity, the larger will be the share of the tax burden shifted to

capital.

        The elasticity of labor demand is related to the degree of

substitutability between capital and labor. Equation (2.9) expresses this

relationship for the case of a linear homogeneous production function, where a

is the elasticity of substitution of capital for labor with respect to

increases in the wage—rental ratio, and                        is capital's share of output

(FKK/F):



(2.9)              =   - a/AK


        As a -.   cc, i.e.,    as capital and labor become closer substitutes in

production,            -   cc Alternatively,            as a -+ 0 and capital and labor approach
                                          -16-


perfect complementarity,       -   0.   Intuitively, when a =   , capital    and labor

are perfect substitutes; hence, their after tax user costs to competitive

firms must be identical, and W(1+T) =       r.   But, assuming constant returns to

scale, the production function in this case is of the form F(K,L) =           a(K+L),
where the constant a equals both FK and FL. Since FK = a =         r/P   =   (W/P)(1+T),
W/P falls by the full amount of the tax.         If, on the other hand, a =    0, firms
view their input as a fixed combination of capital and labor. From their

perspective a tax on labor is identical to a tax on capital as long as it

raises the cost of the fixed capital and labor input bundle by the same

percentage. Since any reduction in the real wage, W/P, received by labor will

reduce the supply of labor (assuming L'(W/P) > 0) and make part of the capital

stock redundant, the equilibrium involves no change in W/P and a fall in r/P

such that the loss to capitalists in real rents equals the tax revenue.


     2.   Commodity Taxation

     A proportional tax at rate T on the consumption of good X creates a

divergence between the price, P. paid by the consumer and the price P/1+T

received by producers. With a consumption tax the factor demand conditions

are written:



(2.4")    (j-) FK(L(W/P),K) =
                                   r


(2.5")         FL(L(W/P),K) =      W




Multiplying (5') and (6') by (1+T) reveals that a proportional consumption tax

is structurally equivalent to a uniform proportional tax on factor inputs. A
                                                         —17--



further equivalence result can be demonstrated by rewriting (2.5') and (2.6')

in terms of the producer price q, where q = P/1+T, and the tax rate T*, where

     = T/1+T:



(2 4"')      q FK(L(W(1T)),K) =                    r


(2.5"')      qF(L(lT*)),K) =w


Equations (2.5"') and (2.6"') describe the identical tax structure as a urHform
proportional income tax at rate i-* on wages and capital rents; here r is the

pretax return to capital paid by firms, while r(1_T*) is the post (income) tax

return to capital.

        The equivalence in a static model between a uniform consumption tax1

a uniform tax on factor returns (a value added tax), and an income tax is a

general result that applies independent of the number of sectors and factors

(Break (1974), Musgrave (1959), and McLure (1975)).1

        Using (2.4") and (2.5") the incidence of the commodity tax expressed as a

fraction of real marginal tax revenues (X) is:


             a(W/P)      L                     D
                T

bear the burden of the tax -in proportion to their respective shares of output.

If       = 0 or T1S =   , capital              bears the entire burden of the tax.

B.   Tax Incidence in a Two Sector General Equilibrium Model

     The static two sector general equilibrium model permits the analysis

of sector-specific factor taxes. Harberger's (1962) seminal analysis of the

incidence of the corporate income tax focused attention on the elasticity of

supplies of domestically mobile factors to particular industries, with such

mobile factors able to switch industries in an attempt to avoid taxation. The

research also identifies industry-specific factor demand conditions as

critical for determining the incidence of a sector-specific factor tax. As

indicated in the discussion of one sector factor tax incidence, factor demand

elasticities are closely related to elasticities of substitution in

production.

     A variety of taxes can be analyzed in this model. A thorough review -is

presented in McLure (1975) who also discusses a number of tax equivalence

propositions. Since both capital and labor are assumed to be inelast-ically

supplied, the incidence of a general factor tax is trivial. It is borne

entirely by the taxed factor. The incidence of excise taxes on one of the

commodities is more complex and -is considered below. We focus on the case of

a sector-specific tax such as the corporate tax. The two sector general

equilibrium model is the simplest framework in which such a tax can be

investigated.

     The two sector general equilibrium model highlights the wide range of

theoretically possible effects of a tax even in a very simple setting. A tax

may actually benefit the taxed factor, or the taxed factor may lose more than

the amount of tax revenue collected. Intermediate outcomes are also possible.
                                            -19-


     1.   Assumptions of the Model

     The two factor, two sector model examined by Ilarberger assumes that

economy-wide supplies of the two factors, capital and labor, are perfectly

inelastic, but that capital and labor are perfectly mobile between sectors.

The two industries are perfectly competitive, and the production functions of

both industries exhibit constant returns to scale. The assumption that

workers, owners of capital, and the government have identical homothetic

preferences ensures that the redistribution between the three demanders of

goods arising from the sector specific factor tax has no impact on the

aggregate demands for the two goods. The analysis thus abstracts from changes

in the relative demands for the two goods that could arise if workers',

capitalists', and the government's preferences differ.


     2.   The Model

     Denote the two industries as X and Y. The constant returns assumption

permits the production function to be written in intensive form:


(2.11)    X =
                 Lf(k)     =
                               Kf(k)/k
          Y =              =
                 Lyg(ky)       Kyg(ky)/ky

where L and Ls, are, respectively, the quantities of labor used to produce

goods X and V. and k and k are the respective capital-labor ratios in

industries X and V. The function f( ) expresses the ratio of output of X to

Lx, and g( )    is,   similarly, output of V per worker in industry V. The respec-

tive economy-wide supplies of labor and capital, Land K, must sum to their

respective demands:
                                                  -20-




              aiX + a1Y =             L
 (2.12)
              akXX + akYY = K,


where aix, akX, a1. and akY are input-output coefficients and are implicitly

defined in (2.11). The equalities, required by competition in factor markets,

between marginal revenue products and post tax factor costs may be written as:

                       w+(r+ikx )k  r+ kx
.        '     x   -
                              f
                                x
                                  —
                                     f'
                       w+rk
              p =
               y        g             g'


where        and P,, are the respective prices of goods X and V1 W and r are the

respective net rentals to labor and capital, and Tkx is the tax on the rental

of capital in the X industry.

     The assumption of identical homothetic preferences of workers, capital-

ists and the government implies that aggregate demands can be written as:


(2.14)       X =
                   m(P/P)
                                  •   I

               =
                   x"y
where I is total disposable income of the private sector plus the government's

tax revenues, i.e.,


(2.15)       I = wi. + rK + TkXKx



The expressions (2.12), (2.13), and (2.14) provide eight equations in eight

unknowns, X, V. w, r,                                      One of these equations is, however,

                                                                 —21-


the expressions in (2.14) satisfy:



(2.16)         p x + P V =
                x
                                        I   = wL.    + rK + T K
                                                                    kxx
                           y

The first equality in (2.13) implies, P,<X = wL> + (r+TkX)KX. This expression

and (2.16) imply: P,, =                                        the third equation in (2.13).

     3.        The Incidence of a Tax on Capital in Industry X

     Following the derivation in Atkinson and Stigiitz (1980), which employs

Jones' (1965) technique of considering "equations of change," one can reduce

the eight equations in (2.12), (2.13) and (2.14) to three equations in the

percentage change in the three ratios: X/Y, x'y' and w/r. Let z denote the

proportional change in a variable z. From (2.13) we have P><f' =                                                      + Tkx
                                                                                                               Pg'

Expression (2.13) also implies                                            =             and       =           '"•   Total

relative price of X rises with increases in the wage-rental ratio if labor's

cost share in X exceeds its cost share in V.

where the bracketed term on the right hand side of (2.25) multiplying (w-r)
                                                                 -24-


is positive since (Alx_Akx) and (0<-0,) have the same sign.3

         In evaluating the incidence of the tax, we choose I, the level of total

nominal income, as the numeraire. With I fixed, we have from (2.16):



(2.26)          dw•L + drK = -K dT
                                                    x kx


The right hand side of (2.24) is the marginal tax revenue evaluated at Tkx = 0.

The equation indicates that the burden of the tax equals the burden on labor,

dwL, plus the burden on capital, drK. This equation can be rewritten as:



            0                              K dT
(2.26')
                2

                                              kx
                                                    r
             k                             K




where 01 and 0k are labor's and capital's respective shares of total income.

Obviously, if w = 0, the tax is fully born by labor, and vice-versa if r = 0.

     Substituting for w from (2.26') into (2.25) and expressing capital's

burden as a share of the total burden gives:



            dr
            dT

                    x                          kx



where D is the bracketed term on the left hand side of (2.25) multiplying

(w-r).

     Consider, first, conditions under which the right hand side of (2.27) is

unity, i.e., capital bears the entire burden of the tax. A sufficient
                                       —25--



condition for this result is that both industries have the same elasticities

of substitution and the same initial factor proportions.     In this case A1

Akx, and A, = Aky (see note 1), and the bracketed term on the right hand side
of (2.27) equals XkX, implying that the right hand side of (2.27) equals 0k +

   = 1.     An alternative condition sufficient for capital to bear the entire

tax burden is that all three substitution elasticities, a>< ayi and i are

equal. In this case the bracketed term in (2.27) equals Akx•

       If factor intensities are initially equal (implying Ai = Akx) and if

ax =   0,   capital's share of the tax burden equals its share of total income,

0k Intuitively, if         = 0 capital and labor are used in fixed proportions in

X, and there is effectively only a single factor. The tax on capital in X,

which in this case is equivalent to simply taxing X, raises the relative price

of X leading to a reduction in its demand. To accomodate this reduced demand

the X industry releases both capital and labor to the V industry in the

proportion that these factors are used in producing X.     If the V industry is

using these factors -in the same ratio, then it can expand production of V to

meet its increased demand with no change in factor proportions. Since ''Ts

capital labor ratio, k1 is unchanged, the ratio w/r upon which ky depends

(equation (2.13)) is unchanged. Hence, w and r both fall (relative to           and

Py) by the same percentage. This same incidence outcome arises in the case

that capital and labor are perfect substitutes in producing V (civ = cx).      From

industry V's perspective capital and labor are identical factors, and it will

use both factors only if their net costs are equal. This implies w =     r,    where

we measure capital in units such that one unit of capital is equivalent in

production to one unit of labor.
                                             —26-


        Capital's share of the tax burden can also be less than its income share.

A necessary condition for this outcome is that the X industry be more labor

intensive than the V industry. Suppose, for example, a = 0 and Xix >
                                                                                Akx.
then the second term in (2.27) is negative indicating that capital's tax

burden share is less than               In this case there is more labor relative to

capital released from X to V than industry V is initially using to produce.

To accomodate the initial relative excess supply of labor, the wage must fall

relative to the rental on capital. It is indeed possible that more than one

hundred percent of the burden of the tax on capital is shifted oto labor;

i.e., the righthand side of (2.27) can be negative, and capital can be made

absolutely better off by the capital income tax levied on industry X.

        At the other extreme capital may bear more than 100 percent of the tax

burden; i.e., labor is made better off by the tax. Consider the outcome when

capital and labor are perfect substitutes in X.           In this case     x,   and the

demand for capital in X is perfectly elastic (see equation (2.7)). From

(2.27), when         = cx, capital's share of the tax burden is       +

which   exceeds 1.     From the perspective of industry X, capital and labor are

identical factors, and the net costs to the industry of hiring labor and

capital must be equal (w =      r   +
                                        TkX); otherwise there would be an incentive to
substitute one factor for the other. Capital bears more than 100 percent of

the tax because, relative to the wage, the rental rate of capital declines in

both industries by the full amount of the tax.

     4.        The Incidence of a Commodity Tax on Good X

     Additional -insight into formula (2.27) can be obtained by considering

Mieskowski's (1967) observation that capital's share of the tax burden can be

divided -into output and substitution effects. Consider the term


               e   (A lx-Akx )rx
                       A        D
                           kx

which -is   the second bracketed term in (2.27) multiplied by       /Akx   This

expression is precisely capital's share of the burden of a tax on the

consumption of good x. To see this, note that in the case of a tax on good x,

the relative changes in producer prices and outputs are given by equations

(2.19) and (2.23), respectively, with a dTrx set to zero, and equation (2.24)

is modified to:




                            'xy
                                        dT
(2.24')        (x-y) =              +
                                         x


where       is the per unit excise tax on good X.      In addition, in (2.26) dTkx IS

set equal to zero. These revised versions of (2.19), (2.23), and (2.26), plus

(2.24') can be solved together to derive the formula given above for drK/dTX,

capital's share of the incidence of an excise tax on good X. Note that if

Alx =              capital's and labor's shares of the tax burden are both zero; i.e.,
        Xkxl
there is no change in the factor incomes received by capital and labor

measured at producer prices, although capitalist and workers bear the tax

burden as consumers. While income measured at procedure prices is the

numeraire and, therefore, doesn't change, real income of consumers falls
                                                  —28-


because of the change in consumer prices. Consider the change in the cost

measured in units of good x of consuming the initial bundle, X0, V0. Let C

denote this cost, then:


                           T           P
(2.28)           C = (1 + -)X0 +


and

                     BC
                                   =
                 x Bi
(2.29)                    I
                              TO

since P/P is unchanged by T when                  w -   r   = 0   (see equation (2.17) with dTkx =   0).
Hence, measured at producer prices, the loss in real income to consumers from

a marginal increase in T equals the marginal tax revenue. Since capitalists

and workers are assumed here to have identical tastes, they bear the burden of

the tax in proportion to their share of total income.

       Returning to equation (2.27), note that when                     =   0, the second term in
(2.27) reduces to the output effect. This is what one would expect, since

when        =    0, a tax in industry X is effectively equivalent to an excise tax on
                      = 0 and          =
good X.
                                           Akx. capitalists and workers bear the tax through
                If

a decline in their factor income rather than through an increase in the

consumer price level.


       5.        The Relationship of Welfare Changes to the Incidence
                 of a Sector-Specific Factor Tax

       While the preceding analysis described changes in incomes of workers and

owners of capital arising from a sector-specific factor tax, a full analysis

of the associated welfare changes requires taking account of changes in the
                                     -29-


prices of the two commodit-ies, P> and Ps,. The assumption that workers and

capitalists have identical homothetic preferences implies that they both view

the price changes as equivalent to the same specific percentage change in

their incomes, which can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the

precise changes in prices. For example, the change in the welfare of workers

can be calculated from their indirect utility function,           as:



             w                         -
           dV = w—                   dwL
(2.30)
          dTkx

                         xx yy —]
                         P + 6 P +



where w is the worker's marginal utility of income, arid (3
                                                              x
                                                                  and 0
                                                                          y
                                                                              ar   the

respective (and identical for workers and capitalists) expenditure shares on X

and V. A similar expression involving the terms        + 8 P ,      reflecting       price
              dK
changes, and —fl--, reflecting income changes, holds for capitalists.
               K
Hence, the price related change in welfare 6 P + 6 p , is the same
                                             xx yy
fraction of income for both workers and capitalists, and the incidence terms,

dwL and drK, describe differential changes in the welfare of workers and

capitalists. Stated differently, workers and capitalists bear the tax both in

terms of possible changes in their incomes and, in their roles as consumers, in

terms of changes in consumer prices. However, the price changes are common to

both and have the same welfare impact as a 0>P +          percentage change in

income, while the direct percentage changes in incomes due to changes in factor

payments can be quite different for the two groups.

     In the special case that the direct percentage changes in incomes of

workers and capitalists are equal, one could describe the tax as simply
                                                   -30-


"falling on consumers" through changes -in prices with no changes -in factor

incomes; i.e., since the model's numeraire can be freely choosen, we could

choose w or r as numeraire. In the case that both factors share the burden in

proportion to their incomes share, we have with the new numeraire convention

w =   r    =   0.     While nominal factor incomes remain constant, P> and, poss-ibly

      rise and generate the same reduction in real factor incomes and welfare that

arises i-f I is choosen as the numeraire.


          6.        Extension to the Case of Differences in Preferences

       Mieszkowski (1967) and Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980) extend the analysis

of the incidence of sector-specific factor taxes to the case in which workers'

and capitalists' preferences differ. The results can be illustrated with the

following example. Let workers and the government consume only X, and let

capitalists consume only Y. Then the new demand equations are:



(2.14')         P X =
                 x
                         wE + Tkxx
                                K

                P V =     rK,
                 y



and the change in relative demands associated with the tax is given by:




                    (X—Y) =
                                          -.


                                   ) + (w-r)   +
                                                   rK dTkx
                                                   —
(2.24')
                                                   wL
                                                       r


Using (2.24') rather than (2.24), capital's share of the tax burden is:
                                             -31-



              dr -                                                                           rK
                                                                                               x
                      K                 (0wxA x   + 0     A )a -
                                                        rx lx x           (A lx-Akx)(0   —

          —   dTk         = Ok +
                                   02

                  x                               0     -
                                                            (A lx-Akx )
                                   kx



Equation (2.27') is identical to (2.27) for r =                  1   except for the additional term

(A1X—AkX)(rKX/WL) in the numerator and the term -(Alx-Akx) in the denominator.

When factor intensities are equal in X and Y we have the same result as

above that the incidence of the tax is independent of demand parameters. When

      A,< demand elements enter, the demand structure (2.14') can either

reduce or increase the tax burden on capital. When the X industry is capital

intensive the fact that workers and the government spend all their expanded

income on X while capitalists adjust to their lower incomes simply ..y reduced

consumption of Y implies a smaller ultimate share of the tax burden falling on

capital. On the other hand, if X is labor intensive the smaller increase in

the incomes of workers relative to the A1 =                      case feeds back to lower r by
                                                            A1
more than would occur if demands were identical and homothetic.


C.   Estimates of Tax Incidence in Static General Equilibrium Models

     Tax incidence formulae, like that given in equation (2.25), are

appropriate only for small changes around an initial no tax equilibrium. To

examine the incidence of large tax changes as well as consider many more

sectors and types of consumers Shoven and Whalley (1972) constructed a

computable general equilibrium model. Their method of calculating an

equilibrium is based on Scarf's (1967,1973) algorithm and related techniques.4

The analysis of large perturbations of the equilibrium requires specifying

explicit functional forms for preferences and production technologies. The
                                     —32-


parameter of these functions are then selected such that initial equilibrium

values of the model are in rough accord with those actually observed in the

economy. This calibration of the model is not an econometric procedure,

although econometric findings, such as the estimated values of particular

elasticities of substitution, are often used as part of the calibration.

     Table 1, which is based on Shoven's (1976) reported results, shows

calculations of corporate tax incidence for the United States for two sector

and twelve sector variants of the Shoven-Whalley model. The table reports the

share of the tax burden borne by capital for alternative elasticities of

substitution of the assumed CES production and demand functions.

     For this particular experiment the two and twelve sector models yield

quite similar results. The incidence on capital is, however, very sensitive

to the assumed elasticities of substitution. A low relative demand

elasticity, a low elasticity of substitution in the non corporate sector, and

a high elasticity of substitution in the corporate sector imply reductions in

the net income of capital well in excess of 100 percent of the corporate tax

revenue. Alternatively, if capital and labor are both highly complementary in

producing the two goods     = .25,    =     .25),   capital's share. of the tax

burden is only a third.

     While Shoven and halley's results on U.S. cor- -rate tax incidence, like

Harberger's (1962) original calculations based on equation (2.25), are

instructive for understanding tax incidence in static general equilibrium

models, their assumed values for corporate income tax rates are subject to

question. They estimate the effective marginal tax rate in different sectors

by calculating taxes collected as a fraction of reported profits. There are a
                                        -33-


number of problems with this procedure. Stiglitz (1973), for example, points

out that since interest is deductible from the corporate tax, the effective

marginal tax on debt financed corporate capital is zero. Other research

(e.g., Jorgenson (1963), Auerbach (1979a,1979c), King and Fullerton (1984),

Bradford (1981), Gordon (1985), Bulov and Summers (1984)), stresses the

importance of depreciation and other investment incentives, the tax treatment

of dividends and capital gains, and the risk sharing attributes of capital

income taxation as critical elements for determining effective marginal taxes

on capital income.



III. TAX INCIDENCE IN OPEN ECONOMIES


     Our analysis has so far maintained the assumption of immobile factors.

This assumption is clearly inappropriate in considering taxes levied by a

single locality from or towards which capital and labor can migrate.

Increasingly, as capital becomes more mobile internationally, it is necessary

to recognize the effects of factor mobility in considering national tax

policies as well. In order to focus on the effects of factor mobility, we

return to the one good general equilibrium model of Section hA. We further

simplify it by assuming that the factor complementary to capital -- here

labelled land --   is   supplied inelastically and is immobile.


A. A Simple Model of Factor Mobility

    Analysis of tax incidence in a simple one good, two factor, two

country model provides important insights into the differences in incidence

results in open and closed economies. Following Bradford (1978), assume that
                                                 -34-


the two factors of production are capital and land and that capital is

internationally mobile. In contrast to the analysis in section hA, of a

country-wide tax on capital in a closed economy, a tax on capital imposed by

one country on income earned by capital in that country is not fully borne by

the capital initially in the country imposing the tax. Since capital is

internationally mobile, reductions in capital rentals in one country imply

reductions in the other. Hence, the incidence of the tax borne by capital -is

spread evenly across all capital, regardless of the country in which -it is

ultimately used. In contrast to capital owners, landowners in the two

countries are differentially affected by the tax; there is a loss in rental

income to landowners in the country imposing the tax on capital and a gain to

landlords in the country with no tax on capital.

        To see this let F(K) and G(K) be the respective production functions

in countries A and B. KA is the capital in country A, and K -                        =        is the
                                                                                KA       KB

capital in country B, where 1< is total world-wide capital. If r is the rental

on capital, and T      is   the tax on capital in country A, we have:


(3.1)       r +   T = F'(KA)
            r =
                  G'(K8)

From these equations and the constraint KA +                 =   K   it is easy to show that
                                                        KB
the ratio of the change in worldwide capital income,                     K, to the change

in tax revenue, -rKAI calculated at the no tax equilibrium, is given by:




            ___        -       AK
(3.2)              =
                                    +            O
            KA              (nBKB       TIAKA)
                                                       —35-



where r and iB are the (nonnegative) respective demands for capital in

countries   A and B. Note that we are implicitly assuming that all tax revenue

is used to purchase the one good in the model. Suppose the functions F( ) and

G( )    are identical, then A =                 B'   and      =
                                                                  KB
                                                                       initially. In this case the

right hand side of (3.2) equals -1, and world—wide capital bears the full

marginal burden of the tax. In the case that the demand for capital in B is

perfectly inelastic, B = 0, or is perfectly elastic in A,                             =   , world-wide
capital bears more than 100 percent of the tax.                          If, at the opposite extreme,

capital is in perfectly elastic demand in country B or in perfectly inelastic

demand in A, world-wide capital bears none of the burden of the tax.

            Land rents in A, RA, and B, RB, are expressed in (3.3):


(3.3)                           —
            RA =                     (r+T)KA
                    F(KA)
                                -
            RB = G(K6)               rKB,

and these expressions imply:



              dRA
(3.4)         d-r
                            -                        <0
             KA                     flBKB +   AKA

            dRB
            _____    =     AKB
             KA          BKB +          T1AKA




Note that the three tax burden expressions in (3.2) and (3.4) sum to -1. In

the case of identical production functions, while world-wide capital bears the

full burden of the tax, landowners in country A lose rents equal to half of
                                     -36-


marginal tax revenues, while landlords in B gain rents equal to half of

marginal tax revenues. In the extreme cases that either       B = 0    or    =

 landowners in country A suffer no loss in rents, while landowners in B enjoy

marginal increases in rents equal to KB.    If B = (xJ, or   11A =   0, landlords in A
bear the full marginal burden of the tax with no change in the rents of

capitalists or landowners in B.

     The lesson of this model is that a country in an open world economy or a

state or locality within a country is likely to bear a significant fraction of

the burden of a tax it levies on an internationally or domestically mobile

factor. From (3.4) it is easy to see that the smaller is the country, state,

or locality imposing the tax relative to the world or domestic economy (the

smaller is the ratio of KA to KB), the larger is the burden on immobile

factors, in this case land, in the taxing jurisdiction. In the limit as

KB/KA approaches infinity the marginal loss -in land rents in country A equals

the amount of marginal taxes raised (equation (3.2)). While one could say in

this case that land in country A bears the full burden of the tax, it is also

the case that world-wide capital income -is reduced by rA/7B times the marginal

tax revenue, and land rents in country B rise by r?A/rB times the marginal tax

revenue. In the symmetric case where the home and foreign countries have the

same production function a tax on domestic capital is borne completely by

capital on a worldwide basis. At the other extreme when the taxing

jurisdiction is very large relative to the rest of the world—wide or

country—wide economy (KB/KA   0), capital bears the full burden of the tax,

and there are no marginal changes in land rents in either A or B.
                                    -37—


B.   Further Implications of the Simple Open Economy Model

     This simple open economy model has several further implications for the

analysis of taxes -in open economies. It suggests a sharp distinction between

taxes on savings and investment. The former are based on capital -income

earned by domestic residents regardless of the location of their capital while

the latter involve the taxation of income from capital that is located in the

home country. First, in this static model, a tax levied by country A at the

personal level on the capital income received by its residents regardless of

where that capital is invested is equivalent to a lump sum wealth tax and will

be fully borne by domestic capital owners. In contrast, as just described, if

country A taxes, at the business level, capital income earned on domestic

capital (regardless of ownership) the tax will fall on foreign as well as

domestic capital owners and can also lower the income of domestic factors such

as labor and land. Hence, from the perspective of the taxing country a tax on

investment income at the business level is, at least in part and possibly in

full, effectively a tax on wages and land rents, while a tax on capital income

at the personal level has little or no affect on wages or land rents.

     Second, consider a tax on capital income at the business level that

distinguishes domestically owned from foreign owned capital. An example

would be a tax on the repatriation of foreign capital income.   If this tax is

sufficiently high it may pay foreigners to stop investing in the home country,

and the resulting equilibrium -in this case would be one of autarky in which

domestic residents only invest at home and foreigners only invest in their own

countries. If T is the domestic tax on foreign capital income earned domesti-

cally, rd is the domestic pre-tax rate of return, and r is the return to
                                               —38—


foreign capital invested in the foreign country, the condition for autarky is

that r >    rd_T, and      rd >     r.   In this case both domestic residents and

foreigners earn a higher return at the margin by investing in their own

countries. While this tax would collect no revenue, by driving out foreign

domestic investment it raises the return to domestic capital and lowers the

return to fixed domestic factors of production. Note that the incidence of a

law prohibiting foreign investment would be identical to that of a tax that

drives out such investment.


C.   Incidence of the Property Tax

     The simple open economy model is also useful for thinking about the

controversial issue of the incidence of local property taxes. Since property

taxes are typically levied on both land and capital, one might decompose the

incidence of the tax into that arising from taxing land and that from taxing

capital. In the simple static open economy model discussed at the beginning

of this section, a tax on land rents is fully borne by land owners. However,

as described above the tax on capital may be shifted. The extent of shifting

will depend not on the size of the local property tax per Se, but on its size

relative to that in other communities. To see this, consider the two city

(country) model in which TA is the property tax in city A and TB the tax in

city B. The conditions corresponding to (3.1) are:


            F'(KA) =   r   +
                               TA
(3.1')
            F'(K_KA) =     r   +
                                    TB




Clearly   if TA =   TB = T, r        falls by the full amount of the tax and capital

bears the full burden of property taxes levied on capital. If TA exceeds
                                     -39-


TB the differential tax, TA - TB, will lower land rents -in A and -increase

rents in B. Capital will bear the differential tax in part, in full, or more

than in full depending on differences in capital demand elasticities and,

given such differences, in the relative size of the two cities. To see this,

one need only replace T by TA - TB and r by r + T8 in equations (3.1) and

(3.3).

     This "new view" of the incidence of the property tax associated with

Mieszkowsk-i (1972,1984), Mieszkowski and Zodrow (1984), and Zodrow and

Mieszkowski (1983,1984) contrasts sharply with the "benefit tax" argument of

Tiebout (1956) which is extensively examined by Daniel Rubinfeld in Chapter

11. In Tiebout's model individuals can costlessly establish new communities

providing the level of local public goods they most desire. As formally

modeled by Atkinson and Stiglitz (1980), in setting up new communities the

Tiebout result holds if one assumes that founders of communities take as given

the utility levels of individuals they hope to attract. Hence, they must

offer competitive utility levels to potential residents. The model also

assumes perfect mobility of all productive factors. The tax used to finance

local public goods makes no difference in the Tiebout local public goods

equilibrium, because it is fully internalized by individuals living in their

communities; any individual in the Tiebout model is free to establish a new

community identical to his existing community. The individual might, for

example, live in a community where taxes are levied on land rents; but he can

costlessly set up a new community that provides the same local public goods

and attracts the same residents, but that exempts the individual from paying

taxes on land rents, and instead, taxes the individual on his wages, or in the
                                    -40-


value of his car, or his consumption of food, etc. Provided the same amount

of taxes are paid by the individual, there will be no real difference between

the new and the old community.

     The fact that the individual is free at the margin to establish a new

community and pay for local public goods in any way he prefers means that the

individual internalizes the tax; i.e., the individual views the tax as

equivalent to a payment to purchase the type of community he most prefers

given the level of utility that must be provided to attract residents to the

community. Since the equilibrium is the same whether the local tax is

labelled a wage, property, income, sales, or other tax, the incidence is

unaffected by the tax base chosen. Hence, in the Tiebout model, the incidence

of local taxes does not fall on particular factors of production, but is fully

borne by individual residents. We can say that each resident bears the burden

of the taxes paid, just as one can say that an individual buying a private

goods bears the burden of paying for that good.

    Atkinson and Stiglitz's (1980) derivation of the Tiebout result assumes

that each resident employs his productive factors in his own community. But

one can modify this assumption and may still end up with the same real

equilibrium. Consider, for example, a Tiebout equilibrium in which

individuals own capital and initially employ that capital in their own

community. Also assume that the production function depends on land and

capital. Suppose the local tax is nominally assessed on local property

including all capital and land in the community. In such a setting owners of

capital would not be indifferent to employing their capital locally or

employing it in another community. When employed locally, the taxes paid on
                                    —41-


capital are simply viewed as part of the payment for local public goods.

However, if the capital were employed in another community and earned the same

pretax return, the taxes paid on capital to the other community would not be

viewed as effectively purchasing local public goods at the margin, since the

owner of the capital invested in someone else's community derives no utility

from the local public goods provided by any but his own community.

     One assumption, suggested by Hamilton (1975,1976,1983), Fischel (1975),

and White (1975) that might permit the Tiebout result to go through in this

setting is that each community zones a section of land for productive

enterprises. Suppose that firms have identical production functions and use

capital and labor in fixed proportions. Suppose, further, that the property

tax rate in the industrial zone is the same as that in the rest of the

community, that community members are homogeneous, and own equal shares of the

land in the industrial zone. Also assume that firms require no local public

goods to operate; i.e., they have no demand for local public goods. Now if

land rents in each zoned area fall by the amount of property taxes levied on

land and capital in the industrial zones, owners of capital will receives the

same net return if they invest in their own community or some other community,

since what they pay in property taxes they save in reduced land rents. In

this model the industrial zones are identical to communities that do not

provide local public goods and have no property taxes. Consider now the lower

land rents received by local residents owning land in the industrial zones.

This lower land rent is effectively part of the price they pay for their local

public goods; i.e., while firms in the industrial zones send in the property

tax check to the local government, the local residents effectively pay this
                                      -42-


 tax in the form of receiving reduced land rents. In this model, taxes on

capital, whether or not they are identical across communities, are fully

shifted from owners of capital onto local community residents.

     As Rubinfeld points out in Chapter 11, the assumptions required for the

"benefit tax" view to hold precisely appear far from being satisfied in actual

settings. While the "new view" of the property tax appears to be correct, at

least in the short run for additional increases in property tax rates, many of

the forces leading to the "benefit tax" result appear to be at play, albeit

slowly; hence, it may be incorrect to view the local property tax simply

according to the "new view," since a large fraction of the distortions from

this tax may have been offset over time by benefit tax forces, such as changes

-in zoning and migration across localities and states.



IV. DYNAMIC MODELS OF TAX INCIDENCE


     The analysis of tax incidence presented in the preceding section was

entirely static. This made it impossible to study two important dimensions of

tax incidence. First, taxes will, in general, affect savings and investment

decisions, leading to effects on capital accumulation which, in turn, will

alter the marginal productivities of both capital and labor and, thus, factor

returns. Second, when taxes are altered, the prices of taxed and possibly

non-taxed assets are likely to change, thus capitalizing the effects of the

tax change. The windfall capital gains and losses associated with tax reforms

are an important aspect of their incidence. A closely related issue is

intergenerational incidence. Tax policies may burden members of different
                                    -43-


generations differently. Where capitalization effects are important, the

owners of taxed assets at the time the tax is imposed may bear up to the

entire future burden of the tax.

     In this section, we develop a sequence of models illustrating

intertemporal aspects of tax incidence. We begin by considering tax incidence

in the context of the life cycle, overlapping generations model of Diamond

(1965, 1970). The overlapping generations model distinguishes members of

d-ifferent generations explicitly and so is ideal for studying

intergenerational incidence. For reasons of analytical convenience, we follow

Diamond in working with a model in which only two generations are alive at any

point in time.

     In the discussion we distinguish between fiscal policies that directly

redistribute across generations without having direct effects on relative

prices and policies that directly affect relative prices, but only indirectly

alter the intergenerational redistribution of resources. Actual fiscal

policies generally combine these two effects, but considering each separately

enhances one's intuition about dynamic fiscal policy. In addition, much of

the concern with deficit and related policies that redistribute across

generations is with their income effects; hence, it is useful to clarify

precisely how the income effects from intergenerational redistribution can

alter savings.

     The two period model may be misleading in its portrayal of the behavior

of actual economies, and multiperiod models may yield rather different

behavior in some circumstances. An illustrative simulation of switching tax

regimes is presented based on the Auerbach-Kotlikoff (1986) 55 period life
                                     -44-


cycle simulation model. We also show in this section how introducing bequest

motives can alter the intergenerational incidence of certain tax policies that

arises in the life cycle model without bequest motives. These models

presented in the first part of this section assume a single good that can

either be consumed or used as capital. In addition, there are zero costs of

transforming a unit of capital into a unit of consumption, and visa versa.

Introducing such adjustment costs or adding additional assets, such as land,

to the model, permits the possibility of asset evaluation associated with the

changes. Asset revaluation is examined first within the partial equilibrium

model of Summers (1981) in which changes in corporate policy alter the stock

value of firms. Next, Feldstein's (1979) two period model of land rent

taxation is presented to illustrate asset revaluation in a general equilibrium

context.

     The general message of this section is that tax policies can have

important effects on the time path of capital formation, the evolution of

factor prices and asset values, arid the intergenerational distribution of

welfare. The models and examples of policy presented in this section indicate

the range of incidence effects arising from dynamic tax policy; but these

models and examples only illustrate potential intertemporal tax incidence

effects; they certainly do not represent an exhaustive characterization of the

government's intertemporal fiscal policies, nor do they illustrate all

possible time paths of dynamic tax incidence.

A.      Tax Incidence in a Life Cycle, Overlapping Generations Model

        We begin by considering the simplest overlapping generations model in

which individuals live for two periods, working only in the first period.

Capital does not depreciate in this model, and there is no technical progress.

We assume that the population and labor force grows exogenously at rate n.

Individuals who are young at time t maximize a utility function

Ut =    (Cii,   C2+1) subject to the budget constraint:


(4.1)       c2.1 = (w_c1)(1+r+1)

where r+1 is the interest rate at t+1, and V4 is the wage at time t.     If the

government has no assets the total capital stock in period t+1 simply

corresponds to the assets of the private sector at t+1. But since young

workers initially have no wealth, private assets at time t+1 equal the wealth

of the old at t÷1 generation. The wealth of the elderly at t+1, in turn,

equals the saving they did when young. Capital per worker can thus be

expressed as:



(4.2)
                                   wc1 (w ,   r1)
            k+1(w,r+1)                  1+n


where kt+i(w, r+1) represents the capital labor ratio at time t4-1, and c1(

represents the first period consumption function. We assume a standard

concave production function f(k), with f'(k) > 0 and f"(k) < 0, and that

factors are compensated competitively. In steady state the condition:


            k -   w(k)   -   c[w(k),r(k)]
                             1+n

must be satisfied. Diamond (1970) points out that the steady state will be

stable as long as:

1.       Price Effects

         a. The Incidence of a Capital Income Tax

         As stressed above, the incidence of a tax depends critically on

government's use of its tax revenue. To highlight price effects, we examine

the case of a capital income tax, assuming that the tax revenue is fully

rebated in a lump sum transfer to individuals in their second period of life.

The steady state condition then becomes:


                      w(k) —
(4.5)        k =
                                    1+n



Note that when the tax revenue, I =
                                                    Tr(w-C1) is compensated in period 2, the
budget constraint in the presence of taxation:



(4.6)        C1 + 1+r(1-T) =         W +
                                              1+r(1-i)



reduces to (4.1). While the compensated tax leaves the consumer's budget

constraint unchanged, it alters the consumer's perceived after tax price of
                                                                                            C2;

hence, in (4.5) C1 is written as a function of the after tax interest rate as

well as the wage. If the utility function is concave, it is easy to verify

that the derivative of C1 with respect to the compensated interest income tax

rate T is positive, i.e.,


             ac
(4.7)         .J      >
                                                  —47-


Hence, from (4.4), (4.5), and (4.7), we have:



                             BC
                        -
(4.8)       —=
            Bk
                                  BC
                                                 <0
                        3w          1
                   1-( -


Thus an interest income tax compensated -in the second period unambiguously

reduces capital intensity. This means that the pre-tax return to capital

rises and the wage falls. The tax is thus at least partially shifted to

labor. Indeed, as Diamond (1970) shows, it is possible that capital intensity

will decline so much that the post-tax return to capital actually rises.

Under the assumption of a linear homogeneous production function, and

expressing output per worker as f, equation (4.9) indicates how r(1-T) changes

with T.5




(4.9)
            Br(1-T) =       rk(1+n)[                  -


                                                              BC
                            ([i/f" +    (k   -            +




Since       =   -f"k   the denominator in (4.9) is negative assuming (4.4). Hence,

the long run after tax return to capital rises, provided:




 4 10       (1+n)f < 1 —
              rw                  1+r 3w


where a =   -(rw/fkf")       is the elasticity of substitution. Hence, the smaller

the elasticity of substitution, the larger will be the net of tax return to

capital.
                                        -48-


     b.      The Incidence of Labor Income Tax

     Consider next the question of the incidence of a labor income tax in a

growing economy. This question was first examined by Feldstein (1974c) who

stressed that in the long run this may depend only on its effect on capital

intensity. He noted that reductions in labor supply that are not associated

with changes in the long run saving rate will have no effect on long run

capital intensity, and concluded that the elasticity of labor supply

potentially has no effect on the long run incidence of a labor income tax.

Feldstein's point can be illustrated in the two period model by assuming that

first period labor supply per worker, L, is variable, while second period

labor supply is zero. In this case the steady state formula for the capital

stock in the presence of labor income tax, that is compensated in the first

period is:



(4 11)       k — T + w(k)(1—T)L[w(k)(1—i-) + T, r(k)] -   C   [w(k)(1—T)+T, r(k)]
                               (1+n)Lw(k)(1—T)4 T, r(k)]


where T = TWL.

     Assuming that utility is homothetic in C1 and C2, and separable from 1,

C1 is proportional to w(1—T)L + T.     In this case it is immediate from (4.11)

that steady state k is unaffected by responses in L to changes in T since both

the numerator and denominator of (4.11) rise or fall by the same percentage.

     Kotlikoff and Summers (1979) make the point that the effects of a labor

income tax on the timing of labor supply over the life cycle will affect its

long run incidence. This is because changes in the time stream of labor income

over individuals' lifetimes will, in general, affect the national savings rate.
                                        —49-


Such effects may be important if, for example, taxes affect retirement ages, or

the elasticity of labor supply differs at different ages. To see this, assume

that labor supply in the second period as well as the first period is variable.

Denote by L1 and L2 first and second period labor supply, respectively, by

T first period consumption of the first period tax, and by T2 second period

compensation of the second period tax. The formula for the steady state

capital stock is floW:




(4.12)    k =
                (1+n)L1+L2


Assuming that utility is homothetic -in        and C2 and separable from both
                                          C1

L1 and L2, C1 will be proportional to w(1—T)[L1 +                   +        +
                                                       (L2/14-r)]       T1       T2/1-fr,
which equals simply w(L1 +   L2/1+r).   Hence, -if L1 and L2 change by the same

proportion in response to the compensated wage tax, the effect on long run k

of the labor supply response is zero. HoWever, L1 and L2 will not, -in

general, change in the same proportion. If, for example, L2 falls by a

greater percentage than L1 in response to the compensated wage tax, this labor

supply response will lead to a larger steady state value of k than would

otherwise be the case.


2.   Income Effects

     a. Explicit Intergenerational Redistribution

     Turning to direct intergenerational income effects from tax policy,

consider for the case of a compensated capital income tax how switching the

compensation from a payment to the elderly to a payment to young workers
                                                                 —50-


affects the results. In this case the steady state budget constraint (4.6) is

given by:


                            C
                                2
(4.6')       C +
              1        1 +r(1—T)
                                            =w+T

and (4.5) becomes:



                   w(k) + T — C [w(k) +                        T,r(k)(1-T)]
(45')        k =
                                            1
                                                1+n



Comparing    (4.6')        with (4.6), it is clear that prov-id-ing the compensation

the first rather than the second generation raises lifetime income by

[Tr(1—T)]/[1       +r(1T)] and produces an income effect which raises C1 beyond what
occurs with second period compensation, assuming C1 is a normal good. But f
C2 is also normal, then some part of the extra present value of resources
associated   with first period compensat-iori, T1, will be saved for second period

consumption. Hence, relative to the case of second period compensation, first

period compensation leads to more steady state savings. In the case of first

period compensation the change in the steady state capital stock associated

with an increase in the capital income tax rate is:



                                                    rk
                                                         2(1        aw
                       —                +
                   1                2
                                            1   —    ,aw   —        1 1
                                                               ak    /
                                                                         14-n



where [ak/aT]2 denotes the expression in (4.8) for a second period compensated

tax, and [ak/aT]1 denotes the derivative of k with respect to a tax on            capital
income that is compensated in the first period.
                                    —51-


     This analysis of switching compensation from the second to the first

period illustrates a general proposition of life cycle models, namely that

redistribution from older to younger generations raises savings. While the

equations presented above do not describe the economy's transition path to the

new steady state, it is easy to see that switching from second to first period

compensation reduces the resources of the initial generation of elderly and,

correspondingly, raises the lifetime resources o-F   successive generations.
Since in the life cycle model older generations have larger marginal

propensities to consume than younger generations, intergenerational

redistribution towards younger generations lowers total private consumption

and raises national saving. The associated increase in capital formation, in

the case of a closed economy, leads to increases in pre-tax wages and declines

in pre-tax returns to capital.


     b. Implicit Intergenerational Redistribution

     A variety of government fiscal policies redistribute resources across

generations, thus potentially altering the time path of pre-and post tax

factor returns and altering the intergenerational distribution of welfare.

Government deficit policy associated with temporary reductions in tax rates

and subsequent increases in tax rates in excess of their initial values is a

prime example of intergenerational redistribution. In this case initial

generation gain at the expense of future generations because initial

generations enjoy the benefits of the tax cut, but escape through death or

retirement the subsequent tax rate increase.

    While explicit deficit policy is a clear mechanism of intergenerational
                                                       —52—


redistribution, there are a variety of other', quite subtle intergenerational

redistribution mechanisms at the government's disposal. Summers (1981) shows

that balanced budget changes in the tax structure can significantly alter the

level of long run savings because of its attendant intergenerational income

effects. Take, as an example, the case of a balance budget switch from a

consumption to a wage tax in our simple two period life cycle model in which

labor is supplied only in the first period and workers work full time

independent of the wage. The steady state budget constraint in the case of a

consumption tax is:



                          (l+T)                  =
(4.13)       Ci(1+T) + C2 1+(k)                      W(kc)


and the formula for steady state capital per worker, k, 'iS:



                       w(kc )C1 [w(k)/(1+T),r(kfl
             kC =
(4.14)
                                      1+n

In the case of a wage tax the budget constraint is:




(4.15)       C1 +      1+rk)     =   w(k)(1-T)

and steady state capital per worker, k, is:


                                       -
(4.16)      k - w(kw)(l_Tw)
                   —
                                           C1[w(k)(l-T),r(k)]
              w                            1 +   n


Now if (1+Tc)' =         1   -       and kw =        k,   the two budget constraints are

identical; however, comparing (4.14) and (4.16), it is clear that steady state
                                          —53-



capital under a consumption tax, k, exceeds steady state capital under a wage

tax,   k. The intuitive explanation for this is that even assuming
                 -
(1+Tc)1 =    1
                     Tw   switching from a consumption to a wage tax relieves the tax

burden on the first generation of elderly at the time of the tax switch.

Consequently, their consumption rises relative to what occurs under a

consumption tax. While the consumption of the initial generation of young

workers does not change (assuming (1-fTc)' =            1    -
                                                                 T   and noting that the

initial period wage is that of the consumption tax steady state), initial

period total private consumption rises and national saving falls. The induced

initial decline in the capital stock lowers subsequent first period saving of

young workers because of the associated change in                factor   prices.

       The assumption that (1fTc)' =      1   -    is       not, however, necessarily valid

either in the initial or subsequent periods. If G is the assumed constant

level of government consumption per worker, the steady state balance budget

equation for Tc is:



(4.17)     Tc{Ci[w(kc)/(1+Tc)ir(kc)] + C2{w(kc)/(1+Tc),r(kc)]()} = 6


The corresponding equation in the balanced budget wage tax steady state is:



(4.18)     Tw(k) = 6


In actual simulations of multiperiod models, Summers (1981) and Auerbach and

Kotlikoff (1983a), find (1+T)' < 1 —          T;   i.e., on a wage tax equivalent

basis the steady state consumption tax is less than the steady state wage

tax.
                                           -54-


       Other Fiscal policies that redistribute towards early generations and

away from future generations are unfunded "pay as you go" Social Security and

policies involving reductions in investment incentives (Auerbach and

Kotlikoff, 1983b).


B.     Income Effects with Intergenerational Altruism and the
       Possible Neutrality of Intergeneration Transfers

       As just described, in life cycle models in which each generation cares

only about its own consumption, intergenerational redistribution can alter the

course of capital formation and the factor returns received by different

generations. In contrast, in Barro's (1974) model of intergenerational

altruism, nondistortionary redistribution across generations has no impact on

any real variable, including capital formation and factor returns. Since

government deficit policy constitutes one of many mechanisms by which the

government transfers resources across generations, Barro's model implies that

non—distortionary deficit policies would neither reduce capital formation nor

affect any other real variables.

      Barro's proposition can be clarified by considering the intergeneration-

ally altruistic utility function given in (4.19):


           Ut =   u{ct2t,ut      1,2ti,u2(ct2,1t2, .
(4.19)
              =
                  V(Ct,2t,Ct+1,2+1i.   .




In   (4.19) the utility of generation t depends on the consumption and leisure

enjoyed by generation t, C. and            as well as the utility of children,

generation t+1. But since the utility of children, generation t+1, is a
                                          -55-


function of C,1,              and their children's utility,    Ut is a function

of C,                       and U.2. Recursive substitution of the arguments of
           C÷1,
               etc., implies that U. can be written as a function V(   )   of   all

levels of consumption and leisure of current and future family members. Thus

continuous altruistic intergenerational linkages effectively imply that

generation t cares about the consumption and leisure of all future

descendants.

     In choosing its time path of consumption and leisure, Barro's altruistic

infinite horizon family maximizes (4.19) subject to the infinite horizon

budget constraint give y:


                  Ct+s+E   t-I-s
(4.20)               1+R    t 1-s
                                    =Ht+At_Tt

     In (4.20) 1/1-4-Rt+5 is the price at time t of a dollar received at t+s,

Ht is the present value of the infinite horizon family's full time endowment

of human capital, At is the family's net worth at time t, and Tt is the

present value of the family's taxes less transfers. Consider now

nondistortionary redistribution between family members of different

generations that leaves unchanged the present value of the family's net tax

payments. Such redistribution leaves Tt and, therefore, the budget constraint

(4.20) unchanged. Since (4.9) is maximized subject to (4.20), this policy has

no impact on the Barro family's time path of consumption and leisure and,

therefore, no impact on saving, investment, or labor supply.


C.   Transition Effects

     A crucial question in assessing analyses of steady state tax incidence is
                                      —56-


the length of time -it   takes the economy to converge to a new steady state

following tax reforms. This issue is taken up by Bernheim (1981), Auerbach

and Kotlikoff (1983a), and Chamley (1982). Not surprisingly, their results

indicate that the rate of transit between steady states depends on all the

parameters of the model being considered. Bernheim's results suggest

convergence to new steady state at an exponential rate of between 5 and 20

percent per year following a tax reform. This implies that the half life of

the adjustment process is likely to exceed 15 years in many cases. The

explicit life cycle model of Auerbach and Kotl-ikoff implies a somewhat greater

speed of adjustment, as does Chamley's (1981) infinite horizon model. Chamley

(1981) makes the point that the process of adjustment is faster with myopic

than with rational expectations.

     As an illustration of these transition effects, consider Auerbach and

Kotlikoff's simulation results (see Kotlikoff, 1984) describing the transition

paths from balanced budget structural tax changes. In the Auerbach-Kotlikoff

life cycle model, agents live for 55 periods, corresponding to adult ages

of 21 to 75, and are concerned only with their own welfare, i.e., they have no

bequest motive. The model incorporates variable labor supply, including

endogenous retirement, with preferences over current and future values of

consumption and leisure described by a CES utility function. The production

sector is characterized by a CES production function. An important

contribution of the model is that it solves the economy's perfect foresight

equ-ilibr-ium transition path from an initial to a final steady state equation.

During this transition there is market clearing for all goods, factors, and

assets.
                                        -57-


     Equation (4.20) presents the CES utility function of consumption, C, and

leisure, 2,   underlying   the life cycle policy simulations described below.



                 55                                            1)'

                                                        2(1l/111/P
                a1

In (12) 6 in the time preference rate, p is the "static" elasticity of

substitution between consumption and leisure at each age a, gi       is   a consumption

share parameter, and 'y is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution between

consumption and leisure at different ages. The reciprocal of y equals the

coefficient of relative risk aversion.

     Baseline parameter values for 6, j, y, p and a, the elasticity of

substitution of capital for labor in the production function, are .015, 1.5,

.25, .8 and 1, respectively. These figures are mid-range estimates based on a

variety of empirical studies many of which are cited in Auerbach, Kotlikoff

and Skinner (1983).

     Table 2 contains the simulation results for changes in the tax base from

proportional income taxation to either proportional consumption, wage, or

capital income taxation with each designed to yield equal revenues. The

simulated economy has an initial steady state capital—output ratio of 3.7, a

capital-labor ratio of 5, a pre-tax wage normalized to 1, a 6.7 percent

pre-tax real interest rate, a 3.7 percent net national saving rate, and a 15

percent proportional tax on all income. Since there are no transfer programs,

receipts from the 15 percent income tax are solely used to finance government

consumption. In each of Table 2's simulations government consumption per
                                     —58-


capita is held fixed, and the tax rate of the specified tax base is adjusted

to produce revenues equal, on an annual basis, to the exogenous path of

government consumption.

     Table 2 displays the large impact structural tax policies can have on an

economy's saving rate and related variables. Relative to the initial income

tax regime, long run saving rates are 19 percent larger under a consumption

tax, 8 percent larger under a wage tax, and 32 percent smaller under a capital

income tax. Changes in the economy's saving rate during the transition period

are even more dramatic; in the first year after the switch to consumption

taxation, the saving rate rises to 93 percent from an initial value of 3.7.

In the case of the capital income tax, there is a negative 2.9 percent saving

rate in the first year of the transition, and saving rates remain negative for

over a decade.6 The figures in Table 2 would, of course, all be magnified in

absolute value if one started with a larger initial steady state income tax.

For example, a structural shift to consumption taxation starting from a 30

percent income tax ultimately increases the capital-labor ratio by 63 percent,

rather than the 24 percent increase of Table 3.

     These changes in after tax prices of factors and goods obviously alter

the utility levels of each cohort alive at the time of the tax change or born

thereafter. One measure of these utility differences is the equivalent

percentage increase in full lifetime resources needed in the original income

tax regime to produce each cohort's realized level of utility under the

specified alternative tax regimes. For cohorts living in the new long run

equilibrium under consumption, wage, and capital income tax regimes the

equivalent variations are 2.32 percent, -.89 percent, and - 1.14 percent.7
                                      —59-


These f-gures are smaller than the long run changes -in wage rates indicated -in

Table 3, because they encompass the additional amount of both lifetime leisure

and consumption that could hypothetically be afforded in the old steady state.

Stated differently since 65 percent of lifetime resources are spent on leisure

in the initial steady state, a 2.32 percent increase in full time resources

would permit a 6.63 (2.32/.35) percent increase in lifetime consumption,

holding leisure constant.


0.   Asset Prices and Tax Incidence

     In both the static and dynamic models we have considered so far, there

are no costs of adjustment impeding the accumulation or reallocation of

capital. In addition there has been no distinctions made concerning the tax

treatment of different assets. As a consequence, there was no scope in these

models for variation in the prices of capital goods and other assets. Studies

of tax incidence within this framework focus on the effects of tax changes on

the wage and after tax rate of return, because the constancy of the relative

price of assets precludes any wealth effects.

     The implausibility of these assumptions may be seen by noting their

implication that corporate shareowners would not lose relative to homeowners

from increases in the tax burdens on corporate capital. More generally,

standard general equilibrium models have the counterfactual implication that

all owners of capital should have the same preferences about tax policy, since

all capital will be equally affected. Capitalists would have no reason

particularily to oppose taxes on their industry. This is because the standard

approach to tax incidence ignores an -important aspect of the actual economy's
                                      -60-


response to such a tax change, namely, that adjustment in   the relative stocks
of capital goods is neither instantanous or costless. Hence, the short run

supplies of capital goods can be quite elastic, implying upward sloping short

run supply curves of firms as well as short run rents that are capitalized in

asset markets.

       Take the example of a reduction in corporate taxes. In the short run,

the price of existing corporate capital would rise, and of existing homes

would fall, as investors reallocated their portfolios. The price changes

would capitalize the expected present value of the effects of the tax reform

on future returns, conferring windfall gains on the owners of corporate

capital, and losses on homeowners. These price changes would act as signals

to the suppliers of new capital, calling forth more plant and equipment and

fewer homes, until their relative prices were again equated to their relative

long run marginal costs of production.

      The extreme volatility of asset prices in the American economy suggests

that these "capitalization" effects are of substantial importance. The ratio

of   the market value of corporate capital to its replacement cost has varied by

a factor of more than two over the last 15 years. The relative price of the

stock of owner occupied housing has increased very substantially. Bulow and

Summers (1984) point to evidence of substantial volatility in the prices of

specific used capital goods. Even more extreme volatility has been observed

in the relative price of non-reproducible assets such as land, gold, and

Rembrandts. Such relative price changes represent important transfers of

wealth, and must be considered if the incidence of tax changes is to be

accurately assessed.
                                          —61-


     A second type of example suggests the importance of focusing on asset

prices in examining tax incidence. Investment can be stimulated by reducing

the corporate tax rate or by the use of incentives for new investment such as

the investment tax credit or accelerated depreciation. In the long run, these

two types may be designed to have very similar effects. But their incidence

will differ dramatically. Because the former policy benefits old as well as

new capital, it will confer a windfall gain on the owners of capital at the

time that reform is announced. On the other hand, investment incentives may

actually confer a windfall loss on the holders of existing capital (Summers

(1981), Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1983b), Auerbach and Hines, (1986)). This

distinction cannot be captured within the standard general equilibrium model,

but requires a framework in which the distinction between new and old capital

is a meaningful one.


1.   Asset Prices and Investment:
     An Illustrative Partial Equilibrium Model

     The following partial equilibrium model of valuation of a firn's capital

is a simplified version of the framework used in Summers' (1981b). Assume

that there -is one type of nondepreciable capital that is supplied elastically

because of either internal or external adjustment costs. That is:



(4.21)    K =
                 I(PK(l+s))   I' >   0, 1(1) =   0



where K is the firm's capital stock, K is the price its capital goods relative

to consumption goods, s is the subsidy paid to the purchase of new investment

goods, and I (    ) is   the firm's net rate of investment function. Note that K

can be negative. Assume further that the capital good K is used in a

production process where it earns a total return F'(K)K and that F"(K) is
                                     —62-


negative. Finally assume that all returns are paid out and that investors

require some fixed rate of return p. to induce them to hold the capital assets.

The returns to holding a unit of capital come in the form of rents FT(K) arid

capital gains so that:




               F'(K)(l-T) +
(4.22)     p



     Equations (4.21) and (4.22) describe the dynamics of the adjustment of

the quantity and price of capital for T = s = 0.   The phase diagram is

depicted in Figure 2. Equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the two

schedules at the point where F'(K) = p.   Note that the system displays saddle

point stability. Except along a unique path marked by the dark arrows, the

system will not converge. Only along this path does the supply of investment

exactly validate the future returns capitalized into the market price of

capital goods. Such saddle point stability is characteristic of asset price

models. It implies that at any point in time, the stock of capital and

assumption of saddle point stability uniquely determine the asset price of

capital.

     The phase diagram in Figure 2 can be used to examine the effects of

various types of tax changes. In Figure 3 the effect of a tax on the asset's

marginal product is considered. Such a tax does not affect its supply curve

so that the K = 0 locus does not shift. The reduction in after tax returns

due to the increase in T leads to a leftward shift in the    = 0   locus. Such

an increase in the tax rate has no immediate effect on the capital stock, but

the market price of capital drops from E1 to B. As capital is decumulated,

the marginal product of capital rises, and the system converges from B to

   where K again equals its equilibrium value. Note that after the first

instant (i.e., after the capital loss) investors always receive a fixed return

p as reduced rents are made up for by capital gains as equilibrium is

restored. The position of the adjustment path depends on the elasticity of

supply of the capital good. IF the elasticity is substantial (the line with

arrows is flatter), adjustment is rapid so that the tax change has little

effect on the asset price of capital. If the SUi of capital is relatively

inelastic, there is a larger movement in the price of capital. In the

limiting case, where the supply of capital is completely inelastic, the

relative price of capital declines to point A along the    = 0 locus.

     The effect of a subsidy (raising s)to new capital investment which does

not apply to existing capital, such as accelerated depreciation or the

investment tax credit, is depicted in Figure 4. This shifts the 1< = 0

schedule, but has no effect on the return from owning capital and so does not

affect the    =   0 locus. Such a subsidy leads to an increase in long run

capital intensity, but also reduces the market value of existing capital

goods. This illustrates that tax measures that encourage investment may hurt

existing asset holders. The magnitude of the loss will depend upon the

elasticity of the supply of capital. If it is high, owners of existing

capital will suffer a loss close to the subsidy rate. If not, they will

continue to earn rents during the period of transition so the loss will be

smaller.

     That a subsidy to capital may hurt capitalists may at first seem

counter-intuitive. It occurs because the subsidy is available only to new
                                       -64-


capital which is a perfect substitute for existing capital in this model. The

adverse effect of a reduction in new car prices on used car prices illustrates

the effect considered here.


2.      Tax Capitalization in a General Equilibrium Model

        This section illustrates how capitalization and changes in factor prices

interact to determine tax incidence in general equilibrium. Consider a tax

on land rents in the simple two period life cycle model presented above, but

altered to include two assets, land and capital, but to exclude population

growth. Such a model is considered by Feldste-in (1977) in his seminal

contribution on the relationship of capitalization to tax incidence. The

lifetime budget constraint (4.1) is unaltered and is duplicated here for

reference.


(4.1)        C2t+i = (wt   —
                               Ci)(l+r+1)
The capital stock in period ti-i corresponds to the period t savings of young

workers that -is not invested in land. Letting Pt stand for the price of land

in period t, T for the inelastic stock of land, and K. as above, for the

period t stock of capital, we have that capital per worker in t+1 equals:


(4.23)           =    — C1t(W,r+1)     —



The production function determining output per worker, F(Kt,T,L), is assumed

to be homogeneous of degree one in capital, and inelastically supplied land

and labor. Pretax land rents, corresponding to the marginal product of land,

FTt, are taxed at rate 6. Since land and capital are perfect substitutes, the

return to holding land must equal the return to holding capital:
                                               -65-


                                          —

 (4.24)            =
                                Pt


      In the steady state we have from (4.24) and (4.23);

where r =          The above expression is positive (or zero) -if the denominator
            FK.
is positive, a requirement for steady state stability. Hence, a tax on land

rents raised capital intensity and, therefore, the real wage in the long run.

The intuition behind this result is that the land rent tax involves a

redistribution from initial elderly landowners to subsequent generations. As

described above such redistribution leads to increased savings. The initial

generation of elderly suffer a windfall loss in their resources because of

the tax on current land rents, and, generally, because of a reduction in the

initial period price of the land. Chamley and Wright (1986) provide an

extensive analysis of the dynamic incidence of the land tax in this type of

model. They show that the initial generation of elderly land owners is always

worse off because of the imposition of the tax. In addition, the initial

price of land can fall by more or less than the present value of future tax

revenues.

     Consider, as an illustration of the dynamic incidence of a land rent tax,
                                          —66-


the special case in which consumption in periods 1 and 2 are perfect
                        1

                      1 +p




(4.27)    U(Cit,C2t) =        U(Cit
                                      +
                                          C)
     The first order conditions for utility maximization imply:



(4.28)    r = p


With this preference function first period consumption is perfectly elastic

with respect to the interest rate. Since r is pegged by p, Kt is also

pegged, since p =   r     =
                              FK(Xt,T,L) and T and L are given. But pegging Kt means
that W is also pegged. Hence, in (4.23) Kt÷i and W are unaffected by the

land rent tax, and C1 rises by the amount of the decline in PtT. The price of

land can be expressed via (4.24) as the present discount value of the after

tax marginal product of land. Since the marginal products of land and capital

are fixed, we have:



                FT(l_O)
(4.29)    P =             , Vt.

Hence, in response to the introduction of a land rent tax the initial price of

land falls by the present discounted value of all future government tax

receipts. In this case the burden of the future as well as the current tax

rent tax falls entirely on the initial generation of elderly land owners. The

initial young and future generations are unaffected by this tax because the

wage and interest rate they face do not change.
                                      —67-


       Obviously, this strong result arises because of assumption (4.27). In

what may be the more likely event that both the price of land falls by less

than the present value of future taxes and capital increases over time, the

initial generation of elderly will bear most of the burden of the tax and

future generations will be better off due to the tax. The initial generation

of young workers will, however, bear some fraction of the tax burden, because

the increased capital accumulation will post-date their appearance in the

labor market. Hence, they WIll not enjoy a higher wage and will not be better

off; on the contrary, when this initial young generation is old, it will

receive a lower return on its saving, because the marginal produce of capital

will be lower due to the increase in capital formation. Through this channel

the initial young generation will share some fraction of the burden of the

tax.

       In this model, as in others presented in this chapter, the equilibrium

may not be unique. More specifically, for certain combinations of preferences

and production functions there may be an infinity of transition paths for the

capital stock and the price of land, all of which ultimately converge to the

same steady state (Chamley and Wright (1986)). The possibility of multiple

asset price equilibria in models of this kind is discussed more generally by

Calvo (1978). In such settings intertemporal incidence, like other variables

in the economy, are not uniquely determined.

1.       The equivalence also holds in a dynamic model provided final output in

the investment goods industries is treated as consumption under the
consumption tax and that purchases of newly produced investment goods are not

deductible under the value added tax.

experience, although U.S. saving experience is certainly neither solely nor

primarily a reflection of historical changes in fiscal policy.

7.       One perhaps surprising feature of these numbers is that steady state

utility is lower under wage taxation than under income taxation despite an 8

percent increase in capital intensity. Despite the 21 percent greater capital
                                    -69-


stock in the wage tax steady state, aggregate steady state consumption is

lower reflecting the smaller aggregate supply of labor induced by the

increased wage tax. While the new steady state has sufficient resources to

sustain a higher level of welfare, the choice between consumption and leisure

is suboptimally skewed towards leisure by the new post—tax intertemporal price

structure imposed by a wage tax. Auerbach, Kotlikoff and Skinner (1983)

demonstrate that for the CES utility function given in (3.40), wage taxation

is less efficient than an income tax over a wide range of parameter values.
