                                            ABSTRACT

        Prevailing wage laws, which require that construction workers employed by private
contractors on public projects be paid at least the wages and benefits that are "prevailing" for similar
work in or near the locality in which the project is located, have been the focus of an extensive policy
debate. We find that the relative wages of construction workers decline slightly after the repeal of a
state prevailing wage law. However, the small overall impact of law repeal masks substantial
differences in outcomes for different groups of construction employees. Repeal is associated with
a sizeable reduction in the union wage premium and a significant narrowing of the black/nonblack
wage differential for construction workers.

Introduction

       Prevailing wage laws, which require that construction workers employed by private

contractors on public projects be paid at least the wages and benefits that are “prevailing” for

similar work in or near the locality in which the project is located, have been the focus of an

extensive policy debate. Early empirical research on this topic sought to estimate the direct

financial costs of prevailing wage laws to governments. To the extent that the prevailing wage is

above the market wage, the laws may impose financial costs both through increased wage bills for

construction projects (e.g., Gujarati 1967; GAO 1979; Bourdon and Levitt 1980; Goldfarb and

Morrall 1981; Fraundorf et al. 1982, Thieblot 1996), and through an inefficient mix of capital and

labor and of different types of workers (e.g., CBO 1982).

       However, because public construction accounts for between one-fifth and one-quarter of

all construction, and because prevailing wage laws cover a substantial number of private projects

undertaken with public financing or assistance (e.g., CBO 1982, U.S. Department of Commerce

1996), prevailing wage laws may also affect construction labor markets more broadly. These

broad effects of the laws may have public policy implications beyond those implied by the direct

financial costs of the laws to government. If governments are the marginal purchasers of

construction services, then laws that require governments to pay a supramarket wage on all

projects may aid unions by reducing the potential cost advantage of nonunion labor. Furthermore,

if worker training or safety is undersupplied from a social perspective by competitive construction

markets, then prevailing wage laws may provide incentives for optimal training and safety (Philips

et al. 1995). On the other hand, prevailing wage laws may aggravate discrimination against

blacks in the construction industry by reducing nonunion-worker competition with members of

historically-discriminatory trade unions. Bernstein (1993, 1994) has argued that the federal
prevailing wage law, the Davis-Bacon Act, was passed with discriminatory intent (but see Belman

and Philips (1996) for an opposing view), and Keyes (1982) finds that Davis-Bacon contributes to

the low percentage of skilled black construction workers.

       Despite this policy importance, there is little evidence on the extent of the effects of

prevailing wage laws on construction labor markets. Identifying the impact of the Davis-Bacon

Act on construction costs is difficult because its national scope and long history mean that there

are no suitable construction labor markets to serve as a “control” group not subject to the Act.

Thus, this paper investigates the impact of the repeal of state prevailing wage laws -- which

specify that state governments must pay prevailing wages on state- and locally-financed

construction -- from 1970-1993 on labor markets for construction workers. It employs a

modified difference-in-difference-in-difference approach to estimating the impact of the laws,

estimating the effect of law repeal as the change over time in labor market outcomes for blue-

collar construction versus nonconstruction workers from states that repealed their laws to the

change over time in outcomes for workers from states that did not. We also assess the extent to

which law repeal has differential effects across groups of construction workers: on union versus

nonunion, and black versus nonblack workers.

       The paper proceeds in four sections. Section I provides background on prevailing wage

legislation and discusses the existing empirical literature. Section II describes the state law

repeals that we evaluate and presents our data and econometric models. Section III presents our

results, and Section IV concludes.



I.     Background on Prevailing Wage Laws

       Prevailing wage laws exist at the federal, state, and local level. The federal prevailing
wage law, the Davis-Bacon Act, was passed in 1931.1 The current Act, modified by amendments

in 1935 and 1964, requires private contractors to pay workers the prevailing wage/benefit

package on all contracts of more than $2,000 for construction, alteration, or repair of federal

public buildings or public works. The “prevailing wage” referenced in the Act is defined by the

Secretary of Labor as the package of wages and benefits paid to the majority of workers in a

given occupation grouping in the geographic area of the project; if the majority of workers do not

earn the same wage/benefit package, then the prevailing wage is equal to the average wage/benefit

package paid to these workers.2 The “public projects” covered by the Act include all construction

purchased directly by the federal government, plus most private but federally financed or assisted

construction: the terms of the Act cover construction undertaken through more than 58 other

laws (CBO 1982).

         State prevailing wage laws set a minimum wage for construction workers on state (and

generally municipal) works projects. Their terms differ across states in multiple dimensions, and

are frequently defined customarily rather than by reference to written statutes or regulations

(Thieblot 1986, 1995). Some state prevailing wage laws are almost nonbinding; others set wages

for virtually all contracts at the collectively-bargained wage level. In addition, different states’

laws treat jointly financed projects (e.g., state/federal, local/federal, private/public) differently.

Some states defer to the federal Act; others preempt the federal Act; others set the state

prevailing wage at the higher of the state or federal prevailing wage. The scope of projects and

workers covered under state laws also varies. States explicitly include or exclude specific types of

projects (such as road construction) and/or workers, and/or projects above or below a given

value.

         Even if state prevailing wage laws covered purely state and local public construction only,
they would have a potentially significant influence on construction labor markets. State and local

public construction accounts for 16 to 22 percent of all construction over the 1970-1993 period,

as compared to 2 to 3 percent for federal public construction (US Department of Commerce

1996, Current Construction Reports C30, Tables 1-2). However, the federal prevailing wage law

is likely to affect labor markets disproportionately, because state and local construction projects

are often partially federally funded. (Indeed, even though federal public construction is only 2-3

percent of total construction, CBO estimates suggest that 20 to 25 percent of all construction is

covered by the Davis-Bacon Act (CBO 1982).)

       The early empirical literature was concerned with assessing the impact of the Davis-Bacon

Act on the federal government's construction costs (e.g., Gujarati 1967; GAO 1979; Bourdon and

Levitt 1980; Goldfarb and Morrall 1981; Fraundorf et al. 1982). These studies estimate the

impact of Davis-Bacon as the difference between the Department of Labor's posted Davis-Bacon

prevailing wage and the average wage for construction workers of a given occupation in a given

geographic area. Although the studies agree that Davis-Bacon increases the government's labor

costs for construction, they report a wide range of point estimates (from 4 to 38 percent).

       However, identifying the impact of the Davis-Bacon Act on construction costs is difficult

because its national scope and long history mean that there are no suitable construction labor

markets to serve as a “control” group not subject to the Act. In particular, because the average

wage in an area is a function of the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage, the difference between the

Davis-Bacon wage and the average wage is not an unbiased estimate of the additional labor costs

borne by the government, over what they would have paid in the absence of Davis-Bacon (but see

Allen (1983) for a novel way to correct for this bias). Most seriously, though, this identification

problem limits the generalizability of the findings from the early literature to construction labor
markets more broadly, and thereby limits the extent to which the early literature can illuminate the

policy questions of interest.

       In recognition of these gaps, and of the size of the share of state and local public

construction, more recent work investigates the impact of state prevailing wage laws, by

comparing labor market outcomes across states with differing laws. Building on prior research

(Thieblot 1986, 1996; Philips et al. 1995), Table 1 presents the effective dates for the adoption

and repeal of state prevailing wage laws. As of 1969, forty states had prevailing wage laws that

covered construction financed by state and local governments. Between 1969 and 1993, nine

states repealed their prevailing wage laws, and Minnesota enacted a prevailing wage law. As

discussed above, because of the multidimensional variation across states in the prevailing wage

statutes and regulatory policies, there is no way a priori to categorize the laws more finely.

       Conclusions from the state prevailing wage law studies are not as uniform as results from

analyses of the effects of Davis-Bacon. Allen and Reich (1980) report that state prevailing wage

laws have no significant effect on school construction costs, holding constant price levels,

urbanization, and climate variables, although Allen (1987) suggests that prevailing wage laws

enable union contractors to receive a higher price for similar school and hospital projects than can

nonunion contractors. Philips et al. (1995) find that the average construction wage declined more

in states that repealed their prevailing wage laws than in states that did not, based on 4-digit SIC

average wages. They also find that repeal of state prevailing wage laws is associated with an

increase in injury rates for plumbers and pipe fitters, although Thieblot (1996) shows that average

construction injury rates in repeal states declined by more than average rates in nonrepeal states.

       However, concerns about unobserved differences across states and over time complicate

interpretation of the estimated effect of interest from all of the state law studies. The studies fail
to control for fixed differences across states in laws, regulatory policies, and other characteristics;

for state/time-varying macroeconomic factors affecting all blue-collar labor markets; and for

state/time-varying microeconomic factors such as the occupational and skill mix of construction

workers. For example, if states that repeal their prevailing wage laws also have unobserved fixed

differences in policies that lead to lower construction wages, then the estimated effect of the laws

might represent in part unobserved fixed differences across states, leading to the overstatement of

the impact of prevailing wage law repeal. Along these lines, if states repeal prevailing wage laws

in response to weak blue-collar labor markets (to improve competitiveness), then the estimated

absolute effect of the laws on construction workers might represent in part the effect of

unmeasured labor market conditions for all blue-collar workers. Either of these biases would be

magnified if contractors respond to repeals by employing less-skilled workers, because the

estimated effects might represent in part unobserved changes in workforce composition. And, in

any event, the existing work does not address other policy questions of interest, such as the

differential impact of prevailing wage laws on black and union workers.



II.    Models and Data

       We investigate the impact of state prevailing wage law repeal with methods that directly

address these concerns. Our basic specification compares time trends in blue-collar construction

and nonconstruction labor market outcomes across repeal and nonrepeal states during a 24 year

period. We model wages and unionization rates as nonparametric functions of worker

characteristics, state-fixed-effects, time-fixed-effects, and prevailing wage laws; thus, we control

for fixed differences across states and over time. We use individual data on workers from the

census and Current Population Survey (CPS), which enable us to control for changes in
workforce composition. Finally, we estimate the impact of prevailing wage law repeal as the

difference between the change over time in the relative blue-collar construction/nonconstruction

wage in repeal states and nonrepeal states, to control for other, unobserved time-varying factors

that affect all blue-collar labor markets and may be correlated with the status of labor market

regulation.

       While this is fundamentally a difference-in-difference-in-difference (DDD) approach to

estimating the impact of the laws, we modify conventional DDD strategies in several ways. First,

our models include few restrictive parametric or distributional assumptions about the relationship

between laws, individual characteristics, and labor market outcomes. Second, we do not only

model the impact of law repeal as having a one-time effect on the levels of outcomes. For

example, to the extent that multi-year contracts influence construction wages, changes in

prevailing wage laws may not have instantaneous effects on labor markets. In addition, to the

extent that prevailing wage laws affect the bargaining positions of workers and employers, the

laws may affect future wage growth as well as current wage levels. Third, in order to investigate

the impact of repeal on black and on union workers, we use a difference-in-difference-in-

difference-in-difference (DDDD) approach to estimate the relative growth in the blue-collar

black/nonblack (union/nonunion) construction/nonconstruction wage differential in repeal versus

nonrepeal states.

       To illustrate DDD estimation of the impact of law repeal, Table 2 presents descriptive

statistics from both individual- and establishment-level data sets on wage trends during the 1980s

for construction and nonconstruction workers, for states repealing and not repealing prevailing

wage laws.3 In addition to analysis of the census and CPS, Table 2 reports for comparison

purposes descriptive statistics from the Department of Labor’s ES-202 data gathered by
establishment on employees covered by various unemployment insurance programs. The “before

law repeal” columns (1) and (4) present average wages for 1979 (1979 CPS and ES-202, 1980

census); the “after law repeal” columns (2) and (5) present average wages for 1993 (CPS and ES-

202) and 1989 (1990 census). The “time difference for location” columns (5) and (6) present the

proportional change in wages before versus after law repeal in a given type of state.

          The top panel of Table 2 compares the change in average wages for construction workers

in the states that repealed their laws (“expermental” states) to the change in average wages for

construction workers in the states that did not (“nonexperimental” states). In the census, for

example, there was a 17.5 percent fall in construction workers’ wages over the 1980s in states

that repealed their laws, compared to a 12.9 percent fall in wages in states that did not. Thus,

there was a 4.7 percent relative fall in construction workers’ wages in states that repealed their

prevailing wage laws; this is the differences-in-differences (DD) estimate of the impact of law

repeal.

          However, if there were unobserved time-varying factors that affected all blue-collar labor

markets and were correlated with the status of labor market regulation, this DD estimate would

not identify the impact of the law: the DD estimate would be a combination of the impact of the

law and of the impact of the unobserved factors affecting all blue-collar labor markets. The

bottom panel of Table 2 investigates this possibility by examining the change in average wages for

nonconstruction workers in experimental relative to nonexperimental states. In fact, in the

census, there is a slight fall in relative wages in experimental states of 2.2 percent, which suggests

that controlling for factors correlated with law repeal that influence all blue-collar workers may be

important.

          Taking the difference between the first and seventh rows of column (7) of Table 2 shows
that there is a 2.5 percent fall in the relative wages of construction workers in states that repealed

their prevailing wage laws, compared to the change in relative wages in the nonexperimental

states. This DDD estimate suggests that prevailing wage law repeal has a causal impact on

construction labor markets. This conclusion is supported by replication of this result with other

data sets, collected for different types of workers. Simple DDD estimates from the CPS and ES-

202 are similar, at -1.3 percent for blue-collar workers in the CPS (= -0.020 + 0.007), -1.9

percent for all workers in the CPS (= -0.016 - 0.003), and -1.8 percent for all workers in the ES-

202 (= -0.041 + 0.023).

       Our formal models analyze repeated cross sections of blue-collar workers from the 1970,

1980, and 1990 census and the 1977-1993 CPS. In state s = 1, ..., S during year t = 1 , ..., T, one

observation in our model is an individual worker i = 1, ..., Nst. Each worker has occupational and

demographic characteristics Xist, which we describe as a set of binary variables. We describe

worker i's industry of employment with Cist, where Cist = 1 if worker i was employed in

construction in state s and year t and 0 otherwise. Depending on the year of the survey and the

worker's state of residence, the worker's labor market outcome may be affected by a prevailing

wage law. We define Ls = 1 if state s repealed its prevailing wage law over the 1970-1990 period

(Ls = 0 otherwise), and Ast = 1 if the repeal occurred before year t (Ast = 0 otherwise).4 We study

two labor market outcomes: real hourly wages Wist and union status Uist, where Uist = 1 if worker

i was a union member and 0 otherwise.

       In regression terms, the basic DDD models of wages and unionization rates are of the

form

                             c                c
         ln(Wist) ' è t % è t ( Cist % á s % á s ( Cist % Ls( A stã1 % Ls( Ast( Cistã2 % X istâ % åist ,   (1)
where è t is a time-fixed-effect, á s is a state-fixed-effect, åist is an error term, 5 and ã2 is the effect of

interest -- the change over time in the construction wage premium in states that repealed their

prevailing wage laws relative to the change over time in states that did not.

        We use the CPS to investigate the dynamic impacts of prevailing wage law repeal by

estimating separately the change over time soon after repeal and long after repeal in the

construction wage premium in states that repealed their prevailing wage laws relative to the

change over time in states that did not, where

                                       c              c
                ln(Wist) ' è t % è t ( Cist % á s % á s ( C ist % Ls( SAstã1s % Ls( SA st( Cistã2s %
                                                                                                                 (1a)
                                Ls( LAstã1l % L s( LAst( Cistã2l % Xistâ % åist.

In one time-since-adoption specification, we defined SAst = 1 if the repeal occurred 1-2 years

before year t (SAst = 0 otherwise), and LAst = 1 if the repeal occurred 3 or more years before year

t (LAst = 0 otherwise). In an alternative time-since-adoption specification, we defined SAst = 1 if

the repeal occurred 1-4 years before year t (SAst = 0 otherwise), and LAst = 1 if the repeal

occurred 5 or more years before year t (LAst = 0 otherwise).

        Finally, we estimate DDDD models to assess the impact of prevailing wage law repeal on

the change over time in differences by race and union status in the construction wage premium

(ã4):

                       b           c          b( c                       b          c           b( c
   ln(Wist) ' è t % è t ( Bist % è t ( Cist % è t ( B ist( Cist % á s % á s ( Bist % á s ( Cist % á s ( B ist( Cist
                                                                                                                    (2)
         % L s( Astã1 % Ls( Ast( B istã2 % Ls( A st( Cistã3 % Ls( Ast( B ist( Cistã4 % Xistâ % åist .

We estimate the effect of law repeal on trends in differences in the construction wage premium

soon after versus long after repeal with versions of equation (2) analogous to equation (1a).

Analogues to equation (2) that substitute Uist for Bist assess the impact of law repeal on the change

over time in differences by union status in the construction wage premium.
       We estimate the parameters of models (1) and (2) with nonfarm private-sector blue-collar

wage and salary workers aged 16 to 64 using the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the

census. Our principal CPS results are based on the currently employed workers in the Merged

Outgoing Rotation Groups (MORGs) for 1979-1993 plus such workers in the May CPS survey

groups from 1977-1978; we appended the earlier May CPS samples to the CPS MORGs to

expand the time period covered by our analysis in the years before law changes occurred.6 For

the same reason, our CPS results estimating the impact of repeal on the relative union wage

premium for construction workers (equation (2)) are based on the 1983-1993 MORGs matched

with May CPS survey groups from 1977-1981 (because the CPS did not begin asking all outgoing

rotation groups about their union status until 1983, and the CPS did not ask any workers about

their union status in 1982).7 The vector of control variables X in the CPS includes indicators for

age (16-20, 21-25, 26-30, 31-35, 36-40, 41-45, 46-50, 51-55, 56-60, 60-64), educational

attainment (less than high school, high school, some college, college graduate or more), marital

status (married or unmarried), gender, black or nonblack race, and one-digit occupational

classification (craftmen and kindred workers, operatives except transport, transport equipment

operatives, nonfarm laborers, service workers), plus an interaction effect between each element of

X and an variable indicating whether the observation was from the 1986 CPS or later.

       Our census results are based on workers employed at any time during the previous year

from the 1970, 1980, and 1990 public use census files. Thus, the wage information in the three

censuses pertains to the years 1969, 1979, and 1989. To calculate the hourly wage for workers in

1970 with missing hours, we imputed average hours per week based on reported hours per week

for workers in 1980 with the same age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, educational attainment,

industry, and occupation. For all years, we analyze a 1 percent sample of blue-collar
nonconstruction workers. For 1980 and 1990, we analyze a 5 percent sample of blue-collar

construction workers; for 1970, a 5 percent sample with state information is not available, so we

analyze a 2 percent sample of blue-collar construction workers (U.S. Department of Commerce

1972). Because Minnesota enacted a prevailing wage law in 1973, we omit workers from

Minnesota from our analysis of the census data. The vector of control variables X in the census

includes all of the variables from the CPS analysis plus indicators for hispanic/nonhispanic

ethnicity and foreign/US country of birth, plus interactions between year indicators and each

element of X. Analyses of the census data weight each observation by the inverse of its sampling

probability.



III.    Results

Basic Difference-in-Difference-in-Difference Results

        Table 3 presents estimates of ã2, the effect of prevailing wage law repeal on construction

wage differentials. In contrast to the simple DDD estimates from Table 2, our regression

estimates of the impact of law repeal control for changes in workforce demographic and

occupational composition across states and over time (except column (1)), for time- and state-

fixed-effects, and for construction*time- and construction*state-fixed-effects (except columns (2)

and (4), which control for construction*time and construction*Ls). In addition, our regression

estimates allow returns-to-characteristics to differ in 1970, 1980, and 1990 (census) and to differ

before and on/after 1986 (CPS). Columns (1)-(3) provide estimates based on the 1970, 1980, and

1990 census (column (1) reports DDD estimates on the effect of repeal on the change over time in

wage levels from equation (1) without controls for demographic and occupational characteristics

Xist). Columns (4)-(7) provide estimates based on the 1977-1993 CPS: columns (4) and (5)
report estimates from equation (1), and columns (6) and (7) report estimates of the time-since-

adoption specification given by equation (1a).

       The regression results reported in Table 3 echo the simple DDD estimates reported in

Table 2: repeal of prevailing wage laws leads to slight decreases in construction wage

differentials. In the census, the DDD impact of repeal on the change over time in wage levels

ranges from 2 to 4 percent, depending on the controls included in the regression.8 Average effect

estimates of the impact of law repeal from the CPS are of the same or smaller magnitude as those

from the census. The estimated impact of repeal from equation (1) calculated controlling for

construction*Ls (column (4)) is -3.9 percent. Controlling for a full set of construction*state-

fixed-effects reduces this estimate substantially in both the basic and the time-since-adoption

specification (columns (5) - (7)), suggesting that state heterogeneity in construction labor markets

is an important determinant of wage schedules.



Differential Impacts of Prevailing Wage Law Repeal by Race

       However, estimates of the average effect of law repeal fail to identify the differential

effects of repeal across groups of construction workers, which also may be important from a

policy perspective. We began by analyzing the effects of law repeal on racial differences in

construction employment. In the 1990 census, blacks comprised 11.7 percent of blue-collar

nonconstruction workers and 7.4 percent of blue-collar construction workers, leading to a black

construction employment differential of -4.3 percentage points (= 0.074 - 0.117). In the census,

we found that the black construction employment differential shrunk by 1 percentage point in

repeal versus nonrepeal states over our sample period, controlling for demographic and

occupational characteristics (allowing returns-to-characteristics to vary over time), and for state-
fixed-effects, time-fixed-effects, time-fixed-effects*black, and Ls*black. However, the statistical

significance of this result was not robust to the inclusion of a full set of state*black interactions,

and we did not find any significant trends in blacks’ construction employment differentials in the

CPS.

        For this reason, we focus on the relative wage impacts of repeal. Table 4 reports DDDD

estimates of ã4, the impact of repeal on racial differences in the construction wage premium from

equations (2) and (2a) using the census and the CPS. Except for column (1), the models in the

Table control for demographic and occupational characteristics (allowing returns-to-

characteristics to vary over time), and for state-fixed-effects, time-fixed-effects, state-fixed-

effects*construction, time-fixed-effects*construction, time-fixed-effects*black, state-fixed-

effects*black, time-fixed-effects*black*construction, and state-fixed-effects*black*construction.

        The results in Table 4 show that repeals affect black and nonblack construction workers

differently. Columns (1) and (2) show that in the census, the construction wage premium earned

by black workers rose by approximately 4 percentage points relative to that earned by nonblacks

as a result of prevailing wage law repeal; this difference is statistically significant at the 5 percent

level. According to the CPS, law repeal led to statistically significant increases (at the 10 percent

level) in the long-run relative construction wage premium for blacks of 5.5 to 6.8 percentage

points, depending on specification (columns (3) - (5)). In both the census and the CPS, repeal has

a negative effect on nonblacks’ construction wage premium, although this effect is only

statistically significant in the census.

        The differential impact of law repeal on blacks’ construction wage premium has two

important implications. First, because the raw difference between blacks’ and nonblacks’

construction wage premium is 6.5 percentage points,9 law repeal eliminates at least two-thirds of
this difference (. 4 / 6.5). Second, in no specification does law repeal significantly reduce the

absolute level of black workers’ construction wage differential, and in some specifications

positively increases black workers’ construction wage differential, even as it reduces the

construction differential for nonblack workers. In terms of equation (2), the impact of law repeal

on the absolute level of black workers’ construction wage differential is equal to ã3 + ã4.       In the

census, ã3 + ã4 is small in magnitude, but in the CPS, the long-run estimate of ã3 + ã4 from column

(5) is approximately equal to 4.8 percent.



Differential Impact of Prevailing Wage Law Repeal by Union Status

        Based on the CPS, Table 5 presents estimates of the effect of law repeal on the

construction unionization differential (equations (1) and (1a), columns (1) - (3)) and the relative

union wage premium for construction workers (equations (2) and (2a), columns (4)- (6)).

Regression results suggest that repeal in the long run reduces the relative construction

unionization differential slightly, although this result is not statistically significant, and is extremely

small in magnitude (and actually positive in sign in the short run). However, prevailing wage law

repeal does significantly reduce the relative union wage premium for construction workers,

controlling for worker demographic and occupational characteristics (allowing returns-to-

characteristics to vary over time), and for state-fixed-effects, time-fixed-effects, state-fixed-

effects*construction, time-fixed-effects*construction, time-fixed-effects*union, state-fixed-

effects*union, time-fixed-effects*union*construction, and state-fixed-effects*union*construction.

The first row of column (4) suggests that prevailing wage law repeal reduces the relative union

wage premium paid to construction workers by approximately 5.9 percentage points. Columns (5)

and (6) show that this effect grows in magnitude over time: three years after law repeal, the
relative union wage premium paid to construction workers falls by approximately 9.9 percentage

points, growing to 11.2 percentage points after 5 or more years.10 These effects are both

statistically and economically significant. Estimates from the 1983-1993 CPS MORGs indicate

that the additional average union wage differential earned by construction workers over that

earned by nonconstruction workers is approximately 20 percent. Thus, law repeal reduces the

relative union wage differential for construction workers by approximately half. However, law

repeal in the long run is not statistically significantly negatively correlated with nonconstruction

union wage differentials. Indeed, states repealing their prevailing wage laws show statistically

significant increases in nonconstruction unionization. Thus, there is no evidence that prevailing

wage law repeal is correlated with other state-level policies that have adverse effects on unions.



Understanding Differential Impacts by Race and Union Status

       We conducted additional analyses to investigate the mechanism by which law repeal

affects racial differences in construction wage differentials, and the construction wage premium

generally. First, law repeal does not have its most important impact on racial differentials through

its impact on the unionization rate. Following Ashenfelter (1972), we calculated the total

contribution of unionization to the black/nonblack wage differential as

ubjãj - uwjãj’, where ubj (uwj) is the share of black (nonblack) workers who are union members in

industry j and ãj (ãj’) is the union/nonunion wage differential for blacks (nonblacks) in industry j.

In other words, we estimate what the change in the racial wage differential would be if the

unionization rate were zero, relative to the current racial differential. Since the estimated total

contribution of unionization to racial differences in the construction wage premium is

approximately 3 percentage points,11 even a 6 percent decrease in the unionization rate (= 1.5
percentage points/25 points total unionization rate, where 1.5 percentage points is approximately

the maximum impact of the law repeals) would reduce the black/nonblack construction wage

differential by at most 0.18 percentage points (=0.06 * 3). Thus, law repeal, which has an

estimated total effect an order of magnitude larger, must affect wage differentials primarily

through means other than reduced unionization.

       Second, repeal achieves its approximately 2-percent effect on the aggregate construction

wage differential primarily by reducing the union wage premium paid to construction workers. If

the average construction unionization rate is equal to u, then the average effect for all

construction workers of law repeal in terms of the parameters from equation (2) (substituting Uist

for Bist) is equal to (1-u)*ã3 + u*(ã3 + ã4). Since u . 0.25 (based on the CPS), ã3 = 0.007 and ã4 =

-0.112 (Table 5, column (6)), most of the effect on the aggregate wage differential comes through

ã4 rather than through ã3.



Sensitivity Analyses

       One important concern with any analysis of the effects of law changes is policy

endogeneity – the correlation of law repeal with unobserved time-varying determinants of wages.

We found no substantial evidence that prevailing wage law repeal was endogenous. First,

according to Thieblot (1986, 1996), the ways in which repeal occurred are consistent with an

assumption of exogenous timing. Some repeals (e.g., Arizona) were imposed judicially (rather

than legislatively), and therefore likely to be less dependent on contemporaneous economic

conditions. Similarly, most legislative repeals (e.g., Alabama, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, New

Hampshire, Utah) only occurred after previous failed attempts; repeal efforts often started years

before a change in law took place. Second, as discussed above, we found no systematic
correlations between repeal and wages or union wage differentials of nonconstruction blue collar

workers, suggesting that repeal was not correlated with other state-level policies that have

adverse effects on unions or unionized workers.

        Third, to investigate directly the possibility that time-varying state macroeconomic factors

correlated with but not caused by repeal were responsible for differential trends in wage

differentials, we parameterized the differential impact of state macroeconomic factors by

reestimating equations (1) and (1a) with controls for the state unemployment rate and the state

unemployment rate*construction and by reestimating equations (2) and (2a) with controls for

unemployment, unemployment*black, unemployment*construction, and

unemployment*black*construction (for those versions of equations (2) and (2a) that model the

impact of law repeal on the union/nonunion wage differential, we included controls for

unemployment, unemployment*union, unemployment*construction, and

unemployment*union*construction). In no case did inclusion of these macroeconomic control

variables alter substantially the estimated effects of law repeal.

        We further investigated the hypothesis that the estimated effects of law repeal were caused

by underlying macroeconomic labor market conditions that differentially affected the construction

industry and were correlated with state labor market rules by reestimating the basic model with

altered control groups. We estimated equations (1) and (1a) based on the census dropping from

the analysis alternately all individuals from states that always had a prevailing wage law in effect

during the sample period, and all individuals from states that never had a prevailing wage law in

effect during the sample period. Although the point estimates of the effect of law repeal were

somewhat larger in those models that used only individuals from states who never had a prevailing

wage law as the control group, the substantive conclusions did not change.
IV.      Conclusion

         We find that state prevailing wage laws have small but significant average effects on

construction labor markets. Repeal of prevailing wage laws leads to slight decreases in the

relative wage levels of construction workers. However, the effects of repeal differ substantially

across groups of construction workers. The negative effects of repeal on wages are borne

primarily by union and by white workers. Although relative construction unionization rates do

not decline significantly in response to repeal, the long-run union wage premium earned by

construction workers decreases by approximately 10 percentage points, or almost half of the total

union wage premium in construction. Since union members account for approximately 25 percent

of all construction workers, the 10-percentage-point decrease in the union wage premium

accounts for essentially all of the (approximately 2 to 4 percent) decline in construction workers’

wages.

         Second, despite the negative overall effects of repeal on construction workers, repeal of

prevailing wage laws does not harm (or actually benefits) black construction workers. Prevailing

wage law repeal raises black workers’ construction wage differential relative to nonblack

workers’ differential. Furthermore, in no specification does law repeal significantly reduce the

absolute level of black workers’ construction wage differential, and in some specifications

increases the level of black workers’ construction wage differential, even as it reduces the

construction differential for nonblack workers.

         The policy implications of these findings, and their applicability to other states considering

repeal of their prevailing wage laws, depend crucially on the mechanism causing the differential

impact of repeal across groups. On one hand, the differential impact of repeal may reflect a
decrease in discrimination due to a weakening of construction unions, or due to a change in

unions’ behavior arising out of a declining union wage premium. On the other hand, if repeal

affects workers in heavy construction (SIC 16, e.g., road and sewer construction) more than

workers in light construction (SIC 15 and 17, e.g., general and special trade contractors)12, and

heavy construction workers are more likely to be white and unionized, then the differential impact

of repeal by race and union status may simply reflect the differential composition of workers in the

two segments of the construction industry. In this case, law repeal might simply be transferring

resources from workers to purchasers of heavy construction projects. Furthermore, to the extent

that the composition of the construction industry differs between repeal states and other states

considering repeal, our findings may not even accurately forecast the average effects of repeal in

states considering repeal.

       Unfortunately, since neither the CPS nor the census includes detailed industry or union

information on construction workers, we cannot distinguish definitively between these two

hypotheses. Indeed, in our supplementary analyses, we found no clear support for either causal

mechanism. We found no evidence that repeal affected racial wage differentials through the

unionization rate. The counterfactual of reducing the unionization rate to zero in both

construction and nonconstruction industries would only reduce the magnitude of the raw

difference between blacks’ and nonblacks’ construction wage differential by half. Compared to

the contribution of unionization to racial wage differentials in the 1960s, the minimal contribution

of unionization in the 1980s and 1990s is striking. Because law repeal has a relatively small

impact on the unionization rate, law repeal must affect race-based wage differentials primarily

through other means.

       On the other hand, we found no evidence that repeal had different effects on different
segments of the construction industry. Differential trends in payroll per worker from the ES202

establishment data presented in Table 2 suggest that repeal affects workers in heavy construction

and light construction equally: the simple DDD estimates of the effect of repeal in the heavy

construction industry are only 0.1 percent greater than the estimates of the effect of repeal in the

light construction industry (-1.9 percent compared to -1.8 percent). Of course, because the

establishment data do not allow us to control for worker heterogeneity, this finding is not a

definitive rejection of differential impacts across 2-digit SIC construction industries. We leave

further investigation of the mechanism by which law repeal affects wage schedules to future

research. One possible avenue for investigation might be the extent to which construction union

behavior or decision-making differs in repeal and nonrepeal states.

  2.Before 1985, the prevailing wage was equal to that paid to more than 30 percent of the workers

  in a given industry/occupation/area group, or the average if less than 30 percent of the workers

  earned the same amount.

  3.In this and all of our subsequent analysis, we deleted individuals reporting wages of less than

  $1.65 or greater than $50 per hour in 1982 constant dollars.

  4.We assume in all of the models that law repeals take effect beginning in the calendar year after

  the repeal is adopted.

  5.We estimate all models allowing for heteroscedasticity and for within state/time-group

  correlation in åist, which may be important in models of state policy effects (Moulton 1990).

  6.Prior to 1989, workers in the CPS earning more than $999 per week were topcoded at $999.

  We recoded these workers to earning $1,400 per week.

  7.If the unadjusted CPS sampling weight for individual i in state s during year t is defined as Ùist

  (e.g., the number of individuals represented by individual i), analyses of the May/MORG sample

  weight each observation by its adjusted sampling weight ù ist, where

                                                        Ùist

  8.The impact of repeal on the change over time in the census in wage growth rates (e.g., 1980-90

  wage growth relative to 1970-80 wage growth in repealing versus nonrepealing states) is small

  and statistically insignificant, suggesting some caution in a strong causal interpretation of our
findings; state repeals may be correlated with preexisting factors affect construction labor

markets.

9.Calculations based on the 1990 census.

10.Interpretation of the long-run rather than the short-run effects as the equilibrium impact of law

report depends on two key assumptions: 1) that the full effects of repeal on labor markets take

more than two years to appear and 2) no other changes in the labor market or legal environment

correlated with but not caused by repeal occurred three to five years after repeal. On one hand, to

the extent that wage levels, and especially wages differences across types of workers, take several

years to re-equilibrate in response to changes in state policy, the long-run effects would accurate

represent the equilibrium impact of law reform. On the other hand, to the extent that union

contracts in the construction industry are shorter than two years in duration, the short-run effects

would accurately represent the equilibrium impact of repeal, with fewer potential unobserved

confounding factors.

11. The minimal contribution of the unionization rate to racial wage differentials in construction in

the 1980s and 1990s is particularly striking when compared either to its contribution in 1967, or

to the total racial wage differential. According to Ashenfelter (1972), the estimated contribution

of unionization to racial differences in construction wage premiums was 8.9 percentage points in

1967. According to calculations based on the 1990 census, the total racial wage differential in the

construction industry was 17.6 percent.

12.This would be true if, for example, (prevailing-wage-law covered) state and local construction

projects involve more heavy than light construction, and light construction workers are poor

substitutes for heavy construction workers.
