Planning and Financial Literacy: How Do Women Fare?

                                            ABSTRACT

Many older US households have done little or no planning for retirement, and there is a substantial
population that seems to undersave for retirement. Of particular concern is the relative position of
older women, who are more vulnerable to old-age poverty due to their longer longevity. This paper
uses data from a special module we devised on planning and financial literacy in the 2004 Health and
Retirement Study. It shows that women display much lower levels of financial literacy than the older
population as a whole. In addition, women who are less financially literate are also less likely to plan
for retirement and be successful planners. These findings have important implications for policy and
for programs aimed at fostering financial security at older ages.

                 Planning and Financial Literacy: How Do Women Fare?

                                Annamaria Lusardi and Olivia S. Mitchell∗

          Many Baby Boomers are approaching retirement with perilously low levels of financial

wealth and virtually no assets other than their homes (Annamaria Lusardi and Olivia S. Mitchell

2007a). This is a particular concern for female-headed households who face many lean years

ahead (David R. Weir and Robert J. Willis 2000). Yet little is known about why people fail to

plan for retirement and how planning as well as information costs shape retirement saving

decisions. Lack of planning has important consequences for saving and portfolio choice: those

who do not plan tend to accumulate far less wealth than those who plan, and nonplanners are also

less likely to invest in stocks and tax-favored assets (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007b).

          This paper examines the factors central to women’s retirement planning, relying on a

purpose-designed module we have developed for the 2004 Health and Retirement study (HRS)

on planning and financial literacy. In this module, we have inserted several questions that

measure basic levels of financial literacy, as well as questions to assess how respondents plan

and save for retirement. Our research shows that older women in the US have very low levels of

financial literacy, and the majority of women have undertaken no retirement planning.

Furthermore, financial knowledge and planning are clearly interrelated: women who display

higher financial literacy are more likely to plan and be successful planners.

       Our findings can be of help to those seeking to enhance older women’s retirement

security. Both employers and governments have devoted efforts to seminars, educational

programs, and retirement planning products in the last decade, but such efforts have had only a

very mixed effect on saving patterns (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007b). One-size-fits-all programs

are unlikely to successfully address saving shortfalls among many different groups. Specifically,

insofar as financial illiteracy is widespread among women, it is doubtful that a one-time financial

education seminar can reshape long-term planning and saving decisions. Instead, programs

targeted specifically at women may be better suited to address fundamental differences in their

preferences, saving needs, and financial knowledge.

I. Empirical Strategy

       The decision of how much to save for retirement is a complex one, as it requires

collecting and processing information on a large set of variables including Social Security and

pensions, inflation, and interest rates, to name a few, and also making predictions about future

values of these variables. It is also necessary for the consumer to understand compound interest,

inflation, financial markets, mortality tables, and more. Nevertheless, little research has asked

exactly how households make saving decisions, how they overcome the difficulty of making

those decisions, and whether they are financially literate enough to make well-informed choices.

These topics are of paramount importance, particularly when older households are increasingly

required to take responsibility for investing and allocating their pension wealth.

   To gain insight into how households make saving decisions, we devised a module on

planning and financial literacy for the 2004 Health and Retirement Study (see Lusardi and

Mitchell 2006). The module includes three questions on financial literacy, as follows:
                                                                                                   3



1. Suppose you had $100 in a savings account and the interest rate was 2% per year. After 5

   years, how much do you think you would have in the account if you left the money to grow:

   more than $102, exactly $102, less than $102?

2. Imagine that the interest rate on your savings account was 1% per year and inflation was 2%

   per year. After 1 year, would you be able to buy more than, exactly the same as, or less than

   today with the money in this account?

3. Do you think that the following statement is true or false? Buying a single company stock

   usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund.

The first two questions, which we refer to as “Interest Rate” and “Inflation,” help evaluate

whether respondents display knowledge of fundamental economic concepts and basic numeracy.

The third question, which we refer to as “Risk Diversification,” evaluates respondents’

knowledge of risk diversification, a crucial element of an informed investment decision.

         The HRS module also asks respondents how they calculated their retirement saving

needs. Retirement planning is a very strong predictor of wealth accumulation (Lusardi and

Mitchell 2007a). The questions about retirement planning calculations we devised for the module

are as follows:

4. Have you ever tried to figure out how much your household would need to save for

   retirement? Yes or No.

5. Have you developed a plan for retirement saving? Yes; more or less; no.

6. How often have you been able to stick to this plan: would you say always, mostly, rarely, or

never?

In what follows, we tabulate the prevalence of financial literacy and retirement calculations

among a sample of age 50+ women respondents in the 2004 HRS module on planning and
                                                                                                              4



literacy. In addition, we assess whether the women who lack insight into these simple economic

facts also appeared to have particular difficulty devising and carrying out plans.

II. Financial Literacy and Retirement Planning

            Table 1 reports the responses to the financial literacy questions for our sample of 785

women respondents to the 2004 HRS module. The Table shows that 61.9 percent of women

correctly answered the interest rate calculation question. This is a relatively easy question, so it

is surprising that so many were unable to respond correctly, particularly because these older

women have most likely made numerous decisions involving interest rates over their lifetimes

(e.g. credit card rates, mortgage financing rates, etc). Respondents were more accurate about the

inflation question, with 70.6 percent answering correctly. By contrast, only 47.6 percent of the

women respondents knew that holding a single company stock implies a riskier investment than

a stock mutual fund.

Health and Retirement Study (N=785)
                                                                   Responses
                                   Correct             Incorrect                DK                   Refuse

Interest Rate                       61.9                  24.7                  11.6                  1.8

Inflation                           70.6                  14.5                  12.8                  2.1

Risk Diversification                47.6                  12.0                  39.6                  0.8

Note: This table reports the percentage of correct, incorrect, “do not know” and refusal responses



    Note also that only less than half of all respondents could answer correctly both the interest

rate and inflation questions. This is a remarkably low ratio, taking into account the complex

financial calculations that households on the verge of retirement have almost surely engaged in

over their lifetimes. Also disturbing is the fact that only 29 percent of respondents could answer

all three questions correctly.
                                                                                                    5



       It is also useful to further distinguish between those offering correct answers and those

giving an incorrect answer or responding “don’t know” (abbreviated DK). The proportion of

incorrect or DK responses varies according to the question. For example, for the interest rate

item, only 11.6 percent did not know, but over one-fifth (24.7 percent) gave an incorrect answer.

On the inflation question, 12.8 percent did not know, while 14.5 percent gave a wrong answer.

The question about risk diversification elicited the most “DKs”: 39.6 percent of the sample did

not know, while a smaller fraction (12 percent) gave a wrong answer. “DK” responses are

highly correlated within individual respondents: that is, women are consistently financial

illiterate or literate. For instance, there is a 70 percent correlation between those who reply “DK”

to both the interest and the inflation questions. Erroneous answers are more scattered, with

mistakes having a correlation of only 10 percent (the highest correlation among incorrect

responses). These results confirm other findings about widespread financial illiteracy among

older adults (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007b).

       Turning to the question about retirement planning, fewer than one-third of all women

respondents (30.9 percent) indicated that they had ever attempted to undertake a retirement

saving calculation. This group of respondents we call Simple Planners. The fact that we find

such a small number of planners confirms results in other papers that use a different measure of

planning (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007a). It is also consistent with findings in Alan L. Gustman

and Thomas L. Steinmeier (2004) that people know little about their Social Security and pension

benefits, two of the most important components of retirement wealth.

       A key advantage of our HRS module compared to previous surveys is that we are further

able to distinguish among types of planners. For the women we examine, only 58.5 percent of

those who tried to figure out how much they need to save for retirement did actually develop a
                                                                                                         6



plan, while another handful “more or less” developed a plan (7.3 percent). Both of these we refer

to as Serious Planners. The high failure rate in terms of developing a plan underscores the

difficulty of developing retirement projections. Furthermore, of the subset of Serious Planners,

fewer than one-third (31.8 percent) were always able to stick to the plan. Close to half of the

Serious Planners said they were “mostly” able to stick to their plans (53.9 percent). The

respondents who are “always” or “mostly” able to stick to a plan are called Committed Planners.

Thus, in the sample as a whole, fewer than one-third (30.9 percent) of the older women are

Simple Planners and one-fifth (20.3 percent) are Serious Planners, leaving only 17.4 percent as

Committed Planners. Of course, households may face unexpected shocks that make them deviate

from plans, but the fact remains that few respondents have tried and succeeded at planning. In

other words, planning for retirement is difficult, few do it, and fewer still think they get it right.

III. Does Financial Literacy Affect Retirement Planning?

        One explanation for why women fail to plan for retirement, or do so unsuccessfully, may

be that they are financially illiterate. Table 2 report results of a multivariate regression analysis

that sheds some light on the importance of financial literacy and its relationship to planning. The

three dependent variables reflect whether the respondent is a planner, whether she said she

developed a plan, and whether she was able to stick to her plan. The dependent variable in

Column I, in each case, takes on a value of 1 if the respondent was correct regarding the literacy

questions (else= 0); Column II adds an indicator equal to 1 if the respondent indicated she did

not know the answer to the question (else= 0); and Column III has the same dependent variable

but adds a set of demographic controls (age, race, educational attainment, marital status, being

born in the US, and being a Baby Boomer). The results depicted are marginal effects from Probit

analysis.

        Financial literacy is strongly and positively associated with planning, and the results are

statistically significant at conventional levels. That is, those who give a correct answer to the

financial literacy questions are more likely to be planners (Column I). In particular, those who

understand risk diversification are much more likely to plan. In addition, knowledge about risk

diversification strongly differentiates the sophisticated from the unsophisticated respondents. Not

only does it have a much larger estimated marginal effect than being able to correctly answer the

interest and the inflation questions, but it also remains statistically significant even after

accounting for the demographic characteristics of the respondent. We also find that those who

answer “don’t know” are different from the rest of the respondents. That is, the DK group is

much less likely to plan and succeed in a planning effort, even compared to those who give an

incorrect response (Column II). Most crucial is a lack of knowledge about the working of interest

rates, which is perhaps understandable since basic numeracy is crucial for doing calculations

about retirement savings.

        Column III indicates that some financial literacy indicators remain statistically significant

after controlling for demographic characteristics. For example, financial literacy still affects

planning above and beyond the effect of education. This is a particularly important result for

women in this sample, many of whom are unlikely to have higher education and are relatively

likely to be unmarried (widow, divorced or separated). In other words, there is reason to believe

that these financial literacy variables may prove very useful in explaining observed differences in

retirement savings among households.

    One may argue that unobservable variables or a third factor may affect both planning and

literacy or that the desire to plan may affect financial literacy, i.e., the direction of causality does

not necessarily go from literacy to planning. In other work (Lusardi and Mitchell 2007c), we use
                                                                                                     9



a much larger set of controls in the empirical specification and show that our results are robust.

Moreover, we address reverse causality and find strong evidence that literacy causes planning,

not the reverse.

IV. Concluding Remarks

       Policymakers seek to learn whether households are effectively protected for many years

in retirement, which we have argued is intimately related to whether they know how to plan for

retirement and whether they can execute these plans effectively. Indeed, we posit that this topic

is of particular interest for women who tend to live longer than men and have shorter work

experiences and lower earnings. Our research shows that older women in the US display very

low levels of financial literacy. Moreover, the large majority of women have not done any

retirement planning calculations. Further, financial knowledge and planning are closely related:

women who display higher financial literacy are more likely to plan and be successful planners.

       Our findings raise concerns about the ability of women to make sound saving and

investment decisions over a long retirement period. In an environment where individuals rather

than employers and governments are charged with handing retirement finances, it is essential that

consumers become more financially literate in order to be more successful at retirement.

       Several questions are left unexplained, such as why women are so financially illiterate

and what might be the best ways to address financial literacy among this segment of the

population. We plan to address these questions in future research.
