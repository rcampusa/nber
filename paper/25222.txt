                                           ABSTRACT

The Chinese economy has undergone three major phases: the 1978-1997 period marked as the
SOE-led economy, the 1998-2015 phase as the investment-driven economy, and the new normal
economy since 2016. All three economies have been shaped by the government's financial
policies, defined as a set of credit policy, monetary policy, and regulatory policy. We analyze the
macroeconomic effects of these financial policies throughout the three phases and provide the
stylized facts to substantiate our analysis. The stylized facts differ qualitatively across different
phases or economies. We argue that the impacts of China’s financial policies work through
transmission channels different from those in developed economies and that a regime switch from
one economy to another was driven mainly by regime changes in financial policies.

                                      I.      Introduction

Since the beginning of China’s economic reforms in 1978, the Chinese economy has undergone
three major phases. The first phase (1978-1997) marks an economy led by growth and reforms
of state owned enterprises (SOEs). The economy in the second phase (1998-2015) was driven by
investment in large and capital-intensive enterprises, which form what we call “the heavy sector.”
The heavy sector includes both SOEs and private owned enterprises (POEs). In recent years (2016-
present), we have witnessed a transition to what the Chinese government calls “a new normal
economy.” All three phases have been shaped by particular government policies. In this chapter,
we focus on macroeconomic effects of financial policies throughout these phases and provide
stylized facts to substantiate our analysis.1

We define financial policies in China as a set of credit policy, monetary policy, and regulatory
policy. Monetary policy in China has always aimed to control the money supply and aggregate
credit, even until today. Credit policy in China plays an essential role in directing banks’ credits
to different sectors or firms. Such a policy consists of a number of administrative tools such as
loan quotas and window guidance to limiting credits to specific sectors or industries. In the SOE-
led economy, credit policy is crucial for achieving balanced growth between heavy and light
sectors and between investment and consumption. For the investment-driven economy,
monetary policy, coupled with credit policy, played a crucial role in promoting overall economic
growth through investment in the heavy sector. Monetary policy was particularly potent in
combating the 2008 financial crisis in the short run but with the cost of a high debt burden in the
long run (measured by the debt-GDP ratio). Most of the stimulus was channeled to real estate
and infrastructure, which formed a large portion of the heavy sector.

Since the massive monetary stimulus in 2009, the effectiveness of monetary policy has been
eclipsed by the rise of shadow banking due to lax regulatory policy. In recent years since 2016,
there have been improvements in coordination between monetary and regulatory policies within
the framework of Macro Prudential Assessment (MPA). In particular, the Chinese government
has placed a number of unifying rules on asset management across different financial sectors
(i.e., across formal banking and shadow banking).

The impacts of China’s financial policies work through transmission channels different from those
in developed economies. Bank credits have always played a special role in promoting China's
economic growth. And the government has always given preferential credits to certain firms or
industries, although the preference has shifted through the three different phases.

In the SOE-led economy, bank credits were directed to SOEs in both heavy and light sectors. As
a result, SOEs, especially those in the light sector (e.g. the textile industry), suffered from

problems with excess capacity and overleverage. Most of these SOEs were small and medium-
sized. In the late 1990s, reforms were focused on SOEs by reducing overcapacity of small and
medium-sized SOEs. This movement is called in Chinese “Grasp the large and let go of the small.”
Reforms in the banking sector also focused on nonperforming loans to SOEs with overcapacity.

In the investment-driven economy, preferential credits were given to the heavy sector. During
this phase, most industries in the heavy sector were favored by the Chinese government as part
of the government’s industrialization policy to promote the heavy sector. The asymmetric credit
allocation in favor of the heavy sector was exacerbated during the stimulus period (2009-2010).
The main consequence is overstock in the real estate, overcapacity in industries supporting the
real estate, and overleverage in both real and financial sectors. Reforms in this economy,
different from those in the SOE-led economy, focused on destocking the real estate, deleveraging
overcapacity firms (e.g., steel, cement, and glass), and deleveraging the financial sector.

While these reforms continue in the new normal economy, China faces new challenges. In
particular, financial reforms have unintended consequences. For example, financial deleveraging
has reduced bank credits to nonbank financial institutions and thus shadow banking loans to
POEs. At the same time, the default rates of POEs and therefore systemic risks have increased.
SOEs in upstream industries, however, have continued to receive preferential credits and remain
unproductive and monopolistic. Implicit guarantees by local governments to such zombie firms
make difficult the deleveraging of corporate debts.

The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. In Section II, we provide the institutional
background of China’s financial policies. In Section III, we analyze the macroeconomic impacts
of financial policies on the SOE-led economy, the investment-driven economy, and the new
normal economy. Section IV concludes.


                  II.     Institutional background of financial policies

                                      Review of financial policies

As defined in the Introduction, China’s financial policies consist of credit policy, monetary policy,
and regulatory policy. We review the interactions of these policies in the context of their impacts
on the macroeconomy.

Credit policy. Prior to 1978, China had long pursued a credit policy in favor of the heavy sector,
which led to severely unbalanced developments between heavy and light sectors. In January
1980, the central government decided to develop the light sector to avoid a shortage of
consumption goods. The emphasis was given to production of consumer durables to generate
demands for the heavy sector. The light sector was granted “six priorities”, including the priority
of receiving bank loans. As a result, bank credits were reallocated to firms in the light sector, most
of which were SOEs prior to 1998.

     stimulus period. The first vertical line divides the SOE-led economy and the investment-driven

                    economy. Data source: Chen, Higgins, Waggoner, and Zha (2017).

From 1998 to 2017, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) used an explicit target of growth rates of
M2 supply as an effective way to control aggregate bank loans and promote an investment-driven
economy. In this phase, credit policy, through window guidance and loan quotas, was also
centralized to be in line with the growth of M2 supply. The PBC utilized window guidance to
control the total volume of bank credits and to redirect loans to the targeted industries (e.g., real
estate and infrastructure). Such loans were made regardless of prevailing interest rates. In line
with M2 growth, the PBC planned the aggregate credit supply for the coming year at the end of
each year and then negotiated with individual commercial banks to redirect credits to targeted
industries when necessary during the coming year.

Monetary policy. Before 1984, the PBC was the only bank in China. In 1984, the PBC became
the central bank and the central government established the banking system comprised of four


                                                    3
specialized banks to make loans to firms in different industries: Bank of China, China Industrial
and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China. All these
four banks were directly controlled by the government. The aggregate credit volume was chosen
to be the intermediate target of monetary policy. But this target was seldom met because there
was no marketized policy instrument to help achieve the target. Instead the mandatory
administrative plan for credit quotas was implemented and local governments played an integral
part in allocating these quotas to firms through local branches of the four state banks. The limited
coordination among local governments made it impossible to control the aggregate volume of
bank credits and the efficiency of their allocations. In 1998, targeting the aggregate credit volume
as monetary policy was eventually abolished.

The ineffectiveness of monetary policy though administrative means made the PBC gradually
switch to targeting M2 growth. Before 1993, the PBC directly controlled the bank credit supply
and its allocations often at local levels. In 1993, for the first time, it announced to the public the
index of monetary supply; in 1996, it began a transition to using the money supply as a target for
monetary policy at the national level. In 1998 the PBC announced that M2 supply was the only
policy target.

New marketized instruments were subsequently established to help achieve the targeted M2
growth. In May 1998, open market operations were initiated to serve as the main tool for the
PBC to manage the money supply on a regular basis. In addition, the PBC used reserve
requirements to adjust the banks’ liquidity.2 From then to the end of 2017, China adhered to this
quantity-based monetary policy framework, especially during the entire period of the
investment-driven economy.

Monetary policy during the period of the new normal economy has undergone a gradual
transition from the quantity based framework to the interest-rate based framework. The
discussion of this transition was initiated in the Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for “Economic and
Social Development” held in 2016. In addition to the discussion of monetary policy, the plan
outlined a new normal economy that features financial reforms and a promotion of consumption
growth to be supported by monetary policy. In 2018Q1, for the first time since 1998, the M2
growth target was no longer among the government’s key economic objects.

Figure 1 shows the time series of year-over-year growth rates of M2 supply and aggregate bank
credit. The rectangular bar (with pink edge) marks the 2009 monetary stimulus period (2009Q1-
Q3) for Figure 1 as well as other graphs in the rest of this chapter.3 There are two vertical lines.
The first line marks the beginning of 1998 and the second line the beginning of 2016. These
vertical lines are plotted in other graphs of this chapter. Clearly, the M2 supply and bank loans
do not co-move in the SEO-led economy (the graph to the left of the first vertical line in Figure

  Chen, Higgins, Waggoner and Zha (2017) identify monetary stimulus as monetary policy
switching to a more aggressive regime to combat the fall of GDP growth below its official target.

1). In 1989-1991, the government used “macroeconomic regulations” to reduce the growth rates
of both bank credits and M2 supply in order to cool down the overheated economy generated
during 1987-1988.4 As a result, GDP growth in 1989-1991 was at the lowest point in the SOE-led
economy (see Section III for further discussions).5 To prevent GDP growth from declining further,
the central government reversed its macroeconomic policy by expanding bank credits through a
rapid increase of M2 growth in 1992 as well as during the first half of 1993. This credit expansion
filled the gap between insufficient household deposits and firms’ strong demands for credits
when the deposit rate was administratively fixed at a low level (Chapter 8, Lin 2013). Because the
government did not set a target on the growth of monetary aggregates, M2 growth overshot in
1992-1995 during the process of supporting credit expansions across regions in the country.
Consequently, the overshooting of M2 supply led to an unprecedented rise of inflation.

The series of these zigzag policies was one of the main reasons for the government to change its
monetary policy in the late 1990s by targeting the M2 supply explicitly with development of
various marketized tools to make the target credible. As a direct result of targeting M2 growth
mandated by the central government, the M2 supply and bank loans co-move in the investment-
driven phase (see the graph between the two vertical lines in Figure 1), implying that monetary
policy was effective in controlling aggregate bank loans. During this phase, two sets of tools were
developed to meet the M2 growth target and control the growth of bank loans. The first set,
including the benchmark reserve requirement ratio and open market operations, was used to
meet the M2 growth target. The second set, including differential reserve requirements for
different commercial banks, credit quotas (implicit or explicit), and window guidance, was used
to keep growth of bank loans in line with growth of M2 supply.

But this effectiveness was eclipsed by the rise of shadow banking activities in the aftermath of
the 2008 financial crisis (Chen, Ren, and Zha, forthcoming). In the third phase (the new normal
economy), the small divergence between M2 growth and bank-loan growth (the graph to the
right of the second vertical line in Figure 1) is driven mostly by reduction of bank credits to non-
banking financial companies (NFCs), which, in turn, reduced their bank deposits through the
financial deleveraging. Bank loans to the real economy, however, remained stable during this
period.

Regulatory policy. Regulatory policy also went through the three phases. In the first phase in
which the state banks were fully owned and managed by the government, administrative tools
were used to control bank credit advancements while the system for regulation and supervision
on NFCs was immature and loose.

  In November 1989, the Fifth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the
Communist Party passed the “Decision of the Central Committee of Communist Party of China to
Further Govern, Reorganize, and Deepen Reforms.” This decision was a starting point of the next
three-year macroeconomic regulation.

  There is no official data for the M2 supply prior to 1992 but the time series of aggregate bank
credit can be found in Chen and Zha (2018).



                                                 5
In the second phase, the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) regulation became one of the most
important components of regulatory policy; it requires a commercial bank to keep the ratio of its
loans to its deposits under 75%. The LDR regulation was established in 1994, but it was not
credibly enforced until the late 2000s. The second most important component of regulatory
policy is the restriction of advancement of bank credits to certain risky industries, which is often
called in Chinese the “safe loan regulation.” In 2006, the State Council, concerned with China's
real estate and many overcapacity industries, issued a notice to accelerate the restructuring
process of these risky industries. In 2010, the PBC and Chinese Banking Regulatory Commission
(CBRC) jointly issued another notice to reinforce the 2006 notice issued by the State Council,
making it operational to prohibit commercial banks from originating new bank loans to these
industries. Although these regulatory actions prevented newly originated traditional bank loans
from flowing to the risky industries, lax regulatory policy on shadow banking activities, combined
with monetary policy tightening after the massive 2009 monetary stimulus, created the shadow
banking boom and dampened the effectiveness of monetary policy in affecting the aggregate
bank credit as a sum of traditional and shadow banking credits.

To achieve financial stability, deleveraging has become a priority for the financial policies in the
third phase. In December 2016, deleveraging corporate debts was a major discussion for the
Central Economic Work Conference. In March 2017, the Report on the Work of the Government
(RWG) made it a priority to deleverage overcapacity firms that supported the real estate. In July
2017, the National Financial Work Conference reiterated this priority. In December 2017, the
RWG no longer specified the M2 growth target for 2018, marking a gradual transition from
quantity based monetary policy to interest-rate based monetary policy. In April 2018, the first
meeting of the Central Financial Commission emphasized the importance of deleveraging zombie
firms associated with local government debts.

Since 2016, the central government has adopted the MPA System to ensure the financial stability
and a cooperation between monetary and regulatory policies. Put in place were various
regulations on specific banking assets and liabilities (e.g. interbank CDs) and on shadow banking
products (e.g. entrusted loans and wealth management products). More important are a number
of unifying rules enacted by the government on asset management across different financial
sectors (i.e., across formal banking and shadow banking).6

                 The nexus between GDP growth and financial policies

The SOE-led economy. In 1978, economic reforms with the so-called “opening-up policy” were
initiated by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party.
In 1984, decentralization took place, giving the local governments a stronger managerial power.


6
 In April 2018, PBC and CBRC issued the joint notice “Guiding Opinions on Regulating Asset
Management Business of Financial Institutions” to forbid the practice of guaranteed redemption
of asset management plans.

                                                 6
In 1987, economic development was the central theme as well as the bottom line of the
Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party. In 1992, Deng Xiaoping advanced further
economic reforms throughout the country. In 1994, the government implemented tax reforms
with the tax sharing system.

The year 1984 was a pivotal point for GDP growth. Since then, promoting local GDP growth has
become the major task of local government officials as their performance has always been based
on local economic grow. 7 In 1984, the external financing of SOEs switched from direct fiscal
appropriations to indirect bank loans. Credit policy aimed at promoting growth of SOEs in each
province, city, and district. By relaxing credit quotas on state banks, the government used
administrative tools to control credit advancements to SOEs and helped close, restructure, or
merge small and medium-sized SOEs that experienced large profit losses. Since SOEs were
prevalent in every industry (in both heavy and light sectors), such credit policy influenced
investment and consumption simultaneously.

The central government's plan for controlling the aggregate credit volume was compromised by
local governments’ actions. Local governments often directed local branches of state banks to
advance credits to SOEs beyond their quotas (the soft budget constraints). Pressures exerted by
local governments on local branches of state banks to increase credits to local SOEs resulted in
pressures from local branches on their headquarters to loosen credit quotas, which in turn forced
the PBC to eventually raise the aggregate credit volume and money supply (this is called the
“reverse loan quota transmission” or 倒逼机制 (Dao Bi Ji Zhi) in Chinese).

Apart from banking lending, Brandt and Zhu (2007) show that during this phase, NFCs, including
the rural credit cooperatives, urban credit cooperatives, and trust and investment corporations,
emerged to be important sources of financing. Unlike state banks, NFCs were usually controlled
or owned by local cooperatives and their lending largely fell outside of the government’s credit
plan. Lending from NFCs contributed 20-25% to the total source of funds.

The investment-driven economy. In this phase, the central government laid out multiple
policy objectives, including (real) GDP growth, inflation, employment, foreign exchange rate,
social stability, and environment. Out of these objectives, only two economic targets are of
primary importance: GDP growth and consumer price index (CPI) inflation. Since 1988, the GDP
growth target has been specified in the State Council's Report on the Work of Government (RWG).
This is the overriding objective among all policy objectives. From 1999 to 2017, the M2 growth
target was also specified in the RWG, along with the GDP growth target. The PBC is not an
independent institution in making monetary policy. The State Council and other government
units exerted considerable and often dominant influences on the official target of M2 growth.

Chen, Ren and Zha (Forthcoming) develop and estimate a quantity-based monetary policy rule


7
 Zhou (2007) calls such an incentive system for local governments the “promotion tournament.”
He argues that the promotion tournament is the key source of China’s miraculous growth.

                                               7
based on China’s institutional facts. Under this rule, monetary policy endogenously switches
between two regimes, according to whether actual GDP growth is above or below the targeted
GDP growth. In the normal situation where GDP growth is above the target, M2 growth responds
positively to the gap between actual and targeted GDP growth rates. By contrast, in a shortfall
state where the actual GDP growth is below the targeted GDP growth, monetary policy takes an
unusually aggressive response to stem the shortfall to meet the GDP growth target.

For the most part, quantity-based monetary policy in the investment-driven economy followed
its systematic response to output and inflation targets (the graph between the two vertical lines
in Figure 2). We compute counterfactual paths of M2 growth and its endogenous component in
the period of the SOE-led economy. These counterfactual paths, shown in the graph to the left
of the first vertical line in Figure 2, reveal that in contrast to the investment-driven economy,
monetary policy in the SOE-led economy would not have followed its systematic rule had it been
implemented in this period. These results confirm that without appropriate marketized tools as
in the SOE-led economy it would be difficult to control either M2 or the aggregate credit volume.

Unlike in the SOE-led economy in which the government provided credits to SOEs across both
heavy and light sectors, most of preferential credits in this phase were channeled to the heavy
sector in order to stimulate investment as a way to meet the overriding GDP growth target. The
heavy sector includes both SOEs and large POEs that are capital intensive. The government's
objective of targeting GDP growth is asymmetric: the GDP growth target has been a lower bound
for growth. Monetary policy was carried out to support GDP growth and at the same time control
CPI inflation through effective ways of influencing bank loans (see various monetary policy
reports (MPRs). This is one of the main features in the investment-driven economy.

The new normal economy. In recent years, Chinese central government strived to achieve a
balance between GDP growth and the financial stability. The Central Economic Work Conference
held in December 2014 declared for the first time that the Chinese economy entered the “new
normal stage.” The 2015 RWG listed the dual objective: maintaining a healthy rate of growth
while moving towards a sustainable level of development. The Central Economic Work
Conference held in December 2015 called for ``structural reforms on the supply side,” which
include deleveraging debts, reducing overcapacity, and destocking the real estate.

This effort shows up as negative monetary policy shocks since 2014 (Figure 2). According to the
monetary policy rule since 1998, GDP growth lower than the target in this episode would demand
higher M2 growth (shown as the endogenous component in Figure 2). Considerations of
accumulated debts due to the monetary stimulus and the financial stability in general, however,
induced the government to lower M2 growth at the sacrifice of GDP growth. These
considerations and their effects, which are abstracted from our monetary policy rule, are
captured as negative monetary policy shocks (i.e., the difference between the solid and the
dashed-x lines to the right of the second vertical line in Figure 2).

We now analyze the effects of financial policies on the macroeconomy. As Figure 3 shows, GDP
growth experienced expansion and slowdown in both SOE-led economy and investment-driven
economies. And financial policies affected both trends and cycles of China’s macroeconomy. In
this section, we first document key patterns of trend and cycle for each economy and then
analyze the role of financial policies in driving the trends and cycles.

          Effects of financial policies on the SOE-led economy (1978-1997)

In the SOE-led economy, SOEs permeated through the whole economy, including all the
industries and across the light and heavy sectors. Monetary policy was the main financial policy
in allocating credit quotas to the banking system that channeled most of its loans to SOEs. Credit
policy as another financial policy played an indispensable role for firms in both heavy and light
sectors to receive bank credits. Bank loans to various SOEs include long-term as well as short-
term loans.

The role of credit policy in the SOE-led economy is summarized by Figure 4. State banks provided
credits to SOEs in both heavy and light sectors. This is the most important aspect of credit policy
in this economy. Under the central government’s pro-growth policy and local government’s GDP
growth tournament, SOEs in both sectors obtained implicit government guarantees of their bank
credits. With these financial guarantees, state banks were willing to advance credits to SOEs in
both sectors and across all industries.




                                                                        10
                     Figure 4. Role of credit policy in the SOE-led economy.

Credit policy was essential to promoting both investment and consumption for the 1978-1997
phase. Since the data on consumption are fragmentary, we focus on an analysis of investment
with the understanding that consumption and investment comoved in this phase. Figure 5 shows
that FAI and bank loans to FAI moved hand in hand. Throughout the 1978-1997 period, the share
of SOEs in FAI remained high (Figure 6) and the share of SOEs in credit allocations to investment
also remained at a very high level (Figure 7). According to Brandt and Zhu (2007), in most years
during this phase, 80-85% of total credits were extended to SOEs through state banks in the form
of either working capital or fixed investment loans. This observation reflected the central
government’s commitment to workers and job growth in SOEs while fiscal resources in local
governments declined. The shares of SOEs in FAI and its loan volume were much higher in the
period prior to 1998 than in the post-1997 period. High shares imply that SOEs, which enjoyed
preferential bank credits, are a driving force of the aggregate investment fluctuation.

Despite the lack of sectoral loan data in this phase, credit allocations to the heavy and light
sectors can be inferred from the ratio of medium- and long-term (MLT) loans to total loans
outstanding. The light sector demands more working capital loans (short-term) to pay the wage
bills than the heavy sector, while the heavy sector demands more MLT loans for capital
investment than the light sector. The ratio of MTL loans to total loans is available from 1994Q1.
Figure 8 shows that there was no secular trend for this ratio prior to 1998, in contrast to the trend
of a steady increase since 1998.8

Credit policy in the SOE-led economy had two notable effects on the Chinese economy. First, the
fluctuation of (real) GDP was driven by the fluctuations of both investment and consumption (the
graphs to the left of the first vertical line in Figure 9). Second, the correlation between investment
and consumption growth rates during 1978-1997 is as high as 0.80 and this correlation is
statistically significant. Table 1 reports this correlation along with its p-value based on the HP-
filtered log annual series. In contrast to the investment-driven economy, as we discuss later, the
investment-to-output ratio was stationary during this episode but at the same time very volatile
(Figure 10).

 Using the annual data from the cash flow table that dates back to 1992, Chen and Zha (2018)
find that the ratio of MLT loans to total domestic bank loans remained stable between 0.2 and
0.31 during the phase of the SOE-led economy.

                                                                      13

Other important facts of the SOE-led economy are the stationary ratio of gross output in the
heavy sector to that in the light sector (Figure 11) and the stationary ratio of gross fixed assets in
the heavy sector to those in the light sector (Figure 12). These observations were an outcome of
credit policy in the SOE-led economy that was engineered to support SOEs across all sectors, not
just the heavy sector. For instance, a large quantity of bank credits were channeled to the
industries producing consumer durables. Many bank credits were allocated to SOEs producing
watches, bicycles, and sewing machines in 1978-1982, color televisions and refrigerators in 1983-
1988, and automobiles in 1992-1997. Thus, we observe one prominent feature of the SOE-led
economy: investment and consumption co-move. As a result, the labor share of income was also
stable prior to 1998 (Figure 13).

The observation that credit policy fueled the demand for both investment and consumption in
the 1978-1997 phase is also supported by the pattern of fluctuations for the two measures of
inflation rate, as shown by Figure 14 and by their summary statistics reported in Table 2.
According to Table 2, the PPI volatility was similar in magnitude to the CPI volatility in 1978-1997.

There was, however, one important difference between the heavy and light sectors in the SOE-
led economy. SOEs in the light sector were typically small and medium-sized (e.g., firms in the
textile industry). As small SOEs were less productive than large SOEs, reforms on SOEs during the
period of the SOE-led economy emphasized the task of ``grasping the large and let go of the small”
to reduce excess capacity problems in small and medium-sized SOEs. These reforms led to a birth
of many productive POEs in the light sector during the phase governed by the investment-driven
economy.

The trends and cycles in the SOE-led economy are summarized as follows.

v Trends:
  Ø (T1) Stationary investment-output ratio.
  Ø (T2) Stationary labor share of income.
  Ø (T3) High shares of SOEs in FAI and in bank loans to investment.
  Ø (T4) Stable ratio of gross output (measured by the ratio of sales revenues) in the heavy
     sector to that in the light sector and stationary ratio of the capital stock (measured by
     gross fixed assets) in the heavy sector to that in the light sector.

v Cycles:
  Ø (C1) Aggregate investment and household consumption tended to co-move.
  Ø (C2) Booms and busts of investment and its credits were driven mainly by SOEs.
     (C3) The volatility of produce price index (PPI) inflation had a magnitude similar to the
     volatility of CPI inflation.

These trend and cycle patterns observed in the data for the SOE-led economy can be explained
by the theoretical framework of Chen and Zha (2018). The economy contains two sectors, heavy
and light, differentiated by the capital intensity. The crucial model ingredient is that the
government ‘s implicit guarantees to SOEs, represented by its net worth, are symmetric across
both light and heavy sectors. SOEs in the heavy sector do not face the borrowing constraint
because the banks are not commercialized and as part of the government are willing to make
intertemporal (long-term) investment loans without conditions. Loans to SOEs in the light sector
are of short term to fund working capital for paying labor wages and other factor inputs. Such
loans are harder to be fully pledged than investment loans to the heavy sector. Thus, the light
sector faces the binding collateral constraint governed by a fraction of their assets. As the
government net worth increases, the collateral constraint of the light sector is relaxed, which
increases its factor demand. This, in turn, increases the demand for capital investment of the
heavy sector due to the imperfect substitutability between these two sectors. Accordingly, the
ratio of gross output in the heavy sector to that in the light sector was stationary.

    Effects of financial policies on the investment-driven economy (1998-2015)

The period 1998-2015 marks an economy qualitatively different from the SOE-led economy. The
most conspicuous difference was a change from the government’s direct credit control policy to


                                                        18
explicitly targeting growth of M2 supply as an effective way to control aggregate bank loans. Such
monetary policy was designed to provide adequate and accurate liquidity to the banking system
to support investment in the heavy sector, which includes both large SOEs and large POEs.
Consequently, the share of SOEs in FAI declined steadily in 1998-2015 until it hovered below 20%
(Figure 6). Since monetary policy was used to support investment in the heavy sector, the share
of SOEs in total bank loans to investment declined steadily after 1998 (Figure 7).

The most striking facet of the investment-driven economy is that GDP growth was driven mostly
by investment (so-called capital deepening). To illustrate this feature, we calculate growth
decompositions from the following production function:
                                       Y" = TFP" K )" N"+,) ,
where Y represents output, TFP total factor productivity, K capital, N labor (employed workers),
 and a the share of capital income in total income. The decomposition of growth per worker is
                                     1                        6
                                 ∆log 2 = ∆logTFP" + α ∆log 2 ,
                                      32                        32
where the second term on the right-hand side of the equation represents the contribution from
capital intensity (capital per worker) or investment.9

Tables 3 and 4 report the growth accounting according to the above decomposition formula. The
computation uses the value of the capital share set at 0.5 as in the literature. For the approach
of Bai, Hsieh, and Qian (2006), the data of gross fixed capital formation for ``structures and
buildings'' and ``machinery and equipment'' goes back only to 1981. The investment price data
for these two categories goes back only to 1990. The values reported under the column with the
heading 1978-1997 in Table 4, marked by the symbol *, are for the period 1990-1997. For 2017,
the approach of Bai, Hsieh, and Qian (2006) requires gross investment price inflation in 2018 to
be available, which we do not have at the time of writing a draft of this chapter.

Both tables show that TFP contributed most to the growth of GDP per worker in the SOE-led
economy, but investment played a dominant role in driving GDP growth in the investment-driven
economy. This finding is consistent with an independent study by Lagakos (2018). As a result, we
see that the ratio of investment to GDP has increased steadily since 1998 (Figure 15).

The investment-driven economy experienced three distinct episodes: the golden decade (1998-
2008), the stimulus period (2009), and the post-stimulus period (2010-2015). Along with
preferential credit policy toward the heavy sector, both monetary and regulatory policies during
these three episodes have distinctive features. We discuss the role of financial policies in each of
these three episodes separately.

 The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics labels K/N “capital intensity”. It is often defined as “the ratio
of capital services to hours worked in the production process” (see chart 2 on page 2 and page
10 of https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/prod3.pdf). We use employment instead of hours
because of the lack of the Chinese data on hours.

The golden decade. The government’s early planning for the investment-driven economy was
crucial for the success in the whole period. In 1995, China enacted the People's Bank of China law
and other banking laws with decentralization of the banking system, which ironically led to the
concentration of large loans to large firms. 10 In March 1996, the Eighth National People's
Congress of China laid out a first five-year strategic plan to develop infrastructure, real estate,
basic industries (metal products, automobile, and high-tech machinery), and other heavy-sector
industries (petroleum and telecommunication). By 1998 the government completed the process
of privatizing SOEs (grasp the large, let go of the small) and began a privatization of the housing
market. Prior to 2003, most houses were transacted below their market values (affordable
housing). In 2003, affordable housing was largely abolished. Instead, the government
encouraged the transactions of houses at the market value. These houses are called “commodity
houses.” In 2000, real estate and auto industries were chosen to be the pillar industries by the
government for its strategic plan. In 2001, China joined the World Trade Organization (WTO),
which marked an important advancement in China’s openness to the world economy and its
trade liberalization.

In 2002, the four state banks became commercialized and thereafter there emerged many new
commercial banks, including Bank of Communications---the fifth largest state bank. The banking
system was the most important source of external financing until the late 2000s when a rise of
shadow banking eclipsed the importance of the traditional banking role. Until the rise of shadow
banking, monetary policy of explicitly targeting M2 growth had been effective on total bank credit
as well as total social financing.

One crucial banking regulation that interacted with the monetary policy to affect the total bank
credit is a regulation on the ceiling of the loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR). In a theoretical framework,
Chen, Ren, and Zha (forthcoming) show that when PBC tightens monetary policy via open market
operations, the probability of deposit withdrawals by primary dealers increases, which makes the
LDR ratio more likely to be binding under the LDR regulation. Consequently, commercial banks,
especially non-state banks, have to incur extra costs to recoup the deposit shortfalls (known as
“last minute rush costs” or 冲时点 (Cong Shi Dian) in Chinese). These expected regulatory costs
reduce the effective return of bank lending and induce banks to engage in shadow banking by
reducing formal banking.

As Figure 16 shows, local governments’ implicit guarantees on credits to the real estate and its
supporting heavy industries played a crucial role in credit allocations during the golden decade.
When assessing loan applications, banks favored large loans to large firms and were biased
against small loans to small firms. This practice was not only due to the asymmetric information
problem facing small firms when banks assessed loan applications, but also because large firms
in the heavy sector gained implicit guarantees from local governments (Jiang, Luo and Huang,
2006). In short, banks favored lending to large firms or industries in the heavy sector targeted by

this period.

the state (e.g. real estate and infrastructure). Compared to small firms, large firms produced
more sales, provided more tax revenues, and helped boost GDP of the local economy---the most
important criterion for the political benefits of local government officials.

As financial policies switched from a reliance on credit policy supporting both light and heavy
sectors in the SOE-led economy to an emphasis on quantity-based monetary policy in the
investment-driven economy, this new economic regime also changed its characteristics. Because
the government’s monetary/credit policy focused on investment in the heavy sector during 1998-
2015, the relationship between investment and consumption broke down. That is, the correlation
between growth rates of investment and consumption changed from 0.80 in the SOE-led
economy to being statistically insignificant in the investment-driven economy (Table 1 and Figure
9). And the correlation between investment and labor income was also close to zero (0.026 with
the p-value 0.919). The promotion of investment at the sacrifice of consumption caused PPI
inflation to be more volatile than CPI inflation (Table 2 and Figure 14) and the labor share of
income to decline (Figure 13).11


11
  The decline of China’s labor income share since the late 1990s is a robust fact, as confirmed by
Bai and Qian (2009) and Qian and Zhu (2012), who have made data adjustments to take into
account changes in the statistical coverage of labor compensations over time.

                                                                       22
             Figure 16. Monetary/credit policy in the investment-driven economy.

Investment during the golden decade was fueled by long-term bank credits at the sacrifice of
short-term bank credits to working capital in the light sector (Figure 8). In other words, the
increase in bank credits under expansionary monetary policy was channeled disproportionally
into long-term bank credits to finance investment. Accordingly, the correlation between short-
term and long-term bank loans in the investment-driven economy is negative (Table 5).

Contrary to the common belief, the external sector played a limited role in investment growth
during the golden decade. After China jointed the WTO, most exports were produced in the light
sector (e.g., the textile, toys, and shoes), as documented in Huang, Ju, and Yue (2015). In a
number of newly industrialized economies in Asia (e.g., South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan), the
export-led economy concentrated on capital-intensive goods. Rapid investment in China's
capital-intensive sector (i.e., the heavy sector) was not led by its exports.12

SOEs also played a limited role during the golden decade. As discussed earlier, the SOE share in
investment as well as in investment loans declined steadily. Given the same preferential credit
policy toward SOEs, these facts imply that the investment-to-output ratio would have declined.


12
   According to Huang, Ju, and Yue (2015), between 1999 and 2007, labor intensive firms
increased their export shares and capital-intensive firms reduced their export share; at the same
time, the capital intensity of export firms was reduced.

                                               23
But instead the investment rate rose steadily. This is because the investment boom was not
driven by SOEs during this period, but by real estate and supporting heavy industries (e.g. steel
and cement). In particular, large POEs in the real estate industry and other heavy industries
received preferential bank credits to finance their investment.13 In 2002, for instance, 65% of all
firms were POEs in number and the POE share of gross industrial output in total gross industrial
output was 55%. In 2004Q1, the FAI growth rate in urban areas was 42.8% (80.7% for POEs vs.
only 22.3% for SOEs).14

The preferential credit policy to firms in heavy sector leads to the fact that gross output in the
heavy sector increased much faster than gross output in the light sector. By contrast, growth of
gross output in both sectors was balanced in the SOE-led economy. This explains the increasing
share of heavy sector GDP in total GDP since 1998 (Figure 17). In particular, the share of value
added to the real estate industry in GDP increased steadily (except for the global financial crisis)
in the investment-driven economy (Figure 18). As documented in Chen, Ren, and Zha
(forthcoming), most firms in the real estate industry are not SOEs.

          Table 5: Correlation between newly issued short-term and MLT bank loans
            Sample                   Loan growth (yoy)            New loan as % of GDP

The shift of a focus to invest in the heavy sector during the golden decade from a focus to
promote SOEs across all sectors in the SOE-led economy resulted in more volatile PPI inflation
than CPI inflation (Table 2). In addition, growth in the real land (house) price was more volatile
than inflation by an order of magnitude and on average much faster than (real) GDP growth
(Figure 19).

The trends and cycles in the investment-driven economy, especially during the golden decade,
are summarized as follows.

v Trends:
  Ø (T1) A steady increase (decrease) of the ratio of aggregate investment (consumption) to
     GDP.
  Ø (T2) A declining share of income.
  Ø (T3) A steady increase in the ratio of MLT bank loans to short-term bank loans.
  Ø (T4) A steady increase in the ratio of gross output (and gross fixed assets) in the heavy
     sector to that in the light sector.

v Cycles:
  Ø (C1) No co-movement between aggregate investment and consumption.
  Ø (C2) No co-movement between aggregate investment and labor income.
  Ø (C3) A negative co-movement between MLT bank loans and short-term bank loans.

Chang, Chen, Waggoner and Zha (2016) develop a theoretical framework to explain these key
facts of the investment-driven economy. The crucial difference between this model and the
model of Chen and Zha (2018) is that the government’s funding through monetary/credit policy
goes to the heavy sector as part of a shift of the strategic emphasis to financing investment in
the heavy sector. Such a preferential credit reallocation caused resources to be reallocated
toward the heavy sector as government net worth increased, which led to the upward trend of
gross output in the heavy sector relative to that in the light sector, especially the real estate
industry. Since the heavy sector had a higher investment rate than the light sector, the ratio of
aggregate investment to aggregate output kept increasing during the golden decade. The
preferential credit reallocation also made bank loans to the light sector costly. These costs,
captured by the convex function of bank loans in the theoretical model, are one of the main
explanations for the observed negative or insignificant correlation between investment and
consumption.

Song, Storesletten, and Zilibotti (2011, SSZ) provide a complementary explanation for the rapid
growth during the golden decade. Their benchmark economy assumes one production sector in
which less productive SOEs enjoy preferential credits while productive POEs do not. Capital


                                                                 26
accumulation by POEs relies on their own savings. As a result, when POEs’ capital stock increases,
they demand more labor, which forces SOEs to downsize due to the competitive labor market.
The capital reallocation from SOEs to POEs leads to an increase in allocative efficiency and
therefore the aggregate TFP. As shown by Chen and Wen (2017), most of the increase in the
share of private employment in total employment occurred between 1998 and 2004 (from 15%
to 50%) and this share kept increasing by another 10% between 2004 and 2011. Therefore, the
SSZ model is crucial in understanding TFP growth during this period, which accounts for one third
of GDP growth (Tables 3 and 4). The rest of GDP growth is accounted for by investment. Zilibotti
(2017) regards all the years up to 2005 as an episode of “investment-led growth” and productivity
growth as a by-product of investment even in the absence of innovations or technical changes.

The 2009 monetary stimulus. During the phase of the investment-driven economy, the
global financial crisis erupted in 2008. China's GDP growth (at a year-over-year rate) plummeted
from 13.6% in 2007Q2 to 6.4% in 2009Q1. In November 2008, the State Council announced a
plan to inject the 4 trillion RMB liquidity into the economy over the two-year period from 2009Q1
to 2010Q4. The plan listed ten areas with real estate as the number one area for massive
investment. As it turned out, the monetary injection was far larger than 4 trillion within the first
three quarters of 2009 (Figure 1). The real estate industry benefited the most. The real estate
price bounced back immediately after the 2009 stimulus (Figure 19) and the value added to the
real estate not only bounced back but also kept increasing (Figure 18).

Overall, GDP growth jumped from 6.91% in 2008Q4 to 11.59% in 2009Q4 (Figure 3) and aggregate
investment grew by over 20% during this period (Figure 5). Growth in aggregate consumption
growth, however, barely changed during this period. Chen, Higgins, Waggonor, and Zha (2017)
show that the monetary stimulus, represented mainly by a switch of monetary policy rule from
the normal state to a more aggressive state, can explain 85% of the increase in GDP growth during
the stimulus period.

In the investment-driven economy, moreover, investment played even a larger role in propelling
economic growth during and after the monetary stimulus period. Tables 6 and 7 report the
growth accounting by breaking down the period of the investment-driven economy into three
sub-periods: 1998-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2015. Across these three sub-periods, the
contribution from investment increased from 61.3% to 75.8% and then to 83.0% (Table 6) and
from 60.5% to 73.9% and then to 81.3% (Table 7).

 investment


Investment was mainly financed by massive credit injections engineered by loosening monetary
policy (Figure 1). Most of the increase in bank loans under the government’s stimulus was
channeled into fixed-asset investment, especially in the real estate industry and its supporting
heavy industries. Such a monetary stimulus played a pivotal role in the recovery of GDP growth,
but the asymmetric credit allocation during the golden decade was exacerbated during the
stimulus period. The exacerbation can be seen in Figure 16, as the share of MLT loans in total
bank loans sprang up during the stimulus period. The ratio of total bank loans to GDP also sprang
up during the stimulus period and kept increasing even after the stimulus was over (Figure 21).
Chen, Higgins, Waggonor and Zha (2017) show that the 2009 monetary stimulus produced an
intertemporal tradeoff between short-run GDP growth and long-run indebtedness. In a similar
spirit, Zilibotti (2017) argues that China’s stimulus plan delayed innovations and created a
tradeoff between fast short-run growth and sustainable long-run growth.

Bai, Hsieh and Song (2016) argue that an important part of financial stimulation was through an
establishment of local government financing vehicles (LGFVs). Although local governments were
legally prohibited from borrowing or running budget deficits, they circumvented the budget laws
in 2009 and 2010 by creating off-balance-sheet companies, known as LGFVs, to finance
investment in infrastructure and other commercial projects. According to Obstfeld (2016), LGFV
borrowing as a percent of GDP increased from 16.3% in 2008 to 25.09% in 2010 (an increase of
8.79 percentage points), but this increase still paled in comparison to an increase of 31.58
percentage points in private sector borrowing as a percent of GDP during the same period.

In this period, SOEs also played a limited role in the soaring investment rate under the monetary
stimulus. Figure 8 shows that the SOE share of aggregate FAI increased moderately during the
stimulus period and resumed its declining trend when the stimulus was over. The reason is that
most firms in the real estate industry, which is the largest recipient of the bank credit during the
stimulus period, are POEs.

The post-stimulus episode (2010-2015). To combat the rising inflation after the 2009
massive stimulus, the government implemented tightening monetary/credit policy to slow down
investment in the heavy sector and place economic growth on a sustainable path. GDP growth
declined from 11.59% in 2009Q4 to less than 7% in 2015Q4. Yet, the contribution of investment



                                                28
to GDP growth continued to increase (Tables 5 and 6); Investment in the heavy sector and
upstream industries continued to play a major role (Bai, Liu, and Yao, 2018). Although the value
added to the heavy sector and upstream industries declined as the shares of GDP after the 2009
monetary stimulus, these shares still remained at an unsustainably high level and bank credits
continued to be channeled to not just upstream industries but the heavy sector in general.

While monetary policy tightened after the 2009 stimulus, regulatory policy on shadow banking
remained lax, which gave rise to the boom of shadow banking that fueled investment in real
estate, infrastructure, and other supporting industries with excess capacity. The lack of
coordination between monetary and regulatory policies gave non-state banks a strong incentive
to avail themselves of the regulatory arbitrage to engage in shadow banking activities, especially
in entrusted lending. As shown in Figure 20, both off-balance-sheet financing and corporate bond
financing increased significantly since 2009. Consequently, the gap between bank loans and total
social financing widened during and after the monetary stimulus (Figure 21).

From 2009 to 2015, entrusted loans became the second largest financing source of loans after
formal (traditional) bank loans. Entrusted lending is a loan made from one nonfinancial firm to
another nonfinancial firm. It was first facilitated by commercial banks off balance sheet but then
brought onto the balance sheet to take advantage of lax regulatory policy. According to Chen,
Ren, and Zha (forthcoming), over 60% of entrusted loans during the period from 2009 to 2015
were funneled to the real estate and its supporting heavy industries. And for the entrusted
lending that went to real estate companies, 75.33% of loan volumes were channeled to
enterprises that are not state owned.

As shadow banking activities blossomed, so did investments in shadow banking products on
banks' balance sheets such as account-receivable investment (ARI) and investments in NFCs.
NFCs include asset management companies and security companies. These companies issue
assets to banks (such as asset management plans) and use the funds to finance investments in
risky assets that were often shadow banking products. As shown in Figure 22, bank credits to
NFCs have waxed and waned when monetary policy has tightened since 2009. In 2010-2015,
these credits, as well as the issuance of municipal corporate bonds, “waxed” in response to
tightened monetary policy. 15 The effectiveness of tightening monetary policy to reduce the
investment rate, therefore, was hampered by other financial policies that failed to coordinate
with monetary policy. The failure of coordination between monetary policy and other financial
policies was a good lesson for researchers and policymakers to understand the limitation of
monetary policy.

  Chen, Liu, and He (2018) use the province-level data to show that provinces experiencing an
abnormally fast growth rate of bank loans in 2009 also had fast growth of municipal corporate
bond issuances during 2012-2015.

Xiong (2018) develops a theoretical growth model featuring local government GDP tournaments
to highlight another potential source for the rising shadow banking industry during this period:
the agency frictions between the central and local governments due to the inability of the central
government to distinguish a governor’s administration ability from infrastructure investment in
the governor’s province. Consequently, the governor faces a tradeoff between debt and career.
To advance his/her personal career, the governor takes on more debts to finance infrastructure
investment with an advantageous growth rate of regional productivity. But the governor has to
face the high cost of paying the debts next period. This model implies that the governor’s career
development can lead to an overleverage of the local government and a booming shadow
banking industry.

In the post-stimulus period, the real estate overstock problem persisted in small- and medium-
sized cities. To reduce the overstock of real estate, credit policy for mortgage financing was
loosened in 2014Q4-2016Q3, which created a boom of mortgage loans and an increasing
concentration of bank loans to the real estate (Figure 23). The concentration in recent years has
further raised systemic risks to the financial system.

In summary, the massive credit expansion during both the stimulus and post-stimulus episodes
has led to rapid growth of the debt burden as a percent of GDP as well as a widening gap between
total social financing and aggregate bank loans. Both the rapid growth of shadow banking
products and the increasing concentration of bank loans on the real estate industry have raised
systemic risks to the financial system. For shadow banking products, systemic risks are associated
with default risks to real estate companies and LGFVs. 16 For bank loans, systemic risks are
associated with default risks to the household sector if the housing market collapses.

  Bai and Zhou (2018) find that the municipal corporate bond yields across provinces are
negatively influenced by the value added to real estate (as a share of provincial GDP).

                        The new normal economy (2016-present)

As the debt-to-GDP ratio rose rapidly in the latter part of the investment-driven economy and
has continued to rise in the new normal economy, the tension between robust GDP growth and
the financial stability has begun to build up. As a result, financial policies in the new normal
economy are featured by strengthened regulations on shadow banking products and a better
coordination between monetary and regulatory policies under the MPA system. In this phase,
two deleveraging processes have begun: financial deleveraging to guide banks to reduce shadow
banking loans (e.g., bank credits to NFCs) and firm deleveraging to reduce corporate debts (e.g.,
ceasing the rollover of corporate debts). As one can see from Figure 22, both NFC credits and M2
supply have declined in tandem since 2016.17

The macroeconomic impacts of the financial and real deleveraging processes in the new normal
economy need time to assess. Early evidence indicates that investment in both real estate and
infrastructure, the two industries that were the largest beneficiaries of the rising shadow banking,
has recently lost steam. Various regulations on shadow banking activities since 2017 has forced
real estate developers to deleverage. The housing market and construction investment have
begun to cool down. In 2018Q1, the premium rate in the land auction market was only 10%, far
below the level of 30% during 2015-2017. Infrastructure investment has also slowed down since
last year due to a series of regulations to rectify local government financing guarantees.18 The
year-over-year growth rate of infrastructure investment has fallen since the second quarter of
2017 to 7.3% in the first half of 2018.

One unintended consequence of deleveraging is that POEs, especially the small and medium-
sized ones, have had even a harder time to gain access to bank financing. During the deleveraging
processes, the tightening of regulations on the shadow banking industry has led to defaults of
unprofitable POEs, creating a tradeoff between cleansing effects and systemic risks as borrowing
costs for healthy POEs have also increased. The mounting default risks, together with increasing
deposit shortfalls under the financial deleveraging, have made banks more reluctant to lend to
POEs, including the healthy ones.19 Since 2016, investment growth in the manufacturing industry
has been continuously below GDP growth. And as GDP growth continues to slow down, the
tension between GDP growth and financial stability challenges the government’s determination
for further deleveraging.

17
   While the recent cooperation between monetary and regulatory policies improved banks’
balance-sheet standing, off-balance-sheet activities and corporate debts continued to be a
serious problem. In 2017, trust loans (a major part of off-balance-sheet banking) soared in
response to the shrinking activities of on-balance-sheet investments (Figure 20).
18
   For example, PBC, Ministry of Finance, and four other government agencies issued a Notice on
Further Regulating Local Government's Debt Financing Behavior in May 2017 for the purpose of
rectifying local government’s financing guarantees.
19
   A similar situation occurred in the corporate bond market, as implied by the increasing credit
spread.

A deeper concern is the limited impact of deleveraging on SOEs in upstream industries, which
have continued to receive preferential credits and remain unproductive and monopolistic.
Implicit guarantees by local governments to such zombie firms make difficult the deleveraging of
corporate debts. Figure 24 shows that in recent years, the share of newly issued bank loans to
SOEs has increased rapidly, while the share of bank loans to POEs has declined. To deal with this
asymmetry between the treatments of SOEs and POEs, the government introduced reforms in
2016 to reduce the production of upstream industries in the heavy sector through administrative
means. The production reduction resulted in an increase of PPI in the upstream firms while these
unproductive and monopolistic firms continued to receive preferential credits. The increase of
PPI in turn raised the costs to downstream industries, most of which belong to the light sector. It
would inevitably exacerbate the credit and resource misallocations, putting further downward
pressures on economic growth. As investment growth in the light sector has slowed in recent
years, GDP growth has also slowed while the investment-to-GDP ratio has remained persistently
high, over 42% as shown in Figure 14.

                                         IV.     Conclusion

The preceding sections provide an overview of how regime shifts in the government’s financial
policies influenced the ways preferential credits were allocated to SOEs and the heavy sector.
The analysis highlights the role of the government in the structural changes of the economy. The
regime switching from the SOE-led economy to the investment-driven economy and then to the
new normal economy has been a product of changes in the government’s active financial policies.

Policy tools since 2016 have been adapted to assist a transition to the new normal economy. At
the beginning of 2016, the government incorporated the MPA System to ensure an effective
coordination between monetary and other financial policies. Other unifying rules on asset
management across different financial sectors (formal banking and shadow banking) have been
developed. Monetary policy has begun to experience a regime change as well: a transition from
the quantity based framework to an interest-rate based framework. 20 In addition to the
conventional policy tools, the government has applied many unconventional tools such as

effectiveness of the reforms on the interest rate liberalization and Liu, Spiegel, and Zhang (2018)

Standard Lending Facility (SLF), Medium-term Lending Facility (MLF), and Pledged Supplementary
Lending (PSL) to assist this transition.

                      loans. Data source: CEIC and authors' calculation.

Such a transition, however, will not be smooth under China’s institutional constraints. The GDP
growth target still remains the foremost goal of monetary policy. According to the central
government's Thirteenth Five-Year Plan (2016-2020), the GDP growth target as a lower bound
will continue for the next five years. High GDP growth vigorously pursued by the central
government as the overriding policy goal puts a severe constraint on how the PBC to conduct its
monetary policy and on how tight regulatory policy should be. As long as the GDP growth target
is in force, monetary and credit policies, with implicit government guarantees to SOEs in the SOE-
led economy and to the heavy sector in the investment-driven economy, will remain to be a
useful guidance for how to allocate bank credits to different firms, industries, or sectors.
Therefore, we conclude that the heavy hand of government in influencing how commercial banks
allocate their loans will continue, making M2 growth an effective tool for monetary policy not
only in the past but also in the near future.

The new normal economy is marked by other challenges as well. Financial markets are in the
development stage and still suffer from market frictions such as deposit rate ceilings and
illiquidity in bond markets. Coordination between monetary and regulatory policies should
continue to improve. The effects on the macroeconomy of a regime switch in monetary policy to
an interest rate based framework are unknown and difficult to measure at this point. Nor is
known about how effective is the monetary transmission from the policy rate to interbank
interest rates and eventually to bank lending rates. In sum, China will face new challenges to its
reforms on financial policies and its policy impacts on the new normal economy.
