                                           ABSTRACT

We randomly assigned beneficiaries of a conditional cash transfer program in Peru to attend a 3
hour training session designed to build their trust in financial institutions. We find that the
intervention:(a) significantly increased trust in banks, but had no effect on financial literacy; (b)
significantly increased savings over a ten month period, and (c) had no effect of the use of
accounts for transactions. The increase in savings is a 1.6 percentage point increase in the savings
rate out of the cash transfer depostis, and a 0.5 percentage point increase in the savings rate out of
household income.

1. Introduction
    While bank accounts play a crucial role in everyday economic activities in high-income
countries, fewer than 40% of the households in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) have
one (Demirgüç-Kunt et al., 2018). Instead, most poor households rely on informal, costly and risky
alternatives and would benefit from access to a range of the financial services offered by formal
institutions (see, for example, Bruhn and Love, 2014; Célérier and Matray, 2019; Dupas and
Robinson, 2013; Kast et al., 2018 and Stein and Yannelis, forthcoming). Savings, in particular,
facilitate investment in productive activities, education and household durables, and help smooth
out income shocks. In light of these advantages, many LMIC governments and international
organizations have set themselves the goal of improving these population groups' access to formal
financial institutions.

    One reason why poor households may not put their savings in a bank account is that they do
not trust the bank to make that money available to them when it is wanted (CGAP, 2012; Dupas
et al., 2016; FDIC, 2016; Bachas et al., 2019). Trust is an essential element of economic
transactions and an important driver of economic development (La Porta et al., 1997; Algan and
Cahuc, 2010). It is particularly crucial in financial transactions in which people exchange money
for promises, and it is essential where the legal institutions that enforce contracts are weak
(McMillan and Woodruff, 1999; Karlan, Mobius, Rosenblat, and Szeidl, 2009).4 A lack of trust
may be one reason why randomized field experiments in three different countries have found that,
even among people who take up accessible and free formal savings products, account use is low
(Dupas et al., 2018). Mistrust may also account for the fact that beneficiaries of cash transfer
programs withdraw most of the funds deposited in their bank accounts by the program in one lump-
sum withdrawal at the beginning of each pay period; this has been found to be the case, for
example, in Brazil, Colombia and South Africa (Bold, Porteous and Rotman, 2012), India

4
  In developed countries, trust has been shown to be key to stock market participation (Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales,
2008), use of checks instead of cash (Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales, 2004), mortgage refinancing (Guiso, Sapienza
and Zingales, 2004 and 2008; Johnson, Meier and Toubia, 2019), and decisions to not withdraw deposits from financial
institutions in times of financial crisis (Iyer and Puri, 2012; Sapienza and Zingales, 2012). In LMICS, there is evidence
that trust affects borrowing money and the take-up of insurance (Karlan, Mobius, Rosenblat, and Szeidl, 2009; Cole
et al., 2013).


                                                           1
(Muralidharan, Niehaus and Sukhtankar, 2016), Niger (Aker et al., 2016) and Mexico (Bachas et
al., 2019).

    We examine this issue with a field experiment designed to improve trust in financial
institutions among beneficiaries of Peru's Juntos ("together") conditional cash transfer program.
We teamed up with the Instituto de Estudios Peruanos (IEP), a well known Peruvian NGO
specializing in financial inclusion, to design and implement a three-hour workshop intended to
foster trust among Juntos beneficiaries and to evaluate the intervention's impact on beneficiary
savings. The Juntos program sets up savings accounts for each beneficiary in the Banco de la
Nacion (BN), a public institution dedicated to increasing the financial inclusion of underserved
populations and regions, and has been depositing bimonthly transfers of 200 Peruvian soles (about
US$ 60) into those accounts since the beginning of the program in 2005.

    We find that program beneficiaries who were assigned to a financial trust workshop were more
likely to report trusting the bank 12 months after the workshop. Specifically, while almost half the
control group reported trusting the bank, the trust intervention caused a 40% increase in trusting
the bank. A significantly larger proportion of the members of this latter group also said that they
were more willing to put their savings in a bank account than to use informal alternatives such as
savings in the form of assets like cattle. However, the workshops did not seem to have any effect
in terms of the beneficiaries' knowledge about the banking system, their financial literacy or their
understanding of how savings, loans and interest rates work.

    Then, using high-frequency administrative account-level data, we examined the effect of the
treatment on bank use and savings. While treatment did not affect the number of transactions
(deposit and withdrawals), we did find that the financial trust workshops resulted in the treatment
group saving 13 Peruvian Soles more than the control group over a ten month period. The increase
in savings is close to double the savings of the treatment over the 10 month period prior to the
intervention, 7 times the savings of the control group over the same period, a 1.6 percentage point
increase in the savings rate out of the cash transfer depostis, and a 0.5 percentage point increase in
the rate of savings out of household income.

    We argue that building trust in financial institutions is a necessary condition for promoting the
use of formal financial services (i.e., financial inclusion requires trust). Moreover, it is likely that
trust is an important element in the effectiveness of other strategies, such as lowering transactions


                                                   2
costs or raising interest rates. Our main contribution to this literature is to provide the first field
experiment to generate evidence that trust in financial instritutions can be influenced by experience
and information and that higher levels of trust translate into an increase in the use of financial
institutions.

    Our study contributes to a small observational literature on the relationshp between trust and
savings (Karlan, Ratan and Ziman 2014). Osili and Paulson (2014) show that immigants who have
experienced a systemic banking crisis in their country of origin are 11 percentage points less likely
to use banks in the U.S. than otherwise similar immigants who did not live through a crisis, and
the effects are larger for people who experienced crises in countries without deposit insurance.
Bachas et al. (2019) study an at-scale natural experiment in Mexico in which debit cards are rolled
out to beneficiaries of a cash transfer program, who already received transfers directly deposited
into a savings account. They find that after two years with a card, beneficiaries accumulate a
savings stock equal to 2 percent of their annual income. Debit cards increased account usage and
savings through two mechanisms: first, they reduced the transaction costs of accessing money in
the account; second, they reduced monitoring costs, which leads beneficiaries to check their
account balances frequently and build trust in the bank.

    The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the context and the
intervention. Section III explains the research design. Section IV presents the estimation strategy
and Section V presents the results. Section VI concludes.


2. Intervention
The workshop was delivered to beneficiaires of Juntos, Peru's conditional cash transfer program
for poor households. Juntos gives 200 soles (approximately US$ 60) to the female head of
beneficiary households once every two months provided that the household fulfills certain
conditions related to schooling and to preventive health services. Juntos transfers are paid into a
savings account that is opened for every beneficiary and managed by the Banco de la Nación (BN),
a state-owned bank committed to service underserved populations. Typically Juntos beneficiaries
withdraw all of the transfer in cash from the account soon after it is deposited. Juntos began its
opertation in 2005 and today covers over 700,000 beneficiaries living in 1,325 (70%) of the




                                                  3
country's 1,874 districts.5 Juntos beneficiaries who participated in the study has been receiving the
transfers though deposits into BN accounts for at least two years prior to the intervention and
therefore are already familiar with banks and bank operations.

           The trust workshop was designed and implemented by Instituto de Estudios Peruanos
(IEP), a well known Peruvian NGO that specializes in financial inclusion. The goal was to foster
trust that money deposited in beneficiaries' bank accounts would be there when they wanted it by
explaining why accounts are secure, that accounts are protected by government regulation, that
there is a consumer-help telephone line available, and a trust building demonstration exersize. The
workshop did not discuss the value of savings or why someone would want to save.

           In addition to refreshments and snacks, the following topics were covered during the
approximately 3-hour workshop:

      A. Account Access and Security

      The account into which Juntos transfers are depsoited is like a lock box. The money deposited
into the account will be there when wanted. The beneficary must use an ATM card and password
to withdraw money from the account. The card with the password is similar to a key that only the
beneficary can use to withdraw the money. No money can be deducted or withdrawn from the
account without the card and the password. Hence, nobody else can access the account except the
beneficiary.

      B. Government Consumer Protection Programs

      The Government protects all money deposited into bank accounts. The Government makes
sure that all banks, including Banco de la Nacion, are safely managing and protecting your money.
The Superintendencia de Banca, Seguros y AFP (Peruvian Superintendent of Bank) is in charge
of making sure that banks safely manage your money including not allowing unlawful deductions
from your account. Fondo de Seguro de Depositos (Deposit Insurnace Fund) is in charge of giving
your money back in case of bankruptcy of Banco de la Nacion or fraud. If you have difficulty
getting access to your funds or have a complaint you can call a toll free telephone hotline and
obtain help in your own language. Cards with the free phone numbers were handed out.

   C. Multi-Red Agents

   Multi-red agents are small stores in underserved rural areas with POS machines that account
holders can use to make deposits and withdrawals. The agents were fairly new so that there was
some information as to who they were and how they worked. The workshop emphasized that
agents were just as trustworthy as bank branches, that the accounts could only be accessed with
the ATM card and password, that consumer protection laws applied to them, and that they could
use the consumer hotline for problems with agents.

   D. How to Keep Money Safe

   Discussion about the relative safety of alternative places to leave money. In particular, why
leaving money in Banco de la Nación is safer than keeping cash at home or purchasing animals or
other assests that can be stolen or more easilly appropriated by relatives, espcially husbands, or
friends.

   E. Trust Building Activity

   One out of the some 30 participants was randomly given 50 Soles to deposit in their account
during the workshop and then asked to go to the bank to try to withdraw 30 soles later in the week
and report back to the group.


3. Experimental Design, Analysis Sample and Compliance
   The study sample was drawn from Juntos beneficiaries who live in rural villages in 17 districts
in the Sierra region of Peru. These beneficiaries receive the Juntos transfers deposited in a BN
savings account linked to a debit card. Beneficiaries can access their account either through the
BN branch located in the district capital or through a MultiRed agent. These agents are private
store owners located near rural beneficiary households and are certified as BN agents to conduct
account transactions (deposits and withdrawals) for Juntos beneficiaries via a wireless point-of-
sale (POS) device. In the study, we included villages with 15 or more Juntos beneficiaries who
received the program transfer payment via direct deposit into their BN account. This gave us a
universe of 130 villages from which we randomly assigned 64 villages to the treatment and 66 to
the control group. The workshops were conducted between November 2014 and July 2015 and
were rolled out over time at the distict level.




                                                  5
   At the time of the randomization, there were 4,562 Juntos beneficiaries in the 130 villages
included in the study. We excluded Juntos beneficiaries who had been dropped from the program
due to noncompliance with the conditionalities or who had moved away from their village (803).
In addition, we trimmed off the top 0.1% of our sample to exclude outliers in the banking variables
(251). Finally, we excluded households that, for scheduling reasons, had received Juntos payments
twice in one bimester and that, as a result, did not receive a Juntos payment during the next period
(321). This process left us with a total of 3,187 Juntos beneficiaries, of whom 1,450 live in
treatment villages and 1,737 live in control villages. In all, 1,166 of the people assigned to
treatment actually participated in the financial trust workshop, for a take-up rate of 80%. In
addition, 198 out of the 1,737 people assigned to the control group attended the training, resulting
in an 11% noncompliance rate in the control group.


4. Data and Measurement
   Our primary source of information was administrative records from November 2013 to August
2015. Juntos provided the list of all beneficiaries living in the study villages as well as program
compliance information for each of the beneficiary households. The Ministry of Development and
Social Inclusion merged the information from Juntos with socio-demographic information from
the national poverty mapping system (Sistema de Focalizacion de Hogares (SISFOH)) using the
beneficiaries' national identification numbers (DNIs). BN then added transaction-level data on
each deposit and withdrawal for each account, again using the DNI, and then provided us with the
merged data after scrambling the DNIs to anonymize them. We aggregated the transaction-level
data into account-level data by Juntos payment bimester, including the number of deposits, value
of deposits, number of withdrawals, value of withdrawals, and savings.

   Ideally, in order to study their savings behavior, we would like to know bank balances (i.e. the
stock of savings) at the beginning of each payment bimester. Since that information was not
provided, we instead measure the initial stock of savings as the value of all deposits minus
withdrawals made during the five bimesters (10 months) prior to the intervention. Then, to
compute the stock of savings in each bimester of the post-treatment period, we added to the last
period's stock of savings the value of deposits minus withdrawals made during that bimester.

   We have data for 11 bimesters (November 2013 to August 2015). However, information on
withdrawals was accidently dropped from one bimester (July and August of 2014). We therefore


                                                 6
exclude this bimester from the analysis. Thus, we relied on the remaining 5 pre-treatment bimesters
for which we have complete data to compute the stock of savings at baseline and the 5 post-
treatment bimester periods to analyze the effect of the training on savings.

   In order to collect information on trust and financial literacy, we supplemented the
administrative data with a household survey conducted between 12 and 18 months after the
intervention. On our behalf, Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) conducted a survey of the
beneficiary households between April and May 2016. IPA enumerators were not informed about
the intervention and did not know who was treatment and who was control. They identified
themsleves as IPA and did not refer to the workshop or IEP in anyway during the interviews. The
response rate was 89.9% and was the same for treatment and control groups. BN merged the
survey data with the adimistrative data using the DNI, and provided us an anonymized data base
for analysis.

   The survey collected information about household interactions with and perceptions of BN and
covered the topics of trust, savings behavior and financial knowledge. The questions about trust
covered trust in the bank, bank staff, and bank branch and preferences regarding saving in the bank
versus holding cash in the house or purchasing assets such as animals. To measure
knowledge/financial literacy, respondents were asked what a savings account was, what a
MultiRed agent was, what savings and loans institutions were, and what interest rates were. The
specific questions used to measure trust and knowledge/financial literacy are provided in Appendix
Table A1.


5. Methods
   We examine the impact of treatment on two types of outcomes. The first set are measures of
trust and knowledge/financial literacy obtained using data form the cross-sectional household
survey. Since treatment was randomized and the experimental groups were balanced (see Table
1), we simply estimate the difference in the means of the treatment and control groups using the
following regression:

                            =  +   +                                                            (1)




                                                 7
where  is the outcome variable for individual  in village  ,  is a dummy variable that
indicates whether or not village  has been assigned to treatment and  is the error term. We
cluster the standard errors at the village level to account for any intra-cluster correlation.

    In studies with multiple outcomes, statistically significant effects may emerge simply by
chance. The larger the number of tests, the greater the likelihood of incurring in a type I error. We
correct for this possibility by using Bonferroni family-wise error rates to adjust the p-values of the
individual tests as a function of the number of outcome variables. We rely on Bonferroni FWER
corrections at the 10% level of statistical significance in conceptually similar blocks of outcomes.6

    The second set of outcomes are transactions and savings obtained using data from the
longitudinal administration account-level data. Given that Juntos transfers are made every two
months, the data is organized in bimesters, following the timing of the transfers. This allows us to
examine how the treatment effect evolves over exposure ­ i.e., the number of bimesters since
treatment.

    We estimate the effect of treatment on the number of transactions and savings using the
following regression specification:

                                 =  + -1   +  +                                                                 (2)

Where  is the outcome variable for individual i in village v in calendar period t. , takes a
value of 1 if the village v is assigned to treatment and  is the number of bimesters since treatment,
with treatment happenng at k=0. We also include bimester fixed effects ( ) and individual fixed
effect ( ). The individual fixed effects control for any concerns over composition effects that
might have occurred due to the rollout over time by district. However, the results are almost
identical with and without fixed effects. The term  is a random error term that is possibly
correlated within villages due treatment assignment at the village level. We therefore cluster
standard errors at the village level.

    The models in equations (1) and (2) estimate the intention-to-treat (ITT) impacts. Since there
is some noncompliance, we also estimate the local average treatment effect (LATE) by
instrumental variables using 2SLS with treatment assignment as an instrument for participating in

6
 For example, if there are 5 outcome variables, the Bonferroni corrected p- value is 0.02 (=0.1/5). Therefore, we
would reject the null hypothesis of no treatment effect if the estimated coefficient is significant at the 2% level.


                                                         8
the workshop. Again, we cluster the standard errors at the village level as a basis for statistical
inference.


6. Results

   6.1. Descriptive Statistics and Balance Checks
   Descriptive statistics for the analysis sample at baseline for households in the treatment and
control groups are presented in Table 1. In two cases, out of 17 contrasts, we reject the null
hypothesis of equal means between groups at conventional levels of statistical significance ­
naturally. However, once we use using Bonferroni family-wise error rates, we never reject the null
hypothesis. In Appendix Table A2, we compare the means of baseline variables for the analysis
sample and for those excluded from the analysis and find only one variable for which we reject
the null hypothesis of equal means. Again, once we use using Bonferroni family-wise error rates,
we never reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the analysis sample is representative of the
population of Juntos beneficiaries in the 17 districts.

   The analysis sample (see Table 1) consists of households where the primary Juntos beneficiary
is female, is on average about 40 years old, has completed 6 years of schooling and whose primary
language is not Spanish. About two thirds of these beneficiaries work in agriculture but only 12%
own their own farms. Very few beneficiaries have contact with formal financial institutions, as
only 4% have a bank account other than their Juntos BN account and only 3% participate in a
rotating savings and credit association (ROSCA). On average, individuals make one deposit (the
Juntos transfer) into their BN account and one withdrawal from it each bimester (two transactions
per bimester). The difference between the baseline stock of savings (i.e. the difference between all
deposits and withdrawals in the 10 month period prior to the intervention) between the treatment
and control group is -3.8 Peruvian Soles and is not statitically different from zero.


   6.2. Trust and Knowledge/Financial Literacy
   Baseline levels of trust are low. Only 48% of the control group trusts the bank and 36% trust
bank staff. Moreover, 54% believe money is safer at home than in a bank and 29% belive it is safer
to purchase animals as a store of value than keep money ina bank (AppendixTable A3). Overall,
the training workshops appear to have increased trust in the banking system substantially (see
Figure 1, Panel A, and Appendix Table A3). All of the treatment effects on all of the outcome


                                                  9
variables are sizable in magnitude and significantly different from zero using conventional p-
values, although trust in bank staff is not statistically significant using Bonferroni family-wise
error rates. The effect of treatment increases the number of beneficiaries who reported that they
trusted the BN by 19 percentage points, or 40% over the control mean (48%). Trust in BN staff
increases by 6.5 percentage points, or 18% over the control mean (36%). Trust in the BN branch
increases by 11 percentage points, or 14% over the control mean (78%). Treatment also increases
the preference for putting savings in the bank over keeping savings at home by 21 percentage
points, or 46% over the control mean (46%). Treatment increases the preference for putting savings
in the bank over holding savings in the form of assets such as livestock by 18 percentage points,
or 62% over the control mean (29%). Finally, treatment increases a summary measure of overall
trust in banking by 30% over the control mean (49%).7

    Another possible explanation for any increase in savings associated with the workshop is that
the workshops may have also increased the beneficiaries' knowledge about the banking system
and financial literacy. If that were the case, it would be hard to distinguish the effect on saving
behaviour of trust from that of knowledge/financial literacy. However, there is little evidence to
support this hypothesis. Basline levels of financial literacy are large. About 74% of control
households understand savings, 99% report knowing how to use a mulitred agent, 85% seems to
understand interest rates, and 32% savings. By and large we find very small and statistically
insignificant effects of the owrkshop on knowledge/financial literacy (see Figure 1, Panel B, and
Appendix Table A3). Regardless, there is little evidence from other studies that financial literacy
leads to higher use of financial services or better financial outcomes.8 Thus, together these results
suggest that any effect on savings was likely driven by increased trust as opposed to increased
knowledge/financial literacy.


    6.3. Use of Accounts and Savings

Table A4), where the local average treatment effects by bimester since the workshop was offered

are presented.9 The difference between the treatment and control groups is postive and increases
over time. This suggests that treatment beneficiaries are saving more than the control group during
each period and that their stock of savings is rising. After 5 bimesters (10 months), the difference
in the stock of savings averaged 13 soles. At baseline (k=-1), the average stock of savings was 7
soles, which implies that, in less than a year, the treatment increased saving levels in aproximately
double baseline savings. In addition, this effect is almost 7 times the savings of the control group
over the same period.10 Finally, this treatment effect also translates into a 1.6 percentage point
increase in the savings rate out of Juntos transfers and a 0.5 percentage point increase in the savings
rate out of household income during the period studied.11

       While the financial trust workshop had a large effect on trust, it does not seem to have affected
the use of the account for transactions (see Figure 3 and Appendix Table A4). One possible reason
is that the closest BN branch or agent was still quite far away from most of the households. For
example, on average, the closest agent was 4 kilometers away, which represents, on average, a
total travel time of over 50 minutes. This is consistent with evidence from Mexico that transacitons
fall the further a household is located from bank branches and ATMs (Bachas et al., 2019b).

       Finally, the workshop also discussed the relatively new multi-red agent network, i.e. small
shops with POS devices that beneficariers can use to access their accounts with their ATM card
and password. The agents are substainatially closer to beneficiary households than bank branchs
and were set up to lower transaction costs of account access. Using administrative data we esimtate
the effect of treatment on the location of withdrawal (branch versus agent) by bimester of exposure
using the specification in equation (2). We find no effect of the workshop on agent use (Figure 4).
This result is consistent with the workshop not affecting knowledge of use of bank functions nor
influencing any behavior related to agents.


7. Conclusion
       We conducted a field experiment to assess the extent to which the level of trust in financial
institutions among Peruvian cash transfer program beneficiaries could be raised and, if their level

    The intention-to-treat (ITT) results are very similar and are also reported in Appendix Table A5.

  In particular, over the same period of time, the control group have saved 2 soles.

  After the training, JUNTOS beneficiaries have received 800 soles in four 200 soles payments and, based on the
information on the Survey (2016), their average total income over the same period was 2835 soles.

of trust was raised significantly, whether it would be effective in increasing their use of their bank
accounts for transactions and saving. The results show that it was indeed possible to substantially
increase their level of trust and thereby bring about an increase of 13 Peruvian soles in their savings
account balances after 10 months as compared to an average of 7 soles at baseline. The savings
effect represents a 1.6 percentage point increase in the saving of Juntos cash transfers and a 0.5
percentage point increase out of household during those 10 months.

   In this study we are interested in the role of trust, i.e. the belief that deposited in account will
be there when the holder wants to access it, on the use of bank. We document that the workshop
did indeed build trust and then compared account use between those that were offered the
workshop and those who were not. It is important to note that while there is strong evidence that
the workshop built trust, there there is no evidence that the intervention increased beneficiary
knowledge about the banking system or their financial literacy. Even if the workshop did improve
financial literacy there is little evidence from other studies that financial literacy leads to higher
use of financial services or better financial outcomes. This implies that the mechanism by which
the workshop increased savings was through enhanced trust and not through enhanced financial
literacy or knowledge and experience with banks.

   Although the workshop used several different types of messages through which to try to build
trust (account access security, consumer protection, safe savings, and a trust building exercise),
we did not attempt to disentangle them empirically. Our primary interest is in the effect of trust on
the use of formal financial services and thus did not design an experiment to assess which types of
messages best built trust.

   Our results show that trust in financial institutions is an important factor in encouraging poor
households to hold their savings in bank accounts. The magnitude of the treatment effect is similar
to other interventions such as lowering monetary and non-monetary transctions costs, increasing
the rate of return to savings, as well as behavoral nudges and reminders (Figure 5). Trust is also
likely to increase the efffectiveness of these other other interventions as well, such as those
involving a reduction in transaction costs or increased returns, in terms of influencing savings.
Overall, trust may be key for the financial inclusion of the poor.

   Around the world, over 100 million families participate in cash transfer programs and therefore
are a vechile to improve the finaicial inclusion of the poor. While many of these programs open


                                                  12
bank accounts in beneficiaries' names, few of those bank accounts are actually used, as
beneficiaries prefer to withdraw their entire transfer as soon as the cash is available (Bold, Porteous
and Rotman, 2012; Muralidharan, Niehaus and Sukhtankar, 2016; Aker et al., 2016; and Bachas
et al., 2019). Simple cheap trust builiding exersizes, like our workshop, maybe transformative in
the financial inclusion of cash transfer program beneficiaries.

Note: This figure reports the differences in the mean for each variable between the treatment and control groups and
the 95% confidence region for that difference based on data from the household survey. The difference in the means
is the LATE estimate of the impact of the trust training workshop on the outcomes. The mean outcome for the control
group is given in the key in parentheses. The point estimates, standard errors, sample sizes and means of the control
groups for each of the bars are presented in Appendix Table A3. Appendix Table A1 reports the questions used to
collect the outcome measures. The overall trust and knowledge/financial literacy measures are the sum of the
responses regarding other outcome measures divided by the number of outcome measures.
