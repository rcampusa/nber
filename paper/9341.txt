                                                ABSTRACT



          Traditionally, the effects of monetary policy actions on output are thought to be transmitted via

monetary or credit channels. Real business cycle theory, by contrast, highlights the role of real price

changes as a source of revisions in spending and production decisions. Motivated by the desire to focus

on the effects of price changes in the monetary transmission mechanism, this paper incorporates a direct

measure of the real own-price of money into an estimated vector autoregression and a calibrated real

business cycle model. Consistent with this new view of the monetary transmission mechanism, both

approaches reveal that movements in the own-price of money are strongly related to movements in

output.

                The Own-Price of Money and a New Channel of Monetary Transmission


             Traditionally, the effects of monetary policy actions on output are thought to be

transmitted via monetary or credit channels. In the former, changes in the nominal

quantity of money affect spending directly whereas, in the latter case, open market

operations induce changes in interest rates that affect spending; in some models, credit

rationing can have a secondary effect on output as well. Real business cycle models, in

contrast, emphasize that changes in real prices can be a consequence of monetary policy

actions and that economics most naturally focuses on price changes as the source of

revisions in spending and production decisions. Unfortunately, estimation or calibration of

real business cycle models to illustrate this theoretical proposition has been handicapped

by the apparent absence of a continuous time series of price data that would reflect

changes in the stance of monetary policy. Thus, the perceived lack of any price data

flowing directly from actions taken by the Federal Reserve’s Open Market Committee

(FOMC) has led authors to examine proxies and isolated incidents rather than directly-

observable price changes over a broad span of time. For example, Romer and Romer (1989)

extracted anecdotal evidence from transcripts of FOMC meetings to identify six episodes of

negative monetary policy shocks associated with attempts to reduce inflation; the dummy

variable that marks these decisions explains a substantial portion of the variation in

output. In a similar vein, Plosser (1991) treated increases in reserve requirements between

1937-39 as an increase in the cost of deposit creation and examined that period for

fluctuations in output associated with this change in the setting of one monetary policy

lever.   1


             Motivated by the desire to focus on the effects of price changes on output as a

consequence of monetary policy actions, this paper introduces a new model of monetary

transmission. In it neither the nominal quantity of money nor interest rates is linked

directly to output but, instead, changes in the real own-price of money are associated with

aggregate fluctuations. To this end, we first discuss how the own-price of money can be


                                                   2
measured in a manner consistent with results in modern aggregation theory and, in so

doing, produce a continuous time series of real prices that can be used in empirical work.

The characteristics of the resulting data then are examined, in overview, within a VAR

framework that allows changes in a nominal measure of monetary policy (the adjusted

monetary base) and changes in the real price of money to affect output separately. We then

discuss a real business cycle model with the nominal quantity of money and modify it to

incorporate the real price of money as well. Once specified, this model is calibrated and

time paths for data generated by it are compared against actual output data. We find that

the synthetic and actual data evolve along similar paths and that a direct measure of the

real own-price of money appears to offer a new channel of monetary policy transmission

apart from either the monetary or credit views.

Measuring the Own-Price of Money

            Empirical work in monetary economics typically uses measures of the aggregate

quantity of money produced by central banks. These data are called simple sum aggregates

because they are unweighted, arithmetic summations of the deposits in the various

categories subsumed within the aggregate. The theoretical implications of simple sum

aggregation are that each asset in the index is a perfect substitute for every other asset in

the group and, as such, the representative consumer has a utility function of the Leontief

form.   2   Alternatively, an aggregate quantity of money also can be constructed as an index

of the superlative class and, in this case, quantities of index components are weighted by

shares of expenditures on their monetary service flows. Here, the form of the sub-utility

function for money holdings is unknown but the index number will track its value over time

as changes in the relative prices of alternative forms of money induce substitutions that

alter the expenditure share weights of the components and the quantities held of those

deposit categories in the aggregate.

            No matter what type of index is chosen to measure the aggregate quantity of money,

principles of duality require that each, as a matter of internal consistency, is paired with a



                                                 3
precise expression for the corresponding own-price of money. Thus, the perfect

substitutability implication of the Leontief technology behind simple sum aggregation

requires that the own price of the monetary aggregate be the lowest price, at time t, among

the assets within the aggregate.                3   The paragraphs below will show that this own-price will

take the form of a minimum user cost.                    4   In contrast, the own price of aggregate money,

when measured by a superlative index, will be the share-weighted sum of each asset’s user

cost.   5   In neither case, however, is the own-price of money merely an interest rate chosen

to represent the opportunity cost of foregone interest on a single alternative to money

holdings.

            To illustrate these points, the construction of a superlative index number begins by

calculating total expenditures on the components of the aggregate. That expenditure (Et)

can be written as Et =          åx    it   pit . When aggregation is over monetary assets, xit is the

nominal quantity of monetary asset i at t and pit is its real price; equivalently, one can

construct the expenditure magnitude by using real quantities and nominal prices. Because

monetary assets are durables that do not perish during the period from use, their prices are

their user costs. The formula for the real user cost of a monetary asset, derived by Barnett

(1978), can be written as:

            pit = ( Rit − rit ) /(1 + Rt )

where Rit is a benchmark rate of return, rit is the own rate of return on the ith component at

time t.     6


            With the user cost and quantity data, the expenditure share on asset j is sjt =

xjtpjt/Et. A Divisia quantity index in continuous time (and its Tornqvist discrete time

approximation) computes the growth rate of the aggregate as the share-weighted average of

its components and satisfies               7



            dlog Xt =   å 0.5 * (s    it   + sit − 1)d log xit

while the Divisia price index Pt in continuous time satisfies




                                                                 4
            dlog Pt =   å 0.5 * ( s   it   + sit − 1)d log pit .

Behavior of the Simple Sum and Divisia Price Duals

            Figure 1 illustrates the behavior of percentage changes in the real price of money as

measured by nominal price duals deflated by the geometric mean of the GDP deflator and

the CPI. With a variety of aggregates that might be examined, we have chosen to examine

data for simple sum and Divisia measures of an aggregate consisting of M1 assets plus

savings deposits. Although this aggregate is not reported by the Federal Reserve, it has

been examined by Rotemberg, et al. (1995) and named “M1-plus” by Belongia (1996). More

important for issues regarding aggregation, however, this grouping possesses the property

of weak separability such that it is a candidate for aggregation; by contrast, M2 fails this

test.   8   Thus, studies that have created a Divisia measure of M2 still have been in error

because they have applied a legitimate index number formulation to a group of commodities

that fails the first test (weak separability) in the construction of an aggregate data series.

The simple sum price dual for this asset collection is a mixture of the user costs of other

checkable deposits and savings deposits issued by thrifts. An exception to this general

result occurred during the period of 1983-1986 when money market deposit accounts

(MMDAs) were reported separately rather than as part of savings deposits; during this

interval, the user cost of MMDAs represented the lowest user cost in the simple sum

aggregates.

            Despite the fundamental differences in the manner each series is constructed,

figure 1 shows that the two follow the same broad patterns; this picture is reinforced by a

comparison of values for the means and standard deviations of the series. And, while both

series demonstrate considerable variability, Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests show that each

is stationary. Finally, from an economic standpoint, it is interesting to note that sharp

increases in the price of money tend to be associated with the on-set of recessions, whereas

sharp declines appear to lead economic expansions. A potential explanation for this pattern




                                                                   5
in the data and more detailed exploration of its economic consequences is the focus of the

real business model derived and discussed later.

A Small VAR Model

       How the monetary price dual might be associated with aggregate activity can be

examined by comparing its contribution to the variance decomposition of output

fluctuations relative to that of the nominal quantity of money. Within such an approach, it

also is possible to compare both the quantitative and qualitative implications derived from

otherwise identical models that use simple sum or superlative index numbers. For these

purposes, a VAR model was estimated with the growth rates of real, per capita GDP (y), the

adjusted monetary base (AMB) and the real price of money (pdual) as the system’s

endogenous variables. The model was estimated with quarterly data over a sample

spanning 1960:2– 2001:4. Two lags were used for each variable and experimentation with

longer lags did not affect the results in a meaningful way.

       The impulse-response functions shown in the top panel of figure 2 indicate that

innovations to the monetary base contribute little to fluctuations in output whereas

innovations to the Divisia M1-plus price dual are related negatively to output growth. The

variance decomposition statistics reveal that about five percent of the variance of output

growth can be attributed to the price dual whereas less than 0.5 percent is associated with

the monetary base. The same VAR, when estimated with the real simple sum price dual,

yields similar results with innovations to the own-price of money showing a larger impact

on output growth than that associated with innovations to base growth. Indeed, with plots

of the two price measures in figure 1 showing similar behavior over time, this result is not

surprising.

       Modification of the VAR, however, highlights how measurement issues can affect the

quality of empirical work. To illustrate the point, the VAR with the simple sum price dual is

augmented by the addition of a term reflecting the difference between the growth rate of the

Divisia and simple sum price duals as a separate term. The effect of this change is shown



                                              6
in the bottom panel of figure 2. In this case, the difference between the two price measures

has a larger effect on output growth than innovations to the monetary base and this effect

is nearly as large as that associated with innovations to the simple sum price dual itself.

Thus, while an investigation based on simple sum monetary aggregates would be internally

consistent if it measured the own-price of money as the minimum real user cost among the

component assets, it would be throwing away information contained in superlative index

numbers.

       Over all, these figures lend credence to a RBC story that would attribute output

fluctuations associated with monetary policy to a change in prices rather than the nominal

quantity of money. Any observed empirical associations among these series, however,

occur in the absence of a theoretical model that would rationalize them. The next section

discusses a model in which the real price of money, as well as its nominal quantity, have

the potential to affect output.

The Model: Overview

       The model borrows elements from real business cycle models with money developed

in King and Plosser (1984) and Coleman (1996) as well as from the shopping time model of

McCallum and Goodfriend (1987). The economy consists of a representative household, a

representative firm, a representative bank, and a monetary authority. The activities of each

of these agents are now described in turn.

The Representative Household

       The representative household enters each period t = 0,1,2,… with Mt-1 units of

currency, Bt-1 bonds, and Kt units of capital. At the beginning of the period, the household

receives Tt additional units of currency in the form of a lump-sum transfer from the

monetary authority. Next, the household’s bonds mature, providing Bt-1 more units of

currency. The household uses some of this currency to purchase Bt new bonds at the price

of 1/rt dollars per bond, where rt denotes the gross nominal interest rate between t and t+1.




                                              7
          After this initial bond-trading session, the household is left with Mt-1+Tt+Bt-1-Bt/rt

units of currency. It divides this currency up into an amount Nt to be used to purchase

goods and an amount Mt-1+Tt+Bt-1-Bt/rt-Nt to be deposited in the bank. The household also

borrows Lt dollars from the bank, bringing the total nominal value of its deposits to

(1)   Dt = Mt − 1 + Tt + Bt − 1 − Bt / rt − Nt + Lt .

          During period t, the household supplies ht units of labor and Kt units of capital to

the representative firm, receiving credit for Wtht+QtKt in return, where Wt denotes the

nominal wage rate and Qt denotes the nominal rental rate for capital. The household

purchases output from the representative firm at the nominal price Pt; it divides its

purchases into an amount Ct to be consumed and an amount It to be invested. Making

these transactions requires

                            χN                     χD
             æ Ct + It ö             æ Ct + It ö
(2) st = γ N ç         ÷         +γ Dç         ÷
             è Nt / Pt ø             è Dt / Pt ø

units of shopping time, where γN > 0, χN > 1, γD > 0, and χD > 1. By investing It units of

output during period t, the household increases its capital stock during period t+1

according to

(3)   K t +1 = (1 − δ ) K t + I t ,

where 1 > δ > 0.

          At the end of period t, the household owes the bank rLtLt dollars, where rLt is the

gross nominal interest rate on loans. At the same time, however, the bank owes the

household rDtDt dollars, where rDt is the gross nominal interest rate on deposits. After all of

these transactions are settled, the household carries Mt units of currency into period t+1,

where

(4)    M t = N t + Wt ht + Qt K t + rDt Dt − Pt (Ct + I t ) − rLt Lt .

The household, therefore, seeks to maximize the expected utility function




                                                        8

(5) E å β t [ln(Ct ) −η(ht + st )],
         t =0


with 1 > β > 0 and η > 0, subject to the constraints (1)-(4), each of which must hold for all t

= 0,1,2,….

The Representative Firm

           The representative firm hires ht units of labor at the nominal wage Wt and Kt units of

capital at the nominal rental rate Qt in order to produce Yt units of output according to the

constant-returns-to-scale technology described by

(6)   Yt = K t α ( Z t ht ) 1−α ,

with 1 > α > 0. In (6), the productivity shock Zt follows a random walk with positive drift:

(7) ln( Z t ) = ln( z ) + ln( Z t −1 ) + ε zt ,

where z > 1 and the zero-mean, serially uncorrelated innovation εzt is normally distributed

with standard deviation σz. The firm acts to maximize its profits, equating the marginal

product of labor to the real wage Wt/Pt and the marginal product of capital to the real rental

rate Qt/Pt.

The Representative Bank

           During period t, the representative bank makes loans worth Lt dollars and accepts

deposits worth Dt dollars. It receives interest on its loans at the gross rate rLt and pays

interest on its deposits at the gross rate rDt. Let θ , 1 > θ > 0, denote the required reserve

ratio. Assuming that rLt > 1, the bank will never find it optimal to hold excess reserves;

hence

(8) Lt = (1 − θ ) Dt

will hold for all t = 0,1,2,….




                                                  9
           During period t, the bank creates deposits with total real value Dt/Pt using a

technology that requires xt(Dt/Pt) units of output, where the financial-sector cost shock xt

follows the first-order autoregression

(9)    ln( x t ) = (1 − ρx ) ln( x ) + ρx ln( x t −1 ) + ε xt .

In (9), 1 > ρx > 0, x > 0, and the zero-mean, serially uncorrelated innovation εxt is normally

distributed with standard deviation σx. Hence, the bank’s nominal profits during period t

are

(10) Π t = (rLt − 1) Lt − (rDt − 1) Dt − Pt x t ( Dt / Pt ).

Since competition in the banking industry drives these profits to zero, (8) and (10) imply

that

(11) rDt = 1 + (1 − θ )(rLt − 1) − x t

must hold for all t = 0,1,2,…, indicating that the financial-sector cost shock xt impacts

directly on the deposit rate rDt in equilibrium.

The Monetary Authority

           In equilibrium, Mt = Mt-1 + Tt and Bt = Bt-1 = 0 for all t = 0,1,2,…. Substituting these

conditions, together with (8), into (1) confirms that in this economy, the monetary base Mt

equals currency Nt plus reserves θDt. Let µt = Mt/Mt-1 denote the gross rate of money base

growth and assume, for simplicity, that the monetary authority conducts policy so that µt

follows the first-order autoregression

(12) ln( µt ) = (1 − ρµ ) ln( µ ) + ρµ ln( µt −1 ) + ε µt ,

where 1 > ρµ > 0, µ > 1, and the zero-mean, serially uncorrelated innovation εµt is normally

distributed with standard deviation σµ.

Solution, Calibration, and Results

Solution




                                                                  10
       Equations (1)-(12), when combined with the first-order conditions describing the

optimizing behavior of the representative household and firm, form a large system of

nonlinear stochastic difference equations. After these equations are log-linearized around

the system’s unique steady state, they can be solved using standard methods, such as

those described by Blanchard and Kahn (1980). The theory’s implications then can be

explored numerically once the model is fully calibrated—that is, once specific values are

assigned to each of the model’s parameters.

Calibration

       Since the model is built around a standard, real business cycle framework, many of

its parameters can be assigned values used throughout the literature on real business

cycles. For example, the depreciation rate δ is set equal to 0.025; with each model period

interpreted as a quarter year in real time, this choice corresponds to an annual depreciation

rate for physical capital of 10 percent. Similarly, the setting β = 0.99 implies that the

representative household’s annual discount factor is 4 percent. The setting η = 2.7 implies

that the household spends about one-third of its time—or eight hours out of twenty-four—

working. Finally, the setting α = 0.33 dictates that capital receives a one-third share of

national income; labor receives the remaining two-thirds.

       Values for other parameters can be assigned so that the model matches key

statistics that are computed from the postwar US data. For example, the setting z =

1.00464 implies that the annualized steady-state growth rate of output in the model is 1.87

percent, equal to the average annual growth rate of real, per-capita GDP in the US from

1959 through 2001. The setting σz = 0.0088 for the standard deviation of the innovation to

the productivity shock makes the standard deviation of output growth in the model equal to

the standard deviation of real, per-capita GDP growth in the US data.

       The parameter θ, which measures the required reserve ratio in the model, is set

equal to 0.0475, based on the observation that from 1959 through 2001, the average ratio

of required reserves to the deposits included in the M1-plus measure of money is also about


                                              11
4.75 percent. Similarly, setting x = 0.011 for the average marginal cost of creating deposits

allows the steady-state user cost of deposits in the model to match the postwar average of

user costs of the deposits included in the M1-plus monetary aggregate. With γN = 0.00004

and γD = 0.008, the steady-state currency-output and deposit-output ratios from the model

coincide with the average currency-output and deposit-output ratios in the US data. The

setting σx = 0.145 for the standard deviation of the financial-sector cost shock allows the

model to replicate the standard deviation of the growth rate of the Divisia M1-plus price

dual as measured in the US data. Finally, the parameters of the money supply rule (12) are

set to match the results from a regression of the quarterly growth rate of the US adjusted

monetary base, 1959:1 through 2001:4, on a constant and its own lagged value: µ = 1.0167,

ρµ = 0.46, and σµ = 0.007.

          In the absence of any obvious way of linking the model’s three remaining parameters

to statistics constructed from the US data, values for these parameters are chosen that

seem reasonable or, at least, do not seem unreasonable. The settings χN = 2 and χD = 2

imply that the shopping-time functions for currency and deposits introduced in (2) are both

quadratic. The setting ρx = 0.75, meanwhile, implies that the financial-sector cost shock is

more persistent than the shock to the growth rate of the monetary base, but less persistent

than the shock to productivity.

Results

          Figures 3 - 5 display, respectively, the impulse responses of four of the model’s

variables -- output growth, monetary base growth, Divisia M1-plus growth, and the growth

rate of the Divisia M1-plus price dual -- to each of the model’s three shocks: To

productivity, to the cost of creating deposits, and to the growth rate of the monetary base.

          In this flexible-price monetary model, as in the basic real business cycle model,

productivity shocks represent the dominant source of output fluctuations. A positive

technology shock (zt ) permanently increases the level of output; hence, in figure 3, it




                                                12
temporarily increases the growth rate of output. Under the simple monetary policy rule

described by (9), the monetary base is an exogenous variable; hence, it does not respond at

all to the productivity shock. Nevertheless, the positive technology shock and the resulting

increase in output lead to an endogenous rise in the deposit-currency ratio, causing the

growth rate of Divisia M1-plus to increase endogenously as well. Therefore, a positive

correlation between the growth rates of output and the Divisia monetary aggregates

emerges from this model, even in the case where productivity shocks are the sole force

driving business cycle dynamics. The nominal interest rate movements set off by the

productivity shock lead to an increase in the user costs of both currency and deposits, also

leading to a rise in the Divisia M1-plus price dual.

       The financial-sector cost shock (xt ) represents the model’s closest analog to the

innovation in the growth rate of Divisia M1-plus price dual identified earlier in the US data.

Just as in the data, this shock generates a decline in output growth. Remarkably, the 0.18

percentage-point decline in output growth for the model, shown in figure 4, coincides

almost exactly with the decline in output growth in the data, shown in figure 2.

       In this flexible-price model, which includes none of the traditional Keynesian or

monetarist sources of monetary nonneutrality, shocks to the rate of monetary base growth

µt affect real variables through inflation-tax effects alone. Hence, in figure 5, the shock to

monetary base leads to a small decline in output growth. Growth in Divisia M1-plus

increases, reflecting the increase in currency, reserves, and deposits facilitated by the

policy-induced increase in the monetary base. Once again, interest rate movements

following the policy shock cause the Divisia M1-plus price dual to rise.

       Overall, these impulse responses give rise to the impression that, while the model

produces little or no correlation between the exogenous growth rate of the monetary base

and the growth rate of output, it does show a positive correlation between the endogenous

growth rate of the Divisia M1 monetary aggregate and the growth rate of output. In the

model, in fact, the correlation between monetary base growth and output growth is -0.0116;



                                               13
the correlation between Divisia M1-plus growth and output growth is 0.2175. Moreover,

the impulse responses from the model and the data suggest that large changes in the real

value of the Divisia M1-plus price dual play a key role in generating this endogenous

money-output relationship.

Conclusions

       While most macroeconomic models incorporate a link between changes in the

nominal quantity of money and aggregate fluctuations, real business cycle models

emphasize the role of price changes on spending and production decisions. Empirical

evaluation of this role has been difficult, however, because it has not been clear how the

effects of monetary policy actions could be summarized in a single price variable, especially

if the rate of interest is viewed as the price of credit rather than the price of money. This

paper offers a solution to the measurement problem by introduction of the economic price

dual to the monetary quantity aggregate. Evaluation of this measure’s impact on output

growth indicates that it exerts a stronger influence than that of the monetary base and, in

particular, that increases in the own-price of money are associated with declines in output.

Moreover, the results indicate that the Divisia price dual contains more information than

that of the simple sum measure.

1   Although some might regard the policy stance index of Boschen and Mills (1995) as being

representative of this concept, it is arbitrary in its construction and does not focus directly

on a single real concept, such as reserve requirements. Also see Kydland and Prescott

(1990) for another study motivated by the idea that variables other than the nominal

quantity of money are primarily responsible for fluctuations in real activity.

2     Moreover, such an index does not internalize pure substitution effects such that the

index value may change even though the value of the monetary service flow from a stock of

money holdings is unchanged.

3    This result offers a well-defined and unique answer to the long-standing debate about

the relative merits of short- v. long-term interest rates as a measure of the own price of

money in money demand functions: It is neither because aggregation theory requires that

the own-price measure must be the price dual to the quantity aggregate. Long- or short-

term interest rates more generally are regarded correctly in this function as prices of

substitute or complementary assets that can shift the demand for money, rather than a

price variable that represents movements along the demand curve's length. This implies

that most empirical demand for money functions have been mis-specified in the sense of

omitting a proper measure of money’s own price and not being able to identify a movement

along the curve’s length from a shift in the demand curve’s position.

4    While it is true that the asset with lowest user cost also will be that earning the highest

rate of return, the nonlinear transformation in the user cost formula does not permit simply

using maximum rates of return.

5   Goldfeld (1987, p. 135) intuited as much when he pointed out that:

        “Measuring this implicit rate of return is no easy matter. Matters are considerably
more complicated when broader definitions of money are used and some components of
money bear explicit interest, especially when there are several components each carrying a
different rate of return. The aggregate own rate of return would then be a complex function
of interest rates, shares, and elasticities of each of the components.”



                                               22
6   In principle, the benchmark rate of return would be the return on a completely illiquid

asset with the example being the return on human capital in a world without slavery. As a

matter of practice, the benchmark rate has been the maximum own-rate among the assets

in the aggregate at time t. An explanation for this choice is offered in Barnett, et al. (1992).

7   Notice that the Divisia index formula is not self-dual because (Xt,Pt) are not a dual pair;

this result was reported by Theil (1967) and occurs because the weights in a Divisia index

are average expenditure shares across two periods. This result is analogous to the fact that

if one uses the Laspeyres index for a quantity index, then one should not use the Laspeyres

price index with it, but rather the Paasche price index, which is the dual to the Laspeyres.

So (Laspeyres, Paasche) are dual pairs, but (Laspeyres, Laspeyres) and (Paasche,Paasche)

are not dual pairs for (quantity, price). So neither Laspeyres nor Paasche indexes are self-

dual. But in the case of the Tornqvist approximation to Divisia, P*t is very close to Pt and Xt

is very close to X*t. With the errors between the two formulae for quantity (or the two

quantities for price) of a third order magnitude in the changes, studies still use a Divisia

index both for quantity and for price and ignore the tiny violation of Fisher’s factor reversal

test. The Fisher ideal index is self dual, but the Fisher ideal along with all other index

numbers in Diewert’s superlative class are equal to each other to within the roundoff error

of the component data, and the Tornqvist approximation has its own advantages.

8   This asset collection has been shown by Belongia (2001) and Swofford and Whitney

(1987) to be a weakly-separable asset group that meets a sufficient condition for

aggregation. More generally, however, aggregating over an admissible asset grouping (i.e., a

collection of monetary assets that is weakly separable from other assets and goods) is

critical to any evaluation of index numbers. For example, the continued use of simple sum

M2 has been defended because it appears to have a stable demand function. The M2 asset

collection, however, is not weakly separable and, as such, fails to satisfy a basic condition

for any economic aggregate; specifically, the results in Belongia (2001) for the U.S.,




                                               23
Germany and Japan, indicate that the inclusion of time deposits in a monetary aggregate is

responsible for the violation of separability conditions. Moreover, as Barnett and Zhou

(1994) have discussed, the inherent instability of simple sum aggregates has led to a

continual broadening in their coverage to induce, for some unknown length of time, the

artificial and illusory stability that can be associated with aggregating over wider ranges of

objects. That is to say, they predict that simple sum M3 eventually will be become the

choice for empirical studies once simple sum M2 begins to show instability.
