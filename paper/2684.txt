              INVESTOR BEHAVIOR IN THE OCTOBER 1987 STOCK MARKET CRASH:
                                  THE CASE OF JAPAN


                                           ABSTRACT



        In a questionnaire    survey we asked Japanese institutional      investors to

recall what they thought and did during the worldwide stock market crash in

October, 1987.       The results confirm that the drop in U.     S.   stock prices was

the primary factor on their minds, and other news stories in the United

States dominated Japanese news stories.          A comparison with an earlier survey

of U.    5.   institutional   investors   at the time of the crash (Shiller [1987])

shows a remarkable similarity between Japanese and U. S. institutional

investors     in a number of attitudinal and behavioral dimensions.         The results

suggest that events in the United States were the proximate cause of the

crash in Japan, but that the tranamiasion mechanism of the crash was very

similar in both countries.

        The main shortcomings of the present survey are that it was undertaken

four months after the crash and that the sample size is only 52.             We think,

however, that in an event ao dramatic as the biggest stock market crash in

history, memories will still he sufficiently fresh that the responses will

be useful.      Moreover, a sample size of 52 is large enough to produce

reasonably small standard errors on estimated proportions
                                                                    -
                                                                        generally   in the

4 percentage point to 7 percentage point range; small enough to permit us to

make some broad conclusions.

Timins of Events

        The Tokyo Stock Exchange (Tokyo SE) closes each day before the New York

Stock Exchange (NYSE) opena.        Thus, the Japanese market could not react to

the   13.   5. crash   on Monday October 19 until Tuesdsy October 20.      For this

reason, October 20 was aubatituted in Japan for October 19 on questions

asked of U. S. investors in Shiller (1987].

        To get a rough ides of the relative stock movements of the NYSE and Tokyo

SE around the craah, we plot the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Nikkei

Average Tuesday September 1 through Wednesday December 23 in Figure            l.     We

can see from the figure that while the decline of stock prices on the NYSE

began Monday October 5, the Tokyo SE did not show any drop until Monday

October 19, and then only a relatively small one.        The New York Stock

Exchange experienced a 10.8% drop between Monday October        5    and Thursday

October 15, but the Tokyo SE did not respond to it.         Thua, the market

decline in Japan essentially began on Tuesday October 20, the date we

singled out in the survey questions.



     3The Nikkei average is based on an arithmetic average of prices of 225
stocks. The Nikkei average is commonly called the "Nikkei Dow Jones."

News Stories

     In order to find what news the Japanese investors reacted to, we selected

a list of news stories and asked respondents to rate their importance, as

they remember judging it on October 20, 1987,         on a one to seven scale (one

completely unimportant, seven very important).         The respondents were told

'Please tell how important     y   then thought these were, and not how others

thought about them."

     The news items are shown in Table 2.         They may be classified into four

categories:    1) news about the Japanese stock price movement, 2) news about

the U. S. stock price movement,      3) other    news of Jspsn, and 4) other news

of the U. S.

     What the Japmnese investors thought most important was the news of the           -




crash of   New York Stock Exchange on October 19.       Fully 87% of the

respondents rated this "very important"; the sverage of the snswers is

6.727.     The drop in the morning October 20 in Tokyo SE comes next. 65% of

the respondents answered that this wss "very important" (the average of the

answers is 6.266).

     The other items were rated lower.          Jspsnese investors thought that the

price drops of the preceding week in the NYSE were more important than the

slight drop in Tokyo Stock Exchange on October 19.         The   aversges of the

answers to the news of "Drop in the New York and other Stock Prices that

preceded October 19"       is 5.257, while the news of Drop in the Tokyo SE on

October 19"    is 4.608.    On the contrsry,      (or similarly?) the U.S. investors

rsted the drops of their own     market   more important than that of the foreign


                                                             -
                                            3
market   (   5.235 vs. 4.776).   This is reasonable since the Tokyo SE did not

show any decline in the preceding week except the 2.3% drop on October 19.

     Comparing     the news of the U.S. and Japan, Japanese investors rated the

former higher than the latter. For example, "The news that Takesita was

nominated as the new president of Liberal Democratic Party on October 20"

was rated lower than the news of "U.S. attack on Iranian oil station October

19" (2.434 vs. 3.317).

     Interestingly, the news on the U. S. economy were rated higher by the

Japanese investors than by the U. S. investors.      For example, the news of

the U.S. trade deficits, the rise of prime rate and U.S. treasury bill

yields, and Treasury Secretary Baker's suggestion on the exchange rate were

rsted more than five on average by Japanese investors, while U.S. investors

rated most of them around four.      Moreover many of the U.S. economic news

stories were raced higher than the news of the stock prices of the preceding

week by the Japanese investors.

     We asked a question that "Did you think the crash would influence the

Japanese market?"4      Of our respondents, 98.2% answered that they thought

then that Japanese stock prices would go down.       Only 1.8% (one person)

thought that the drop of Tokyo Stock Exchange would be larger than that of

NYSE. This also seems to support the notion that the Japanese stock market

crash was caused by the United States crash.

     Two interpretations     are possible to these results.   One is to regard them

as general features of the Japanese investors and to suppose that the Tokyo


     4This question immediately followed a question asking the date and time
when respondents first heard of the crash on the NYSE. All but two of the
resondents had heard by 8:00 a. m. JST. Thus, in context, this question
may be interpreted as asking for the opinion the respondent held before the
crash in the Tokyo market.

                                          4
SE is dependent on the NYSE.   Considering thst Tokyo SE by some measures is

now about as large as NYSE, however, the unidirectional causation is hard to

believe.

     The other interpretation is to regard the dependency of Tokyo SE on the

NYSE as specific to the current crash.       A stock market crash is apparently a

unique event in investors minds, not just a bigger version of smaller price

movements.   The reasons the event occurred in the U.S. in the United States

are not clear, though the conclusion in Shiller [1987]         was that a self-

amplifying sequence of reactions to price declines played a role; the

reaction each day to price declinea of the previous day, starting the

previous week.   The crash in the Tokyo SE seemed to have no apparent toots

in their own economy, and there were no significant price declines in Japan

the preceding week.    This may explain why the Japanese investors rated the

news in the U.S. very high in the survey.        However, the latter

interpretation   does not requite that this is always true.         If a crash

happens autonomously in Japan and spreads to the NYSE, the U.S. investors

would rate the news in Japan very high.



Attitude and Behavior Comparisons   -   U.   S. and Japan


     In the previous survey of U. S. institutional investors (Shiller [1987])

it was concluded that important factors in the crash were investors'

impressions of the psychology of other investors.           The theory moat common

among investors was that investors had caused the market to be overpriced

and vulnerable to a panic, much like the one that occurred in the United

States in October 1929.

     Respondents were asked    "Which of the following better describes your
 theory about the detline: a theory about investor psychology,         [or]   a theory

 about     fundamentals such as profits or interest rates?" (See Table 3 for

 questions discussed in this section.)         Of Japanese investors, 22.2% chose

 investor psychology.       This is even higher than the percent answering yea

 Song U.     5;   institutional investors (64.0%).

         Of the Japanese respondents, 83.6% answered that they thought just before

 the crash that the market was overpriced relative to fundamental values.

This is very close to the result with the U.S. institutional investor, where

 84.3% said they thought the market overpriced.        Apparently   the average

 institutional investor in both Japan and the United States
                                                            thought that

Qthx      investors were too optimistic about share values.     This is consistent
with the result that only 29.1% of the Japanese respondents and 22.2% of the

U. S. respondents thought that they were bullish and optimiatit relative to

the other investors.

         Japanese investors were remarkably similar in their willingnesa to admit

that they had experienced "contagion of fear" on the day of the crash. Of

Japanese investors, 41.8% said yea, of U. S. investors, 41.3% said yea.             The

question "Roughly how many people did you talk to about the atock market on

[the day of the crash]?" also yielded similar numbers in the both countries

(Japan 15.4 vs. U.S.19.?).       Thus, the interpersonal communication    that is

necessary     for contagion of fear was present in roughly equal amounts in both

•tountries.       Interestingly about 20% of the respondents in Japan said they

thought or talked about the events of 1929 (which are most likely to he U.

S.   and not Japanese events) in the few days before the crash; the number is

even higher than that of the U.S. institutional investors, which is 53.2%.

      We asked investors directly about anxiety levels as expressed by explicit


                                           6
symptoms.     Anxiety levels in Japan were comparatively low the week before
the crash and over the weekend before the crash, as one might expect
                                                                     given

the absence of major stock price movements in Japan then.       On October 20

anxiety levels in Japan were fully comparable to those described by U. S.

investors.     Japanese investors were somewhat less confident of their ability
to predict when a rebound would occur than were    U. S.   investors.

        Only around 11% of the Japanese investors had a policy of limiting bases
at the point of October 20.     This number is quite similar to that in the

U.S..     While portfolio insurance appears to be very important in the United

States, the overall impact of all loss-limiting policies appears to be

roughly equally important in the two countries.

        Respondents were also aaked whether they had abandoned a policy of

investing for the long term just before the crash: 10.9% of the Japanese

investors answered yes.     The number is not significantly different from that

of the U.S. institutional     investors (6.6%).



Interpretation   and Conjectures

     What is most striking in the survey data of the Japanese institutional

investors is that the answers are very similar to those of the U.S. insti-

tutional investors.5    The comparisons of the U. S. and Japan at the time of

the market crash show that there are today not
                                               only world markets: there is
also a world market culture: patterns of behavior, outlook and communica-

tions, that transcends national boundaries.

     We think that it is a strong suggestion of these results that the


     51n fact, according to the surveys, we can say that the U.S.
institutional investors are closer in behavior to the Japanese institutional
investors than they are to the U.S. individual investors.
proximate        tause of the crash came from the United States.     A scenario of the

Tokyo SE on October 20 may be as follows:           Investors anticipated that a

                                                                      and heard
    sharp drop would occur in Tokyo SE on October 20 when they got up

    the news of the crash of NYSE, and focused on the movement of the stock

    price in the morning.     The big question on their minds that morning was

    about Japanese investor pyschology: how investors in the Japanese market

    would react to the U.    S. stock   market crash.   Considerable anxious

    interpersonal communications on this issue took place among Japanese

    institutional    investors that day.

         What is interesting is that the Tokyo market did not respond to the

    decline of NYSE in the preceding weeks, although the decline was not small

    compared with the declines in previous history (394 points for two weeks)
    Perhaps the channel of the contagion across national boundaries of a market

    decline is in operation only when it becomes of considerable size.6

         In Tsutsui [1988] it was found that Cranger causality tests with nine

    lags between the NYSE (Dow Jones Industrial Average) and the Tokyo SE

    (Nikkei Average) in nominal terms showed strong evidence of bidirectional

    causality with daily data April 1, 1985 to October 13, 1987.        The evidence

    for causality was stronger from the NYSE to the Tokyo SE than in the reverse

    direction.     When the sample was shortened to April 1    1.985 to October 13,


    1987 (excluding the crash) there is still evidence of bidirectional

•
    causality, though now causality from the Tokyo SE to the NYSE was only just

    significant at the 5% level.




         6lnstitutional investor behavior on ordinary days may show less active
    communications and less concern with market psychology; see Pound and
    Shiller [19871.
