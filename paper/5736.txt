                                             ABSTRACT



         This paper examines whether sponsors of traditional defined benefit (DB) plans are replacing

them with 401 (k) or other defined contribution (DC) plans. I compare pension plan offerings by

sponsors of a DB plan in 1985 with their offerings in 1992 using Form 5500 filings from those two

years.   I find that 401(k) and other DC plans are substituting     for terminated DB plans and that

offering a DC plan of any type increases the probability of a DB termination.     Thus, it appears that,

at the sponsor level, many of the new 401(k) plans may not be avenues for net saving but are

replacements for the more traditional pension forms.

         Using several specifications, I estimate that a sponsor that starts with no 401 (k) or other DC

plan and adds a 401(k) is predicted to reduce the number of DB plans offered by at least 0.3. That

is, the estimates imply that one sponsor terminates a DB plan for about every three sponsors that

offer one new 401 (k) plan. The addition of a non-40 1(k) DC plan is estimated to reduce DB plan

offerings by at least 0.4.

         Plan-level   point estimates indicate that if a 401 (k) plan is added by a sponsor, the DB

termination probability increases by about 18 percentage pointsto35     percent. The addition of a non-

401(k) DC plan similarly increases the probability that an accompanying DB plan will be terminated.

1.   INTRODUCTION

       Traditionally,    the primary form of an employer-provided   pension has been

defined benefit,      In a defined benefit plan, retirement payments are described

by a formula based on salary and years of service and are funded by employer

contributions .     The benefit is guaranteed in nominal terms and the employer

bears all investment risk,      A defined contribution plan, in contrast,

establishes an account for each participant with retirement benefits

determined solely by the contributions     to the account and the investment

return.    Prior to 1978, only employers could make pre-tax contributions      to

defined contribution plans.      But, with the advent of the 401(k) plan, the

ability to make pre-tax contributions was extended to plan participants.1

       While 401(k)s plans are provided by an employer, they have become the

leading form of tax-deferred retirement saving for individuals.        In 1992,

401(k) contributions     totaled $64.3 billion, about 24 percent of personal

saving.2   During the heyday of the Individual Retirement Account (IRA) from

1982 to 1986, annual IRA contributions averaged only $34 billion, and have

fallen substantially     since the Tax Reform Act of 1986.   Recent research has

focused on whether individual 401(k) contributions     represent net saving

(Engenp Gale, and Scholz (1994), and Poterba, Venti, and Wise (1995)).         Work

in this area focuses on the potential substitution between individual

contributions   and an expanding list of personal financial assets --

conventional    liquid assets, IRA contributions, and housing equity, for




     lThe 401(k) plan was first authorized in 1978, but came into use after the
Internal Revenue Senice   issued clarifying regulations in 1981.

        example.   Yet, despite concern in the popular press about defined benefit plan

        phase out in favor of defined contribution plans (see Newsweek, 1993, for

        example) the important substitution potential at the employer level has

        received little attention.     Employers may view the 401(k) plan as an

        opportunity   to reduce their pension costs since participation     in 401(k) plans

        is voluntary.

              Contributions    to 401(k) plans are not only a significant fraction of

        personal saving, but.now play an increasing role in pension saving.        In 1985,

        401(k) contributions   totaled $16.3 billion, about 18 percent of all pension

        contributions.   By 1992, 401(k) contributions had risen to $64.3 billion, and

        comprised almost 50 percent of all pension contributions    (see the Department

        of Labor, 1996, Tables E14 and E23).    This paper explores whether this shift

        in relative importance is due in part to changing forms of employer pensions.

        Evidence of plan substitution on the part of the employer would raise a

        cautionary flag about the degree to which the growth in 401(k) plans and

        assets are net saving.

              Despite uncertain effects on net saving, the concept of the individual

        saving plan as employer-provided    pension continues to be popular.     Recent

        legislation creates a variation on the 401(k) plan for small business with

        fewer anti-discrimination    requirements called the SIMPLE plan:     Savings

        Incentive Match Plan for Employees.     Employees contribute the minimum of up to

        three percent of salary or $6,000 per year.     Employers are required to match

        the contribution, but ❑ay temporarily drop their match rate to one percent in

        unprofitable years.     Clearly, it is important to resolve the effects of these

        tax-deferred saving plans on net saving both on the part of individuals as

        well as their employers.

         To examine sponsor behavior,     I construct a panel of firms that sponsor

at least one defined benefit plan in 1985 and compare their pension offerings

in 1985 to offerings in 1992 accounting for changes in their 401(k) or other

defined contribution plan status.         I use a panel of defined benefit plans over

the same period to estimate termination probabilities.         Of secondary interest

is the extent of the (primarily) administrative        substitution of 401(k) for

other defined contribution plans.        Many of the early 401(k) plans are commonly

thought to be converted defined contribution plans (thrift or profit-sharing)

that did not have the pre-tax participant-contribution         feature.

         The next section provides of brief description of 401(k) plans and

compares them to the    ❑ ore    traditional pension forms.   Section 3 summarizes

existing evidence on the substitution possibilities between defined benefit

and 401(k) plans.     Section 4 describes the data to be used and Section 5

presents econometric evidence at both the sponsor and defined benefit plan

level.     Section 6 concludes.



2,   BACKGROUND

         Employer-sponsored     pre-tax saving plans, often called 401(k) plans,

differ from traditional employer-sponsored        retirement plans in that eligible

employees are permitted to ❑ake pre-tax contributions         to the plan.   Most

employers match the contributions        (typically with a match rate of 50 percent

up to six percent of compensation).         The return on the contributions accrues

tax-free and taxes are paid at withdrawal.         Following the Tax Reform Act of

1986, the employee contribution        limit is set at $7,000, indexed for inflation.

The contribution    limit is $9,235 for the 1995 tax year.       Because the saving is

tax-favored, the Internal Revenue Service imposes contribution limits, and


                                             3
restricts participant access to the funds,        The plan must pass certain

nondiscrimination    tests to remain tax-qualified.3

         With the matching provision, a higher contribution limit, and no

adjusted gross income phase-out of deductibility, 401(k) plans have a greater

potential for pre-tax saving than do Individual Retirement Accounts          (IRA).

But, unlike an IRA, a 401(k) plan is available only through employers.           They

are now widely offered by employers.     The percentage of employees with an

employer who sponsors a 401(k) plan increased from 26.9 percent in 1988 to

36.8 percent in 1993.     The fraction of participating workers rose from 57.0

percent to 64,6 percent.4

         It is not surprising that both employees and employers would prefer

plans with a 401(k) option to the other types of defined contribution           (DC)

plans.     Employees receive tax-deferred saving and a high instant return if the

employer matches even a fraction of their contribution.         Employers may find

401(k) plans a cost-effective way to offer pension benefits         to workers with

different preferences.     The employer need only make a contribution        (if they

match) for workers who have already ❑ade a contribution.         Indeed, Even and

McPherson     (1993) find that the probability of an employee participating in a

pension plan offered by a firm is lower if the primary plan is a 401(k).               It

is commonly understood    that many thrift or saving DC plans without the pre-tax

contribution    feature were terminated and replaced by a similar 401(k) plan.

The extent of this DC conversion is addressed below.

         The substitution of a 401(k) type of DC plan for a defined benefit (DB)

plan is of more interest.    Since the plans differ fundamentally   in terms of

investment risk and portability,   swirching from a DB to a DC plan with 401(k)

features implies significant changes in the nature of pension benefits.s

Andrews (1992) documents that most of the 401(k) plans that were created in

the early 1980s supplemented an already existing DB plan.    While it would not

be surprising to see DBs terminated by closing firms and 401(k)s created by

new firms, a priori, one would expect little replacement of a DB plan by a

401(k) in ongoing firms.    In fact, this supposition is confirmed by evidence

from the early 1980s, as reviewed in the next section.



3.   EXISTING EVIDENCE

       Two strands of literature address, either directly or indirectly,

substitution between types of pension plans.    The first research arose from

concern about wide-spread DB terminations during the mid-1970s      to ❑id-1980s,

and documents broad economy-wide shifts in the shares of employees covered by

types of plans but does not link shifts to changes in plan offerings.

       Gustman and Steinmeier   (1992) analyze the role of unions, firm size, and

industry composition using repeated cross sections from Form 5500 filings.

They find that these factors could account for at most half of the decline in

primary DB coverage from 1977 to 1985 (from 89.7 percent in 1977 to 79.3

percent in 1985).

       Clark and McDermed   (1990) estimate that only 3,1 of the 15 percentage

point decline in the proportion of DB coverage between 1979 and 1983 can be

explained by changes in the size distribution of firms and industrial



     5The behavioral effects of the DB form of pension benefits has been widely
studied. See Gustman and Steinmeier (1995) and Turner (1993) for analysis.

                                         5
composition.     Using the 1979 and 1983 Current Population Survey supplements on

pension coverage and the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances, they conclude that

demographic , employer size, and broad industry and occupation variables

explain none of the coverage decline.       They speculate that pension regulation

could be responsible for the increased use of DC plans.

      Petersen (1992) examines DB terminations without directly addressing the

shift to DC plans.      He finds that financial factors play a strong role in the

decision to terminate overfunded DB plans (greater needs for cash and higher

costs in obtaining external capital increase the risk of termination and a

reversion of assets).

      The issue of plan t~e       substitution is raised with sponsors directly in

a recent survey by Papke, Petersen, and Poterba (.1996). They find that only

one (albeit large) sponsor in their small sample of 43 plans reports a DB

termination as a result of 401(k) plan introduction between 1986 and 1990.

However, there is evidence of widespread DC conversion,      that is, replacement

of a thrift/saving or profit-sharing      plan with a plan with 401(k) features.

Forty-five percent of responding firms, representing 37 percent of 401(k)

participants    in the survey, indicate that another pension plan was converted

to the 401(k).      fie survey responses indicate that 401(k) plans typically

supplement a preexisting DB plan (63 percent) or DC plan (19 percent).

      The   ❑ ost   complete analysis of substitution between DB and DC plans is by

Kruse (1995), in which he tabulates participation and assets for the entire

pension sector.      He ❑atches sponsors using Form 5500 data from 1980 and 1986

to study adoptions and terminations of different types of plans, and estimates

the number of employees involved.       For each type of plan, he tabulates

participant counts for companies that adopt, maintain, or terminate a plan


                                           6
(plan categories are DB, All DC, Profit sharing, and Employee Stock Option

Plans) over this period.

        Kruse’s key conclusions         in the current context are the following:     (1)

Very little of the growth in DC participants came from companies that

terminated DB plans, with       ❑ ost   growth coming from companies with no change in

DB status; (2)    The largest declines in DB participation came from companies

that had no change in DB or DC status; (3) Employee Stock Option Plans (ESOPS,

a type of DC plan) tend to supplement rather than replace DB plans.            Kruse

documents a total of 7.2 million 401(k) participants as of 1986 (out of a

total of almost 33 million DC participants), but 401(k) data are not available

for 1980 and he is unable to isolate the effect of the adoption of 401(k)s on

other plan offerings or participant counts.

        These findings are reflected in the aggregate data presented in Table 1.

The pension sector over the first half of the 1980s is broadly characterized

by a stable number of net DB plans, and a net increase in the number of and

participation    in DC plans.     While the number of large single employer DC plans

(with 100 or more participants)           rises from 12,978 to 25,713 over this period,

net DB plans are virtually unchanged           (22,424 in 1980 and 22,426 in 1986).

        However, the aggregate data from the latter half of the 1980s and early

1990s suggest a need to re-examine the issue of substitution of DC for DB

plans     Two changes in particular are noteworthy.          First, the net number of DB

plans falls dramatically.        From 1985 to 1992, the number of large DB plans

(over 100 participants)    falls 25 percent (from 22,619 to 17,019) while the

number of DC plans increases about 64 percent (from 23,279 co 38,283).              If

single employer plans of all sizes are considered, the DB total falls from

167,911 in 1985 to 86,797 in 1992, and the number of single employer DC plans


                                                7
increases from 461,158 to 618,429 in 1992.     Changes in the number of active

participants ❑irror these movements.6

      Second, as Table 1 illustrates, adoption of 401(k) plans escalates over

this period.     The availability of 401(k) plans rises from 29,869 in 1985 to

139,704 in 1992.     The number of active participants   (who ❑ay also participate

in other plans) more than doubles (from 10.3 million in 1985 to 22.4 ❑illion

in 1992).   Assets rise from $lh3,9 billion to $552.9 billion over this period

(see the U.S. Department of Labor, 1996, Table E23.)

      Papke (1994) uses some preliminary Form 5500 data from the second half

of the 1980s to estimate the effect of 401(k) introduction on the

characteristics    of 3,406 companion defined benefit plans.    Using a difference-

of differences methodology,    she compares changes in defined benefit

participation,    funding, and the intention to terminate the existing single DB

plan, between 1985 and 1991 for plans whose sponsors introduced a 401(k) plan

over this period and for plans whose sponsors did not.

      Papke finds no evidence that the introduction of a 401(k) plan affects

defined benefit plans offered by larger sponsors (those with over 200

employees) .    However, it appears that the smaller sponsors do reduce

participation    and funding, and are more likely to indicate they intend to

terminate their defined benefit plan, once a 401(k) plan is introduced.

      This paper extends this work in a number of ways.        First, the 1985

sample is extended to sponsors of multiple DB plans with at least 100



     ‘Between 1980 and 1985, the active participant count in the larger DB plans
is relatively stable (21.9 million in 1980 to 21.4 million in 1985), while DC
participation increases from 14.8 million to 27.7 ❑illion.     But from 1985 to
1992, active participation in DB plans falls from 21.6 million to 19.8 ❑illion,
and participation rises in DC plans from 27 million to 29.5 ❑illion. The story
is similar if all sizes of single employer plans are considered.

                                          8
participants     so the menu of DB offerings can be examined,   Second, the

previous analysis is limited to DB plans that are ❑aintained over the period

so it ❑isses DB plans that are terminated between 1985 and 1991.          In contrast,

this analysis tracks sponsors of DB plans functioning in 1985.          The initial DB

plan(s) and all related plans are tracked between 1985 and 1992.          I note

termination of the original DB plan over the period as well as the reported

intention to terminate in the 1992 filing.      Third, this paper examines the

effect of changes in both the number of 401(k) and non-401(k) DC offerings on

the sponsor’s DB plan.       Finally, I estimate the extent of conversion of non-

401(k) DC plans to 401(k) plans.      This paper focuses on ongoing sponsors who

originally offered a DB plan in 1985, and does not address economy-wide shifts

in types of pension coverage.

        To summarize, this paper poses two t~es     of questions.    The first

concerns the menu of plans offered by the sponsor.       How do the sponsor’s

401(k) or other DC plan offerings affect their DB plan(s)?          In particular,

does the introduction of a new 401(k) plan affect DB offerings by that

sponsor?       What is the extent of DC conversion into 401(k) plans?     I use a

panel of plan sponsors to address these questions.       Second, at the plan level,

how does a 401(k) plan affect the termination probability of the accompanying

DB plan?       This question is analyzed with a panel of DB plans for those same

sponsors.       The next section describes the data used to analyze these issues.



4.    SAMPLE CONSTRUCTION

         I use data from the 1985 and 1992 Form 5500 filings available from the

Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration      of the U.S. Department of Labor to

construct two panels.       A Form 5500 is filed annually with the Internal Revenue


                                           9
Senice        by all sponsors of pension plans with 100 or more participants.     Each

plan’s report includes information on plan eligibility, participation,

employment, administrative       cost, distributions, and contributions.

         I begin with a sample of all single employer sponsors of DB plans in

1985.    Using the Employer Identification Number (EIN) of the sponsor to

identify companion plans, I note the number and type of accompanying 401(k)

and other DC plans for those sponsors and plan characteristics       of interest --

participation,       eligibility, assets, and coverage.

         To construct the panel of sponsors, I match the 1985 list of DB sponsors

by EIN to all plan reports by those sponsors in the 1992 Form 5500 filings,

the   ❑ ost    recent year for which the Form 5500 data are available.     I summarize

the information on the sponsor’s DB plans, and accompanying 401(k) and other

DC plans.        If a DB plan does not appear in the final 1992 filings but its

sponsor files a form for other plan(s), the DB plan is considered to be

terminated.        A DB plan is also considered terminated if the 1992 filing

indicates the plan has been terminated (but the sponsor is required to file

until all assets are distributed) or indicates that a resolution to terminate

the plan has been filed.

         To construct the panel of DB plans, I match the DB plans of the sponsors

in 1985 to their reports in 1992, again summarizing accompanying DC plan

information.        While the sponsors must be ongoing in 1992 to enter the sample,

the DB plan need not be.        That is, as in the panel of sponsors, if a sponsor

files for other plans in 1992 but not for the original DB plan, the DB plan is

considered to be terminated.’        If the sponsor does not file any Form 5500 in


     ‘The absence of a DB plan from the 1992 Form 5500 data when the sponsor has
filed for other plans likely indicates a plan termination, but could result from
a plan merger that changes the plan number, (about three percent of plans

                                            10
1992, the DB plan is dropped from the sample since either the sponsor has

ceased operation over this period or there has been a filing error.

      Since some sponsors offer      ❑ ore    than one DC plan -- a 401(k) and an ESop,

for example -- it is important to clarify how some of the accompanying DC plan

characteristics    are summarized.     The Form 5500 data include     ❑ easures   of plan

participation,    but it is not possible to determine how many employees

participate   in more than one plan offered by their employer.         It is generally

understood that employees participate          in only one DB plan, but participation

in an accompanying DC plan, or in more than one DC plan is possible.

Therefore, when appropriate, I sum characteristics          across all accompanying

401(k) or other DC plans to create the characteristics          of the accompanying

plans for the sponsor or for the DB plan.

      To summarize the construction of the panels, sponsors of a DB plan in

1985 are ❑atched to their 1992 reports along with accompanying 401(k) and DC

plan information.    To construct the panel of plans, each DB plan is ❑atched to

its 1992 record, if available.       A DB plan is considered to be terminated if

the sponsor indicates the plan has been terminated or a resolution to

terminate the plan has been filed.           In addition, if the 1985 DB plan has no

match in 1992, but the sponsor reports other plans, the original 1985 DB plan

is presumed to have been terminated over the period.           Descriptive statistics

for the two years of data are presented below.



      A.   The 1985 Sample



indicate an intention to merge in 1985), or a filing error. Because these two
alternatives are not obviously correlated with 401(k) introduction, it is not
clear what the direction of the bias, if any, would be. I thank Dan Beller for
useful discussions on this issue.

                                               11
        The initial      1985 sample consists of 16,597 DB plans corresponding        to

11,950 distinct sponsors (the plan’s sponsors have different EINs -- the terms

sponsor and employer will be used interchangeably here).            Eighty-three percent

of employers offer one DB plan, 10 43 percent offer two DB plans, and 2.86

percent offer three DB plans.        The remaining 3.55 percent of employers in the

sample offer    ❑ ore   than three DB plans.

      Of the 11,950 employers, 1,586 (13.27 percent) offer one 401(k) plan in

addition to their DB.plan in 1985,        A non-401(k) defined contribution plan

(hereafter, a DC plan) is offered by 17.21 percent of these employers;           ❑ ost   of

these (82.63 percent) offered only one DC plan.

      Table 2 displays the summary statistics for the 1985 sample of DB plans.

While later regression analysis uses only changes in plan status and

participation    data, other characteristics        of interest are summarized as well.

Both means and medians are presented since the largest plans dominate the

means of some characteristics.        Two measures of participation are reported.

The first, a response to question 7a4 on the 1985 Form 5500 (“Total number of

active participants at the end of the plan year”) indicates an average active

participant count of 587, and a median of 211.            The second measure reported in

response to question 17h (“Information about employees of employer at end of

the plan year:      Employees participating”)        indicates more participants on

average, 772, but a similar ❑edian, 216.

      The average participation       rate (participation divided by eligible

employees) for DB plans is virtually 100 percent, with an average coverage

rate (number of eligible employees divided by total employees) of 57 percent

(a median coverage rate of 65 percent).             Seventeen percent of DB plans in the

sample are accompanied by a 401(k) plan.            Almost nine percent of DB plans


                                               12
reporting in 1985 have been terminated or a resolution to terminate has been

filed.     The average funding ratio is 1.63 (funding calculations are available

from the author).     The average age of the DB plans is 18 years, and median

plan assets are $2.33 million      (average assets are $12.4 million).

         Table 3 reports summary statistics for the 401(k) plans that accompany

these DB plans in 1985.       No sponsor in the sample offered more than one.   Both

measures of participation      indicate that the average 401(k) plan has about 1000

participants,    although the ❑edian plan is much smaller - about 270.    The

participation    rate is 83.3 percent (using question 7a4), and the average

coverage rate 63.7 percent.       Most 401(k) plans are relatively new in 1985 ..

the average age is 2.84 years, median assets are $1.88 ❑illion (average assets

are $11.3 million), and.the calculated average match rate offered is 0.64.s



         B. The 1992 Sample

         There are two striking changes between the 1985 and 1992 samples that

parallel the aggregate data presented in Table 1.       First, over 41 percent of

the 1985 sponsors exit by 1992, accounting for over 57 percent of the 1985 DB

plans .    Second, sponsors are three times as likely to sponsor a LOl(k) in 1992

than in 1985.9

         Of the 6,974 ongoing employers from the 1985 sample who appear in the

final 1992 Form 5500 filings, 20.78 percent (1,449) offer no DB plan.       Thus,


     aThe plan’s match rate is not reported on the form. It is calculated as the
ratio of employer to employee contributions. See Papke (1995) for a discussion.

     ‘I have estimated, but do not report, linear probability ❑odels that explain
EIN attrition in 1992 based on the 1985 sponsor-level characteristics that are
available on the Form 5500. The probability of sponsor attrition is associated
negatively with the number of plans offered, the DB plan’s participation ratio,
plan assets, plan age, and positively with a higher ratio of retired or separated
participants to actives. The r-squares in the models are quite low.

                                           13
over twenty percent of the employers still reporting in 1992 drop their 1985

DB plan(s), but retain or add a DC or 401(k) plan.            The   ❑ajority,   68.30

percent of these employers       (4,763), offer one DB plan, 7.26 percent (506)

offer two DB plans, 1.82 percent (127) offer three DB plans.                The remaining

1.88 percent of employers offer more than three DB plans.

      By 1992, more employers offer an accompanying 401(k) than a DC plan.

While most offer no 401(k) plan (61.40 percent (4,282)), 33.68 percent (2,349)

offer one, and 3.87 percent       (270) offer two.      The remaining 1.08 percent offer

more than two 401(k) plans,       The fraction of employers offering at least one

non-401(k) DC plan has also increased.         Most of the employers offer no

accompanying DC plan (71,36 percent), 23.27 percent offer one, 4.24 percent

offer two, and the remaining 1.13 percent offer three or            ❑ ore   DC plans.

      Table 4 reports the summary statistics for the 1992 sample of DB plans

for ongoing sponsors.     Two   ❑ easures   of participation are reported,        The first,

reported in response to question 7a4 (as in 1985, “Total number of active

participants as of the end of the plan yearn) indicates an increase in the

average size of DB plans from 587 participants on average in 1985 to 843.                   The

median has also increased to 257 (from 211).

      The second   ❑ easure   of participation       is taken from question 21, which is

the most comparable to question 17h from 1985.            However, the set of questions

concerning employees has been expanded to include questions related to anti-

discrimination   requirements that are not applicable to DB plans.              As a result,

many fewer filings contain answers to the subparts of question 21 than to

question 17 in 1985.    The participation          subpart, question 21m, (“Enter the

number of nonexcludable       employees who benefit under the plan”) indicates that




                                              14
on average 475 employees benefit under the plan(s),l”

        Average participation   rates in DB plans have fallen relative to 1985

using either measure (to 80 or 88 percent of eligibles).          (Note that the

sample size for the rate calculation is halved due to missing values to

question 21j (“Number of nonexcludable    employees”) .    The DB coverage rate has

increased to 71 percent.    About five percent of DB plans still filing in 1992

are terminated or will be terminated.     The average funding ratio has fallen to

1.01.    (The funding ratio is expected to fall over this period due to the

funding limits in the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1987.)

        Table 5 reports the summary statistics for the 401(k) plans that

accompany a DB plan in 1992 or that are reported by an ongoing firm that

sponsored a DB in 1985.    Recall that these characteristics may be sums over

multiple 401(k) plans if more than one 401(k) plan is offered by the employer

(about five percent of the sample).     Average participation      in the 401(k)

plan(s) has risen since 1985 from 1,067 to 1,592.     The participation       rate (the

sum of all plan participants    divided by the sum of eligibles in 401(k)s) is

about the same, 81.9 percent, and the coverage rate has increased from 63.7

percent in 1985 to 70.3 in 1992.     The average match rate has fallen to 0.40

(although the median rate is about the same, 0.33), and the average maximum

match rate across plans offered by the same sponsor       iS   0.42.   Average assets

in 401(k) plans have increased from $11.3 million in 1985 to $41.7 in 1992,

and the 1992 median is $4.71 million.




     1°If Question 21k (“Do 100 percent of the nonexcludable employees entered
on line 21j benefit under the plan?”) is answered affirmatively, then question
21m is not completed on the form.    The response to question 21j (“Enter the
number of nonexcludable employees”) is substituted in the data.

5.   ECONOMETRIC ESTWTES

       As past work indicates, many factors enter into DB termination.        The

primary purpose of this paper is to estimate the role of 401(k) offerings on a

sponsor’s DB offerings.

       A.    Sponsor-level Estimates of Plan Substitution

       Table 6 presents estima~es of the effect of the change in the number of

401(k) or other DC plan offerings on the change in the number of DB plans

offered by the sponsor.      Specifying the regression equation in changes over

the two years holds constant any characteristics of the sponsor that do not

change over the period.      The (log of) the level of firm employment in 1985 is

included rather than the change in firm employment, because firm employment is

missing for 45 percent of plans in the 1992 data.11

       Estimates of the    ❑ ost   complete model are presented in column four and

indicate that both 401(k) and DC plans are substitutes for DB plans.         The

addition of a 401(k) plan over this period results in a reduction of 0.184 of

a DB plan,     In other words, a DB plan is predicted to be terminated for about

every five 401(k) plans added.        An additional non-401(k) DC plan is estimated

to result in a reduction of 0.152 of a DB plan,        after controlling for total

firm employment in 1985 and industry dummies.

       In the sample, 66.12 percent (4,611 out of 6,974) of employers do not

change the number of 401(k) plans offered, and 28,95 percent (2,019) add at

least one.     The number of net 401(k) plans added is 2,071.      Thus , the point

estimate indicates that these additional 2,071 401(k) plans are associated

with a loss of about 381 DB plans, 10.81 percent of all DB plans lost to



     llQuestions about   firm   employment  on  the   1992  form   ❑ ove           to   a
nondiscrimination tests section that is not relevant for DB plans.

                                             16
ongoing sponsors (3,526 DB plans).

        In the sample, 72.71 percent (5,033 out of 6,922) of employers do not

change their DC offerings, and 17,77 percent (1,239) add at least one,              The

net change in DC plans is 700.        The point estimate indicates that these 700

additional DC plans are associated with a loss of about 106 DB plans.

        The estimates in Table 6 require that the effect of adding a 401(k) plan

is the same (though of opposite sign) as subtracting a 401(k) plan.           The

estimates in Table 7.relax this assumption.        Three plan status dummy variables

are included for each plan t~e.         The categories are:     (1) the fiti offers at

least one new 401(k) plan over this period; (2) the firm ❑aintains the 401(k)

it had in 1985 and did not add another; (3) the firm loses the 401(k) it had

in 1985,      (No sponsor in the 1985 sample offered   ❑ ore   than one 401(k). )

Similar dummy categories are defined for non-401(k) DC plans, adjusted for the

fact that there may be multiple DC plans in 1985.        The coefficient estimates

on these dummy variables are interpreted relative to the base or omitted

category:      the firm offers no 401(k) or DC plan in 1985 or 1992.

        The effects of 401(k) and DC plan status reported in Table 7 are fairly

consistent across the models and again indicate substitution across the plan

t~es,      The r-squared of the regression indicates that almost 12 percent of

the variation in DB plan offerings by sponsors is explained by the status of

accompanying 401(k) or other DC plans (column 2).

        The   ❑ ost   complete model is presented in column four and includes the log

of firm employment in 1985 and industry dummies.         These estimates indicate

that the addition of at least one 401(k) plan reduces the number of DB plans

by 0.312 relative to a sponsor that offers no 401(k) or other DC plan.              (This

is essentially the same as adding one 401(k) plan since 85 percent of sponsors


                                             17
that add at least one add only one.)           This estimate implies that a sponsor

terminates a DB plan for about every three sponsors that offer at least one

new 401(k) plan.         Since 2,019 sponsors added at least one 401(k), this

estimate predicts a loss of 630 DB plans or almost 18 percent of the DB plans

lost to ongoing sponsors in the panel.

         Maintaining     the 401(k) offered in 1985 reduces the number of DB plans by

0.213.     In the sample, 673 sponsors maintained the 401(k) they had in 1985, so

the estimate predicts a termination of 143 DB plans.             The t-statistics for

these two effects are extremely high.           Substitution of a DB for a terminated

401(k) plan is indicated as well, but the coefficient is small and

statistically     insignificant.

         Using 1985 DB average plan characteristics         from Table 2, it is possible

to estimate the number of participants who lose their DB plan when a 401(k) is

added.     Multiplying     the number of predicted DB terminations (630) by one of

the two    ❑ easures    of participation   -- active participants or employees

participating     -- indicates that between 364,172 and 486,562 participants are

involved.     These participants represent 4.04 percent of all active

participants or 4.91 percent of all employees participating            in a DB plan in

1985.

         Non-401(k) DC plans like ESOPS or profit-sharing plans are also

estimated to be substitutes for terminated DB plans in two out of three

situations.     The estimated effects are larger than those for 401(k) plans.

The addition of a DC plan reduces the number of DB plans offered by 0.410.               If

2.4 sponsors offer at least one new DC plan, then one DB plan is predicted to

be terminated.         Since 1,239 DC plans were added, the estimate predicts a loss

of 508 DB plans to ongoing sponsors.          Maintaining   the existing DC leads to a


                                              18
termination of 0,264 of a DB plan.        But the situation is different if a DC

plan is lost.        If a sponsor loses a DC plan, it is estimated to also terminate

0.134 of a DB plan.        This ❑ay reflect Kruse’s obsemation     that ESOPS typically

supplement DB plans.        These supplementary ESOPS appear to be terminated along

with the DB plan.        These estimated effects are also highly statistically

significant.       Apparently, despite the different nature of these plans, by the

latter half of the 1980s and early 1990s, 401(k)s and other DC plans have

begun to replace DB plans.

         What is the extent of substitution between new 401(k)s and non-401(k) DC

plans?        Recall that earlier work did find evidence of conversion of DC into

401(k) plans, and this is confirmed in Tables 8 and 9.           The most complete

model (column four of Table 9) provides unambiguous evidence of substitution

for these plan types as well.        The preferred estimates in Table 9 indicate

that .241 of a DC plan is terminated for each 401(k) added.           That is, a

sponsor terminates a DC without 401(k) features for about every four 401(k)s

added.        For every 401(k) plan ❑aintained over the period,    .144 of a DC plan is

terminated.       And, a terminated 401(k) plan leads to .499 of a DC plan.




         B.     Plan-level Estimates of DB Plan Termination

         How does the change in 401(k) or other DC status change the probability

that an accompanying DB plan will be terminated?        Tables 10 and 11 present

linear probability ❑odels estimated on the panel of DB plans.           The dependent

variable equals one if the DB plan is terminated by 1992 and zero otherwise.

That is, the dependent variable equals one if the Form 5500 indicates that the

plan has been terminated recently, or if a resolution to terminate the plan

has been filed, or if the plan is missing from the final 1992 filings but the


                                            19
sponsor has filed Form 5500s for other plans (presumed terminated).

      The estimates in the fourth column of Table 10 indicate that the

addition of a 401(k) plan over this period increases the probability of DB

termination by .044 or by 4.4 percentage points.     The addition of a DC plan

similarly increases the DB termination probability by 4.2 percentage points.

The effects of 1985 firm employment and plan assets continue to be small -- an

increase of 10 percent in 1985 firm employment increases the termination

probability by 0.37 percentage points, and a 10 percent increase in plan

assets reduces the termination probability by .52 percentage points.

      In Table 11, the three plan status categories are included for 401(k)

and DC plans.     In column four, which includes industry dummies and controls

for firm employment and plan assets in 1985, an additional 401(k) plan is

estimated to increase the termination probability of the accompanying DB plan

by 15.5 percentage points relative to a DB plan of a sponsor with no 401(k) or

DC plan.   This 15.5 percentage point increase in the probability of

termination is large relative to the unconditional    termination probability of

35 percent.     Maintaining the 401(k) plan increases the termination probability

by 12.8 percentage points.     These two estimates are highly statistically

significant.     The effect of losing a 401(k) is also estimated to increase the

termination probability, but the estimated effect is ,small and measured

imprecisely.

      Without any controls in the regression    (column one), the termination

probability    for the base case sponsor with no 401(k) or other DC plan

increases from 0.17 to about 0.35 when a new 401(k) is offered.     Thus ,

relative to this base case, the addition of a 401(k) doubles the DB

termination probability,


                                         20
        Adding a DC plan increases the DB termination probability by 24.0

percentage points, and maintaining a DC plan increases it by 18.6 percentage

points .     As in the sponsor-level estimates, the loss of a DC plan    is


associated with the loss of a DB plan.         Losing a DC plan is associated with an

increased DB termination probability of 12.4 percentage points.         These effects

are also highly statistically     significant.

        To summarize, 401(k) plans and DC plans appear to be substitutes for DB

plans over this period.      Adding a 401(k) plan essentially doubles the DB

termination probability.      Losing a 401(k) plan has no effect on the DB plan.

Adding (or maintaining) a non-401(k) DC plan also increases DB termination

probabilities.      But, if a sponsor terminates a DC plan, it is also    ❑ ore   likely

to terminate the accompanying DB plan.      Losses of non-401(k) DC and DB plans

move together.



        c.    Changes in DB and Non-401(k) DC Plan Participation

        Given the legal complications of plan termination, substitution between

a defined benefit and 401(k) plan may be a more subtle process.         If employers

are gradually replacing defined benefit coverage with 401(k) coverage, defined

benefit participation may decline ove~ time as employers offer only the 401(k)

plan to new employees.lz     Table 12 presents estimates of the effect of

changes in 401(k) and DC plan status on participation        in the accompanying DB

plan.

        The estimates in the second column of Table 12 indicate that adding a


     12Since participation in an available DB plan is usually mandatory, the
participation ratio (active participants divided by employees eligible) ❑ay not
reflect this shift. It is more likely that the coverage ratio (eligibles divided
by total employees) will reflect this subtle shift. Unfortunately, the coverage
ratio can not be calculated for 45 percent of plans in the 1992 sample.

                                          21
401(k) reduces DB plan participation by 105.5 employees.         ~iS   iS    18.25

percent of the average participation      in a 1985 DB plan (578 participants), and

is half of the participants     in the median plan (211 participants).         This

estimate is statistically significant at the five percent level.             The

estimated effect of    ❑aintaining   a 401(k) plan is small (a loss of 35 DB

participants)    and is statistically   insignificant.    Losing a 401(k) is

estimated to also reduce DB participation      (by 111.7 participants) but is also

imprecisely ❑ensured-.

      Changes in DC status have a larger effect on DB participation and all

three categories are statistically significant at the five percent level.

Offering a new DC plan reduces DB participation by 146.0 employees and

maintaining    a DC over the period reduces DB participation by 288.9 employees.

As in the regressions where a loss of a DC plan is associated with a loss of a

DB plan, losing DC participants also is associated with losing DB participants

(166.9).

      men     other covariates are added, however, only    the coefficients on

adding and maintaining a DC plan maintain their economic and statistical

significance.     Offering a new DC reduces DB participation by 100.4 employees,

and maintaining    the DC reduces DB participation by 250.4 employees,          Overall,

the r-squareds in these regressions are quite small, indicating that not much

variation in DB participation    is being explained by changes in 401(k) or DC

plan status.

      The effect of 401(k) status on non-401(k) DC participation            is analyzed

in Table 13,    While the preferred estimates in column four indicate that the

participation    in 401(k) and DC plans indicates substitution, again not ❑uch

variation is explained by plan offerings,

6. CONCLUSION

        This paper examines the changes in pension offerings and plan

participation    for sponsors that began with at least one DB plan in 1985.

Between 1985 and 1992, over 20 percent of ongoing sponsors dropped DB plans

entirely in favor of DC-type plans.      The econometric evidence indicates that

DB offerings are reduced when-a sponsor introduces either a 401(k) or other DC

plan.    That is, for ❑any ongoing sponsors, 401(k) and other DC-type plans are

replacing their traditional DB plan.      In addition, many of the “new” 401(k)

plans appear to be converted from DC plans without the pre-tax participant

contribution    feature.

        The addition of a 401(k) plan is estimated to reduce the number of DB

plans by about 0.3 relative to a sponsor that offers no 401(k) or other DC

plan.    That is, one sponsor terminates a DB plan for about every three

sponsors that offer at least one new 401(k) plan.      In the sample, this effect

accounts for almost 18 percent of the DB plans lost to ongoing sponsors in the

panel and the DB loss affects four to five percent of all 1985 DB

participants.    Maintaining   the 401(k) offered in 1985 reduces the number of DB

plans by about 0.2.

        Non-401(k) DC plans are also estimated to reduce DB plan offerings, and

the estimated effects are larger than those for 401(k) plans.      The addition of

a DC plan reduces the number of DB plans offered by about 0.4.      Maintaining

the existing DC leads to a termination of 0.26 of a DB plan.

        Addition of a 401(k) plan also substantially increases the probability

that an accompanying DB plan will be terminated.     The point.estimates   indicate

that if a 401(k) plan is added by a sponsor, the DB termination probability

increases by about 18 percentage points to 35 percent.     The addition of a non-


                                         23
401(k) plan similarly increases the probability   that a DB plan will be

terminated.

      This evidence indicates that 401(k) plans are substituting for the

traditional DB and DC thrift/saving type plans among sponsors that have

offered DB plans in the past.    While the estimates are suggestive, there are

several important caveats to bear in ❑ind.    First, a change in the number or

type of plan offered does not necessarily change pension coverage.       It is

possible that sponsors are consolidating plans, and as mentioned above, a

limitation of this data is that it is not possible to track participants to

specific plans.   Further, a change in pension form, from DB to 401(k), has no

necessary effect on the amount of eventual retirement assets.    Large

individual contributions,   a Possible comPanY match! and good investment

performance ❑ay lead to a larger income at retirement than the company’s DB

formula.

      Third, for the twenty percent of employers who replaced all DB plans

with 401(k) or DC plans, it is clear that a fundamental change in the nature

of pension benefits has taken place,     But the qualitative nature of that

change is not considered here.    It may be that participants prefer the DC

pension form that offers portability and frequently, participant-direction       of

assets .

      The evidence presented does suggest, however, that not all the assets in

new 401(k) plans represent net saving.     401(k) assets may in part replace

saving that formerly took place in a DB plan or in an DC plan without 401(k)

features.

      The debate over whether 401(k) plans and other types of individual

saving plans generate enough new saving to justify their large tax expenditure


                                         24
is still ongoing.       In assessing their effects on saving, prior research has

focused on whether participant      contributions substitute for other forms of

personal financial assets.       But, since 401(k) plans are an employer-provided

form of retirement saving, the extent of substitution for other forms of

pensions   ❑ ust   also be explored in assessing the efficacy of LOl(k) plans.
