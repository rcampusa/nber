                                             ABSTRACT

Lesotho and other least developed African countries responded impressively to the preferences they
were granted under the African Growth and Opportunities Act with a rapid increase in their clothing
exports to the US. But this performance has not been accompanied by some of the more dynamic growth
benefits that might have been hoped for. In this study we develop the theory and present empirical
evidence to demonstrate that these outcomes are the predictable consequences of the manner in which
the specific preferences might be expected to work.

The MFA (Multi-fiber Arrangement) quotas on US imports of textiles created a favorable environment
for low value-added, fabric-intensive clothing production in countries with unused quotas by inducing
constrained countries to move into higher quality products. By allowing the least developed African
countries to use third country fabrics in their clothing exports to the US, AGOA provided additional
implicit effective subsidies to clothing that were multiples of the US tariffs on clothing imports. Taken
together, these policies help account for the program’s success and demonstrate the importance of
other rules of origin in preventing poor countries from taking advantage of other preference programs.

But the disappointments can also be attributed to the preferences because they discouraged additional
value-addition in assembly and stimulated the use of expensive fabrics that were unlikely to be produced
locally. When the MFA was removed, constrained countries such as China moved strongly into precisely
the markets in which AGOA countries had specialized. Although AGOA helped the least developed
countries withstand this shock, they were nonetheless adversely affected. Preference erosion due to
MFN reductions in US clothing tariffs could similarly have particularly severe adverse effects on these
countries.

    AGOA Rules: The intended and unintended consequences of Special
                                     Fabric Provisions.



                                         Introduction

         The export performance of the small, land-locked nation of Lesotho is an

African success story that demonstrates both the power and limitations of trade

preferences. In 2004, just three years after Lesotho became eligible for preferences

under the Africa Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) the clothing exports to the

US from one of Africa’s poorest land-locked nations had trebled to reach $460

million and provide employment for over 50,000 workers (Bennett, 2006). The

performance of Lesotho and several other preference recipients was particularly

striking because it seemed to contradict the pessimistic verdict many had reached

about Africa’s capacity to become a globally competitive exporter of manufactured

products even when granted preferential market access.2

         On May 12 2010, a ceremony was held on Capitol Hill in Washington DC, to

celebrate the tenth Anniversary of AGOA. In his remarks at the gathering, United

States Trade Representative Ron Kirk credited AGOA with “a substantial increase in

two-way U.S.-Africa trade since 2000, with African countries now exporting to the

United States a more diverse range of value-added products,” Kirk also asserted that

the trade program “powerfully demonstrates the link between trade and economic
                  3
development.”         In this paper we will provide some evidence that supports Kirk’s



2
  Several studies have been devoted to explaining this poor performance, and most conclude that the
problems lie with the African countries themselves, rather than on the access given their products in
foreign markets. A host of inhibiting factors have been identified (Ng et al., 1996; Wang and Winters,
1998).

positive verdict: AGOA has stimulated exports of manufactured products, especially

clothing, but we will also suggest that the ultimate impact on economic development

has been quite disappointing. We will argue that both the success and limitations are

the predictable consequences of the manner in which the preferences have been

constructed. We will show that although these preferences encourage exports, they

simultaneously create disincentives for local value-addition that may limit the

program’s development benefits.

                                          Background

         As indicated by Mr. Kirk’s remarks, trade preferences are of interest not only

because they might provide one time benefits in the form of higher incomes and

increased employment but also because trade is associated with more dynamic

benefits that lead to faster growth. Economic growth is an ever- expanding process in

which actors not only replicate what they were doing on greater scale but

continuously develop new capabilities that allow them to produce increasingly

sophisticated goods and services (Hausmann, Hwang and Rodrik, 20007). More

developed countries typically produce higher unit value products and wider ranges of

products than their less-developed counterparts (Schott, 2004). These products often

face less elastic demands and provide higher profit margins than more standardized,

commodity-like products. If they can “learn by doing” by using trade preferences, it is

hoped that firms that start by exporting a few simple products can upgrade their

product sophistication, and diversify into other products and markets and ultimately

become competitors that no longer need preferential treatment.4 In addition, it is


4
  According to Hwang (2007) there is unconditional convergence at the 6-digit level. If countries start
to produce low unit-value goods within a product category, they will eventually experience significant
increases in their unit values. The claim is that this will happen more or less automatically, without
any special supportive policies in place.


                                                                                                      4
                                                                                                    5


hoped that there are benefits to the rest of the economy. Other domestic firms could

gain too through backward and forward linkages as exporters demand inputs and

services and become increasingly embedded in the local economy.

        During the industrial revolution this form of development was evident in the

textile industry which was an important driver of industrialization. Japan, and later

Korea, Hong Kong and other dynamic Asians also all cut their teeth as exporters of

clothing continuously upgrading, and diversifying (Gereffi, 1999). Motivated in part

by such considerations, the EU and the US both implemented multilateral Generalized

Special Preferences (GSP) programs in the 1970s. In addition, they both have

regionally focused preferential programs. 5

        Yet, the notion that developed country markets are open to manufactured

exports from least developed economies as a result of these concessions can be

challenged. It is difficult for underdeveloped countries to produce complete complex

products but they are often quite capable of providing simple assembly operations.

Some of the preferences given through programs are thus a sham because they include

rules of origin that require more local production than these poor countries can

provide.    These rules are generally justified as necessary to prevent the trade-

deflection that could occur if products are imported from third countries and then,

with little additional value added, claimed as originating from preference-recipients –

a practice sometimes known as “screwdriver plants.” This is a legitimate concern, but

the rules are more constraining than strictly necessary and they inhibit poor countries


5
  The EU granted African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Countries special preferences, first under the
Lomé Conventions (starting in 1976) and later through the Contonou Agreement (2000). More recently
the EU has concluded Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) with groups of ACP countries. The
US has granted special preferences under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), the Andean Promotion
Act and AGOA. Preferences for least developed countries (LDCs) have received special attention. In
2001, the European Union introduced an “Everything But Arms” (EBA) program which provides LDC
exports duty free, quota-free access. In the Doha Round negotiations the United States agreed to give
duty-free access to LDCs in 97 percent of its tariff lines.


                                                                                                    5
                                                                                                   6


from specializing in the narrow slices of global production chains in which their

comparative advantage is likely to lie.

        In the case of preference programs in apparel, these rules are particularly

stringent, generally requiring that at least two (in the case of the EU) or even (in the

case of the US) three transformation processes (e.g. yarn, fabric, assembly) in the

preference-receiving or granting countries to qualify for duty-free entry. (For an

excellent account see Ahmad, 2007). These rules are especially problematic because

fabric production is a highly capital and technology activity that is beyond the

capabilities of most very poor countries.

        The rules of the US AGOA program are however an important exception,

indeed perhaps the exception that proves the rule. AGOA not only gave all Sub-
                                                                                              6
Saharan countries extensive duty -free quota-free access to the US (Table 1).                     Its

rules of origin also contained an unusual a waiver for wearing apparel that was

granted to “Lesser Developed Beneficiary Countries” (LDBCs). Subject to a fairly

generous market-share caps that have not been binding, the waiver allowed these

LDBC countries to use third-country fabrics or yarn and still export clothing under the

AGOA preferences.7 Instead of requiring individual items to meet specific

transformation rules, such as minimum value-added requirements, or the use of

domestic fabric, the US set up a simple inspection program that verified that genuine


6
  In May 2000, the US congress passed AGOA. The Act granted duty free access for 4600 GSP tariff-
line items plus another 1800 tariff line –items not on the original GSP. This meant that, aside from
some apparel and agricultural products, AGOA beneficiaries could export almost any product to the US
duty free. The AGOA preferences for garments required that that they are made of 85% US made yarn
and fabric or from fabrics and yarns made in other AGOA beneficiary countries.
7
  Most of the countries that were eligible for the wainver are classified as Least Developed by the
United Nations. Botswana and Namibia did not meet the requirements for the Special Rule as their
GDP per capita exceed the minimum of US$ 1 500 in 1998. However, they were designated as LDC
countries under amendments to the AGOA act in 2002 (AGOA II) and 2004 (AGOA IV). Mauritius
was temporarily granted the third-country fabric derogation from October 2004-September 2005 under
the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill of 2004 (known as AGOA III). More recently Mauritius qualified for the
third-country fabric derogation in November 2008 for a period of 4 years.


                                                                                                   6

production activities were taking place.8 Although the special LDBC rule was

originally scheduled to expire after three years, it was extended in 2004 for another

three years and in 2007 for a further five.




[TABLE 1 HERE]




        Countries not defined as “lesser-developed” such as South Africa and

Mauritius did receive AGOA preferences, but they were required to meet GSP rules

of origin that for clothing required the use of US or regional yarns or fabric. Because

the different treatment for higher income countries provides a useful control group,

AGOA provides an ideal opportunity to explore the role of different types of rules of

origin in preferential arrangements. And the experience demonstrates how important

they can be: US imports of clothing from AGOA countries (SITC 84- Apparel and

Clothing Accessories) increased from $730 million in 2000 to $1755 million in 2004.

This growth was dominated by US imports of clothing from the least developed

African countries which increased by four hundred percent, almost all of which took

advantage of the lesser developed country provision (See Figure 1). The largest

growth in exports between 2000 and 2004 came from Lesotho (up from $140 million

to $456 million) and over the same period very significant increases also occurred in

Kenya (up from $43 million to $270 million), Madagascar ($110 million to $323

million), Swaziland ($32 million to $179 million) and Namibia (0 to $79 million)

(Figure 2). By contrast in 2004, US imports of clothing from South Africa and

 AGOA privileges also require protecting US intellectual property rights, observing labor rights,
proving access to US trade and investment and implementing rule of law. Apparel exports require
adopting an effective visa system to prevent transshipment

                                                                                                      8


Mauritius, the two largest African clothing exporters when AGOA was passed, were

actually 18 million dollars lower than they had been in 2000 (Figure 2).




[FIGURE 1 & 2 HERE]




        AGOA also stimulated entry into new clothing markets. Table 2 reports the

number of HTS ten-digit apparel products produced by AGOA countries. Overall

AGOA countries export limited ranges of apparel products. South Africa, Mauritius

and Madagascar had the widest range of products (over 130 each) prior to the

implementation of AGOA in 2000. AGOA preferences increased product penetration.

Many countries experienced exceptional increases in the total number of lines from

2000 to 2004 (see Kenya from 45 to 155, Swaziland from 47 to 139, Lesotho from 60
           9
to 118).       In most countries however these trends reversed after 2005, but still

remained above 2000 levels.




        [TABLE 2]




        AGOA countries have experienced setbacks, however, first when the

constraints on their (mainly Asian) competitors were lifted with the expiration of the

Multi-Fiber Arrangement in 2005 and second with the slump in the US because of the
                            10
global financial crisis.         As a result, U.S. imports declined, although for the least

developed AGOA countries still remained three times as large as in 2000. By contrast,

  The largest contractions in Lesotho occurred in firms producing knitted garments; those producing
woven garments (e.g. denim) did better. See Bennet op. cit.

despite AGOA, imports from South Africa and Mauritius combined were decimated

and in 2008 were only a third of their 2000 levels.

        Several research papers have confirmed what is obvious to the naked eye --

that the lesser developed country provisions have played a key role in the outcomes.

Using a variety of methodologies, empirical estimates confirm that preferences under

AGOA are a significant determinant of Apparel exports: Mattoo, Devesh, and

Subramanian (2003) stressed the role of rules of origin in limiting the overall benefits

from AGOA to all recipients. Collier & Venables (2007) find that the AGOA apparel

provision had a positive and significant effect. Frazer and Van Biesebroeck (2010)

find that the AGOA had a “large and robust effect that grew over time” and estimate

that overall AGOA apparel exports increased by 53 percent with stronger impacts on

products with high initial levels of protection. Portugal-Perez (2008) report an impact

of 96 percent for 22 countries eligible for the third-country fabric provision, and 303

percent for the top 7 beneficiaries 11 In addition to higher export volumes there is also

evidence that AGOA exporters enjoyed higher prices and captured some of the tariff

rents created by the preferences (Olarreaga and Özden, 2005). Apparently, whatever

Africa’s handicaps, they have not prevented substantial responses: indeed, there is no

evidence of differential effects in taking advantage of AGOA based on measures of

corruption or institutional quality (Frazer and Van Biesebroeck, 2010).

        Despite the impressive growth in volumes, there is also some disquieting

evidence in AGOA’s performance that relates to the issue of dynamic benefits.

Decompositions of output growth reported in Table 3 reveal that the export of new

product lines (the extensive margin) contributed only 30 percent of total AGOA

import growth from LDC special rule countries between 2000 and 2004, and 42

percent of the decline from 2004-08. Strikingly only 8 percent of the growth in

Lesotho’s apparel exports took the form of new products. The share of product lines

accounted for by the top four and top ten HS 10-digit products is around sixty and

eighty percent and has remained fairly constant throughout the period. In addition,

production is predominantly CMT (Cut-Make-Trim) with little value addition and

there is little evidence of dynamic spillovers to other sectors of the economies (Lall

2005). These trends are exemplified by the development of Lesotho’s clothing

industry in response to the AGOA preferences. Therefore, before presenting and

testing a theory that can explain these outcomes, we describe briefly the history of

Lesotho’s clothing industry.




[TABLE 3]


Lesotho

       As the largest apparel exporter to the US, Lesotho is of particular interest.

Whereas some countries such as Namibia, Malawi and Botswana, became clothing

exporters for the first time after AGOA, the response of Lesotho actually built on a

longer historical experience in which trade preferences and policies also played an

important part. The industry was launched in the 1980s when Taiwanese

manufacturers, originally based in South Africa, moved to Lesotho in order to avoid

trade sanctions imposed by the US and Europe on what was then the Apartheid

regime. More investors were attracted in the late 1980s, after the European Union

signed the Lomé convention, which granted special preferences to the ACP countries

that had formerly been colonies. While the clothing preferences in Lomé had a double

transformation rule, Lesotho was granted a temporary derogation from the



                                                                                       10
                                                                                                  11


requirement allowing it to use third country fabrics that the investors took advantage

of.

        When the derogation expired in the mid 90s, exports to Europe plunged and

they have never recovered (Figure 3). This experience provided the first

demonstration of the importance of the role of these special preferences in the

viability of Lesotho’s exports of clothing. Clothing exports to the United States were

subject to tariffs but were also constrained by quota restrictions under the MFA. As

these became increasingly binding on others, Lesotho’s foreign owned firms shifted

to exporting to the United States to take advantage of its unfilled quotas. Lesotho’s

concentration of exports in products where quota constraints on Chinese exports were

binding is clearly revealed in Figure 4. Thus even prior to the passage of AGOA,

firms based in Lesotho, most of which were subsidiaries of Asian multinationals were

exporting to the US. Indeed, after 1999, 99 percent of all Lesotho’s apparel exports

went to the US with only 0.8% going to South Africa and just 0.2% to the EU.




[FIGURE 3]




        The small share of Lesotho’s exports going to South Africa also indicates the

important role played by fabric rules of origin. The US MFN tariff on clothing is

around 17 percent, while the SACU tariff is about 40 percent. Thus garments exported

to South Africa from Lesotho (which is within the customs union) have a much larger

margin of preference. Yet Lesotho is far more competitive in the US than in SACU.12




12
   Indeed according to Sandrey et al. (2005) Lesotho cannot even compete in Lesotho! “Examination of
the local clothing retail outlets reveals a predominance of both Chinese and South African garments.”


                                                                                                  11
                                                                                                  12


The reason is that to sell in South Africa, Lesotho has to pay SACU tariffs or SACU

prices for fabric. By contrast, under AGOA it obtains these duty free.13




[FIGURE 4]


        AGOA has been in effect for a decade but there is little evidence that much of

Lesotho’s industry could survive without preferences or that it has diversified

horizontally into new products and markets or vertically into greater domestic value

addition. Factories in Lesotho continue to concentrate on just a narrow range of

garments: the most basic low unit value categories knitted tee-shorts, slacks, blouses

and blue-jeans. The slice of the production chain they participate in is narrow and

does not seem to be expanding. Most apparel manufacturing in Lesotho is CMT (Cut-

Make-Trim). The firms, almost entirely foreign owned, typically provide assembly,

packaging and shipping services and depend on their Asian headquarters to generate

orders, design the clothes and send them the fabric they need. This can be seen by

comparing the industry wage bill for 50,000 workers (approximately $1000 per

worker) i.e. $50 million in 2004 with total US exports valued at $456 million. Most of

the value is thus added to other parts of the chain. Almost none of the managers are

locals and the buyers of fabric and the marketers of the garments and the key strategic

corporate decisions are all made thousands of miles away in Asia.

  To be sure, factors besides favourable rules of origin have contributed to Lesotho’s performance.
(Maloney, 2006) These include fluctuations in the Rand to which its currency is tied (favourable
between 2000 and 2002) and other policies to assist exporters by the Lesotho Government. In addition
Lesotho has benefited from a favourable international image as a non-sweatshop producer (Seidman
2009). It has also been promoted by Bono in his campaign against Aids. The Lesotho National
Development Corporation (LNDC) has played an active role, offering favourable rents for factory
shells. The government also provided generous tax treatment from the Government --reduced from 15
to 0 in 2006 – and sought to maintain industrial peace with a Directorate of Dispute Prevention and
Resolution. The Government has used the Duty-Credit-Certificate Scheme of the South African
Customs Union that gives apparel firms between 10 and 25 percent of the FOB value of their exports in
certificates which allow them to import textiles or apparel duty-free.


                                                                                                  12
                                                                                                       13


         The local production process is characterized by highly routine steps used to

produce very large volumes. Just one buyer -- the US retailer the GAP -- accounts for

almost 40 percent of overall output. The combination of the large scale on which they

operate and the large orders by concentrated buyers, makes it difficult for small firms

to enter the market. In addition, to move up the value chain and to produce

differentiated products in smaller batches requires more skilled workers. This is part

of the explanation for Lesotho’s inability to do well in the relatively small South

African market in which demand is more varied.

         One firm in Lesotho has built a denim plant.14 But with this exception, all

fabrics are imported. Lesotho and other AGOA countries, even South Africa,

therefore, lack the domestic textile industry that would allow them to meet the regular

clothing rules of origin in US preference programs.

         Lesotho’s workers have relatively low productivity levels and their skills do

not appear to have increased over time.15 Lall ascribes the lack of improvement in part

to the Labor Code Rule that prohibits the use of piece rate. He noted “Despite a

decade and a half or experience in CMT operations, productivity in Lesotho is below

that of major competitors. Since wages are comparable, its competitiveness cannot

outlast trade privileges” (Lall 2005).

         The relatively low quality of Lesotho’s (and other AGOA) apparel exports is

also revealed in the comparative price of its exports. Table 4 presents the average unit

values of the top 15 apparel products at HS 10-digit level exported by Lesotho to the

US in 2004. These unit values are compared against the average unit value of other

   In 2004 the industry faced a major challenge which the potential expiration of the special rule. Partly
anticipating the expiration of the Special Rule in 2004, the Nien Hsing Group of Taiwan invested over
$100 million to build the Formosa Mill, a state of the art denim fabric mill.
15
   Lall (2005) estimated that while Lesotho’s wages were similar to Asian levels, its productivity was
typically only fifty percent of East Asian levels. According to Morris and Sedowski (2006), worker
productivity has not increased over a ten year period. See also Morris (2006).


                                                                                                       13
                                                                                      14


lesser-developed AGOA countries and the 10th, 25th, median, 75th and 90th percentile

unit values of the 226 countries in the sample. In all but one case when it is just below

the 25th percentile, the unit values of Lesotho’s apparel exports fall between the 25th

and 50th percentile range.




[TABLE 4]


What is also striking is the range of unit values even within these highly

disaggregated product lines (see Schott 2004). For example, the 90th percentile unit

value of a dozen women’s or girls’ cotton pullovers (Lesotho’s top apparel export) in

2004 was 280 dollars versus 31 dollars for Lesotho exports.

       The combination of a productivity disadvantage and almost no domestic

textile industry makes the industry’s survival totally dependent on its preferences.

Each time the expiration of the special rule has drawn near, therefore studies have

issued credible and dire warnings about the industry’s ability to survive without them

(Salm, 2002 and Bennett, 2006).

       This experience makes it clear that trade need not automatically lead to growth

and the manner in which trade is stimulated could well prove consequential for the

amount and nature of the growth it stimulates. In particular it suggests that trade that

is stimulated by preferences might well have different effects than trade that occurs

for other reasons.

       Why this disappointment? Both Lall (2005) and Collier and Venables (2007)

suggest it may be that these AGOA countries are simply too underdeveloped for the

exports to ignite the process. Collier and Venables argue it reflects a lack of

complementary inputs that are required to exploit scale economies. They suggest that



                                                                                      14
                                                                                   15


preferences are only likely to work if countries already have “the skills and

infrastructure to be near the threshold of global manufacturing competitiveness”

(P1328). Lall also suggests that part of the explanation could lie with having foreign

factory owners – most of whom are Taiwanese, -- that are not closely integrated into

the local community. Ironically, this might suggest that these kinds of preferences

should be given to the more advanced developing countries like South Africa rather

than the least developed countries that have received them.

       In this paper, however, we will explore a different explanation that has been

overlooked in the literature. We will argue that both the positive and negative

responses to AGOA are no accident. Indeed, they are the consequences that economic

theory would lead us to expect, given the form in which the preferences have been

granted.

       As we will show using the theory of effective protection, preferences

combined with the third country fabric rule can have powerful financial effects. They

could easily be the equivalent of a subsidy to production that is two or three times

higher than the 17 percent preference margin granted by AGOA through MFN tariff

relief on clothing. This allows AGOA producers to offset cost disadvantages due to

the lower productivity of their workers and greater distance from suppliers and

markets and helps explain why the initial responses to AGOA (and the availability of

unused MFA quotas) were so powerful.

       On the other hand, in theory the preferences also have two deleterious effects.

First, they steer firms mainly toward the simplest products in which clothing

producers add little value. Thus the preferences tax skills acquisition and discourage

firms from moving up the value-chain. Second, the preferences (and the MFA)

discourage backward linkages because they induce exporters to use relatively


                                                                                   15
                                                                                     16


expensive fabrics rather than the cheaper fabrics that are more likely to be produced in

poor countries.

        In sum, trade preferences “work.” They can stimulate trade, raise incomes in

developing countries and boost employment. But whether they actually lead to

development conceived of as a cumulative growth process is much less certain.

       In addition changes in other trade policies at first helped and then hindered

AGOA’s performance. On the one hand, the MFA initially provided an especially

favorable environment for AGOA countries to produce low unit value products

because it not only constrained their Asian competitors but also induced these

exporters to shift towards higher quality products. On the other hand, when the MFA

was removed, constrained countries such as China moved strongly into precisely the

markets in which AGOA countries had specialized. Although AGOA helped the least

developed African countries withstand this shock, they were nonetheless adversely

affected.

       This paper proceeds now in three sections. In the first we discuss the economic

theory of the effects these regimes are likely to have. In the second, we conduct

several empirical tests of the theory and in the final section we present our

conclusions.

                                       Theory

The overview of Lesotho’s export performance identified the influence of two trade

policies: (i) the effect of MFA quotas and their removal and (ii) the effect of AGOA

tariff preferences and rules of origin. In this section we draw on economic theory to

investigate the impact of these policies. The focus is on incentives they create for the

production and export of particular types of clothing products. We are particularly



                                                                                     16
                                                                                       17


interested in the impact on product characteristics such as quality, fabric-use and

value addition in recipient countries.

          We will show that the regime governing clothing trade can be expected to

have a profound impact on clothing production choices in countries like Lesotho. In

particular, we will demonstrate that the MFA not only provided a subsidy to

Lesotho’s clothing exports but also created incentives for it to specialize in low

quality and low valued-added products. The AGOA program provided an even more

powerful incentive to expand exports of low value added clothing products, but it had

an additional effect. The third-country fabric provision encouraged further

specialization in clothing products with high fabric cost shares.

          Some of the arguments we will use are not new. The body of literature on how

trade policies influence product characteristics is well established in the case of quotas

(Falvey, 1979; Krishna, 1987, Feenstra, 1988) and transport costs (Alchian and Allen,

1964; Hummels and Skiba, 2004). The central result in this literature is that quotas

and unit transport costs lead to quality upgrading, while tariffs do not. However, the

literature generally assumes integrated production, and less studied are the effects of

quotas and tariffs on the quality and value-addition when products contain imported

intermediate inputs. This analysis therefore explores how tariff preferences and their

associated rules of origin lead to changes in the quality of goods produced and

exported. We focus on clothing and fabric inputs although some of the results would

be applicable to other products that are manufacturing with imported intermediate

inputs.

          Most apparel firms located in Lesotho sell products to the U.S. through ‘full

package’ intermediaries located in East Asia. These ‘full package’ suppliers compete

with others for orders in the US and Europe (Lall, 2005). They then contract these out


                                                                                       17
                                                                                                      18


to their associated apparel producers, either through competitive bidding or through

some allocation rule. Lesotho, for example, will export all products for which its

production costs are lower than its competitor suppliers.

         We are therefore going to develop a simple model which captures this intra-

firm allocation and thus the relative shares of two countries, think Lesotho and China,

in the US apparel imports. We model clothing as an array of products containing

varying quantities of labor and fabric inputs. We determine patterns of value-addition

and specialization in a Ricardian framework that captures the effects of differences in

fabric intensity. We then explore the effects of changes in market access policies on

production choices in both countries. In particular we highlight how these policy

changes affect both the volumes (intensive margin) and the types of products (the

extensive margin) each of the countries will export.

Model

We assume apparel products are differentiated by type of product and the content of

fabric.16 Each apparel product z is associated with a point on an interval [0,1] and is

assembled using labor and fabric according to a constant returns to scale Leontief

production function:17

         y ( z )  minL( z ) a( z ) , F ( z )  ( z )




16
   Mattoo et al. (2003) develop an alternative model with decreasing returns and infinite demand to
show how both tariff preferences and waivers of rules of origin increase exports of existing products.
They do not deal with the impact on product quality, nor export of new varieties.
17
   Portugal-Perez (2008) assumes a similar production function. A clear limitation of this model is that
it does not take into account capital (sewing machines, fabric cutters, irons, washing and drying
machines) used in the production of apparel. However, in a world where this type of capital is
internationally mobile, it is the non-traded factors that become the primary determinant of a country’s
comparative advantage (Wood and Mayer, 2001).


                                                                                                      18
                                                                                        19


a(z) is the labor used per unit output, L(z) is the quantity of labor, F(z) is the quantity

of fabric and (z) is the unit fabric requirement in square meters (the input-output

coefficient).

        Using the cost function dual to the production function, the unit cost c(z) of

clothing (assuming no transport costs) is given as:

        c ( z )  a ( z ) w   ( z ) PF ( z )                                    (1)

where w is the wage and PF(z) is the price per square meter fabric associated with

product z. We also assume firms are competitive, so equilibrium profits are zero and

the free on board price equals costs, i.e.

        p ( z )  c ( z )  a ( z ) w   ( z ) PF ( z ) .                        (2)

        Products are therefore differentiated according to their unit labor requirements,

as well as unit fabric costs which are affected by the quantity and price of fabric used.

For example, we would expect more complex apparel products (e.g. suits) to require

more labor than simple products (e.g. T-shirts). Although we do not model quality

specifically, we would also expect higher quality apparel to require more labor

services and higher priced fabric than lower quality products.

The allocation decision

The allocation process depends on the relative cost of production across different

locations. Lesotho will export all products for which its costs are less than or equal to

those from China. This allocation condition can be specified as:

          a( z )w   ( z ) PF ( z )  a  ( z ) w   ( z ) PF  ( z )          (3)

where transport costs are assumed to be zero and * denotes foreign competitor

(China). Under free trade where fabric is internationally traded and there are no




                                                                                        19
                                                                                          20


differences in unit fabric costs (PF(z) = PF*(z)), we can re-specify the relationship in

terms of Lesotho’s Relative Unit Labor Cost (RULC):

                            wa( z )
           RULC ( z )                 1                                           (4)
                           wa  ( z )

Here, home (Lesotho) exports all apparel products for which its unit labor costs are

lower than its foreign competitors. Alternatively, China exports all apparel products

for which its relative wages are less than or equal to its relative productivity.

           This result implies that comparative advantage when intermediate inputs can

be obtained at world prices is entirely dependent on the relative effective price of the

non-traded factor. This outcome is equivalent to that of the Dornbusch, Fischer and

Samuelson (DFS) (1977) Ricardian model with a continuum of goods. The fabric

content of apparel therefore has no influence on what is produced by the home

country. We will see later that this no longer holds once we introduce quotas and

preferential trade barriers.

Consumption and Equilibrium

To close the model, we assume that there is no US apparel production, that countries

only export apparel to the U.S. and that U.S. consumers have identical and homothetic

preferences. Utility is Cobb-Douglas for a numeraire good (non-clothing products),

but is a constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function in the quantities of the

differentiated clothing products. The utility function is specified as:18

                                      
           u    C  ( z )dz 
                   1
                                           C01   0   1                         (5)
                  0             

where C(z) denotes total U.S. consumption of apparel products z and C0 is

consumption of all other goods. U.S consumers spend a constant fraction  of their


18
     See Dixit and Norman (1980: 282).


                                                                                          20
                                                                                                                          21


income on apparel products with the remainder spent on the numeraire good. In

addition, the differentiated apparel products are substitutes with a constant elasticity

of substitution given by   1 /(1   )  1 .19

             Since u is a separable utility function, the optimal choice of apparel products

can be obtained by maximizing the CES component of the utility function subject to

expenditure being less than or equal to I where I is U.S. income. Optimal demand by

U.S. consumers for each product z is given by

                                      
                          p( z )         I
                C ( z)                                                                                         (6)
                          P              P

                                                                                                                     1 (1 )
where the price index of the CES quantity index is given by P    p( z )1 dz 
                                                                    1
                                                                                                                                .
                                                                  0               

A rise in the relative price of a particular product will therefore result in a

disproportionate reduction (as  > 1) in the relative consumption of that product.20

Assuming a sufficiently large number of products, the elasticity of demand for each

product will be given by .

             The model so far differs importantly from the Dixit/Stiglitz (1977) and

Krugman (1979, 1980) monopolistic competition models in that we assume perfect

competition and constant returns to scale. The full range of apparel products will

therefore be produced and prices will equal marginal cost in equilibrium.21 In




19
   Note that this is ensures that the differentiated goods are closer substitutes among themselves than
are the differentiated goods and the numeraire good. We do not modify the CES function to allow for
quality as in Hummels and Klenow (2005). A quality index acts as a demand shifter, leading to higher
consumption at every given price.
20
     To see this take the ratio of (6) for product 1 to product 2 to obtain: C ( z1 ) C ( z 2 )   p ( z1 ) p ( z 2 )  .

21
  While we could follow DFS (1977) and use a Cobb-Douglas utility function for U.S. consumers, this
has the disadvantageous outcome that the value of U.S. imports of each variety does not change.
Growth in foreign exports to the US can only be achieved through growth along the extensive margin.
This outcome is inconsistent with the empirical evidence.


                                                                                                                          21
                                                                                        22


addition, the value of exports of any product decline in response to a rise in relative

prices, with a greater change the more substitutable are the differentiated products:

                                      1
                          p( z ) 
        p ( z )C ( z )                   I
                          P 

       The final condition for equilibrium is that labor demand equals labor supply

(L), or alternatively that labor income equals the wage bill in the clothing sector.

Assume that apparel products are indexed according to diminishing Chinese relative

unit labor requirements, (a*(z)/a(z)). With z denoting a hypothetical dividing line

between Chinese exports (0, z ) and Lesotho exports ( z ,1), the home and foreign

labor market clearing condition are respectively represented as:

                 z
        wL   wa( z )C ( z )dz                                                 (7)

Taking the ratio of these two conditions gives:

             z                       

This schedule is upward sloping on z. A rise in the range of products exported by

Lesotho at constant relative wages increases the demand for labor in Lesotho and

reduces the demand for labor in the competitor country. This raises the relative wage

in Lesotho required to equate demand and supply of labor. Equilibrium is achieved

through reductions in relative U.S. consumption of Lesotho exports in response to

higher prices.




                                                                                        22

         If relative wages are fixed, as may be expected in Lesotho where

unemployment is very high, then the adjustment to equilibrium will be through

changes in the relative employment of labor in the apparel sector (L*/L falls). In what

follows, we impose the fixed wage assumption to avoid unnecessary complexity

associated with the marginal effect of relative wage changes on the range of products

exported. Together, equations (2), (3), (6), (7) (8) and the price index solve for

Chinese and Lesotho wages, the geographic specialization of apparel exports, the

price index P and U.S. consumption and prices across the full spectrum of products.

Quotas and product choice for exporting firms

The MFA was important in the markets in which Lesotho and other clothing

producers operated and its application and elimination had major effects (Harrigan

and Barrows, 2009). Quotas on clothing imports into developed economies were

widely applied under the MFA with imports from China particularly constrained

(Brambilla, Khandelwa and Schott, 2010). The MFA, therefore, led to a geographical

dispersion of clothing production as producers re-located to countries where there

were unused quotas. Lesotho (and other AGOA countries) was a beneficiary of this

relocation of production as its US quotas were not filled.22 But the effects on clothing

products were not all the same. As we will argue, quotas under the MFA induced the

export of low value added, fabric-intensive and low priced (low quality) clothing

products in developing countries such as Lesotho.

         It is well established in the literature that under competitive conditions a quota

is equivalent to a specific tariff (Falvey, 1979). The result also holds in cases of




22
  For data on quota fill rates see the US Office for Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA)
(http://otexa.ita.doc.gov/). Brambilla et al. (2010) provide a review of the fill rates for various countries
since the 1980s.


                                                                                                          23

imperfect competition (Feenstra 1988, 2004).23 While the quota restricts the total

volume of sales, its effect differs across products produced by the firm. Firms adjust

exports of different products to ensure that they earn the same quota premium from

each good exported (Feenstra, 2004). The effect is that exports of low priced (low

quality) products are the most adversely affected.

         We find similar effects in our model. Assume apparel quotas are imposed on

imports from China. The specific tariff effect of the quota (denoted as s) alters the

allocation condition (equation 3) that determines the range of apparel products

exported by Lesotho. The condition becomes:

         a( z ) w   ( z ) PF ( z )  a  ( z )w   ( z ) PF  ( z )  s .                    (10)

Assuming, for exposition purposes, that both Lesotho and China have access to fabric

at world prices ( PF  ( z )  PF ( z ) ), this equation can be re-specified in terms of

Lesotho’s Relative Unit Labor Cost (RULC):24

           wa ( z )         s
            
                     1                                                                        (11)
          w a ( z)      a ( z ) w


Further, if we let *(z) denote the share of fabric in foreign costs

(  ( z )   ( z ) PF  ( z ) / c ( z ) ) and therefore 1-*(z) as unit labor costs as a share of

total costs (  w a  ( z ) c  ( z ) ), we can simplify the allocation condition even more to:

           wa ( z )              s
                     1                        .                                                (12)

23
   See Krishna (1987) for an imperfect competition model where firms jointly select the quantity and
the quality of the products they export in response to a quota. Feenstra (1988, 2004) also show how
quotas lead to an upgrading of the characteristics within each variety produced.
24
   In Lesotho, for example, import duties were rebated on imported fabric used in the production of
apparel exports. We ignore the effects that transport cost differentials have on the relationship. Specific
transport costs on output can be modelled in an equivalent way to the effect of specific tariffs and
quotas. For example, relatively high specific transport costs on output for the competitor country have
the equivalent effect on quality as our example for quotas. See Falvey (1979) and Hummels and Skiba
(2004).


                                                                                                        24

The effect of the quota is a modified allocation condition in which the right hand side

of the DFS equation (4) is raised by the term s (1   )c  . This term is positive and

rises if, ceterus paribus, s increases, costs fall or the share of fabric in production

rises.

         We can consider four implications of quotas under the MFA for apparel

exports from Lesotho using this relationship.25 Firstly, the effect of a quota is

equivalent to a specific subsidy on exports from non-quota constrained countries such

as Lesotho. This enables Lesotho’s producers to export apparel products even if they

do not have a comparative advantage in the production of that product, i.e. where their

RULC exceeds 1 by up to s (1   ( z ))c  ( z ) . The implicit subsidy conferred by the

tariff compensates the relatively inefficient apparel producers for their high relative

unit labor costs and helps explain why countries such as Lesotho exported apparel

under the MFA despite productivity levels that were lower and wage levels that were

comparable to those of Asian levels (Lall 2005).

         The second consideration is that the implicit subsidy of the quota for Lesotho

(and other non-quota constrained countries) is a greater percent of the overall value

the lower is the price ( c (z ) ) of the product exported by China. This is the standard

result for quotas obtained by Falvey (1979). Quota constrained countries upgrade

quality of exports by shifting to higher priced varieties. What we show here is that the



25
   There are two additional considerations. Missing from this story is the fact that within-quota tariffs
were also imposed under the MFA. As shown by Hummels and Skiba (2004), ad valorem tariffs lower
the relative demand for high-quality goods in the presence of per unit transport costs (or equivalently
quotas). As tariffs rise, the shadow price of the quota constraint falls and dampens the effect (but not
direction) of the quota on relative demand for high-quality products. The final consideration is that
import quotas administered by the Office of Textiles and Apparels (OTEXA) are specified in terms of
yardage of fabric equivalents and not quantity of goods. In this case, the quota is equivalent to a
specific tariff on the price per square meter of fabric equivalence, i.e. the allocation condition is:
c( z ) /   c  ( z ) /   s . The implication for Lesotho is that relative demand and relative prices shift
in favor of exporting low priced clothing varieties that are intensive in the use of cheap fabric.


                                                                                                          25
                                                                                      26


gap in the market is filled by non-quota constrained countries that may not have been

able to compete prior to the quotas, i.e. where their RULC exceeded 1.

       The third consideration is novel to our model. Holding costs constant, the

effective subsidy, i.e. the subsidy as a proportion of value added, rises exponentially

with the share of costs (of the efficient producer) attributed to fabric. Alternatively,

the effective subsidy is greater the smaller the value added of the product.

Take for example, two apparel products each priced at US$ 10, but differing in terms

of fabric-intensity: Fabric costs make up 90 percent of the cost of product A and 1

percent of the cost of product B. Assume further that the specific tariff equivalent of a

quota on imports from China is 1 dollar. The resulting effective export subsidy for

Lesotho is just over 1 percent for product B, but is 100 percent for product A. In fact,

the effective subsidy is 100 percent for any product in which China’s labor costs are

equal to 1 dollar. The implication is that firms in Lesotho will be able to compete in

exporting product B, even if their unit labor costs are 100 percent higher than those of

the competitive quota constrained supplier (China). These considerations explain how

the quotas enable an expansion in the range of products exported by Lesotho and

other non-quota constrained countries, i.e. growth along the extensive margin.

       The impact of the quota is to shift the Chinese out of low prices products. This

implies that relative price increase of Chinese exports will be strongest in low priced

products. This leads to the fourth effect: Lesotho will also experience growth in the

volume and value of existing exports (intensive margin) as the relative price of their

existing exports falls relative to the exports from quota constrained countries (their

export price falls relative to the average price index, see equation 6).. Therefore in

Lesotho we expect the strongest intensive margin growth in exports in existing low




                                                                                      26
                                                                                                      27


priced products. In contrast, quota constrained countries experience a decline in the

range, value and volume of their exports, particularly in low priced products.

         In conclusion, we expect four effects of the MFA on Lesotho and other AGOA

countries (and other non-quota constrained countries): a rise in the export of both (i)

existing and (ii) new apparel products combined with specialization in (iii) cheap low

quality products with (iv) very little value addition. The removal the MFA would have

had the opposite effects. Previously quota constrained countries would shift

production towards cheaper products with lower labor value added. Unconstrained

countries would thus be especially adversely affected in these shifts, both in terms of

the range and value of their apparel exports.

Tariff preferences and product choice

We now turn to an analysis of the effect of the tariff preferences granted under

AGOA. Generally, theory suggests that in a competitive market ad valorem tariffs

have no impact on value-addition as they preserve relative prices faced by the firm

and the consumer (Falvey, 1979; Feenstra 1988).26 This changes once we introduce

tariffs and tariff preferences in a model where products contain internationally traded

intermediate inputs such as fabric.

         Once tariffs are introduced, what determines whether Lesotho exports product

y(z) is whether the tariff inclusive price of its good in the US market is less than or

equal to its foreign competitor, China: 27

         c( z )1  t   c  ( z )1  t                                                    (13)


26
   Krishna (1987) presents an imperfect competition model where the firm’s choice of output and
quality is influenced by ad valorem tariff rates.
27
   To simplify the model we have assumed that the ad valorem tariff does not vary by variety. Apparel
tariffs actually vary enormously according to the type of fabric used and in some cases according to the
quantity and amount of fabric used in production. Extending the model to allow for variation in tariffs
across z does not alter the main insights of the theory.


                                                                                                      27
                                                                                        28


Letting (z) denote the Lesotho fabric price relative to the Chinese fabric price,

PF ( z) PF  ( z) , we can express the allocation condition (13) in terms of relative unit

labor costs (RULC) and fabric cost shares () as follows:

 wa ( z )
          
            
            1 t
                  
                     ( z )  (1  t  )          
                                            ( z )
                                                                                (14)
w a ( z ) 1  t  1   ( z )  (1  t )
  
                                                   

         The cut off point defining what products will be exported by Lesotho is now a

function of relative tariff rates faced, fabric-intensity and relative fabric prices. To

explore the implications for product choice under AGOA, three different scenarios are

compared:

(a) Case 1: Pre-AGOA with MFN tariffs and competitive input supplies,

(c) Case 2: AGOA tariff preferences for LDC Special Rule beneficiaries,

(d) Case 3: AGOA tariff preferences for non-LDC Special Rule beneficiaries

Case 1: No preferences, MFN tariff rates (t = t*) and access to competitively priced

inputs

In the first scenario the US imposes common MFN tariffs on apparel imports from

Lesotho and China. For MFN trade there are no rules of origin requirements or

restrictions on access to internationally priced fabric, so barring domestic restrictions

on use of inputs, all countries have access to internationally priced fabric, i.e.

((z)=1).

         In this scenario, the product allocation condition 14 reduces to the standard

RULC condition of the DFS model (equation 4). Tariffs affect both countries

equivalently and the unit fabric cost components cancel each other out. The

geographic location of production is determined entirely by relative unit labor costs,

with specialization according to comparative advantage. Fabric intensity has no



                                                                                        28
                                                                                       29


bearing on what a country exports. Tariff protection in this scenario introduces no

fabric-use bias.

Case 2: Preferential access granted to home (t=0, t*>0) and no rules of origin

The second scenario is set up to reflect the AGOA preferences granted to Lesotho and

other LDBCs. These countries are granted a tariff preference into the U.S. (t = 0,

t*>0), but under the LDC Special Rule are also able to use internationally competitive

third-country fabric in the production of apparel exports. Given our assumption of no-

transport costs, fabric prices are therefore equal in Lesotho and China (((z)=1).

       The allocation condition in this case simplifies to:

                                    ( z ) 
         wa( z )
        w a  ( z )
                     
                      1  t
                                           
                                 1   ( z )
                                              t .                              (15)


What can be observed from the relationship is that the effective preference is a

function of both the tariff preference as well as the ratio of fabric cost shares to value

added costs shares (*/(1-*)). We explore the implications of this in more detail.

       Take a scenario where apparel products contain no fabric, i.e. * = 0, and the

term on the far right of equation 15 falls away. The tariff preference has a uniform

impact on all apparel products and allows Lesotho to export products in which it is up

to 1+t* times less efficient at producing than China. For example, a tariff preference

of 20 percent enables the home country to export new apparel products where its unit

labor costs are up to 20 percent greater than their foreign competitors.

       In addition to the export of new products (i.e. growth along extensive margin),

the tariff reductions under AGOA also raise U.S. consumption of existing products

exported by Lesotho (i.e. the intensive margin) through reductions in the relative U.S.

consumer price of these goods. The effect on the volume and value of exports could




                                                                                       29
                                                                                         30


be very large if products are highly substitutable. We would therefore expect to see

growth in exports along both the intensive and extensive margin.

        Once fabric is introduced, the AGOA preferences alter relative incentives to

export products of different unit fabric contents. In particular, the tariff preference is

greater for products with higher fabric cost shares. This is revealed by the second term

on the right hand side which is positive and increasing (exponentially) in *. As the

fabric cost share approaches 1, the effective preference granted to Lesotho converges

on positive infinity.

        Diagrammatically, this relationship is represented in Figure 5. Assume for

simplicity sake, that Lesotho’s relative unit labor costs are fixed at aw a  w 1 on the

vertical axes for all apparel products. We have also assumed that Lesotho’s RULC

exceeds 1. On the horizontal access, apparel products are ordered according to rising

fabric cost shares (or diminishing labor cost shares). In a competitive environment

where Lesotho and China face the same U.S. tariffs (see Case 1 in Figure 5), Lesotho

would not export any products as its RULC exceeds 1. With tariff preferences plus

waivers from the rules of origin granted to Lesotho, the relevant comparison is

between RULC and the solid line (equals the right hand side of equation 15) identified

as Case 2 in the Figure. Lesotho is still unable to export products with low fabric cost

shares. However, because the effective tariff preference rises with fabric cost share,

Lesotho is able to export all products in which the fabric cost share exceeds 1,

despite having no comparative advantage in these products.

        In sum, the tariff preference affects Lesotho’s exports in three ways. Firstly, it

raises the relative unit labor cost threshold by (1  t  ) , which is equivalent to what we

would expect in a tariff adjusted DFS model. Secondly, the threshold defining the cut-

off-point is higher for fabric intensive products. This arises because tariffs not only

                                                                                         30
                                                                                                       31


tax foreign unit labor costs, but also tax the fabric content of the product. The total

tariff equivalent preference per unit labor cost is therefore an increasing function of

the unit fabric cost share.28 Finally, by reducing the relative price of exports, the

preferences increase the volume and value of existing imports from beneficiary

countries.

         The implication for LDC AGOA beneficiaries is that they enter and specialize

in the export of the most-fabric intensive apparel products. The AGOA preferences to

LDC beneficiaries therefore compound the existing incentives to produce low value

added or fabric-intensive products brought about by the MFA. There is one important

difference. The AGOA incentives are unrelated to the price of the product, only fabric

intensity whereas the implicit subsidy for non-quota constrained countries under the

MFA is greatest for low priced fabric-intensive products.




         [FIGURE 5]




Case 3: Preferential access granted to home (t=0, t*>0), but rules of origin

constraints on fabric inputs

This scenario reflects the situation for non-LDC Special Rule AGOA countries such

as South Africa (and Mauritius for most of the post 2001 period). Apparel exports

from these countries have preferential access into the US market, but production is

subject to a two-stage transformation requirement. Apparel producers from these

countries are therefore required to use domestic (or U.S.) produced fabric in the


28
  In a small-country price taking model, the tariff effects are greatest for fabric intensive products even
amongst those goods where it has a comparative advantage (the intensive margin). The tariff
preferences therefore create incentives for firms to expand production most in the low value-added
fabric-intensive varieties of products they are already exporting. In addition, the preferences would
encourage entry of the least efficient firms into the most fabric-intensive apparel products.


                                                                                                       31

production of exports to the U.S. under AGOA preferences. If these countries produce

fabric at internationally competitive prices, (z)=1, then the outcome will be

equivalent to Case 2. However, if local fabric is more expensive than foreign fabric,

(z)>1, the allocation condition is given by:

The relationship differs from equation 15 in that while the home country is granted a

tariff preference, it has to utilize more expensive domestic fabric.

        The impact on clothing production relative to the pre-AGOA period is

ambiguous and depends on the fabric price disadvantage relative to the tariff

preference. Take for instance a scenario (Case 3a) where the home relative fabric

price disadvantage is less than the tariff preference such that 1  t    ( z )  0 . In this

scenario, the effective preference rises with fabric-intensity, but less so than in Case 2.

In Figure 5 this is depicted by the dashed line identified as Case 3a. The home country

will export all products in which the fabric cost share exceeds 2.

        An alternative scenario (3b) is one where the fabric price disadvantage is

greater than the tariff preference such that 1  t    ( z )   0 . Here the effective

preference declines as the fabric-intensity of the product rises. At some level of

fabric-intensity, the fabric price disadvantage will dominate the tariff preference

effect and reduce the right hand side of equation (15) to below 1. At this point, there

is a disadvantage associated with exporting under the preferential access scheme as

opposed to exporting under MFN rates (Case 1). Firms that are competitive in these

products, i.e. RULC < 1, will then export under MFN rates. In Figure 5, Case 3b

depicts the declining effective preference (Case 3b), although in this example, the




                                                                                               32
                                                                                     33


non-LDC AGOA beneficiaries will not export at all as the allocation condition 15 is

not met for any product.

       Bar the case of competitive domestic fabric producers, our model predicts that

LDC AGOA beneficiaries such as Lesotho will experience higher growth in export

volumes (along both the extensive and intensive margin) to the U.S. than other

AGOA beneficiaries. The effect will be particularly pronounced in fabric-intensive

apparel products.

Other effects

Other considerations relate to the development of a comparative advantage in the

nascent industry. Our model raises a number concerns in relation to this. Firstly, the

incentives steer firms to producing products with the lowest value addition

conditional on price, rather than up the value-chain. If these products are

characterized by low positive growth externalities, then the preference may trap firms

into a lower growth path than alternative preferences that incentive greater value

addition.

       Secondly, our model does not deal with the opportunity cost of resources used

in the production of apparel. If labor supply is not infinite, then the growth in the

apparel industry will raise wages, which may actually drive out export firms in other

sectors where the home country has a comparative advantage. This also holds for

other scarce resources such as infrastructure, land and water.

       Thirdly, the specialization by firms in fabric-intensive products makes these

exporters highly vulnerable to international price volatility (either through exchange

rates or international prices), preference erosion through lower MFN tariff rates and

the ending of the waiver of the rules of origin. Changes in these variables result in an

amplified impact on the effective subsidy provided by the AGOA preferences and the


                                                                                     33
                                                                                                    34


MFA quotas. Preference erosion could therefore provide an additional blow that

would be seriously underestimated if models fail to capture the contribution of the

rule of origin preference.

        Finally, the preferences restrict backward linkages by discouraging the

addition of value added services from other sectors and inducing exporters to use

expensive fabric that is less likely to be produced in poor countries.

              Empirical application: Testing Methods and Data

        Our background review identified three distinct trade regimes facing AGOA

recipients from the mid-1990s: (a) Quotas under the MFA, (b) AGOA preferences

including the third country fabric provision, and (c) the expiration of the MFA.

Theory suggests that each of these trade regimes had different impacts on the

incentives facing AGOA and non-AGOA countries

        In what follows we describe the testing approach we use and then apply this to

highly disaggregated U.S. import data. Our specific focus is on changes in the

characteristics (value-addition, and fabric intensity) of AGOA apparel exports

associated with the MFA and AGOA preferences. We ignore the effects on the value

and range of imports as this is already covered by existing empirical research.29 The

empirical method we use is difference-in-difference estimation applied to price

equations. In essence, we identify changes in the fabric-intensity of U.S. apparel




29
  We have estimated triple difference-in-difference equations similar to those of Frazer and van
Biesebroeck (2010) and do find a surge in apparel imports from lesser-developed beneficiaries relative
to other AGOA recipients (and the rest of the world) in response to the third-country fabric provision.
The average growth in imports from 2001 through 2004 associated with the fabric-provision is
estimated to be up to 282 percent, with stronger effects in products facing high preference margins. We
also find that that the expiration of the MFA adversely affected exports from AGOA recipients, but the
effect was mitigated for the least developed AGOA countries by the third-party fabric preferences
provided under AGOA.


                                                                                                    34
                                                                                      35


imports from AGOA recipients by analyzing changes in the relationship between

apparel import prices and fabric input prices.

          We find support for our theoretical predictions. Under the MFA, AGOA

recipients are found to be specialized in fabric-intensive clothing products with low

value addition relative to quota-constrained (and other) countries. Our estimates

suggest, however, that the implementation of AGOA led to no further increases in the

overall     fabric   intensity   of   these   exports.   Lesser-developed   beneficiaries

predominantly expanded the output of the products they were already exporting as a

result of their MFA preferences, i.e. growth was primarily along the intensive margin.

          However, support for our hypothesis of rising fabric-content in response to the

AGOA preferences is found after the expiration of the MFA. China and other

previously quota-constrained countries raised the fabric content of their exports after

2005 relative to other emerging economies, as predicted by our theory. More

importantly for this study is that we also find a rise in the fabric-content of lesser-

developed AGOA apparel exports relative to the emerging country control group.

AGOA preferences therefore helped insulate recipients in those fabric intensive

products that China and other quota constrained countries increasingly entered into

after 2005.

Empirical specification of the price equation

An important limitation of existing empirical studies on the effect of AGOA on

import values (Collier & Venables 2007; Portugal-Perez 2008; Frazer and Van

Biesebroeck 2010) is that import value data, even at the HS 10-digit level, is too

aggregated to fully capture changes in product characteristics. By only looking at the

value or range of HS10-digit products exported by each country, existing studies may

miss important changes occurring within each product line.


                                                                                      35
                                                                                                  36


        Take for example, Figure 6 that plots U.S. import unit values on exporter per

capita GDP (both in logarithmic form) for Women’s and girls’ cotton pullovers

(Lesotho’s top apparel export) in 2004. The price of imports of this highly

disaggregated HS10-digit product ranges from under 10 dollars to over 1000 dollars

per square meter equivalent with higher income economies producing the more

expensive (higher quality) varieties (as in Hummels and Klenow (2002) and Schott

(2004)). The lesser-developed AGOA recipients predominantly situate at the low-

price, low-income per capita end of the spectrum.30



[FIGURE 6]


        Our particular focus is on product prices. More specifically, we use difference-

in-difference estimation to exploit the distinct breaks arising from the implementation

of AGOA and the ending of the MFA and identify whether prices changes and

changes in the fabric-intensity of apparel products are consistent with those predicted

by our theory.

        Following Feenstra (2004), the U.S domestic price of an imported good i from

country c is specified as a function of marginal costs (c*), the exchange rate (e),

import tariffs (tar), aggregate domestic expenditure (I) and the price of substitute

goods (q) as follows:

         ln pict    1 ln cict
                              
                                    2 ln ect   3 ln qict
                                                               .                         (17)
                 4 ln(1  tarict )   5 I t   t




30
  There are exceptions. Apparel unit values of China, India and Indonesia, who were amongst the top 4
quota restricted countries under the MFA (Brambilla et al. (2010), are higher than predicted. This is
consistent theoretical predictions of quality upgrading in response to quota restrictions.


                                                                                                  36
                                                                                                37


This is an unrestricted version of a price equation that imposes symmetric pass-

through of the exchange rate and foreign costs (where 1 =2), symmetric pass-

through of the tariff and exchange rate (where 2 = 4) and homogeneity of degree 1

in its arguments (1 (=2=4) +3+5 =1).

          We are particularly interested in isolating changes in the fabric content of U.S.

apparel imports using this equation. This requires a more precise specification of the

influence of fabric costs on unit costs c*. To simplify the analysis, we impose a unit

cost function derived from a constant return to scale Cobb-Douglas production

function:

           
          cict  At pf it pvaict
                              1
                                                                                         (18)

pf is the price of the fabric used in the production of good i, pva is the value added

price (made up labor and capital costs) and At measures total factor productivity. This

specification imposes the restriction that the proportion of expenditure spent by the

firm on fabric is constant and is given by . Substituting (18) into (17) gives the

following equation:

          ln pit    1 ln pf it   2 ln pvait   2 ln et   3 ln qit
                                                                                         (19)
                  4 ln(1  tarit )   5 I t   t

where  1  1 and  2  1 (1   ) . Given the assumptions imposed, the fabric

content        of        the        clothing           product     can       be   calculated    as

 1 /( 1   2 )  1 /( 1  1 (1   ))   . Fabric-intensive products would therefore

be characterized by large coefficients on the fabric price ( 1 ) relative to the

coefficient on the value added price (  2 ).




                                                                                                37
                                                                                                        38


         There are two changes in response to the MFA and AGOA that we wish to

identify: (i) changes in the price level and (ii) changes in the fabric-intensity of U.S.

apparel imports.

         To identify changes in the level of import prices from a region in response to a

shock, say AGOA recipients after 2001, the above equation is modified to include an

interaction between an AGOA dummy variable (DAg) and a dummy variable for the

post-AGOA period (D01). The basic price equation in this example is then specified

as:

         ln pict  1 D01 DAg c
                 1 ln pf it   2 ln pvaict
                                                                  .                          (20)
                 2 ln ect   3 ln qict   4 ln(1  tarict )
                cntry / prod ct  t   ict

where 1 measures the marginal effect of the AGOA preferences (D01) on unit values

of U.S. imports from AGOA countries (DAgc) relative to all other countries in the

sample (the control group). Country by product (cntry/prod) fixed effects are

included, so the regression uses the within-country by product variation of prices and

the other variables over time to estimate the coefficients.31 Year fixed effects t are

also included to account for common shocks across all product varieties.

         To identify changes in the fabric-intensity associated with the various trade

regimes, we focus on changes in the coefficients on the fabric and value added prices.

For example, we would expect a shift by AGOA recipients to more fabric intensive

varieties within each 10-digit product line to be revealed by a rise in the coefficient on

fabric prices and a decline in the coefficient on value added prices.



31
  The standard most restrictive difference specification includes a dummy variable for AGOA
countries (DAgc), but in equation 22 these have been replaced with country by product fixed effects
(cntry/prod) to allow for country and product level heterogeneity in the base-level of import prices.


                                                                                                        38
                                                                                     39


       We use difference-in-difference estimation to identify changes in the relative

fabric-content of apparel imports from AGOA beneficiaries. The specification in the

case of AGOA preferences is as follows:

        r1 : ln pict  1 D01 DAgc
        r2 :     (1   2 D01)  DAgc  ln pf it
        r3 :     ( 2   3 D01)  DAgc  ln pvaict
        r4 :     (1   4 D01)  ln pf it                        .          (21)
        r5 :     ( 2   5 D01)  ln pvaict
        r6 :      2 ln ect   3 ln qict   4 ln(1  tarict )
        r7 :     cntry / prodic  t   ict

The first row tells us the effect of AGOA on U.S. import unit values of apparel

products imported from AGOA recipients. Rows 2 and 3, however, are of most

interest to us. The coefficients on the triple interaction terms (2 and 3) measure the

marginal impact of AGOA preferences on the fabric-intensity of U.S. imports from

AGOA recipients (first difference) relative to changes in the fabric-intensity of U.S.

imports from the control group (second difference). The latter effect is captured by

the coefficients 4 and 5 in rows 4 and 5.

       For example, support for our hypothesis that AGOA preferences raise the

fabric-intensity of imports from recipient countries, would be revealed by a positive

coefficient on the AGOA country by post-2001 interaction with the fabric price (2) in

row 2 and a negative coefficient on the AGOA country by post-2001 interaction with

the value added price (2) in row 3. Note that these coefficients reflect the post 2001

impact on fabric-intensity in AGOA countries relative to the post-2001 impact on




                                                                                     39
                                                                                                       40


fabric-intensity in the control group which is captured by the coefficients 4 in row 4

and 5 in row 5. 32

         Equations 20 and 21 summarize the main approaches used in the following

analysis. Further refinements to isolate the marginal effects of the MFA and AGOA

preferences on lesser-developed AGOA beneficiary countries will be explained in the

relevant empirical sections.

Data

         The empirical analysis draws on a panel of time-consistent 10-digit HTS

import data for the U.S. from 1996-2008.33 The raw data contains approximately 1202

product lines for Clothing (HS61, 62 and various sub-codes of HS 64 & 65) covering

224 countries.

         Unlike the price equations specified above, the dependent variable is the log

import price of clothing exclusive of tariffs, insurance and freight costs. This does not

affect the estimates, except that the pass-through of tariffs to US domestic prices of

imports is calculated as 1-7. Looking at the independent variables, we use the foreign

industry value added deflator (in foreign currency) for pva, the US dollar to foreign

currency exchange rate for e and US Producer Prices (at 6-digit NAICS level) (usppi)

and competitor clothing unit values (at 10-digit level) (Pcompete) for substitute

products q. Applied tariff rates are defined at the 4-digit HS level.34 In addition to


32
   We could also include product by year fixed effects and country by year fixed effects. In this case,
only variables defined over product, country and time will be retained.
33
   The HTS classification changed frequently throughout the period as new product lines were
introduced and old product lines were aggregated. We use the Pierce and Schott (2009) concordance
programme to construct a time-consistent classification for the full period.
34
   We use the average tariff at the HS 4-digit level to avoid erroneous correlations arising from the
construction of the variables (tariff rate = duty/import value and price = import value/import quantity).
Using the average may also reduce biases associated with the potential endogeneity of product level
tariff rates. The trade data are obtained from Peter Schott who constructed the database using US
Customs Service data. US producer prices are obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, fabric
prices are constructed using UNcomtrade data and the exchange rates are obtained from the World


                                                                                                       40
                                                                                                   41


these variables, real GDP per capita measured in PPP prices is included to capture the

impact on prices of general productivity improvements in the economy and relative

technological advantage in producing higher-quality goods (Hummels and Klenow

2005). 35

        For fabric prices, we calculate Tornqvist price indices for silk (HS50), wool

and fine animal hair (HS51), cotton (HS 52) and man-made fiber and staple (HS 54 &

HS55) using unit values derived from world trade data obtained from UNComtrade.36

The calculated fabric indices are presented in Figure 7.37 Of interest, is the relatively

close association between the average U.S. import unit value of wearing apparel (HS

61 and HS 62) and fabric prices, particularly man-made fabrics.




        [FIGURE 7]




        The relevant fabric price (silk, cotton, man-made, wool, or weighted average

of these) is allocated to each 10-digit HTS clothing product based on the dominant

fabric used in producing the good.38 Unfortunately, we are unable to construct




Bank World Development Indicator database. Country specific tariff rates at the 4-digit HS level are
constructed as the sum of duties collected over value of imports. Competitor clothing prices are
calculated as the geometric average price of all other countries (using import values as weights).
35
   Although the industry value added price is the net effect of productivity and nominal factor prices,
the real GDP per capita also embodies productivity improvements in the services sector.
36
   The following HS codes for synthetic fibres are also included in man-made products: 550110,
550120, 550130, 550190, 550200, 550310, 550320, 550330, 550340, 550390, 550410, 550490,
550610, 550620, 550630, 550690. The average of the fabric prices calculated using world exports and
world imports are used.
37
   The fabric prices correspond closely with the dominant agricultural commodity used to produce the
fabric. For example, there is a close fit between cotton-based fabric and raw cotton prices, and wool-
based fabric and wool prices.
38
   The allocation was done manually on the basis of the product description.


                                                                                                   41

weighted average fabric price indices for apparel products produced using different

combinations of fabric types.39

        We now separately apply the various equations to the AGOA and MFA trade

regimes.

                           African Growth and Opportunity Act

Our expectation is that AGOA preferences stimulated US imports from beneficiary

countries, with relatively high growth in imports of fabric-intensive and low value-

added products. The effects are predicted to be particularly pronounced in LDC

recipients eligible to use third country fabric.

        Table 5 presents regression results for various specifications of the price

equation. The first column presents benchmark estimates of the price relationship over

the period 1996-2004 and is used to evaluate the consistency of the price equation

with our theoretical priors. Overall, the price model produces results that are

consistent with theory and other empirical evidence (See Feenstra 1989.

        The dollar price of US clothing imports rise with increases in foreign and US

competitor’s prices. Import unit values rise with foreign GDP per capita reflecting a

positive association between income and quality of exports as explained by Hummels

and Klenow (2005). Applied tariffs reduce the fob price of apparel products with a

coefficient of -0.60, which is very close to the effect of an equivalent depreciation of

the dollar.40 Foreigners therefore absorb 60 percent of tariff increases or depreciation

either through lower mark-ups (in case of imperfect competition) and/or reduced

marginal costs (from upward sloping supply curve). Further, rising foreign production

costs result in higher U.S. import prices. US import prices are equally affected by

increases in foreign fabric costs and value added costs, implying a fabric share

coefficient of approximately 50 percent.41



[TABLE 5]


           Various diagnostic tests reveal that the aggregate model fails the homogeneity

test and the hypothesis of symmetric pass-through of the tariff and exchange rate.

However, far fewer instances of rejection are found in the disaggregated HS4–digit

level estimates. The disaggregated results and hypotheses tests are presented in Table

A1 in the appendix. We are therefore reasonably satisfied with our basic price

equation and proceed with our objective of identifying differences in the fabric-

content of AGOA apparel exports.

           The second column of results extends the base regression by including

interactions between an AGOA dummy (DAg) and fabric costs and value added prices

(see rows 9 & 10). The objective of this estimate is to identify the average fabric-

intensity of U.S. imports from AGOA beneficiaries throughout the 1996 to 2004

period.

           The results indicate that AGOA countries produce relatively fabric-intensive

clothing products with low value addition. The coefficient on the fabric price (DAg x

ln(pf)) is positive and significant (0.323), while the coefficient on value added prices

(DAg x ln(pva)) is significant and negative (-0.389). Therefore, U.S unit values of

apparel imports from AGOA beneficiaries are far more sensitive to fluctuations in

fabric prices than apparel imports from the rest of the world. We infer from this result


41
     The coefficients on value added and fabric prices are insignificantly different from each other.


                                                                                                        43
                                                                                                         44


that AGOA beneficiary exports are relatively fabric-intensive. This outcome is

consistent with both the effect of the AGOA preferences and the MFA.

         To identify the effect of AGOA preferences on beneficiary exports, we use the

specification in equation 21 where the time period dummy variable in the interactions

refers to the 2001 to 2004 period.42 The relevant results are presented in rows 3 & 4 in

column 3 of Table 5. These are the coefficients on the difference-in-difference terms

that measure the change in fabric-intensity of U.S. imports from AGOA beneficiaries

after 2001 relative to the change in fabric-intensity of imports from the rest of the

world. Our expectations are that AGOA preferences raised the fabric-intensity of

imports from beneficiary countries.

         However, contrary to our theoretical predictions, we find no increase in the

fabric-intensity of apparel exports from 2001 to 2004 in response to the AGOA

preferences. The coefficients on the interaction terms (D01 x DAg x ln(pf)) in row 3

and (D01 x DAg x ln(pva)) in row 4 are insignificantly different from zero.

         One reason may be that the above estimates are an average for both LDC

AGOA and other AGOA countries. Our theory suggests that the effect of AGOA

preferences on fabric-intensity is particularly pronounced amongst LDC AGOA

countries who are eligible for the third country fabric provision. To isolate the

marginal impact of the third country fabric provision on fabric-content, we include

additional interactions of ln(pva) and ln(pf) on dummy variables for LDC AGOA

countries (Dldc) over the full period and over the 2001-04 period. Estimates of this

relationship are presented in column 4. The coefficients on the LDC interaction terms



42
  Not all countries became eligible to export apparel in 2001. D2001 therefore varies by country and
time and equals 1 for all years from the time the country becomes eligible to export apparel products.
The dummy variable is set equal to 1 for the initial year if eligibility occurred within the first 6 months
of the year.


                                                                                                         44
                                                                                                   45


in rows 2 & 3 are interpreted as the marginal impact of AGOA on fabric intensity in

LDC special rule countries relative to the rest of AGOA beneficiaries.

        We still find no increases in the fabric content of apparel exports by lesser-

developed AGOA countries relative to other AGOA countries or the rest of the world

from 2001 to 2004. None of the marginal effects for LDC Special Rule countries are

significantly different from zero.

        Overall, the results suggest that the preferences under AGOA had very little

impact on the within-product fabric content of apparel exports to the US by recipient

countries. AGOA beneficiaries, including lesser-developed Special Rule countries,

were already specialized in fabric intensive products prior to receiving AGOA

preferences. The impact of AGOA was to make production of these products more

attractive and they responded by increasing exports of these products, rather then of

new fabric-intensive products. This is consistent with the decomposition of growth

analysis in Table 3 which showed that the expansion of exports was overwhelmingly

along the intensive margin.




                                       Expiration of MFA

The ending of the MFA presents an additional policy ‘experiment’ to test our theory

as applied to AGOA beneficiaries. As noted, quotas under the MFA were removed on

the 1st January 2005, although some quotas were re-imposed in industrialized

countries in response to the rapid growth in imports from China.43 In this section, we




43
   We do not take into account the re-imposition of quotas on selected Chinese apparel products from
late 2005. As shown by Harrigan and Barrow (2010) these contained, but did not reverse the import
response to the end of the MFA.


                                                                                                   45
                                                                                     46


exploit this break to indentify whether import values, import unit values and the

fabric-intensity of U.S. apparel imports moved in accordance with our predictions.

       Theory predicts that firms in previously quota restricted countries respond to

the ending of quotas by downgrading the quality of their apparel exports. In our

model, this would be revealed by relatively strong growth in imports of low priced

varieties from previously quota restricted countries that include AGOA beneficiaries.

Evidence in support of quality downgrading is found by Brambilla et al. (2010) and

Harrigan and Barrows (2009).

       A second hypothesis derived from our theory, is that, conditional on price,

quota restricted countries responded to the ending of the MFA by increasing exports

of fabric-intensive apparel products. In this section, we test these two hypotheses

focusing on the response by quota restricted countries relative to AGOA beneficiaries.

       Preliminary support for the effect of the MFA on product quality is provided

in Figure 8 that presents a measure of within-product price differences for selected

countries relative to Lesotho. These are calculated by aggregating up the log ratio of

export prices relative to Lesotho using Lesotho export values as weights. Higher

values reflect the export of more expensive apparel varieties than Lesotho within each

product line.

       During the MFA period, quota-constrained countries such as China,

Bangladesh and India exported varieties within each HS 10 digit line that were up to

twice as expensive as those from Lesotho. The expiration of the MFA, however, saw

a dramatic decline in the relative price as these countries downgraded the quality of

their apparel exports: see the relative price of Chinese apparel that fell from 1.95

times to 90 percent of those from Lesotho in one year. There was a slight rebound




                                                                                     46
                                                                                     47


from 2006 as new quotas on Chinese apparel exports were imposed, but by 2008

relative prices had still fallen by over 55 percentage points from 2004.



[FIGURE 8]


       The composition of imports from quota constrained countries also shifted

towards the low priced products exported by Lesotho. Figure 9 presents import

weighted prices (per square meter equivalent) of apparel imports from each country

calculated using the product-level median prices for the entire sample and period and

time varying import values by country as weights. Reductions in the average price,

reflects across-product shifts in the composition of apparel exports to the U.S.

towards lower priced products.

       The shift in composition is most noticeable for China, whose apparel exports

were initially concentrated in relatively expensive 10-digit apparel products, but then

fell in 2002 as quotas imposed under Phase I, II and III of the MFA were eliminated

in response to China’s entry into the WTO. A further shift towards low priced

products occurred in 2005 after the ending of Phase IV of MFA and by 2008 the

import weighted median price of Chinese apparel exports was very similar to those of

Lesotho.



[FIGURE 9]


       The trends in these diagrams provide some support for our hypotheses

regarding the effect of quotas on product prices. We now apply the difference-in-

difference estimation to test for significant changes in the price and fabric-content of

apparel exports by AGOA recipients


                                                                                     47
                                                                                         48


Quotas and price levels

The first objective of this section is to estimate if the expiration of the MFA reduced

average U.S. import unit values from quota-constrained countries who are predicted

to have shifted apparel production towards lower priced products. The equation used

to identify these price effects is the difference-in-difference specification of equation

20, except that we replace DAg with a dummy variable Dquotacntry for quota

constrained countries and D01 with a post-2005 dummy variable (D05). Table 6

presents the results.

           In line with theoretical predictions (and the price trends in Figure 8 and Figure

9), quota constrained countries responded to the end of the MFA by reducing the

quality of their apparel exports by shifting towards lower priced varieties and

products. The average unit value of U.S. apparel imports from the top 4 most quota

constrained countries declined by 31.9 log points relative to other countries after 2005

(see row 1 of column 1 of Table 6) (see also Brambilla et al. (2010) and Harrigan and

Barrows (2009)).44 This arises from a combination of across-product shifts of imports

towards lower price products and within-product shifts towards lower priced varieties.

The expiration of the MFA therefore adversely affected the competitiveness of non-

quota constrained countries such as Lesotho that produced low priced products in

response to the MFA.




           [TABLE 6]




Quotas and fabric-intensity.

     The decline for the top 30 quota constrained countries is lower at 13.9 percent.



                                                                                         48
                                                                                      49


We now test for changes in the fabric-intensity of apparel imports in response to the

expiration of the MFA. Our theory predicts a rise in the fabric-content of exports by

previously quota constrained countries relative to AGOA beneficiaries and other non-

quota constrained exporters.

       We commence with the simplest difference-in-difference specification to

identify changes in the fabric-intensity of quota-constrained countries in response to

the end of the MFA. The specification is similar to that of equation 21, except, as

above, a post-2005 dummy variable is used and we also include of various

interactions between Dquotacntry and value added and fabric prices covering the pre

and post MFA period.

       We are interested in two effects: (i) the change in fabric-intensity of exports of

the control group (non-quota constrained emerging economies) after January 2005,

and (ii) the change in fabric-intensity of exports of the quota-constrained group

relative to the control group. The first effect is given by the interactions between the

post-MFA dummy (D05) and fabric and value added prices in rows 4 & 5 of Table 6.

The second effect is given by the triple interaction between D05, Dquotacntry and

fabric and value added prices in rows 6 & 7.

       The results in rows 4 & 5 in column 2 indicate a decline in the fabric-intensity

of apparel exports to the U.S from emerging economies after 2005. The coefficient on

log fabric prices declines by 10.9 log points, while the coefficient on log value added

prices rises by 9.3 log points. This change is consistent with our theory that predicts

shifts out of fabric-intensive products by non-quota constrained countries in response

to the removal of quotas.




                                                                                      49
                                                                                                    50


          Our estimates also reveal significant increases in the fabric-intensity of U.S.

apparel imports from the most quota-restricted countries.45 This is revealed by the

significant positive coefficient of 0.217 on the interaction term (D05 x Dquotacntry x

ln(pf)) in rows 6 & 7 of column 3. Apparel exports from Bangladesh, India, China and

Indonesia therefore became more responsive to fabric price fluctuations after 2005

relative to all other emerging economies. We infer from this result that the fabric-

intensity of apparel exports to the U.S. from these previously quota constrained

countries has risen.

          The next two estimates focus on identifying the MFA effect on prices and

fabric-intensity for AGOA beneficiaries relative to other non-quota constrained

emerging economies. We do this by separately including additional triple interactions

for the AGOA group (see rows 8 & 9 column 3) and the LDC AGOA group (see rows

10 & 11 column 4).

          The estimates produce interesting results. The data suggest that the expiration

of the MFA led to a rise in the fabric-intensity of AGOA exports relative to other

emerging economies. This is revealed by the rising responsiveness of U.S. import

prices from AGOA recipients to changes in fabric prices relative to the control group.

If we focus on Lesser-developed beneficiary countries (column 4), we get a similar

result.

          Clearly AGOA countries have responded differently to other non-quota

constrained emerging economies. This is precisely what our theory predicts would

happen under AGOA preferences. We found earlier that AGOA resulted in no

changes in fabric-intensity of exports by beneficiary countries. Our explanation was



45
   There is no significant difference from the control group for the top 30 most quota-restricted
countries.


                                                                                                    50
                                                                                    51


that these countries were already specialized in fabric-intensive low value-added

apparel products as a result of the incentives introduced by the MFA quotas.

       With the end of the MFA, China and other quota-constrained countries moved

into the fabric-intensive products they were previously discouraged from exporting

under the quotas. This led to increased competition in fabric-intensive products that

non-quota constrained countries specialized in under the MFA. The response by these

countries was to reduce the fabric-intensity of their apparel exports. AGOA recipients,

however, are an exception.

       Why? An explanation based on our theory is that AGOA preferences insulated

the recipients in the most fabric-intensive products as the effective preferences in

these products are the greatest. The effect of AGOA on fabric-intensity is only

revealed in our estimates once MFA is removed as prior to this we had an

identification problem as both AGOA and MFA encouraged specialization in fabric-

intensive products.

       In sum, the MFA induced AGOA countries to specialize in low value added,

high fabric-content apparel products. AGOA preferences and particularly the third-

country fabric provision were expected, according to our theory, to compound this

specialization in low value-added, fabric-intensive varieties and products. We do not

find evidence of significant changes in the fabric-content of apparel exports in

response to the AGOA preferences. Rather, the apparel producers in AGOA recipient

countries responded by increasing exports of existing products.

       The dependence of these exports on the tariff preferences and quota

restrictions in competing countries made AGOA recipients and other non-constrained

emerging economies very vulnerable to the ending of the MFA. The elimination of

quotas (quotas were re-introduced on Chinese exports in later 2005) induced China


                                                                                    51
                                                                                   52


and other previously quota restricted countries to downgrade product quality and

increase exports of those products and varieties that AGOA countries were

specialized in. However, the effect on fabric-content of AGOA recipient exports was

insulated relative to other countries by the AGOA preferences that grant the greatest

effective preferences in fabric-intensive products. The AGOA preferences helped

mitigate the effects of the expiration of the MFA.


                                     Conclusions

Lesotho and other Lesser-developed beneficiary countries enjoyed rapid growth in

their clothing exports to the US as a result of the third-country fabric provision of

AGOA. Although adversely impacted by the expiration of the MFA and the recession

in the US, the clothing industries of these least developed African countries have

clearly benefited from the provisions. But these economies have not enjoyed the more

dynamic upgrading and spill-over benefits that might have been hoped for. Most of

the export growth has come in the products that these countries were already

producing. Success in the US clothing market has also not translated into success in

other clothing markets or in success in exporting other labor-intensive products. The

LDBCs have generally remained specialized in a small number of garment categories

that are particularly favored by the preferences. These typically embody low-value

added in sewing and are relatively intensive in fabric. Although the AGOA program

has operated for a decade, it is unlikely that most of the industry in these poor Sub-

Saharan could survive without the special rule.

       This experience provides important lessons. Trade preferences do have major

advantages. First, they can offer powerful inducements to beneficiary exporters that

are financed through foregone tariff revenues by developed countries rather than

taxpayers in developing countries. Second, by providing a form of infant industry


                                                                                   52
                                                                                      53


protection in export rather than domestic markets, they ensure that products have to

meet the requirements of consumers in advanced economies. And third, since they are

externally imposed, they do not give rise to domestic rent-seeking.

       The positive response to AGOAs special rule highlights the importance of

providing exporters with access to inputs at world prices. Requiring exporters to use

expensive inputs can seriously impede their competitiveness. This is clearly seen in

the contrast between Lesotho’s prowess in the United States where it is allowed to use

fabrics that are priced at world prices, with its weak performance in the EU and

SACU where it is not. The positive response to AGOA highlights the restrictive

nature of other rules of origin that have been imposed on least developed country

exports. Allowing LDBCs to use imported fabrics provided powerful effective

subsidies for clothing exports. This served to compensate producers in poor countries

for the lower productivity of domestic workers and other institutional and

infrastructural deficiencies.

        The fact that the program has operated smoothly without problems relating to

trade deflection demonstrates the scope for improving the restrictive rules that

continue to limit the benefits to poor countries from programs such as the EBA

program of the European Union. Such improvements would create more realistic

possibilities that the least developed countries could participation in global production

chains. It would be particularly welcome given the problems faced by these countries

as a result of the expiration of the MFA.

       In the Doha Round, it is recognized that lower MFN tariffs will result in

preference erosion. But typically studies have suggested that the effects would not be




                                                                                      53
                                                                                                   54


large.46 However, if the models that are used to estimate the impact of erosion fail to

take the third-country fabric provision into account they could seriously

underestimated the impact on the effective protection provided to the Lesser-

developed AGOA recipients.

        The experience also shows, however, that trade preferences are not a panacea.

The outcomes associated with the special rule conform to those suggested by theory.

The special rule distorts decisions on value-addition and fabric use in opposite

directions, both of which are undesirable. On the one hand, the incentives are most

powerful in lower quality products that require less value-addition. This may limit the

dynamic benefits that are hoped for from these preferences by discouraging skills

development and other forms of quality upgrading. On the other hand it encourages

the use of more expensive fabrics. This makes it less likely that there will be

backward linkages into domestic textile industries that are still at rudimentary stages

of development.

        Preferences are thus an opportunity but not a substitute for more

comprehensive industrial strategies that involve complementary domestic policies to

improve private and governmental capabilities. This does not mean that these

preferences are unimportant, but suggests they are unlikely to be sufficient. In

addition problems arise when most of the entrepreneurs taking advantage of the

preferences are foreign, with many other crucial parts of the value chain being

provided thousands of miles away.

        The experience analyzed in this paper is a case study of the links between

trade and growth -- a topic that has been the subject of considerable empirical

investigation. This example highlights the obvious, but often ignored consideration,

that both trade and growth are quintessentially endogenous variables rather than

policy instruments and suggests that the reasons for trade are likely to be important in

the impact on growth. Even if on average trade and growth are associated, and even if

on average trade may cause growth, the widely used proposition that trade leads to

growth should not be used as an unconditional forecast. The precise reasons for trade

and the other domestic conditions and policies that are associated with it, are likely to

play key roles in the growth impact. In the case of Lesotho and other AGOA countries

utilizing preferences may lead to more trade but are not a substitute for the more

difficult challenges of developing more comprehensive development strategies. In

sum, the slogan of “trade not aid” can be misleading. Trade preferences may be help

create the conditions for growth, but they are not sufficient

Note: Year fixed effects are not included as the fabric costs do not vary across products for some of the HS 4-digit groups. Estimates are robust to heteroscekasticity.



Overall, the coefficients are broadly consistent with expectations. In most sectors the coefficient on fabric prices is positive and ranges from 0.23
to just over 1. Similarly, the coefficients on value added prices and the exchange rate are mostly of the correct sign. The estimates for Headgear
(HS 64) and Footwear (HS 65) products are poor, but is likely that the fabric costs indices do not adequately reflect the inputs used in the
production of these products. For example, HS 6406 covers Parts of Footwear; Removable In-Soles, Heel Cushions And Similar Articles;
Gaiters, Leggings etc. HS65 covers headgear products often comprising of felt, strips of any material, lace, etc. These products also make up a
very small proportion of AGAO country exports. Most estimates fail to reject the homogeneity and symmetric pass-through (both the tariffs and
exchange rate & exchange rate and production costs) hypotheses. Each hypothesis is rejected at most 12 times (out of 40).
