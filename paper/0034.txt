Introduction

        In the past few years, there has been substantial progress in the

application of the economic theory of household decisiortmalcing to human

fertility behavior.' As yet, however, the theoretical and empirical

scope   of the   economic theory of fertility has been quite limited.   ob-

served fertility    behavior is regarded as the outcome of utility maxi—

nizinr choices by couples in which the costs and satisfactions associated

with the number and "ciuality" of children are balanced against the costs

and satisfactions of other activities unrelated to children. Theoretical

emphasis has been given to the effects of the costs of parental tine and

money resources devoted to rearing children on the demand for the total

number of children in a static framework under conditions of certainty.

Empirical work has focused on explaining variation in the number of chil-

dren ever born to women, who have completed their childbearing, as a

function of measures of the household's total resources and the opportunity

cost of time, especially the value of the wife's time. Empirical results

have been of mixed quality. The value of the wife's tine, as measured by

her potential market wane or her education, is almost always found to have

a significantly negative impact on completed fertility, hut measures of

husband's lifetime income are not always significant or consistent in sigh.2




     'For a recent collection of papers-on the economic analysis of fer-
tility, and citations to earlier work, see T. W. Schultz, ed. (1973).

        number of explanations for the puzzling inconsistency of the
"income effect" on fertility has - been advanced, hut it is probably
accurate to say that none has been universally accepted. See Becker (1960),
Becker and Lewis (1973), Ben—Porath (1973), Sanderson and Willis (1971),
Simon (1973) and Willis (1973).
        One important objection to static theories of fertility is their

  failure to deal with the implications of the simple fact that reproducjo

 is a stochastic biological process in which the number and timing of births

 and the traits of children (e.g.
                                    sex, intelligence, health, etc.) are in—

 certain and not subject to direct control.. To control fertility, a couple

 can only attempt to influence the monthly probability of
                                                            conception and,
 given conception, the prohability that pregnancy will terminate in live

 birth by altering sexual behavior, contracepting or resorting to abortion.

 As recent work by Ben—Porath and Welch (1972)
                                                 stresses, this implies that

 family fertility decisions are inherently sequential and that decisions

 about further children are made in light of experience with previous

 children. Moreover, a modest extension of this argument suggests that

 undertainty nay surround the valuation process itself: until a family has

had one child it does not know what the costs and rewards of having a

second one would be. Finally, it is evident that uncertainty concerning

fertility decisions and realizations adds to and interacts with uncertainty

surrounding other lointly determined household decisions about marriage and

divorce, consumption and saving, labor supply and investment in human capi-

tal.


       In this paper, we report some initial results of a study in progress

whose goal is to develop an integrated theoretical and econometric model

of fertility behavior within a sequential stochastic framework.    The prin-
cipal contribution of the paper is to the development of an appropriate

econometric methodology for dealing with some new econometric problems

that arise in such models. However, we also present in more tentative

form the rudiments of a theoretical model of sequential fertility choice

and some empirical estimates of the determinants of the monthly probability

of conception in the first birth interval whih utilizes our econometric
                                   —3—

methodology.

     Recognizing the sequential and stochastic nature of family decisions,

Ben—Porath suggests that "The proper framework for dealing with all the

theoretical considerations [involved in the economic analysis of fertility]

is a dynamic programming utility maximizing model with:the various risks

explicitly included." (Ben—Porath, 1973, p. 187).   In Section I, we formu-

late a very simple model of this type to characterize the way in which a

couple's contraception strategy evolves over its life cycle as a function

of the cost of contraception, age, parity, the time paths of income and

the cost of children. In each month of the child bearing period (excluding

sterile periods following pregnancy), a couple's contraception decision

is assumed to reflect (expected) utility maximizing choices in which the

costs of contraception are balanced against the utility associated with

each vossible fertility outcome weighted by the probability of that out-

come. Unfortunately, analytic results are difficult to achiive in such

models, even with drastic simplification of the underlying structure of

family decisionmaking. At its present stage of development, our theoretical

model serves mainly to illustrate the stochastic structure in which fer-

tility decisions are made and their consequences realized.

     Even without a fully rigorous theory it is possible to utilize the

concentual framework of a stochastic theory of reproduction in order to

determine empirically at what stages of the family building process and

through which channels economic variables affect realized fertility out-

comes. The full reproductive history of a woman (i.e. the timing of

each birth and contracentive choices in each birth interval) can be used

together with the associated economic history of her family in order to

investigate the impact of economic variables and accumulated experience

on the seauence of contraception decisions. beginning with marriage which
                                        —4—

 determine the monthly probability of conception and, hence, the proba-

 bility distribution of the timing, spacing and total number of births.

      In Section II, we present methods to obtain consistent parameter

 estimates of the effect of economic variables in modifying the monthly

 nrobabllity of conception in the stochastic process. In order to obtain

 consistent narameter estimates, a number of new econometric Droblems arise.

 In particular, we demonstrate that it is important to account explicitly

 for sources of sample variation, including variation among individuals

due to measured and unmeasured conm0nents. To avoid bias, it is especially

important to take into account persistent variations in the monthly proba-

bility of conception among individuals caused by unmeasured differences

in fecundity (i.e. the physiological capacity to reproduce), frequency

of coition or efficiency of contraception which, in turn, are related to

omitted economic variables and family characteristics which determine

health, the cost of contraception and the demand for children.

     Bias arises when persistent variation is ignored because of a selection

mechanisn which confounds changes in the behavior of an "averageT' couple

in a sample caused bya change in an economic variable —— the relation—

shii we seek ——   with   changes in .the composition of the sample caused by

differential probabilities of conception. For example, the group of

women who begin a given birth interval may have an average monthly proba-

bility of conception of 0.2. If all women had identical probabilities,

the conditional probability of conception in the second month of women

who did not become pregnant in the first month would be O.2r       If they

are not identical, however, women who survive the first month without con-

ceiving are, on the average, those with the lowest probabilities. Hence,

the conditional nrohahility of conception would tend to decline over time

because of a change in sample composition, hot a èhange in behavior.
                                    —5—

Further, we show that the mean probability of conception in the initial

group of women is downward biased if persistent variation is ignored.

Our econometric method enables us to estimate the fraction of persistent

variance in total variance at the same time that we obtain unbiased es—

tinates of the parameters of exogenous economic and demographic variables.

     In Section III, we present parameter estimates of the model from data

on the interval between narriare and first oregnancy.fron the 1965 Princeton

National Fertility Study.   flur empirical results suggest that the econo-

metric problems discussed in Section III are of considerable practical

importance.

 I.   Contraception Strategies and Realized Fertility in Stochastic

                             Models of. Reproduction


       Beginning with the seminalwork of Perrin and Sheps (1964), mathe-

 matical demographers have developed stochastic models of reproduction

 in order to study the effects of variations in fecundity (i.e. the bio-

 logical capacity to reproduce) and contraceptive practice on the number

 and timing of births over a woman's reproductive life cycle.. In this

 section, we ffrst describe the stochastic structure of these demographic

models and then show how choice—theoretic economic models of fertility

behavior can be embedded in it.

      During any month a woman is in one of five possible states:

              —   nonpregnant and fecundable
              —   pregnant
              — temporary sterile period due to anovulation following
                     an abortion or miscarriage

           53 —   temporary sterile period following a still birth
           54 —   temporary sterile periodfolLlowing a live birth

The woman's family building history (i.e., the number and timing of preg-

nancies and births) is completely described by the sequence of visits she

makes to these reproductive states and by the length of time spent in each

state at each visit. For instance, the total number of pregnancies she

has is equal to the number of transitions from            to S and the total

number of births to the number of transitions from
                                                          l to S4 Similarly,
the timing of the first conception for a woman who begins marriage in a

nonpregnant fecund state is equal to the length of her first stay in

while the length of her first birth interval is equal to the time from

marriage until the first ttansition from         to S4•

      If it is assumed that the length of stay in each state and the outcote

 a woman begins marriage in a fecund nonpregnant state              Each month

After a random length of time, she becomes pregnant, passin from             to

        The length of time she stays in       is a random variable whose mean

and   variance dependr on the pregnancy outcrme. For example, pregnancy
lasts an average of perhaps less than three months when terminated by
abortion or miscarriage and, of course, about nine months when terminated
by a live birth. Finally, each type of pregnancy outéome has a given
probability     which governs the likelihood that shewill pass     from S   to

       It is clear in this model that a couple confronts considerable un-

certainty about the number and timing of births, It is also clear that

if fertility outcomes are sublect to choice, this choice must be exer-

cised (excludinp abortion) through control of the monthly probability of

conception, p, by means of contraception or by variations in the frequency

and timing of coition over the menstrual cycle. The effect of contracep-

tion on the couple's chance of conception in any month may be expressed as


                                  p*p (l—e)

where p is the couple's "natural fecundability" (i.e., the monthly proba-

bility of conception in the absence of arjy     deliberate   attempt to control

achieved by      contracepting with efficiency e.3 The value of e depends on

both the technical characteristics of the method chosen and the care with

which it is used.

        The nature of contraception decisions and pregnancy outcomes for a

"typical individual" may he examined in more detail with the aid of the

elementary branching process depicted in Figure 2. The process is as-

sumed to begin in month 1 when the woman has first entered the nonnregnant

fectmd      state (S0)   at marriage or after a previous pregnancy    and ends with
her   nassape into the nregnant state             in month t   or at the end of the
period      of observation. Three types of contraception decisions are made

within each nregnancy interval.         (1) The counle Is assumed to decide

whether or not to contracept when the woman first enters S0.4 (2) If

the decision is to contracent, the counle selects a given level of contra—

centive efficiency, e, which determines the woman's monthly probability of

                     =                             (3) If, at the end of month t,

        3
       Natural fecundability is a somewhat misleading term because it
depends not only on the physiological characteristics of a woman and her
snouse      hut also on their "natural" natten
                                            of sexual activity. Variations
in sexual behavior ma'y arise from differences in sexual preferences of a
given couple at different times in their marriage, from variations in pre-
ferences among couples or from deliberate attemnts to increase or decrease the
chance of conception for enunles with given preferences. In the latter case,
of èourse, the frequency and pattern of coition should he considered as
variation in contraceptive efficiency rather than natural fecundability. Apart
from reported use of "rhythm" as a contraceptive method, however, it is difficult
to distinguish these two sources of variation empirically.

     4In Pigure 2, we assume that a woman who initially decides not to
contracept will never decide to contracept later in this pregnancy interval.
The main reason for this assumption is that our data record whether or not a
woman contracepted in a given interval ar.d when (and if) she discontinued
contracention hut do not record when she began contracepting. Since the nur—
nose of contraception is to delay or prevent pregnancy, it seems most plausible,
given our data, to assume that she begins contracention as soon as she is at
risk (i.e., enters S0).
                                             —10--


 the woman remains nonpregnant, the couple decides whether or not to dis-

 continue contracentlon.

        Observed fertility outcmnes follow as a probabilistic
                                                                       consequence of
 the contraception strategy adopted by a couple. The length of each nreg—

nancy interval is a random variable whose mean and variance are determined

   contraception decisions made within the interval. The sequence of these
decisions across intervals determines the probability distribution of the
total number of nrepnancies and births over a woman's reproductive span.

The contracention strategy chosen by a counle is assumed to reflect the

interaction of the couple's demand for children (including both number

and timing dimensions and embodying their attitude toward risk), the costs

of contraception and       their   past   childbearing experience.
        The effect of costly contraception on strategy choices and realized

fertility can be made clearer with the aid of a simple economic model.

Let us assume that a couple receives a flow of c units of child services

ner    child ter year for as long as the child remains in the household and
that   it   also   receives a flow of s units of other satisfactions unrelated

to children. The couple's lifetime utility function is assumed to be:

(1) intertenporally additive, (2) of identical form          in   each year, and

(3) characterized by a constant rate of time preference. It is written

as

where T is the family's time horizon in months from the date of marriage

at t =   0, d is the rate of tine preference, u(.) is the flow of utility
per month from its consumotion of c and a, Nt is the number of children

in the household in month t and     is the cost of contraception in month

t measured in utils.5 We assume that the monthly contraception cost

function takes the form

                                   f=f(e)                         (2)


where e is the efficiency of contraception, noncontraception is costless

[i.e. f(O)     0] and increases in efficiency are achieved at increasing

cost (i.e.   .L   ' >0).
     The couple is assumed to maximize expected lifetime utility subiect

to its lifetime resource constraint. For simplicity, we make the following

additional assumptions:    (4) that the household's full income is an exogenous

flow of      per month; (5) that ct and        the full resource (i.e. time and

money) costs per unit of c and s in period t, are exogenous and (6) that

no borrowing or lending is possible so that full monthly income is equal

to monthly expenditure on c and s. Thus, the flow budget constraint is


                                    iT cN + iT5t5t .                (3)

     Let us first examine the implications of the model under deterministic

conditions by assuming that contraception is costless (i.e. t aO) and

that there is no biological constraint on fertility (i.e. the couple may

choose with certainty to have a birth any time it wishes). At the beginning



     5Th princinle, the costs of contraception may include both resource
costs (i.e. time and money) and psychic (i.e. util) costs. For simplicity,
we have assumed that all costs are nsychic. One inplication of this is
that variations in contraception costs shift the utility function, not the
budget constraint. Consequently, variations in these costs cause no income
effects.

couple would optimally have all of its children simultaneously at the

widely spaced, the more rapidly rising is the life cycle profile of full.

                            examples, allowance might be made for (1)
variations in child "quality"
                               (e.g. by letting the number of units of
child services per child he

        The couple's expected lifetime utility at the beginning of the second

month of marriage is conditional on which event, conception or noncon—

cention, occurs in the first month. If the woman conceives in the month 1,

let V2(h1) be the couple's expected lifetime utility at the beginning of

month 2 on the assumption that the couple follows an optimal, expected

utility maximizing contraception strategy in all subsequent time periods

conditional on beginning month 2 in a pregnant state. Similarly, let

V2(_b1) be expected lifetime utility at the beginning of month 2 conditional

on   entering that month in a nonpregnant state.8 The couple's expected life-
time utility    at the beginning of marriage may then be written as


                  V01

costs of contraception), its expected lifetime utility is

             of preventing a conceütion is negative (e.g. NB), the couple will not con—

              tracept and will have a nrobability p of having a "desired" conception in

             month 1.

              of preventing the conception of the n+l child in month t. As before, the

              couñle's. optimal decision is not to contracept if AV+i(-b+1) is negative

              and,       if   it is positive, to select e such that f' =          PAVt+i(bn+i)•

              sequence of contraception decisions made by a couple depends on how the

     timing     and number of pregnancies and births the couple experiences.

           In   the first birth interval (i.e. the interval between marriage and
     first pregnancy),    parity remains constant at zero, hut time varies. As is

     indicated schematically in Figure 2, a number of alternative sequences of

     decisions within this interval are possible. If
                                                         AVt(_bi) is initially
 negative and remains so over time, the couple will not
                                                               contracept during
 the interval and, therefore, faces a constant monthly probability of con-

 ception, p. The length of time it takes the woman to conceive is a random

 variable, distributed geometrically with mean lip and variance (l—p)/p 211
 If                 is positive and remains roug1y constant over time, the couple

 will contracept at some given level of efficiency such as e1, in Figure 4

 until an "accidental" pregnancy occurs. In this case, the monthly pro-
 bability of conception is the constant p* = P(l—eb) and the mean and var-
 iance of waiting time to conception are increased to lfp.* and
 respectively.

         Mother possibility is that AV(_bi) is initially positive, but de-

creases over time until it becomes negative as would be indicated in

Figure 3 bya progressive decrease in the marginal benefit of contraceptive

efficiency from            to c In this case, according to Figure 4, the cou—
pie initially contracepts with efficiency eb and, assuming the woman re—

mains nonpregnant, continues to contracept, but with decreasing efficiency,

until NB becomes negative at which time the couple discontinues contracep-

tion. It follows that r continuously increases until it equals p at the

tine of discontinuation.'2
         11
     -        See, for exanole, Sheps (1964).
     12Another       less plausible possibility is that tv(-bi)
                                                           Is initially
negative and increases over tine until it becomes positive. In this case,
of course, the couple would begin contracenting once Avt(-bi) became posi-
tive, provided that the woman did not become pregnant in the initial period
of    noncontraception.

       To the extent that decreasing contraceptive efficiency involves a

switching of contraceptive techniques rather than using a given technique

with less care, the decline in efficiency may be substantially less than

would be indicated by following the marginal cost curve Od in Figure 3

as MB decreases. As an extreme example, suppose that a couple initially

chooses a technique such as the IUD which has a "technologically" fixed

level of efficiency equal to eb.          Further suppose that the monthly

cost   of wearing an IUD is zero once it has been insertedP The "supply"
of contraceptive efficiency, given the choice of an IUD, is then the
dotted   vertical line eg in Figure 4. As long as Av(_bi) is positive,

the couple contracepts with efficiency eb and faces the constant pro-

bability of conception 2*       (le) when Av(_b1) becomes negative, the

woman has the TUD removed.

       The theory can easily be extended to deal with the choice of contra-

ceptive techniques such as the IUD which involve fixed costs as well as

variable monthly "user" costs. To take the simplest example, suppose the

couple must choose either the 11Th or not contracept at all during the

first birth interval. The maximwn price (in utils) that the couple would

be willing to pay to have an 1111) inserted at the beginning of marriage is

equal to the discounted sum   of   expected utility   gains from wearing an IUD.

     13This assumption abstracts from that possibility that the 11Th produces
unpleasant and"costly" side effects such as cramping. We also abstract from
the possibility that the device may be expelled involuntarily.

                    P(l_eb) and (i—p )        is   the nrobability that the

woman goes t months without conceiving. If the demand price exceeds

the cost (in utils) of inserting an 11Th, the couple will contracept.

It is easy to see that the probability, of choosing the IUD is greater

the   more effective is the 11Th, the higher the marginal benefit of pre

venting a conception in each month, the lower is the rate of discount,
                                                     14
and the longer is the desired duration of use.

      So far, we have discussed how the marginal (and fixed) costs of

contraception interact with various possible tine paths of the marginal

benefit of contraception within the first birth interval to generate the

sequence of decisions to contracept or not contracept, to select optimal

levels of contraceptive efficiency and to discontinue contraception which

are depicted schematically in Figure 2. Clearly, a similar analysis of

contraception decisions in subsequent birth intervals is possible. For

example, a decision to contracept in the first month — say t —
                                                                      t2
                                                                           —   that
awonan enters the nonpregnant fecund state            after the birth of her

first child would be optimal if the marginal benefit of contraception,

             is positive. The sign and magnitude of Av2( b2) depends

both on the woman's parity — she now has one child — and on the timing

of her first birth which is   the   probabilistic outcome of contraception

decisions   in the first birth interval.
      In general, our model suggests that the reproductive history of a
woman (i.e. the number and timing of pregnancies and births) may be




     4The extension of this analysis to choice among many alternative
forms of contracention which have different fixed and variable costs is
straiczhtfoniard, but beyond the scope of this paper. For an analysis of
the choice of contraceptive technique in a static framework, see Michael'
and Willis (1973).

regarded    as the realization of a stochastic process whose parameters

are determined by the biological capacity of a couple to reproduce and

by the sequence of contraception decisions the couple makes. These

decisions, in turn, depend on the costs of contraception and the sign

and   magnitude of the marginal benefits of contraception (pvt(-b) as
it varies with time and parity.

        It is apparent that any hypotheses that nay emerge from our model

        the effect of economic variables on contraception decisions and

realized fertility depend crucially on our capacity to derive the rela-

tionship between these variables and the ev(-b). Formally, the model

of optimal decisiornuaking that we have specified requires a couple to

solve a stochastic dynamic programming problem at the beginning of each

month from marriage to menopause whose answer is summarized by the sign

and magnitude of AV     C-b).   Unfortunately, the rigorous analysis of

these   dynamics programming problems remains on our agenda of future
research. 15




      l5 issues that may occur to the reader at this point deserve
brief comment. First, it is known that stochastic dynamic programming
problems are difficult to solve and often do not yield.many predictions.
We are encouraged on this issue by the recent work of Mccabe and Sibley
(1973) who have obtained comparative static results using dynamic pro—
granmiing techniques in a model of sequential fertility behavior which
assumes perfect fertility control but allows for uncertainty about future
income and wage rates. Second, it may    strain the credibility of the read-
er to suppose that behavior is in fact governed by the complex calculations
implied by our model. Without attempting to add to or resolve the ancient
controversy concerning the realism or relevance of deriving hypotheses
by assuming optimizing behavior, we shall simply assert that it is plausi-
ble to imagine that "rules of thumb" or "behavioral- norms" which emerge
to guide decisionmaking in complex situations tend to be peroetuated to
the extent they anproximate optimal decisions. If this is the case,
optimizing models can be a fruitful source of empirical hypotheses
about behavior.

      It   is possible, however, to use a simple two period dynamic pro-

 gramming model to   illustrate   the meaning of MIt (ba) more concretely

 than we have done so far and to shot.- how current contraception decisions

 are influenced by a ,ositive probability of "accidental" pregnancies

 in the future under conditions of costly and imperfect contraception.

 Paradoxically, for example, we can show that a couple might find it op—

 tinal to contracept when contraception is costly in situations in which

 it would not contracept if contraception were perfect and costless.        This

 implies that, under certain conditions, a decrease in the marginal cost of

 contraception may decrease the probability that a couple. contracepts. A

motivation for such behavior is suggested by the demographer Nathan Keyfitz

 (1971) who argues that the increase in the efficiency of modern birth con-

trol techniques ha allowed couples to concentrate their childbearing in

the early veers of marriage   instead   of spacing them widely to avoid the

chance .of ending up with "excess" fertility.

     To examine the plausibility of Keyfitz's argument for "precautionary

contraceptiont', consider the following two period model. Let us suppose

that a couple has N* — 1 children at the beginning of period 1 and that
the per period flow of utility from children is such that v(N*_l) cv(N*)
     *                             *
> v(N +1) so that we may say that N is the desired stock of children. 16


The couple's decision problem is to decide whether or not to contracept

during period 1.




     16ror ex-nositional simnlicity, we assume that children are conceived
at the beginning of a period and horn at the end of the period after which
they provide utility to their parents; that the rate of time preference is
zero and that there is no sterile period following birth. Under conditions
of certainty, the coule's maximum lifetime utility at the beginning of
period 1 would he v(N ) + v(N ).

       The   couple hepins period 2 with either N or N —l children dependin

N     — 1 children, ft maximizes expected utility in the final period by not

contracenting. In this case, using the tiotation we defined for the general

T neriod model, its expected utility at the beginning of period 2 is

                                 =    v(N*   —   1) + n v(N*) + (l_n)v(N* —1).

If the couple begins neriod 2 with N* children, it is optimal to contracept

in    order to reduce the chance           of "excess fertility".           Its expected utility
is

where n =     n   (1—e2) is the probability of having the                    + 1       child, f(e2) is
the cost of contracention in period 2, and e2, the ontimal level of contra-
ceptive efficiency, is chosen such that the marginal benefit ((i.e.
p[v(N*) _v(N* + 1)])]and marginal cost (i.e.                     f') of contraception are equated.

       The   counle's decision about whether or not to contracept at the be—
ginning of    period   1 depends on the sign of AV2(—h) = V2(_h*)                         —

which,   as before, is internreted as the expected utility of nreventing a
conceotion in period 1 on the assumntion that the counle pursues optimal
(expected utility maximizing) decisions in future neriod(s). t'sthg the
expressions derived above, we see that

        (f contracention       is nerfect (i.e.           n=   (1)   and costless (i.e. f(e2) O),
tV2(.h*)     is negative since v(N — 1)               <   v(N*).      In this caSe, the counle

will not contracept in period 1. in order to maximize its chance of having

the   N* child. If, however, contraception is                   costly and imperfect, the

nositive terms, p      (v(N)         —   v(N*    + l)j +f(e2), nay he of sufficient magni-

tude   to make    tV (_b*) nositive and, as Keyfitz conjectured, lead the

  couple to contracept before reaching its "desired" number of children.

          These positive terms have a simple economic interpretation as the

  total opportunity cost of imperfect contraception. Thu may be illus-

 rectangle ebilea. The upper limit of the opportunity cost of imperfect

 contraception is equal to the direct cost of perfect cntraception

 (i.e. f(e2) =    f(l))   given by area ode in Figure 4

         In our two period example, it   is   evident that a necessary condition
 for a couple to engage in precautionary contraception is that the loss of
 potential utility from one child too many, v(N*) v(N *+1), is substantially
 greater than-the loss from one child too few, v(N*)            *
                                                           — v(N —1). While this
mightbe true, it need not be. Indeed, on grounds of svmetrv it might be
argued that, on the average, the losses from one too few children and one
too many children are about equal so that precautionary contraception would

occur in only a minority of cases. Possibly, the incentive to engage in pre—

cautionary contraception is greater in the general multi—period case because

of the chance of higher levels of excess fertility (i.e. the chance of having

births N + 2, N* + 3 and so on). Unfortunately, examination of this possi-
        *



bility must await rigorous analysis of the more general model.

       We shall conclude this section by considering the effects of variations

in economic variables on the optimal path of contraception decisions a couple

would follow under the simplifying assumption that it may contracept perfectly

at zero cost. In this way, we eliminate consideration of the effect on current
                                        —25—


decisions   of the risk of future contraception costs and risks of "ccci—

dental" pregnancies while contracepting       since f(e) 0 and p      0   in

every month in which txV(-bn)       is positive. The analysis is nearly    iden-

tical to our earlier discussion of fertility behavior in the absence of a

biological constraint on fertility, except that now the couple cannot ob-

tain children as ranidly as it wishes.

     Recall, for example, that we showed that if       the   flow of full income,

    and    the   relative cost of child services, ii/ir, are constant over

the life cycle, the optimal stock of children, N, is also a constant —

say N —     in   even nonth. In this case, the couple will not contracept
                       *
until a rarity of N is reached and will        contracect perfectly thereafter.

Although sufficient changes in the levels of income or cost of child ser-

vices nay change the optimal stock of children, they will have no effect
                                                                *
on behavior (e.g. the monthly probability of conception) until N is
                                *
reached.    For instance, if N is always greater than one child, variations

in income and the cost of children will not influence contraception deci-

sions in the first birth interval.

     [f the cost of child services follows a rising time path (e.g. because

of an increasing ware profile of the wife) and I is constant, our earlier

discussion implies that the optimal stock of children will tend to decrease

at discrete time intervals during the life cycle. Provided that the optimal

stock at the beginning of marriage exceeds one child, the couple will not

contracept during the first birth interval. Since the timing of the first

birth is a random variable, the optimal stock of children at the beginning

of the second birth interval will vary across individual households which

initially    had identical "fertility goals". Those couples who had their
first child quickly would have larger optimal stocks of children at the be-
ginning of the second      interval than those who took longer to conceive the
                                            — 26 —


 first child. Consequently, the probability that a couple will go on
 to   have a   second child   i.s negatively   related to the   length of the

 fIrst birth interval. Extending the argmBent to subsequent birth in—
 tervals, the probability that a couple terminates childbearing with the
nth child is positively related to the length of tine it has taken the
 couple to achieve parity ii.       Thus,   in the case of an exogenousF,r rising
time path of the cost of child services, the connleted fertility of a
group of initially identical households is dependent on the realized                         timing
               17
of births.

       A different nattern of behavior is implied by the assumption of a

rising time path of full income assuming constant r                /   ir        since, as
                                                              ct            gt
we showed earlier, the optimal stock of children, ,N, will tend to in-

crease at discrete tines during the life cycle. If N: = 0 for a period

of time, the cOuPle will contracent at the beginning of marriage, then dis—
                                                                                         *         18

                                                                                       Nt
If the first child is hon before N: increases to two, the couple will again

practice contracettion in the second interval, discontinue when N; = 2 and

so on until the highest value of N; is reached at the neak of the income

profile (assuming that I remain constant thereafter). Once actual parity

reaches this level (there is, of course, some probability that it will not),



     17An interesting extension of this analysis would be to consider the
interaction between contraception strategy and the wife's accumulation of
human canital via labor force exnerience. See Mincer and Polachek (1974)
for evidence that female waae rates are quite resnonsive to labor force
experience which, in turn, is strongly related to the wife's reproductive
history.

     18Assuming that a malor purpose of marriage is to have.children, a
(notential) couple may delay marriage until N = 1.. Anothernossibility,
of course, is that marriage may he delayed until an actual parity of one
is imminent. Despite these considerations, we treat the date of marriage
as an exoenous event in this naper.                       -
                                      — 27 —


the couple will contracept permanently. This analysts suggests that the
more steeply rising is the income profile, the more likely it is that

counles will contracent in order to space their births.'9 It also im-

plies that the probability that a couple will contracept for spacing pur-
poses   in the second or higher   intervals   is greater, the faster its earlier

births occurred. Finally, an upward shift in the level of the income pro-

file (or decrease in the cost of child services) will tend to increase

N: for all t=l,..., T, thus reducing the probability that a couple will

contracept at any given tine and increasing the maximum value of N:.

        In this section, we have shown how a choice—theoretic economic model

of fertility behavior can be embedded in the stochastic structure of

demographic models of reproduction depicted in Figures 1 and 2. Our model

implies that the sequence of decisions to contracept, the choice of contra-

ceptive efficiency and decisions to discontinue contraception that are made

as a couple proceeds through its reproductive life cycle may he internreted

as a contraception strategy in which decisions at each time and parity level

are based on current and future values of income, costs of child services

and costs of contraception. It also implies that a woman's actual reproduc-

tive history can be interpreted as the probabilistic consequence of this

strategy.

        It is clear that much remains to be done before a complete economic

model of fertility behavior within a sequential stochastic framework is

achieved. The rather simple model specified in this paper has not yet been

fully analyzed in the general T period case under conditions of imperfect




          we noted earlier, in a perfect caoital market the value of
depends only on the present value of the income profile and S independent
of its shape. In thiscase, the slope of the time pathof N is rising,
constant, or falling according to whether the rate of interek is greater
than, equal to, or less than the rate of time preference.
                                             —28—

  contraception.        Consequently, we are not yet certain what imolications

 the model has for effects of variation in the levels and tine paths of

 income and the cost        of   children on optimal contraception decisions when

 there are risks of future "accidental" pregnancies.
         It   is   also evident that the specification of the model abstracts
 from a number of aspects of family decisionmaking and the environment in

 which these decisions are made which probably have a substantial impact

 on contraception strategy. For examvle, we have assumed that the flow of

 child services from a given child and the costs of producing these services

 are independent of the child's age, sex or other traits and the presence

 and characteristics of other children. We have also assumed that the

 flow of services from a child cannot be increased by the expenditure of

 resources on child quality".           Obviously,   specification of a household

production function for child services which incorporated these factors

might considerably alter the implications of the model for desired spacing

patterns      under perfect contraception and attitudes toward the risk of
unwanted pregnancies under imperfect contraception. Other factors that

deserve consideration include the effect on fertility decisions of uncer-

tainty about future income and wage rates; decisions concerning investments

in human capital and life cycle labor supply by husbands and wives; and

decisions about the timing of marriage and choice of spouse's characteris-

tics.


        While further theoretical progress is highly desirable, it is of equal

importance to design and implement empirical methods by which we nay deter-

mine the effect of economic variables on realized fertility as these effects

are channeled through the sequence of decisions we have cAlled a couple's

contraception strategy. Our ultimate empirical objective is to           use   data

on the full reproductive histories of women- to estimate the effect of
                                   —29—

economic variables and prior experience with the fertility process on

contraception decisions in successive birth intervals. Ey directly

estimating the constituent probabilities of the fertility process (i.e.

the probability of contracepting, the monthly probability of contracep-

tion conditioned on contraception and the probability of discontinuing

contraception) as it evolves over the reproductive life cycle, we can

explain completed fertility as well as the timing, spacing and contra-

ception decisions which lead to completed fertility. We can then use the

estimated probabilities to simulate the effects of economic variables on

the aggregate birth rate, and can determine at what stages and in what

decisions economic variables contribute to the explanation of observed

fertility outcomes.

     It is obvious, however, that many additional, usually unmeasured and

frequently persistent factors influence contraception decisions and fertility

outcomes. Among these are variations among couples in natural fecundability

due to differences in health or taste for sexual activity and variations in

contraceptive efficiency caused by differences in the taste for children

or distaste for using contraceptives. As we demonstrate theoretically in

the next section and empirically in the final section, these unmeasured

components of persistent variation in p and e raise a serioSs statistical

problem in obtaining unbiased estimates of the effect of economic variables

on the monthly probability of conception of the representative or average

couple in a sample. We now turn to an examination of this problem and

present a method for resolving it as one step   toward   our longer run objec-

tive of estimating the stochastic structure of an economic model of repro-

duction.

                         II.       Serial Correlation Problems


        In the previous section, we presented an economic model of fertility

 behavior within a sequential stochastic framework. It is important to note

 that this structure, as represented by the schema in Figures 1 and 2 of

 the previous section, has been presented only for a typical individual.

Unless very strong statistical assumptions are made, the simple• semi—

Markov structure does not lead to a sample likelihood, function in which

estimated parameterized probabilities can be said to predict accurately

the probabilities of observed events for individuals. To see that this

is   so, it is   important to distinguish three sources of variation in ob-

served   birth intervals among individuals: (1) purely random factors
that arise independently in each time period, and are independent of ran-
dom factors in other time periods, (2) random factors, including unobser-
vable   variables, that are correlated across time periods, (3) deterministic
variables such as income and education that can be measured, and which are
assumed to affectthe probabilities.
      To fix ideas, suppose we are concerned solely with estimating the
probability process determining whether a woman has a first pregnancy.
Inherent in the model is the notion of a time series of events. A woman
has a first pregnancy in month I only if she has not had a first pregnancy
in months 1,... ,j—l. The most general way to model this probability is to
imagine a set of continuous random        variables               ...,   which may be
thought of as index functions. The S1, i=l, ...,                 , are   assumed to be

intercorrelated, The event Of a woman becoming pregnant in the first

interval   depends on what value the "wheel of chance" throws up for
Supnose that her education E is the only economic variable of interest.
We may then define       +
                             a1E
                                   so that if      < a

reversed, the woman         is not nregnant and stays in                the sample. The probability

       Notice that there is an alternative "incidental parameters" argument
that   leads directly to equation (22). Sunnose it is        argued that in an or—
dinary      prohit model a disturbance "c" appears. This may he viewed as an

incidental parameter with density function h(c). Following a suggestion

of Kiefer and t'olfovjtz (1956), the nrohlem of incidental parameters has

precisely the solution written in equation (21) and for the normal case

this solution becomes eouatton (22). In a simple one period nrobit model,

such   as   one designed to   explain the purchase of   refrigerators in a cross

                                                       is possible. An individual

    probabilities of Pregnancy               at   each interval for a Riven value of t.           "C" is,

                                                         by a density function h(c). Then the

 processes and is given 1w equation (21).22

                                            outcomes imposes the constraint of
  constancy on conditional probabilities, It
                                                   is intuitively obvious, and
  formally correct, that if persistence

  parameter estimates, a time trend that
                                              does not belong in the model night
  nonetheless prove statistically significant,

          Since serial correlation in
                                        ordinary regression models does not lead
  to bias in coefficient
                        estimates, it is imnortant to motivate why it leads
 to bias En our case. To show
                               what is involved, consider
                                                          specializing the
 simple model further so that there are only two education
                                                           classes. Suppose,
 in particular, that E assumes the value of zero or 1
                                                            corresponding to low
 or high levels of education. For
                                        each education class, we may estimate a
 monthly probability of becoming pregnant P (I)     where   1—0   for low     education
 women and i—I.   for   high education women, Given a functional form for the
 distribution of the     S, a , ,,, , we      may solve P(1)   uniquely       for a*

This may be done in several ways all of which lead
                                                   to the same estimate.
One way is to partition
                             the data on length of time to first pregnancy by
educationaj level, and estimate the Average interval for each education
class. The inverse of these two averages leads to estimates
                                                             of the
monthly   probability of pregnancy assuming
                                               that serial correlation is
absent.    A second, and equivalent
                                      approach, is to maximize    the   sample



                                                                                          L

         Note that these estimators. are the correct maximum likelihood

 estimators       assuming no serial correlation. The procedure yields                con-'
 sistent estimators Of mean lengths of duration to first pregnancy even
 in samples with serial correlation since the population mean is the same
 for all observations and IChinchine's theorem readily applies.24 However,
 in the presence of serial correlation, the mean length.of duration is not

 simply related to any measure of direct interest. In fact, the inverse of

 the   mean duration est*aates the harmonic mean of the probabilities
                                    Pr(S'ca +aiEit)
 over   all value of c .      To see this, note that the mean duration to first

pregnancy    is simply                    .

        23Thus,   in   constructing this function, if           a highly   educated woman
goes L—l months without pregnancy and becomes pregnant in the tth nth,
the probability of this event is

                                   (1 —       p(l))t-'1pfl)
Similarly, if the sample period is T months, highly educated woman
never gets pregnant with probability (l-P(l)) . Producting these proba-
bilities associated with observed events, we reach the probability of
the sample outcomes. Choosing value of P(l) which maximizes this prob-
ability yields maximum likelihood estimates of P(l). Defining N1 as
the number of women who become pregnant in month I

observaTion period. Thus maximizing     (1), or equivalently in/ (1), the
çstimator for P(l)               P Ni               P

tory variables apart from education are included as well.
        In addition to solv!ng problems of bias, direct estimation of the
probabilities allows us to solve the problem of open     intervals. If a
given sample covers only a portion of a woman's reproductive history,       it
is likely that some portion of the sample will not conceive. For such
women, the probability of this event is easily derived and such data may
be pooled in sample likelihood fashion with data from women who conteive.

   III.    Empirical Results

           This section presents estimates
                                              of the monthly probability of con-
   ception in the first
                           pregnancy interval following conception using the

   econollietric model developed in the
                                          preceding section. The data consist
   of a sample of white
                           non—Catholic women, married once with husband

  present for 15—19 years from the 1965 Princeton National Fertility         26
                                                                      Study.
  The sample of all such. women was reduced by eliminating
                                                           women who reported
  premarital conc!ptions or who had missing values for relevant variables.
  The   sample was   then divided into two groups,
                                                     contraceptors and   noncontra
  ceptors,   on the basis of the woman's
                                           response to a question concErning
  the contraceptive methods she used before her first
                                                      pregnancy (or in her
  current interval if she had not had
                                          a pregnancy). Summary statistics on
 the two groups are presented in Table 1 including the
                                                       means and variances
 of the three independent
                               variables (wife's education (ii), wife's
                                                                          age (A),
 and husband's predicted income at age 40 (0)) whose influence
                                                               on the monthly
 probability of conception is estimated.

        Women in each subsample were "followed"
                                                     for a tazimum of 120 months
 beginning with their first month of
                                         marriage. Among the non—contraceptors
we estimate the monthly
                            probability of conception in the first
                                                                      pregnancy

       Husband's predicted income is based on an estimated regression re—
lationship between husband's income and his education, and experience (i.e.,
age minus years of schooling minus 6) from data on all white non—Catholic
men in the 1965 NFS sample for husbands. The variable H is then. imputed
for men in the current sample on the basis of the man's education, with
age set arbitrarily at 40. Thus, H may be interpreted as a transformation
of husband's education or as his permanent income, depending on the reader's
preference.

                                                    function implied by equation
  (22) we estimate parameters which maximize the likelihood of observing

  the events that occurred in this subsample. These events are (1) that

  a given woman conceived in month     (j —   1,   ...,   120) or (2) that she
 went 120 months without conceiving.
                                        Among the contraceto, we estimate
 in similar fashion the monthly
                                  probability of conception given that the

 woman is contracepting. In this case, the events we observe are (1)

 that a woman conceives in month j while
                                              using a contraceptive; (2) that
 the woman uses a contraceptive for k months
                                                   without conceiving, at which
 time she discontinues contraception (this decision is treated as an

 exogenous event); or (3) she continues using contraception for 120 months

 and does not conceive. 28

      Parameter estimates for the non—contraceptors are
                                                        presented in
 Table 2A and for contraceptors in Table 2B.       In each group, we estimated
six models which differ in the number of parameters estimated in order to

determine the statistical significance of
                                               individual parameters or sets




      27The methods used are described in (oldfeld and Quandt (1972, Ch. 1).
Two algorithms, Powell and GRADX, were used in tandem to ensure that the
estimates are stable. That is, in the first stage the parameters of the
likelihood function were estimated by the Powell method. These parameters
were then given as initial values in a GR.ADX optimization procedure whose
final parameter values are reported in this paper. The computer program,
written by C. Ates Dagli and Ralph Shnelvar, is available from the authors
on request.

          we noted in footnote 4, p. 9, our data only record whether a woman
contracepted in a given pregnancy interval and when and if she discontinued
contraception. They do not record when she began contracepting or any other
interruptions in contraceptions other than the final decision to discontinue.

of parameters using likelihood ratio tests.29

     Among these parameters, we have a particular interest in the magnitude

of the serial correlation coefficient, p, its statistical significance and

the influence of its inclusion or exclusion from the econometric model

on the other parameters of the model (i.e., the constant term, °o' and the

coefficients of A, W and H which are, respectively, a1, a and a3). Accord-

ingly, we present two estimates of each set of a's in Table 2, one in

which p is constrained to be zero and one in which p is free to assre a

nonzero value.

     It is easy to see in Table 2 that p is positive and statistically

significaàt in every instance.30 Among the non—contraceptors p — 0.450

when only the constant term is entered and fails to 0.426 when the wife's

age at marriage is held constant, but does not fall any further when wife's

education and husband's predicted income are added to the model. Similarly,

the estimate of p in the contracepting subsample falls from 0.549 to 0.531

when A is held constant and to 0.526 when W and H are also held constant.

If we recall that the definition of p is the fraction of persistent

variance   (a2) in total variance (a2 + cr2), the decrease in p is easily
understood as showing that the exogenous variable A in the non—contracepting
subsample and    the   variables A, H and W   in   the contratepting subsample con-
tribute to   the persistent component of variation in conception probabilities




         property      of maximum likeli,hood estimation is that twice the
difference in log      likelihood between two equations (within set A or set 3)
is distributed as      Chi—square with n degrees of freedom where n is the
difference in the      number of parameters in the two equations.

     30Comparing lines (1) and (1') in Table 2, for example, we find that
log likelihood rose from —692.71 to —619.50, a difference of 73.21. Twice
the difference in log likelihood is 146.4 while the critical value of
chi—square with one degree of freedom at the .95 level is 4.6.

among women in the two subsamples. The small size of the decrease in o,

however, also shows that the contribution of other factors we have not

held constant constitutes the malor fraction of persistent variation. This

suggests that it is unlikely that the heterogeneity problem can be overcome

simply by holding constant a number of observable variables.

       The size of the decrease in p caused by the addition of exogenous

variables is, of course, related to the statistical significance of these

variables. The wife's age at marriage is the only variable to pass a test

of statistical significance at conventional levels in either subsample.31

Wife's education and husband's predicted income are utterly without effect

on log likelihood in the non—contracepting subsample (e.g., the change in

log likelihood from line (2') to line (3').is 0.03). This is not entirely

surprising because the channels through which education and income may

affect the monthly probability of conception among non—contraceptors are

essentially limited to correlations of these variables with health or

coital frequency.

       Our theory suggests that we should expect to find a larger impact

of income and education on the monthly probability of conception among

contraceptors. In this group, variation in conception probabilities is

caused by variation in contraceptive efficiency due to differences in the

techniques   chosen and the care with which a given tech*ique is used as
well as variation in natural fecundability. Comparing lines (5') and       (6'),

we   find that the change in log likelihood is not completely trivial (twice


               the change in log likelihood from line (1') to line (2') for
noncontraceptors is 12.1 and the corresponding change from   line (4')
                                                                     to
line (5') for contraceptors is 6.2, both of which exceed the 0.95 confidence
level. Wife's age is also significant in the equations in which a    is
constrained to equal zero.

 the difference in log likelihood is 2.9), but it falls well below conven
 tional   levels of significance. 32
        Estimates of    the monthly probability of conception and the effects

 of   changes in exogenous variables on that probability differ substantially
 depending      on whether or not serial correlation is taken into account. In

 Table 3, we present examples of estimates of levels and changes in the

 nrnthly probability of conception among non—contraceptors and contraceptors

with and without p constrained to equal zero. These estimates are derived

 from the parameter estimates in Table 2. Before tuning to Table 3, it

will be helpful to show how the estimates in Table 3 are derived from those

in Table-2 and how they are to be interpreted in light of our statistical

discussion in Section II.

        When p is constrained to equal zero, we proved in Section II that the

resulting estimate of the monthly probability of conception is an unbiased

estimate of the harmonic means of the conception probabilities of the in-

dividual women in the sample. Let the harmonic mean be             for noncontracept—
ors and         for- contraceptors. If p were truly equal to len (i.e., if all

women in a sample had identical conceptionnprobabilities), then the harmonic

means would equal the arithmetic sans of the two grouns, p and p*. If we

are   interested in measuring the arithmetic means, the difference between
  and     (or    between *   and   *) measures   the bias caused by ignoring serial
correlation.
      In order to make this comparison, it is necessary to evaluate p and *



      32The     critical value of Chi—square with two added parameters is 6.0
at the 0.95 level. Since the critical value with one added parameter is
4.6, it is clear that neither B nor W would be significant if entered alone
into the equation.

at    the beginning of the first month of marriage. The reason for this is

that when serial correlation is present, the conditional probability of

conception      in month I of the subsamfle of women who have gone j—l         months

without    conceiving iA nailer the larger is I          because   the most fecund
women tend to be selected out of the original sample by conceiving in
the early months of the interval.
        The deriviatjonr'of estimates of       and   *   evaluated   at the outset of
marriage    from   the parameter estimates in Table 2 is straightforward. We
need only read off the appropriate values from a table of the standard
normal    integral. If we consider line (1') in Table 2, for example, then

(1     ), the    monthly probability of not conceiving among non—contraôeptore

in    the first month of marriage is
                                a —1.214

so that     —
                .113,   the value which is entered in line 1(b) in Table 3A. When
serial correlation is not      allowed, the value of a0 in         the upper limit of
the   integral is 2.016 (see line (1) in Table 2) so that — 1022, the value

which is entered in line 1(a) of. Table 3A. Thus, we see that bias from

not considering setial correlation is quite larger. Similarly, in lines 2(b)

and 2(a) of Table 3 we see that the arithmetic mean monthly probability of

conception among contraceptors is * — .038 and the            harmonic mean is       —   .012.
       In Table 3B, we    evaluate the monthly probability of conception for several
values   of wife's age at marriage for non—contraceptors and contraceptors with

and without p constrained to be zero from parameter estimatessin line! (2),

(2'), (5) and (5') in Table 2. Here, we notice that the effect of increased

wifets age is to reduce the probability of conception in both groups and that

this negative effect is markedly greater when serial correlation is taken

into account. There is some evidence from these estimates that failure to
                                      - 50   -




account for serial correlation results in downward biased estimates of

contraceptive efficiency, e. Recall from Section I, that we defined the

monthly probability of conception while contracepting as      —    p(l    — e)

from which it follows that e   1 —   p*/p.   Using the estimates for 20 year

old women in lines 3(a) and 6(a) in Table 3 we may compute contraceptive

efficiency as e — 1 —      — .5 when p is constrained equal to zero, while,

from estimates in lines 3(b) and 6(b), we compute e — 1 —   p*/p   —     .67 when
p is unconstrained.

     In parts C and P of table 3, we evaluate the ceteris paribus effects

of variations in wife's education and husband's predicted income, on the

probability of conception among contraceptors using the parameter estimates

contained in lines (6) and (6') of Table 3•34 The most notable features

of these estimates are that husband's predicted income appears to have a

large negative impact on * suggesting that higher husband's income is

associated with improved contraceptive efficiency while wife's education

has, if anything, a slight positIve effect on p*.

     This finding, if it is not simply a result of imprecision in our para-

meter estimates, is rather surprising because it is wife's education that

has been found repeatedly to have a substantial negative impact on completed

fertility while husband's predicted income has a weaker, non—monotsnic effect




     33The absolute values of e should not be taken too seriously because
it is quite likely that the natural fecundability, p,. of non—contraceptors
is lower than that of contraceptors since one of the reasons for not con—
tracepting is subfecundity or sterility. A more complete econometric model
would allow for the decision to contracept to be determined simultaneously
with the monthly probability of conception in order to reduce or eliminate
this selection bias.

     341t should be emphasized that neither W nor H was statistically signi-
ficant and, therefore, that little confidence may be placed in the magnitude
or signs of tFir effects.

(see, for example, Willis, 1973). However, it should also be noted that

Michaeland Willis in their paper at this Conference have found that hus-

band's predicted income has a significantly positive effect on the pro-

bability that couples used the highly effective oral contraceptive pill

in the period 1960—64 while wife's education had a weaker, non—aonotonic

ef feet on this probability. While both our finding and the Michael—Willis

finding are based on data from the 1965 National Pertilitt Study, their

samples and ours are independent.35 Moreover, estimates of completed

fertility equations from 1965 PD'S data yield very similar results to those

estimated by Willis (1973) from 1960 Census data. These apparently contra-

dictory effects of husband's income and wife's education on completed

fertility and contraceptive efficiency present a puzzle. Hopefully, future

research will determine whether the apparent contradiction is genuine and,

if so, how to resolve it.
