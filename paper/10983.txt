This paper examines whether financial development boosts the growth of small firms more than
large firms and hence provides information on the mechanisms through which financial development
fosters aggregate economic growth. We define an industry's technological firm size as the firm size
implied by industry specific production technologies, including capital intensities and scale
economies. Using cross-industry, cross-country data, the results indicate that financial development
exerts a disproportionately large effect on the growth of industries that are technologically more
dependent on small firms. This suggests that financial development accelerates economic growth by
removing growth constraints on small firms and also implies that financial development has sectoral
as well as aggregate growth ramifications.

I.      Introduction

        Although a large literature suggests that financial development fosters economic growth,

considerably less research examines the cross-firm, cross-industry distributional effects of financial

development.1 Some theories imply that financial development boosts economic growth by

disproportionately fostering small firm growth. If smaller, less wealthy firms face tighter credit

constraints than large firms face due to greater informational barriers or high fixed costs associated

with accessing financial systems, then financial development that ameliorates market frictions will

exert an especially positive impact on smaller firms (Banerjee and Newman, 1993; Galor and Zeira,

1993; Aghion and Bolton, 1997).2 In contrast, other research suggests that most small, less wealthy

firms, especially in poor countries, cannot afford financial services, so that financial development

disproportionately facilitates the growth of large firms (Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990).3

        This paper assesses whether financial development boosts the growth of small firms more

than large firms and hence sheds empirical light on (1) debates concerning the distributional

implications of financial development, (2) one mechanism through which financial development

may affect aggregate economic growth, and (3) a large policy-oriented literature that stresses the

importance of small firm growth for economic development. In terms of public policies, the World

Bank (1994, 2002, 2004) argues that small firms foster competition, innovation, and employment to

a greater degree than large firms and has devoted more than $10 billion in the last five years toward

  See Levine (2005) for a review of the literature on financial development and growth. Specifically, cross-country
studies (King and Levine 1993; Beck, Levine, and Loayza 2000; Levine, Loayza, and Beck 2000), firm-level studies
(Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic 1998), and industry-level studies (Rajan and Zingales 1998; Wurgler 2000) find that
the level of financial development is positively related to growth and this relationship is not due only to simultaneity
bias. Aghion, P., Howitt, and D. Mayer-Foulkes (2005) find that financial development accelerates the speed of
convergence toward a steady state, but does not influence steady-state growth.
2
  In these models, financial development that lowers information or transaction costs disproportionately benefits less
wealthy entrepreneurs. In terms of U.S. banks, Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) find that efficiency improvements reduced
fixed costs included in loan prices, helping small firms.

  Levine and Schmukler (2003, 2004) provide evidence that international financial liberalization has primarily benefited
large, rich firms. Also, local banking monopolies may foster close relationships between banks and small firms and

promoting small enterprises. Rather than examining whether small firms per se accelerate growth,

we examine whether financial under-development exerts a particularly onerous impact on small

firms. Furthermore, while considerable research suggests that finance is closely associated with

economic growth, dissecting the mechanisms connecting finance and growth provides information

on whether – and if so how -- financial development causes growth, or whether financial

development is simply associated with fast growing economies. Toward this end, this paper

examines whether financial development accelerates growth by boosting small firm growth.

Finally, as stressed above, financial development may have distributional implications. This paper

examines whether financial development is particularly good for large firms or small firms, or

whether financial development has a balanced impact on firms of different sizes.

         We examine whether industries that are composed of small firms for technological reasons

grow faster in economies with well-developed financial systems. As formulated by Coase (1937),

firms should optimally internalize some activities, but size enhances complexity and coordination

costs. Thus, an industry’s optimal firm size depends on that industry’s particular production

technologies, including capital intensities and scale economies (Kumar, Rajan, and Zingales, 2001).

Given estimates of each industry’s technological firm size, we use a sample of 44 countries and 36

industries in the manufacturing sector to examine the growth rates of different industries across

countries with different levels of financial development. If “small-firm industries” – industries

naturally composed of small firms for technological reasons – grow faster than “large-firm

industries” in economies with more developed financial systems, then this suggests that (i) financial

development boosts the growth of small-firm industries more than large-firm industries and (ii) one

mechanism through which financial development accelerates growth is by fostering the growth of


thereby increase credit availability to small firms (Petersen and Rajan, 1994, 1995). If financial development intensifies
competition and breaks these monopolies, it may also hurt small firms.


                                                            2
small firms. Instead, if financial development disproportionately boosts the growth of large-firm

industries, then this implies quite different distributional effects. Finally, financial development

may foster balanced growth, and therefore we would not find cross-industry distributional effects.

       More specifically, we extend the Rajan and Zingales (1998, henceforth RZ) methodology to

examine whether financial development enhances economic growth by easing constraints on

industries that are technologically more dependent on small firms. RZ find that industries that are

technologically more dependent on external finance grow disproportionately faster in countries with

developed financial systems. They measure an industry’s need for external finance (the difference

investment and cash from operations) using data on large, public corporations in the U.S.

Assuming that financial markets are relatively frictionless in the U.S., RZ identify each industry’s

“technological” demand for external finance, i.e., the demand for external finance in a frictionless

financial system. They further assume that this technological demand for external finance is the

same across countries. Instead of only considering each industry’s technological dependence on

external finance, we also examine each industry’s technological firm size. We measure an

industry’s “technological” composition of small firms relative to large firms as the share of

employment in firms with less than 20 employees in the U.S. Assuming that financial markets are

relatively frictionless in the U.S., we therefore identify each industry’s “technological” firm size in

a relatively frictionless financial system. While conducting a large of number of sensitivity checks

regarding the validity of this measure of technological firm size, we test whether industries that are

technologically more dependent on small firms grow faster in countries with more developed

financial systems.

       The results indicate that small-firm industries grow disproportionately faster in economies

with well-developed financial systems, which has two key implications. First, the findings indicate




                                                   3
that financial development has cross-industry distributional ramifications: Financial development

exerts a particularly positive growth effect on industries that are technologically more dependent on

small firms. Second, the analyses advertise one mechanism through which finance influences

aggregate economic growth: Financial development removes growth constraints on small-firm

industries. Our analyses suggest that large-firm industries are not the same as industries that rely

heavily on external finance. We control for cross-industry differences in external dependence, and

confirm the RZ finding that financial development disproportionately boosts the growth rate of

industries that are more dependent on external finance. Even when controlling for cross-industry

differences in external dependence, however, we find that financial development disproportionately

accelerates the growth of industries that for technological reasons are composed of small firms.

       These results are robust to an array of sensitivity checks. Besides confirming that the results

hold over different estimation periods, we assess the sensitivity of our findings to using different

financial development indicators and alternative measures of small-firm share for each industry.

Furthermore, we were concerned that small-firm share might proxy for other industry characteristics

that interact with country-level traits to explain industry growth. For instance, Claessens and

Laeven (2003) find that industries characterized by high levels of intangible assets grow faster in

countries with strong private property rights protection. If small firms have higher levels of

intangible assets and strong property rights underlie financial development (Levine, 1999), then our

results on firm size may be spurious. We confirm our results, however, when controlling for the

interaction of industrial reliance on intangible assets and national property rights protection.

Similarly, Fisman and Love (2003b) argue that financial development is particularly important for

industries with substantial growth opportunities. If in our sample, small-firm industries are also

those industries with above average growth opportunities, we may be capturing cross-industry




                                                   4
differences in growth opportunities, not cross-industry differences in firm size. Again, however,

when controlling for the interaction of financial development and each industry’s growth rate in the

United States, we continue to find that financial development exerts a particularly large impact on

the growth of industries that are naturally composed of small firms. Finally, we were concerned that

market size, human capital skills, and the level of economic development could influence industry

size, invalidate the use of the U.S. as the benchmark country, and lead to inappropriate inferences.

Nevertheless, even when controlling for these country-specific traits, we continue to find that

financial development exerts a particularly pronounced growth-effect on small-firm industries.

Moreover, we confirm this paper’s findings using the United Kingdom as the benchmark country

and when employing alternative definitions of industrial firm size.

       There are limitations to our analyses. Some theories predict that financial development

lowers information and transaction costs in ways that are particularly beneficial to small firms. We

find evidence consistent with these theories. We do not, however, examine the links in the chain

from financial development, to particular information and transaction costs, and on to small firm

growth. This is similar to RZ. They find evidence consistent with theories stressing that financial

development reduces the cost of external finance. They do not, however, measure the cost of

external finance directly. Thus, although this paper’s findings indicate that financial development

boosts economic growth by fostering the growth of industries that are naturally composed of small

firms, further research needs to link these findings to specific information and transactions costs.

Along similar lines, financial market imperfections could impede the growth of small-firm

industries by causing firm size to deviate from its optimum or by hindering the flow of capital and

other financial services to small firms. We do not explicitly distinguish among these possibilities.

Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2003), however, find no evidence that financial under-




                                                   5
development distorts firm size. Given this finding, our results imply that financial under-

development disproportionately hinders the flow of growth-enhancing financial services to small

firms.

         Our paper relates closely to two recent papers that examine the importance of financial

development for small firms. Using evidence across different region in Italy, Guiso, Sapienza, and

Zingales (2004) find that small firms enjoy more growth benefits than large firms from regional

financial development.4 Rather than focusing on inter-regional differences in Italy, we undertake a

cross-country, country-industry investigation. Beck, Demirguc-Kunt, and Maksimovic (2005) use

firm-level survey data to assess the relationship between the financing obstacles that firms report

they face and firm growth. They find that the negative impact of reported obstacles on firm growth

is stronger for small firms than large firms and stronger in countries with under-developed financial

systems. Their study has the advantage of using cross-country, firm-level data, but it has the

disadvantage of relying on survey responses regarding the obstacles that firms encounter. In

contrast, we use a different methodology that assesses whether industries that are naturally

composed of small firms grow faster in countries with better-developed financial systems. Our

research provides complimentary information on whether financial development fosters aggregate

growth by disproportionately facilitating the growth of small firms.

         The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 explains the data, while

Section 3 describes the methodology. Section 4 presents the main results and sensitivity tests.

Section 5 concludes.

  In terms of new firm formation, Guiso, Sapienza, and Zingales (2004) also find that new firm creation is higher in
Italian regions that are more financial development. Similarly, Black and Strahan (2002) show that more competitive
banking markets are associated with higher levels of new incorporations in the United States.

II.        Data

           To assess whether financial development boosts the growth of industries that for

technological reasons are naturally composed of small firms more than the growth rate of large-firm

industries, we need (i) measures of industry growth, (ii) measures of each industry’s technological

firm size, and (iii) country-level indicators of financial development. This section describes these

key variables. The data cover 44 countries and 36 industries in the manufacturing sector. Tables 1

and 2 present descriptive statistics.



           II.1. Industry growth rates

           Growthi,k equals the average annual growth rate of real value added of industry k in country

i over the period 1980 to 1990. Thus, we have cross-country, cross-industry data on industrial

growth rates. We use the data obtained by RZ from the Industrial Statistics Yearbook database,

which is assembled by the United Nations Statistical Division (1993). In robustness tests below, we

show that the results hold over different estimation periods.



           II.2. Measure of Small Firm Share

           Since our goal is to assess whether industries that are naturally composed of small firms

grow faster, or slower, than large-firm industries in countries with greater financial development,

we need to measure each industry’s “natural” or technological firm size. Differences in productive

technologies, capital intensities, and scale economies influence an industry’s technological firm size

(Coase, 1937, and Kumar, Rajan, and Zingales, 2001).5 To get a proxy measure of each industry’s

natural firm size, therefore, we need a benchmark economy with relatively few market


5
    See You (1995) for an overview.


                                                     7
imperfections and policy distortions, so that we capture, as closely as possible, only the impact of

cross-industry differences in production processes, capital intensities, and scale economies on cross-

industry firm size.

       Small Firm Sharek equals industry k’s share of employment in firms with less than 20

employees in the United States, and is obtained from the 1992 Census. 6 In our baseline regressions,

we use Small Firm Share as the measure of each industry’s “natural” or “technological” share of

small firms. Table 1 lists the Small Firm Share for each industry in the sample. The Small Firm

Share has a mean of 6 %, but varies widely from 0.1 % in manufacturing of pulp, paper and

paperboard to 21% in wood manufacturing. In sensitivity checks emphasized below, we consider

many alternative measures of each industry’s natural firm size and we test for the importance of

many potential problems associated with using the United States as the benchmark country for

measuring technological firm size.

       Given our focus on the relationship between financial development, firm size, and growth, it

is logical to use the United States to form the benchmark measure of an industry’s technological

share of small firms. As in RZ, this relies on the assumption that U.S. financial markets are

relatively frictionless. Based on this assumption, Small Firm Share measures the share of small

firms for each industry in a relatively frictionless financial system. U.S. markets, of course, are not

perfect. Indeed, Evans and Jovanovic (1989) argue that small firms in the United States are more

liquidity constrained than large firms.

       Our empirical methods, however, do not require that the U.S. financial system is perfect.

Rather, we require that financial market imperfections in the United States do not distort the ranking

of industries in terms of the technological share of small firms within each industry. Since the




                                                   8
United States has one the most developed financial systems in the world by many measures

(Demirguc-Kunt and Levine, 2001), it represents a natural benchmark for providing a ranking of

each industry’s technological firm size.

         As noted, the perfect benchmark country has relatively frictionless markets and policies

distorting firm size beyond the financial sector. For instance, differences in human capital, market

size, contract enforcement, and overall institutional development may influence industrial firm size

beyond technological factors, such as scale economies, capital intensities, and industry-specific

production processes shaping long-run average cost curves (You, 1995, and Kumar, Rajan, and

Zingales, 2001). Thus, the ideal benchmark economy not only has relatively frictionless financial

markets; it has relatively frictionless markets in general.

         Again, the United States is a reasonable benchmark to derive each industry’s technological

Small Firm Share. The United States has the full spectrum of human capital skills and indeed

attracts both high and low human capital workers from the rest of the world (Easterly and Levine,

2001). Furthermore, comparative studies of U.S. and European labor markets suggest that the

United States has many fewer policy distortions. Moreover, the U.S. internal market is huge and –

given its size – it is comparatively open to international trade. Furthermore, many studies point to

the United States as having a superior contracting environment and well-developed institutions (La

Porta et al, 1999). Moreover, the United States does not need to have perfect labor markets,

contracting systems, or institutions to act as a reasonable benchmark. To represent a good

benchmark for Small Firm Share, we simply require that policy distortions and market

imperfections in the United States do not distort the ranking of industries in terms of the

technological share of small firms within each industry.

6
 We do not use measures of Small Firm Share prior to 1992 because the U.S. Census did not start collecting firm size
data at the firm level until 1992. Before 1992, the data were collected at the plant level. From a theoretical perspective,



                                                             9
         Furthermore, we present a battery of sensitivity analyses that assess the validity of using the

United States as the benchmark country. We use different measures of Small Firm Share and also

use a different benchmark country. Furthermore, since omitting country-specific factors that

interact with industry characteristics and explain industry growth could bias the results, we control

for an array of country traits. As we describe below, however, the results are robust to a variety of

sensitivity checks.



         II.3. Indicators of financial development

         Ideally, one would like indicators of the degree to which the financial system ameliorates

information and transactions frictions and facilitates the mobilization and efficient allocation of

capital. Specifically, we would like indicators that capture the effectiveness with which financial

systems research firms and identify profitable projects, exert corporate control, facilitate risk

management, mobilize savings, and ease transactions. Unfortunately, no such measures are

available across countries. Consequently, we rely on an assortment of traditional measures of

financial development that existing work shows are robustly related to economic growth.

         Private Crediti equals the value of credits by financial intermediaries to the private sector

divided by GDP for country i. It captures the amount of credit channeled through financial

intermediaries to the private sector. Levine, Loayza, and Beck (2000) show that Private Credit is a

good predictor or economic growth and also use instrumental variables in stressing that the strong,

positive association between Private Credit and economic growth is not due to reverse causality. In

our baseline regression, we measure Private Credit in the initial year of our estimation period, 1980

(or the first year in which data are available). We use the initial year to control for reverse

causation. Since using initial values instead of average values implies an informational loss, we


we need data at the firm level, not the plant level, and we therefore do not resort to Census data prior to 1992.

                                                            10
also use Private Credit, averaged over the period 1980-89 in our sensitivity analysis. Furthermore,

we use instrumental variables to extract the exogenous component of Private Credit. Data for

Private Credit are from Beck, Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2000). There is a wide variation in

Private Credit in our sample, ranging from 7% in Bangladesh to 117% in Japan.

       In sensitivity tests, we use several alternative indicators of financial development. To save

space, we do not define the different financial development measures here. Rather, we jointly

define these variables and present the sensitivity analyses below.


   III.           Methodology

       To examine whether industries that are naturally composed of small firms grow faster than

large-firm industries in countries with higher levels of financial development, this paper extends the

methodology developed by RZ. In particular, we interact an industry characteristic – each

industry’s technological small firm share – with a country-characteristic – the level of financial

development. In describing the econometrics more rigorously, we only discuss the interaction

between financial development and Small Firm Share. In the actual implementation, we control for

the interaction of financial development with the external financial dependence of each industry as

stressed by RZ.

      Econometrically, we use the following regression:


Growthi ,k = ∑α j Countryj + ∑ β l Industryl + γ Sharei ,k + δ (Small Firm Sharek * FDi ) + ε i ,k , (1)
              j                 l


where Growthi,k is the average annual growth rate of value added, in industry k and country i, over

the period 1980 to 90. Country and Industry are country and industry dummies, respectively, and

Sharei,k is the share of industry k in manufacturing in country i in 1980. Small Firm Sharek is the

benchmark share of small firms in industry k, which in our baseline specification equals the share of


                                                  11
employment in firms with less than 20 employees in the United States in 1992. FDi is an indicator

of financial development for country i, which equals Private Credit in our baseline regression. We

include the interaction between the small firm share in an industry with financial development. We

do not include financial development on its own, since we focus on within-country, within-industry

growth rates. The dummy variables for industries and countries correct for country and industry

specific characteristics that might determine industry growth patterns. We thus isolate the effect

that the interaction of Small Firm Share and Private Credit has on industry growth relative to

country and industry means. By including the initial share of an industry we control for a

convergence effect: industries with a large share might grow more slowly, suggesting a negative

sign on γ. We include the share in manufacturing rather than the level, since we focus on within-

country, within-industry growth rates. We exclude the United States (the benchmark country) from

the regressions.

       In interpreting the results, we focus on the interaction of financial development and small

firms share, i.e., we focus on the sign and significance of δ. If δ is positive and significant, this

suggests financial development exerts a disproportionately positive effect on small-firm industries

relative to large-firm industries. This would suggest that financial development tends to ease

growth constraints on small firms more than on large firms. A negative and significant sign would

suggest that it is mostly large firms that benefit from the development of financial markets. An

insignificant coefficient would suggest that financial development influences industries that are

naturally composed of small firms the same as industries naturally composed of large firms. Thus,

if δ enters insignificantly, this would not support the view that financial development has cross-

industry distributional consequences and would not support the view that one channel through




                                                   12
which financial development boosts aggregate economic growth is by disproportionately easing

constrains on small firm growth.

      Apart from using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regressions, we also run Instrumental

Variables (IV) regressions to address the issue of endogeneity of financial development. Based on

research by La Porta et al. (1998), Levine (1999), Levine, Loayza, and Beck (2000), and Beck,

Demirguc-Kunt, and Levine (2003), we use the legal origin of countries as instrumental variables

for financial development. Legal systems are typically classified into four major legal families: the

English common law and the French, German, and Scandinavian civil law countries, and we use

dummy variables for these categories of legal origin as instruments (excluding one category,

Scandinavian civil law countries, which is included in the constant term).



   IV.         Results and Sensitivity Tests

       IV.1. Main Results

       Table 3 results suggest that small-firm industries (industries with technologically larger

shares of small firms) grow faster in economies with better-developed financial intermediaries. The

interaction of Private Credit with Small Firm Share enters positively and significantly at the 5%

level in column (1). We also find that the coefficient on Industry Share enters negatively and

significantly. This is consistent with the convergence effect identified by RZ. Overall, these results

indicate that industries whose organization is based more on small firms than on large firms grow

faster in countries with better-developed financial intermediaries.

       The relationship between financial development, an industry’s small firm share, and industry

growth is not only statistically, but also economically large. To illustrate the effect, we compare the

growth of an industry with a relatively large share of small firms and an industry with a relative low



                                                  13
share of small firms across two countries with different levels of financial development.

Specifically, the results in column (1) suggest that the furniture industry (75th percentile of Small

Firm Share) should grow 1.4% per annum faster than the spinning industry (25th percentile of Small

Firm Share) in Canada (75th percentile of Private Credit) than in India (25th percentile of Private

Credit).7 Since the average growth rate in our sample is 3.4%, this is a relatively large effect.

           Given the influential findings of RZ, we were concerned that there might be a large,

negative correlation between industries that are naturally heavy users of external finance and

industries that are naturally composed of small firms. If this were the case, then it would be

difficult to distinguish between the RZ finding that externally dependent industries grow faster in

economies with well-developed financial systems and our result that small-firm industries grow

faster in economies with well-developed financial systems. While there is a negative correlation

between Small Firm Share and External Dependence, it is very small (-0.04) and insignificant. This

suggests that the industry characteristics explaining firm size distribution are not the same as the

characteristics explaining technological dependence on external finance.

           Moreover, Table 3 (i) advertises the robustness of the original RZ result on external

dependence and (ii) illustrates the robustness of the result on industry firm size when controlling for

external dependence. As shown in column (2), the interaction between each industry’s level of

external dependence and financial development (Private Credit * External Dependence) enters

positively and significantly. This indicates that industries that are naturally heavy users of external

finance grow faster in economies with higher levels of financial development. Since we also

control for cross-industry differences in the technological level of firm size, this represents an

additional robustness test on the RZ finding. Moreover, column (2) shows that the interaction

between each industry’s technological Small Firm Share and financial development (Private

7
    We use the results of column 2 in Table 3 for this experiment.

                                                             14
Credit*Small Firm Share) enters positively and significantly when controlling for external

dependence. Thus, we find that industries with technologically larger shares of small firms grow

more quickly in countries with higher levels of financial development even when controlling for

cross-industry differences in external dependence. 8

         Finally, Table 3 column (3) presents results using instrumental variables, which indicate that

the relationship between Small Firm Share, financial development, and industry growth is not due

to reverse causation or simultaneity bias. Here we extract the exogenous component of Private

Credit using the legal origin of countries. We instrument both the interaction of Private Credit with

Small Firm Share and the interaction of Private Credit with External Financial Dependence. The

first-stage regression results support the use of legal origin as an instrument for Private Credit. The

interaction of Small Firm Share with Private Credit continues to enter positively and significantly.9



         IV.2. Sensitivity to Controlling for Different Industry Characteristics

         There are a number of potential complications with using the United States as the

benchmark country to identify the technological level of small firm share for each industry. In

particular, Small Firm Share in the United States may be correlated with other industry-specific

traits that interact with country-level characteristics to explain industry growth. This would produce

spurious results.




8
  In unreported regressions, we also tested whether the interaction between Private Credit and small firm share varies
across industries with different degrees of external dependence. The triple interaction term does not enter significantly
and the interactions of Private Credit with external dependence and the small firm share continue to enter significantly
and positively, suggesting that small firms consistently face high financing constraints, irrespective of whether they are
in an industry with a naturally high or low demand for external finance.
9
  We have used alternative instrument sets, including latitude and settler mortality – proxying for initial endowments -,
religious composition and ethnic fractionalization, factors that have been proposed by the literature has having a
significant impact on financial and institutional development (Beck, Demirguc-Kunt and Levine, 2003, Easterly and
Levine, 1997; Stulz and Williamson, 2004), and obtain similar results.


                                                            15
       As a sensitivity test, therefore, we include the interaction between financial development

and different industry traits. First, as we have emphasized, the results are robust to controlling for

the interaction of Private Credit with the RZ measure of external financial dependence. If the Small

Firm Share is highly (negatively) correlated with External Dependence, the findings on Small Firm

Share should vanish when controlling for external dependence. As noted, however, there is not a

strong correlation between the Small Firm Share and External Dependence and we find that

financial development exerts a particularly pronounced growth-effect on small-firm industries even

when controlling for the interaction between financial development and external dependence.

       As a second concern, Claessens and Laeven (2003) show that industries that naturally use a

high proportion of intangible assets grow faster in countries with strong private property rights

protection. If small firms rely heavily on intangible assets and strong private property rights are

closely associated with financial development, then our findings may simply be confirming the

Claessens and Laeven (2003) results rather than establishing a new channel linking financial

development and economic growth. In Table 4 column 1, we therefore control for the interaction of

Property Rights with the percentage of intangible assets in each industry. We use the ratio of

intangible assets to fixed assets of U.S. firms over the period 1980 to 1989 calculated using data

from Compustat. We confirm the Claessens and Laeven (2003) result: The interaction of Property

Rights with Intangibility enters significantly and positively. However, this does not affect our main

finding: Industries with a larger small firm share grow faster in economies with better-developed

financial intermediaries.10

       Third, we consider the possibility that industries classified as small-firm industries face

different growth opportunities than industries composed of larger firms, which might lead us to

spuriously link industrial firm size with faster economic growth in financial developed economies.




                                                  16
Fisman and Love (2003b) argue that financial development boosts the growth rate of industries with

particularly good growth opportunities. Thus, we want to assess the independent importance of the

relationship between industry growth and the interaction between financial development and Small

Firm Share when controlling for cross-industry growth opportunities. Thus, in Table 4’s column 2,

we follow Fisman and Love (2003b) and also include the interaction between Private Credit and

their measure of industrial Sales Growth to control for growth opportunities. Sales Growth is

calculated as real annual growth in net sales of U.S. firms over the period 1980 to 1989 using data

from Compustat. Even when controlling for both external dependence and growth opportunities,

the interaction of Small Firm Share with Private Credit enters positively and significantly.



           IV.3. Sensitivity to Controlling for Different Country Characteristics

           There may also exist concerns that financial development is highly correlated with other

country-specific traits that interact with industry firm size and shape cross-industry growth rates.

To examine the sensitivity of the results to different country factors, we choose country traits that

on theoretical grounds are associated with financial development and influence industry firm size

and growth (Greenwood and Jovanovic, 1990; Galor and Moav, 2005). Specifically, we include the

interaction between Small Firm Share and country characteristics besides financial development.

           Thus, in Table 4, columns 3 – 5, we control for the interaction of (i) the log of GDP per

capita with the Small Firm Share, (ii) average years of schooling with the Small Firm Share, and

(iii) openness to trade with the Small Firm Share. Small firms might benefit from a generally more

developed institutional environment. Thus, we include the overall level of economic development.

If financial development is simply proxying for the overall level of institutional development, then

including the interaction between Per Capita GDP and Small Firm Share should drive out the

10
     We also tried an interaction of intangibility and financial development and obtained similar results.

                                                              17
significance of the interaction between financial development and Small Firm Share. Similarly, a

more educated population might be more conducive to the growth of industries composed of

smaller (or larger) firms since technical, entrepreneurial, and managerial skills influence industrial

organization and growth. If financial development is closely linked with human capital

development, then controlling for the interaction between Small Firm Share and Human Capital (as

measured by each country’s average years of schooling of the population over the age of 25) should

drive out the results on industrial firm size. Finally, market size may be associated with financial

development, industrial firm size, and the growth rate of different industries. For instance,

industries that depend on relatively large firms may grow faster in economies with larger markets

that allow them to exploit economies of scale more fully. To test this, we include the interaction

between Small Firm Share and a proxy measure of openness to international trade, Openness, which

equals exports plus imports divided by GDP.

       The finding that financial development disproportionately boosts the growth of industries

that are naturally composed of small firms holds even when controlling for these other country

characteristics. The interaction of Private Credit with Small Firm Share enters positively and

significantly in Table 4’s columns 3 – 5. The interaction of Per Capita GDP and Small Firm Share

and the interaction between Openness and Small Firm Share do not enter significantly in columns 3

and 5 respectively. The interaction of Human Capital and Small Firm Share enters positively and

significantly at the 10% level, which provides some support to the view that small-firm industries

grow faster in economies with more educated work forces. However, this does not affect the

significance or size of the interaction term of Small Firm Share with Private Credit. Thus, this

paper’s core results on financial development, industrial firm size, and industry growth are robust to

controlling for different country characteristics.




                                                     18
        IV.4. Sensitivity to Alternative Measures of Industrial Small Firm Share

        Table 5 indicates that the results are robust to using alternative definitions of Small Firm

Share. In all of these regressions, we control for the interaction between financial development and

external dependence. We use four different cut-offs to define a small firm: 5, 10, 100 and 500

employees respectively.11 Table 1 lists Small Firm Share for different for the different definitions

of a small firm. There is a high correlation among the different measures of Small Firm Share, and

the average correlation is 91%.12 Nevertheless, some additional information may be garnered from

examining the results with different cut-offs. This allows us to (a) test the robustness of the results

to different definitions of a small firm and (b) assess more fully the relationship between cross-

industry firm size, financial development, and growth.

        Using the alternative definitions of a small firm does not change our main finding: Financial

development fosters the growth of small-firm industries more than large-firm industries, though the

significance of the interaction term between Private Credit and Small Firm Share is significant only

at the ten percent level when defining a small firm as having 100 or fewer employees. We also find

that once we include firms up to 500 employees in the definition of Small Firm Share, then the

interaction of financial development and firm size distribution turns insignificant. Thus, these

sensitivity checks (i) emphasize that financial development exerts a particularly large growth effect

on small-firm industries and (ii) indicate “small-firm” industries that enjoy a disproportionately

large growth effect from financial include industries with a large share of firms with less than 100

employees.



11
  Note that we loose two industries due to missing data in the U.S. Census when we use 5 and 10 employees as cut-off.
12
  Not surprisingly, the correlation decreases as we move towards higher thresholds. The correlation between S5 and
S10 is 99%, but 78% between S5 and S500.


                                                         19
       We also find that the economic size of the impact of financial development on industries

with different Small Firm Shares is robust to using different definitions of small firm share.

Specifically, using the example above, moving from India (25th percentile Private Credit) to Canada

(75th percentile Private Credit) benefits the industry at the 75th percentile of Small Firm Share

relatively more than the industry at the 25th percentile of Small Firm Share. According to the

estimated coefficients, this change induces a 1.4% growth differential between these two types of

industries using 20 employees as the cut-off definition for a small firm. For example, the growth

differentials are virtually identical (1.6% and 1.5 % growth differential respectively) when using 10

or 5 employees as alternative definitions of small firm in categorizing the technological level of

small firm share. Given that we control for the interaction of financial development with external

financial dependence, these results suggest that small-firm industries benefit more than large-firm

industries from financial development.

       Next, we were concerned that using indicators of Small Firm Share that are measured after

the dependent variable would induce biases. While we cannot measure Small Firm Share in earlier

periods due to the data constraints discussed above, we can assess whether Small Firm Share is

stable and then see whether using Small Firm Share from a different year alters the results. The

correlation between the small firm shares in 1992 and 1997 using the 20-employee cut-off is 90%,

significant at the 1% level, and the Spearman rank correlation is 92%. This suggests that firm size

distribution across industries in the United States is persistent and does not vary significantly over

the business cycle (in 1992, the U.S. economy was just emerging from a recession, while 1997 was

a boom year).

       Moreover, this paper’s findings are also robust to measuring Small Firm Share for U.S.

industries in 1997 instead of 1992. Columns (1) and (2) of Table 6 report the results when using the




                                                  20
Small Firm Share across U.S. industries when using the 1997 Census and 10 or 20 employees as the

cut-off. Using the 1997 data does not change our findings: the interaction of the Small Firm Share

with Private Credit enters positively and significantly at the 1% level.

         Critically, we also confirm the robustness of the results when using the United Kingdom as

the benchmark economy for computing each industry’s technological firm size. We use AMADEUS

data for 1997 to calculate the small firm share across industries for the United Kingdom.

AMADEUS is a commercial database maintained by Bureau Van Dijk containing financial

statements and employment data for over 5 million firms in Europe, including the United Kingdom.

Unfortunately, the data on industrial firm size distribution is not as complete for the United

Kingdom as for the United States.13 Nevertheless, we continue to find that small-firm industries

grow faster in countries with well-developed financial systems. The interaction of Small Firm

Share in the United Kingdom and Private Credit enters positively and significantly at the 5% level

(Table 6 column 3), which again confirms this paper’s core conclusion.

         Finally, the results are robust to controlling for the average size of large firms in each

industry. We were concerned that industry variation in the size of the largest firms could reflect

U.S. specific factors and distort our results. Thus, we control for the median size of the large, listed

firms by industry in the United States, using Compustat data to calculate the log of the median

number of employees across large, listed firms in the United States. The regressions in columns (4)

and (5) of Table 6 show that the interaction of Private Credit with the median firm size of large,

listed firms does not enter significantly in any of the regressions at the 5% level. In contrast, we


13
  Unlike for the U.S. Census, for the U.K. dataset we only have complete data for enterprises above 10 employees so
that our U.K. small firm share is calculated as employment in enterprises between 10 and 20 employees relative to
employment in enterprises with more than 10 employees. We only include limited liability companies in our
calculations, since in the United Kingdom unlimited liability companies are not required to file financial accounts (for
further details, see Klapper, Laeven, and Rajan, 2004). Also, we exclude industries with less than 20 firm-observations.
The correlation between the small firm shares for industries in the U.S. in 1992 and small firm shares in the U.K. in
1997 is 58%, significant at the 1% level and the Spearman rank correlation is 52%.


                                                           21
continue to find that the interaction of Private Credit and Small Firm Share enters positively and

significantly at the 5% level.

           IV.5. Sensitivity to Alternative Measures of Financial Development

           The findings are also robust to using alternative measures of financial development as

shown in Table 7. First, we use Private Credit, averaged over the period 1980 to 1989 instead of

using the value in the initial year. While using the average value may introduce a bias in our

estimates, the interaction with the Small Firm Share enters positively and significantly at the 1%

level, and the coefficient is only slighter higher than when using the initial value (regression 1).

           Second, we use Liquid Liabilities, which equals the liquid liabilities of the financial system

(currency plus demand and interest-bearing liabilities of banks and nonbank financial

intermediaries) divided by GDP. Unlike Private Credit, Liquid Liabilities simply measures the size

financial intermediaries and does not focus on the intermediation of credit to the private sector. As

shown in Table 7 regression 2, the results hold when using Liquid Liabilities. 14

           Third, we test whether small-firm industries grow faster in economies with more active

stock markets. Market Turnover equals the ratio of the value of stock transactions divided by

market capitalization for each country’s stock exchange. While the interaction with the Small Firm

Share is positive, it is not significant (Table 7 regression 3). This suggests that, consistent with

Petersen and Rajan (1995), small firms benefit more from services provided by financial

intermediaries than by stock markets.15

           Fourth, we use several indicators that do not directly measure the size or efficiency of the

financial system, but instead measure the institutional foundations for financial development.

Specifically, we also use Legal Efficiency, which measures the efficiency and integrity of a


14
     These results also hold when using Commercial-Central Bank from Levine, Loayza and Beck (2000).
15
     These results hold when using stock market capitalization and value traded as alternative stock market indicators.


                                                             22
country’s legal environment. Data are averaged over 1980-83 and are originally from Business

International Corporation. Also, we use the Law and Order index compiled by ICRG, which is

based on survey data that seek to elicit the degree of trust that citizens have in the legal system’s

ability to resolve disputes. Finally, we use Accounting Standards, which measures the number of

items listed on firms’ financial statements, an indicator ranging from zero to 90 and compiled by

CIFAR. Accounting Standards is a proxy for the quality of financial information about firms and

has been used by RZ as a proxy for financial development. As shown in Table 7, the interaction

between Legal Efficiency and Small Firm Share and the interaction between the Law and Order and

Small Firm Share both enter positively and significantly at the 5% level (columns 4 and 5). The

interaction of Accounting Standards with Small Firm Share, however, enters insignificantly

(column 6). This suggests that the quality of financial statements does not foster disproportionately

faster growth in small-firm industries. This finding is consistent with the insignificant result for the

interaction of Turnover with Small Firm Share and emphasizes the particularly large, positive

relationship between the development of financial intermediaries and the growth rate of industries

that are naturally composed of small firms. While not direct evidence, this result is consistent with

arguments that small firms rely on financial intermediaries to obtain information on the firm

through means other than publicly available financial statements (such as information deriving from

long-term bank-firm relationships), so that financial intermediary development induces a

particularly large, positive effect on small firms.

       IV.6. Sensitivity to Alternative Sampling Period

       As a robustness test, we use industry value added growth over an extended period, 1980

through 1999. The core sample includes 1242 country-industry observations for the period 1980 to

1990 (the original RZ sample). When we move to the extended period, the sample drops by one-




                                                      23
third to only 827 country-industry observations because we lose data on several countries and

industries.

       Nevertheless, the results in Table 8 indicate that our main findings are robust to calculating

industry growth over this longer period. The results in columns 1 and 2 confirm a significant and

positive coefficient on the interaction of Small Firm Share and financial development when using

(i) industry growth rates over the period 1980-99 and (ii) defining Small Firm Share with either the

10 or 20 employees cut-off. The regression in column 3 suggests that the significance over the

longer period is not due to the reduced sample because the results for the 1980s also hold for the

smaller sample for which we have data through 1999.


   V. Conclusions

       This paper finds that financial development boosts the growth of industries that are naturally

composed of small firms more than large-firm industries. This result is robust to controlling for

other industry characteristics, many country traits, different measures of financial development,

various methods for computing the technological firm size of industries, and alternative estimation

samples. The results imply that one way in which financial development boosts growth is by

relieving constraints on the growth of small firms.

       This result has three interrelated implications. First, this paper contributes to the literature

on the mechanisms through which financial development boosts aggregate economic growth.

Although a large literature shows that there is a strong positive relationship between financial

development and economic growth, it is crucial to dissect the channels connecting finance and

growth to (i) better understand the finance-growth nexus and (ii) assess whether finance causes

growth, or whether financial development is simply a characteristic of successful economies. Past

work suggests that financial development facilitates economic growth by boosting the growth of


                                                   24
firms that rely heavily on external finance. Besides confirming this finding, we show that financial

development fosters economic growth by relieving constraints on small firm growth. Thus, we

identify an additional mechanism through which financial development fosters aggregate economic

growth. Second, this paper’s findings support the view that financial development

disproportionately boosts the growth of small firms relative to large firms. Some theories of the

firm argue that financial development is particularly beneficial to large firms. Others predict that

financial development is especially important for lowering transaction costs and informational

barriers that hinder small firm growth. Our findings support the view that under-developed

financial systems are particularly detrimental to the growth of firms with less than 100 employees.

Finally, we find that financial development has cross-industry distributional consequences.

Although we do not examine specific policies, the results suggest that policies that improve the

operation of the financial system will tend to boost the growth of small-firm industries more than

large firm industries.

Table 3           Financial development, small firms share, and growth
Dependent variable is average growth in real value added over the period 1980-1990 by country and ISIC industry.
Share in value added is the industry’s share in total value added of the country. Private Credit is claims by financial
institutions on the private sector divided by GDP in 1980. Small firms share is the industry’s share of employment
by firms with less than 20 employees, and is calculated using data from the U.S. Census on all U.S. firms for the
year 1992. External dependence is a measure of the industry’s dependence on external finance, from Rajan and
Zingales (1998). The industry measures are based on U.S. data. The regression in column (3) is estimated using
legal origin dummies as instrumental variable for Private Credit. All regressions include country and industry
dummies, but these are not reported. Robust standard errors in parentheses. * significant at 10%; ** significant at
5%; *** significant at 1%.

Table 4           Controlling for Additional Industry and Country Characteristics

Dependent variable is average growth in real value added over the period 1980-1990 by country and ISIC industry. Share in value added is the industry’s share in
total value added of the country. Private Credit is claims by financial institutions on the private sector divided by GDP in 1980. Property rights is a measure of
the country’s protection of property rights from the Heritage Foundation. Average for the years 1995-99. We reverse the original order of the index such that
higher values indicate more protection (score of 1-5). Per capita GDP is the logarithm of the country’s real GDP per capita in 1980. Human capital is average
years of schooling in population age over 25 in the year 1980. Openness is the sum of exports and imports relative to GDP in 1980. Small firms share is the
industry’s share of employment by firms with less than 20 employees, and is calculated using data from the U.S. Census on all U.S. firms for the year 1992.
External financial dependence is a measure of the industry’s dependence on external finance, from Rajan and Zingales (1998). Intangibility is a measure of the
industry’s dependence on intangible assets from Claessens and Laeven (2003), and is calculated as the ratio of intangible assets to fixed assets of U.S. firms over
the period 1980 to 1989 using data from Compustat. Sales growth is an industry measure of sales growth from Fisman and Love (2003b), and is calculated as real
annual growth in net sales of U.S. firms over the period 1980 to 1989 using data from Compustat. The industry measures are based on U.S. data. We include
country and industry dummies, but these are not reported. Robust standard errors in parentheses. * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%.
