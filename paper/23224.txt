                                          ABSTRACT

Using earnings data from the U.S. Census Bureau, this paper analyzes the role of the employer in
explaining the rise in earnings inequality in the United States. We first establish a consistent
frame of analysis appropriate for administrative data used to study earnings inequality. We show
that the trends in earnings inequality in the administrative data from the Longitudinal Employer-
Household Dynamics Program are inconsistent with other data sources when we do not correct
for the presence of misused SSNs. After this correction to the worker frame, we analyze how the
earnings distribution has changed in the last decade. We present a decomposition of the year-to-
year changes in the earnings distribution from 2004-2013. Even when simplifying these flows to
movements between the bottom 20%, the middle 60%, and the top 20% of the earnings
distribution, about 20.5 million workers undergo a transition each year. Another 19.9 million
move between employment and non-employment. To understand the role of the firm in these
transitions, we estimate a model for log earnings with additive fixed worker and firm effects
using all jobs held by eligible workers from 2004-2013. We construct a composite log earnings
firm component across all jobs for a worker in a given year and a non-firm component. We also
construct a skill-type index. We show that, while the difference between working at a low-or
middle-paying firm are relatively small, the gains from working at a top-paying firm are large.
Specifically, the benefits of working for a high-paying firm are not only realized today, through
higher earnings paid to the worker, but also persist through an increase in the probability of
upward mobility. High-paying firms facilitate moving workers to the top of the earnings
distribution and keeping them there.

1       Introduction
A growing body of work studies the rise in earnings inequality in the United States1 with many
studies focus on assessing the role of the employer in explaining these trends.2 Virtually all of these
papers use administrative data to analyze employer effects on earnings inequality. Information from
administrative sources, unlike data collected in household surveys, is found or organic data.3 That
is, these data come from a convenient frame neither designed nor ensured to be representative of the
population under study. Using found data to study features of a population, in particular features
that evolve over time like earnings inequality, requires additional effort to determine what types of
individuals are included in the found data and how those who are excluded from the analysis affect
the results.
        In this paper, we analyze the importance of firms in explaining the evolution of earnings
inequality in the U.S. using administrative data from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dy-
namics (LEHD) infrastructure files of the U.S. Census Bureau. We do two important analyses
before turning to earnings inequality. First, unlike other studies of earnings inequality that use
administrative data, we supplement the LEHD frame with data from the Social Security Admin-
istration (SSA) to create a consistent frame of workers over time. Specifically, we identify records
in the administrative LEHD data that are either (a) associated with an invalid SSN or (b) used
in a manner indicating possibly fraudulent labor market activity associated with a valid SSN. We
remove both of these types of records from our analysis and document the consequences. Second,
we systematically compare the cross-sectional estimates of earnings inequality in our administrative
data to estimates based on conventional household surveys and document the differences. Then,
we link the administrative and household survey data and use the linked data to understand where
important features of the earnings distribution diverge.
        By converting the found LEHD administrative data frame on workers to a designed frame,
we can produce reliable estimates of features of the worker population. Conversion to a designed
frame matters because trends in inequality differ between the designed frame and the original found
frame. While our designed frame shows a widening of the earnings distribution post-2000 that is
consistent with findings from other data sources, the found frame does not. Instead, the found frame
shows no growth in earnings inequality since 2000.4 We show that the workers excluded from the
found frame to create the designed frame tend to be very low earnings individuals. In general, it is
    1
      See Katz and Autor (1999) for a summary of the extensive body of work that analyzed the rise in U.S. wage
inequality from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s and the forces behind this change in the wage structure.
    2
      In particular, see Card et al. (2013) and Song et al. (2015). Aside from the increase in firm-specific wage premiums
as a source of earnings inequality, other analyses have focused on skill-biased technological change (Acemoglu and
Autor, 2011) and the rise in the returns to education (Autor, 2014).
    3
      The term “found data” is commonly used in the data science literature, but the first formal use is Whither Biomet-
rics Committee (2010, p. 72). Former U.S. Census Director Robert Groves coined the term “organic data”(Groves,
2010).
    4
      Blackburn and Bloom (1987) made a related point when analyzing earnings inequality from 1967-1985 in CPS-
ASEC. They noted that the patterns in earnings inequality observed in the data depended on various factors, including
which individuals were included in the earnings distribution. More recently, Spletzer (2014) noticed a similar difference
when comparing trends in inequality observed in the CPS vs. the LEHD data.



                                                            1
the bottom of the earnings distribution that is most affected by different frame-selection criteria.
       Using our designed worker frame, we analyze how the earnings distribution has changed
over time. We include inactive workers in our analysis, defined as individuals who are eligible to
work, but report no positive earnings. While most studies of earnings inequality limit the analysis
to employed individuals, we highlight the importance of accounting for the mass of nonemployed
workers when analyzing the patterns in earnings inequality.5 We show that by excluding these
inactive workers in the analysis of earnings inequality, traditional measures of inequality like the
Gini coefficient actually show a decline in earnings inequality during the Great Recession as workers,
mostly from the bottom 80% of the earnings distribution, moved into nonemployment.6 While we
do not receive a direct report of the labor-force participation status of these inactive workers from
the administrative records, about 30% of them have reported positive earnings within the last four
years, indicating that many have had some recent attachment to the labor market.
       With both active and inactive workers in our analysis sample, we decompose the year-to-
year changes in the earnings distribution into flows of workers across five employment outcomes
from 2004-2013: (i) ineligibility, (ii) nonemployment, (iii) employment with annual earnings in the
bottom 20% of the earnings distribution, (iv) employment in the middle 60%, and (v) employment in
the top 20%. From this decomposition we find that mobility, both upward and downward, generally
occurs between neighboring parts of the inactivity/earnings distribution. Specifically, inactive
workers are most likely to transition into employment at the bottom of the earnings distribution,
and rarely do employed workers jump from the bottom of the earnings distribution to the top.
Furthermore, worker flows explain almost all of the changes in the earnings distribution in the last
decade, with the average real earnings of workers in the bottom, middle and top of the earnings
distribution remaining fairly constant.
       The Great Recession had a very large impact on these flows, with over nine million workers
moving into nonemployment and almost four million workers falling from the middle of the earnings
distribution to the bottom. While gross outflows from inactivity increased during the recovery, the
flows have not been large enough to noticeably reduce the large pool of inactive workers accumulated
during the early years of the Great Recession. Furthermore, overall mobility declined, with workers
more likely to remain in their current employment state.
       To understand the role of the firm in moving workers to the various parts of the earnings
distribution, we decompose the above flows by worker and firm types. Specifically, we estimate the
   5
     Numerous studies have documented that workers face large earnings losses upon job loss (Jacobson et al., 1993;
Stevens, 1997), and that layoffs are highly counter-cyclical (Hall, 2005). However, while there are studies that allow
the probability of experiencing unemployment spells to differ across income groups (Castañeda et al., 1998) and some
that explicitly take into account the effect of job loss when estimating models of earnings dynamics (Altonji et al.,
2013), there is no consensus in the literature on the best method for incorporating inactive workers into a study of
earnings inequality.
   6
     While many studies have documented a rise in earnings inequality during recessions (for example, Castañeda
et al., 1998), other studies have noted that this relationship may not always hold. In particular, Barlevy and Tsiddon
(2006) note that the cyclical variation in earnings inequality may also be connected to long-run trends in inequality.
More recently, Piketty and Saez (2013) focus on the affect of business cycles on the top of the income distribution,
where transitions into unemployment are less of an issue.

statistical model developed in Abowd, Kramarz and Margolis (1999), AKM hereafter, to decompose
annual earnings into firm and non-firm components. Then, we characterize the firm component
by its position in the overall distribution of firm components. For the person side of the analysis,
we consider only the AKM worker effect and the estimated effect of the skill-related regressors.
We label this component the skill type. Using the firm-type/skill-type dichotomy, we classify
workers by their skill-type location in the earnings distribution and by their employer’s location
in the firm-component distribution. We examine the mobility patterns and earnings changes for
different skill-types of workers employed at different pay-types of firms. We find that while the
difference between working at a bottom- or middle-paying firm is relatively small, the gains from
working at a top-paying firm are large. In particular, workers benefit from working at a top-paying
firm in two ways. First, workers employed at a top-paying firm earn more than similar workers
employed at bottom- and middle-paying firms. Second, workers at top-paying firms experience a
higher probability of moving up the earnings distribution in the following year. Thus, top-paying
firms are associated with increases in both the probability of upward mobility for a worker and the
probability of remaining at the top of the earnings distribution.

Related Literature
This paper contributes to two main strands of literature on earnings inequality. The first documents
the trends in earnings inequality. The second analyzes the sources of earnings inequality, with a
particular emphasis on understanding the role of firms.

Trends in Earnings Inequality              There is a large body of work that documents the trends in
inequality and tries to identify the sources of these changes. Many of these early studies analyzed
the public-use micro-data from the Current Population Survey (CPS). These studies documented a
dramatic rise in wage-rate and earnings inequality that started in the late 1970s and continued until
the mid-1990s.7 This widening of the earnings distribution, while still present, has slowed since the
mid-1990s. Much of the focus of this literature has shifted towards understanding the polarization
of the wage rate distribution.8 Piketty and Saez (2003) directed the attention of researchers to
analyzing the change in the share of income received by the top 1%.
       More recent studies also use administrative data to study earnings inequality. Unlike data
collected from household surveys, administrative earnings data are generally free from measurement
error and top-coding (Abowd and Stinson, 2013), but often lack direct information on labor supply,
which makes the distinction between earnings and wage-rate analyses salient. In the U.S., given
the absence of information on hours worked on most administrative records, the focus has shifted
from wage rates to earnings or income.9 Kopczuk et al. (2010) use micro-data from the Social
   7
    See, for example, Katz and Murphy (1992), Levy and Murnane (1992), Juhn, Murphy and Pierce (1993), and
Katz and Autor (1999).
  8
    See Autor et al. (2008) and Acemoglu and Autor (2011) for a summary of more recent work on wage polarization.
These studies usually define the “wage rate” as the earnings of full-time, full-year workers.
  9
    Researchers have also used administrative data from other countries to study earnings inequality. Baker and

Security Administration (SSA) with information on taxable social security earnings to analyze
the evolution of earnings inequality and mobility from 1937 to 2004.10 They find that earnings
inequality over this period is U-shaped, decreasing until about 1953, then increasing thereafter.11
Finally, Spletzer (2014) analyzes the trends in earnings equality in the LEHD data. The trend in
earnings inequality depends on the workers included in the sample for analysis. Specifically, he
shows that quarterly earnings inequality has been increasing among workers who are very attached
to the labor market.12 However, annual earnings inequality has not changed since around 2000 when
Spletzer (2014) includes all workers age 15 and older in his analysis sample, a result consistent with
our findings when we use the data on all available jobs, but inconsistent with our findings when we
correct the estimation frame to exclude job records associated with what we call ineligible workers.
       With the availability of all these data sources for studying earnings inequality, Spletzer (2014)
also analyzes how the patterns in inequality vary across data sources. While he conducts detailed
comparison across several sources, we focus on the comparison between Current Population Survey’s
Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC) and the LEHD data.13 In particular, he
compares the evolution of the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile in CPS-ASEC and in LEHD.
When comparing these two sources, Spletzer documents different patterns in the 90/10 ratio across
the two that are very similar to our findings. In particular, the 90/10 ratio in CPS-ASEC has been
increasing over the last 15 years, while the 90/10 ratio in LEHD has remained relatively flat. While
Spletzer (2014) identifies that it is differences in the evolution of the bottom half of the earnings
distribution causing this discrepancy, he does not further analyze the differences in the sample of
workers covered by CPS-ASEC (a designed frame) and those covered by LEHD (a found frame),
as we do.14

The Role of Firms in Earnings Inequality                         To evaluate the role of firms in the rise in
inequality, many papers estimate a variation of the statistical model presented in AKM.15 The data
Solon (2003) use longitudinal income tax records to decompose the growth in earnings inequality in Canada into its
permanent and transitory components. They find that both of these components are important.
  10
     Kopczuk et al. (2010) use several data sources from SSA for their analysis. See section II.B of their paper for the
precise details.
  11
     Guvenen et al. (2014) also use micro-data from SSA; however, their earnings measure comes from W-2 forms (box
1) submitted directly by the employers. They focus on earnings risk changes during recessions; in their results, the
trend in earnings inequality, which can be computed from their reported earnings percentiles, shows a small decline
in earnings inequality during the 1990s until about 2000. Since 2000, earnings inequality has been on the rise. See
Table A.3 of their Appendix A for the percentiles of the earnings distribution.
  12
     To proxy for full-time workers, Spletzer (2014) only includes full-quarter workers: individuals with at least three
consecutive quarters of positive earnings, for whom the interior quarter is studied.
  13
     Spletzer (2014) also compares LEHD data to the data from the outgoing rotation group contained in the CPS
basic monthly files and the IRS data used in Saez (2015).
  14
     Spletzer (2014) notes that the scope of coverage of CPS-ASEC is previous year income from all jobs for all persons
aged 15 and over currently residing in the household. To get comparable estimates from LEHD, he computes annual
earnings from all jobs for all workers aged 15 and over. While we impose no age restriction on our found frame, the
results in Spletzer (2014) are very comparable. Further, it is interesting to note that just imposing an age restriction,
as is done in many studies, is not sufficient to reconcile the differences in earnings inequality trends observed in
CPS-ASEC and LEHD when using the underlying LEHD data without adjustments to their frame.
  15
     A number of papers in this volume use or analyze the AKM decomposition. Freeman et al. (forthcoming) directly
apply the AKM method to the LEHD data, using the all-workers frame we discuss below. Card et al. (forthcoming)


                                                           4
requirements that allow for the identification of separate worker and firm fixed effects–longitudinal
links in both dimensions with sufficient network connectivity–almost always restrict such studies
to administrative data. Card et al. (2013) applied this statistical technique to administrative data
from Germany. Their analysis focused on full-time, full-year male employees. Their estimates
suggest that, for this group of workers, the rise in German wage-rate inequality was in part due
to the increase in the dispersion in wage premiums paid by firms. Song et al. (2015) take a
nonparametric approach to measurement of the firm’s contribution to the rise in earnings inequality.
Using SSA earnings data from the W-2 tax information forms from 1978-2012, they decompose the
rise in earnings inequality into the part attributed to rising dispersion between firms in the average
earnings they pay their employees and the part attributed to rising earnings dispersion among
workers within a firm. They find that virtually all of the rise in earnings inequality is accounted
for by an increase in the dispersion in the average earnings paid by firms. In their data, earnings
differences among workers at the same firm have remained fairly constant over this period.
       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the Unemployment
Insurance (UI) based individual- and job-level data we use in our analysis and discusses the creation
of our all-workers and eligible-workers frames. Section 3 presents and compares inequality trends
in found versus designed data. This section also briefly discusses the results of comparing our
analysis frames to data from the Current Population Survey and the American Community Survey.
Section 4 analyzes the evolution of the earnings distribution over time and presents a worker
flow decomposition of the year-to-year change in the earnings distribution. Section 5 analyzes
the importance of firms in understanding these changes in the earnings distribution. Section 6
concludes.


2     Data Sources and Methods
The empirical work in this paper uses three different sources of earnings information. The pri-
mary data source is the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) infrastructure files,
developed and maintained by the U.S. Census Bureau.16 We also use two household surveys: the
Current Population Survey (CPS) and the American Community Survey (ACS). From these three
data sources, we create two annual person-level earnings files covering the period 1990-2013. We
construct the first file using the LEHD data and the second file using repeated cross-sectional CPS
and ACS microdata.
       In the LEHD data infrastructure, a “job” is the statutory employment of a worker by a
statutory employer as defined by the Unemployment Insurance (UI) system in a given state. Man-
develop a full economic model that interprets AKM in the equilibrium, and apply that model to data from Portugal.
Van Reenen et al. (forthcoming) use AKM worker and firm effects to augment their analysis of German employers.
Haltiwanger et al. (forthcoming) use the LEHD data in the all-workers frame, relying on observable firm characteristics
rather than the AKM decomposition to study the employer’s contribution. Juhn et al. (forthcoming) measure earnings
volatility from the LEHD data, using the all-workers frame and requiring two consecutive years of positive earnings
to study whether firm revenue shocks are transmitted to workers.
  16
     See Abowd et al. (2009) for a detailed summary of the construction of the LEHD infrastructure.

dated reporting of UI-covered wage and salary payments between one statutory employer and one
statutory employee is governed by the state’s UI system. Reporting covers private employers, state
and local government. There are no self-employment earnings unless the proprietor drew a salary,
which is indistinguishable from other employees in this case.
         The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) supplied federal jobs data, included from
2000Q1 forward. The OPM data were edited as part of the LEHD infrastructure processing to
produce records containing quarterly earnings reports comparable to those reported directly in the
UI wage and salary payments. As part of this processing, pseudo-UI account numbers were created
using the observed combinations of duty station state and agency/sub-element.17 The result is a
set of state-level employer identifiers conceptually similar to those found on the UI data for private
firms.
         Due to national security regulations, which suppress certain jobs from the ones released by
OPM to the public and other agencies, the coverage of the OPM extract varies by agency. Under-
coverage is particularly severe for the Department of Defense (including the Air Force, Army, and
Navy), Department of Justice, Department of State, and the Department of Treasury. Although
the federal jobs data are typically not included as part of the state-based UI system, going forward
in this paper, when we say “UI-covered” employment, we mean “statutory employment” as defined
by the UI system or a statutory federal employee.

2.1      Date Regimes
States and the federal government joined the partnership that supplies input data to the LEHD
program at different dates. When a state or the federal government joined, the data custodians
were asked to produce historical data for as many quarters in the past, back to 1990Q1, as could
be reasonably recovered from their information storage systems. As a result, the date that a
data-supplying entity joined the partnership is not the same as the first quarter in which that
entity’s data appear in the system. The start date for any state or the federal government depends
primarily on the amount of historical data the state or federal government could recover at the time
it joined. This potential ignorability (in the sense of Rubin (1987) or Imbens and Rubin (2015))
of the start data for a segment of the LEHD data is the basis for our methods of constructing
nationally representative estimates back to the early 1990s.18
         To understand how state entrance into the LEHD program affects the trends in earnings
inequality, we analyze four regimes that correspond to different epochs of data availability:

   • Regime 1: 1990-2013 [19% of 2012Q1 QCEW private employment]
     (AK CO MD ID IL IN KS LA MO WA WI);
   • Regime 1 and 2: 1995-2013 [68%]

presents a detailed tabulation of the coverage of each date regime.
                                                          We did not create a separate date regime when the OPM data begin in 2000Q1 for two
reasons. First, the proportion of reported federal jobs in 2000Q1 is small, no more than four
percent of 2012Q1 UI covered employment in a state and, on average, less than one percent,
except for DC, where the proportion of OPM jobs is about nineteen percent. Second, although the
proportion of OPM jobs in DC is high, jobs in DC are part of regime four, which does not begin
until 2004Q1.

2.2                                                       Job and Person Sampling Frames
By 2004Q1 the LEHD data represent the complete universe of statutory jobs in the U.S.: all fifty
states, the District of Columbia, and the federal government are reporting regularly. Before this
date, LEHD data provide a complete frame for the states in each date regime (excluding the federal

                                                                                                                                          7
government before 2000Q1). After this date, the LEHD data, in theory, provide a complete frame
for the national population of UI covered jobs (including federal employees). Studying job-level
inequality, the task for which having a complete job frame is well suited, as a proxy for person-level
inequality may be misleading due to the time-varying many-to-one assignment of jobs to workers.
The number of employers per worker varies over the business cycle. Lower-earning workers tend
to have more employers, complicating the interpretation of job-level results.19 Therefore, when
studying inequality, it is preferable to have a person frame that covers a known population of
interest, such as all persons legally eligible to work in the United States. For our analyses, we use
two different approaches to creating frames of jobs and workers. The first approach relies only on
the employer-employee links present in the UI data. This method captures all reported jobs. The
second approach uses the Census Bureau’s edited version of the Social Security Administration’s
master SSN database (the “Numident”), capturing all reported employment-eligible workers but
removing jobs associated with ineligible workers, as we elaborate below.
         LEHD earnings records are reported quarterly by the employing firm. These records contain
a nine-digit person identifier, typically assumed to be a Social Security Number. However, at the
time the report is received by the state UI office, the nine-digit person identifiers are not verified,
resulting in records both with and without a valid SSN. Using the Numident, we ascertain if each
earnings record is associated with a valid SSN. Records not associated with a valid SSN may
have an alternate, valid person identifier, such as an IRS-issued Taxpayer Identification Number;
nevertheless, we can only distinguish between valid and invalid SSNs. If the SSN is valid, we have
access to demographic characteristics, such as sex and birth date, from the Numident and other
Census sources. We also have an employment history from the UI wage records. If the SSN is not
valid, we only have access to the employment history.
         Our first frame, the “all-workers frame,” contains earnings for all jobs reported on the UI
data for each date regime in the relevant years from 1990-2013, as noted in Figure 1.
         Our second frame, the “eligible-workers frame” is also delineated by these date regimes, but
includes jobs only for the subset of the all-workers frame that meets the following criteria:

       • has a valid SSN on the Numident;

       • appears in the frame every year from 1990 to 2013 in which that individual is between the
         ages of 18 and 70, inclusive;

       • the year of the recorded data is greater than or equal to the SSN year of issue, and less than
         or equal to the year of death (if available); and

       • has an SSN that was associated with fewer than 12 jobs during the data year.

An eligible worker is labeled as “active” in the labor market in a given year when UI earnings
are positive, and “inactive” otherwise. The valid SSN, age-range, date of death, number of jobs,
  19
    See Hirsch and Husain (2013) and the references therein for a summary of the literature on the cyclicality of
multiple job-holding. The authors find that the multiple job-holding rate is pro-cyclical, declining during recessions
because of the increased slackness in the labor market.

and active worker restrictions remove about 7% of the worker-year records found in the all-workers
frame.
       The purpose of the eligible-workers frame is twofold. The Numident allows us to consistently
identify a set of persons legally eligible to work each year, while at the same time implicitly removing
earning records from our analysis sample that are not associated with individuals in the covered
population. However, we also go a step further, and remove earnings records with a valid SSN
where the available data strongly suggest that the SSN is not being used by the original owner.20
These two types of suspect nine-digit person identifiers—invalid SSNs that do not match to the
Census Numident and valid SSNs apparently being used by multiple persons and/or for whom the
age of the person issued the SSN is inconsistent with labor-market activity—we call “immigrant
candidates.”
       Table 1 presents basic counts of persons and jobs in the eligible-workers frame and in the
immigrant candidate file. While we present some analysis of the immigrant candidate jobs in
Appendix A, we do not have sufficient information to convert the collection of these jobs into an
inter-temporally consistent frame for this population of individuals. We have no plausible means
of determining how many immigrant candidates are using each SSN in this collection of UI wage
records.
       Even accounting for the increasing coverage of each date regime, there is a clear, strong
upward trend in the number of immigrant-candidate records until the Great Recession, and a
strong downward trend thereafter. Because there are data in the system for each of these records,
the associated nine-digit person identifier represents at least one worker, but may represent many.
A great deal of supplemental research would be required to estimate the relation between how many
jobs are reported for a “worker” in the immigrant-candidate records and the number of individuals
employed. Even more research would be required to estimate their characteristics. We do not
attempt such research here. We note that when we use the all-workers frame, each associated
nine-digit person identifier counts as one individual, but there is no adjustment for being inactive;
that is, we do not assume zero earnings when this “worker” has no reported earnings. When we use
the eligible-workers frame, all immigrant-candidate records are excluded. Eligible inactive workers
are assumed to have zero earnings when there is no reported activity in any job.
       Appendix A contains additional detailed analyses of the construction of the eligible-workers
frame. In particular, Appendix Figure A.1 plots the count of earnings records excluded from
the eligible-workers frame each year, disaggregated by earnings records each year associated with
individuals who have invalid SSNs, who are either too young or too old, and/or who report working
12 or more jobs in a year. Detailed counts are reported in Appendix Table A.2.
  20
    The use of SSNs not originally issued to the person using the SSN has been documented and studied by Brown
et al. (2013) and others.

Notes: The table presents counts of the number of persons and jobs in the eligible-workers frame and in the
immigrant candidates file. The sum of these two components is the all-workers frame. The persons in the
eligible-workers frame are disaggregated into those who report positive earnings (Active) and those who do not
(Inactive). The frame is complete and covers the entire U.S. from 2004 forward.

2.3    Earnings Definitions and Coverage
In this section we define our earnings measures for both the all-workers and the eligible-workers
frames. Our primary measure of earnings is based on annual UI job-level earnings reports. We
adjust nominal earnings to real earnings using the Consumer Price Index (CPI-U), with 2000 as
the base year. Let yijt be the real earnings for worker i employed at firm j in year t. Person-level
annual earnings sum all jobs for each worker in each year:
                                                          X
                                                  eit =        yijt .                                           (1)
                                                           j


Using eit , we estimate total annual earnings for the eligible-workers frame in year t using:
                                                           X
                                             EtEW =                     eit ,                                   (2)
                                                       i|(i,t)∈EWt


where EWt is the set of workers in the eligible-workers frame in year t. For the period 2004-2013,
when our frames contain data for the entire U.S., the eligible-workers frame is approximately 90%
of wage and salary compensation as defined in the National Income and Product Accounts.21

2.4    Estimation of the Earnings/Inactivity Distribution
We begin by calculating deciles of eligible-workers person-level earnings, eit , pooled across the years
2004-2013. Using these deciles, we create three earnings bins as shown in Table 2. The bins are
designed to capture the bottom, middle, and top of the earnings distribution over the entire ten-
year period. For example, the first two columns in Table 2 show the results for bin 2, workers in the
bottom 20% of the earnings distribution.22 Workers in this bin have a minimum annual earnings
value of $2, a maximum value of $6,600, and a mean log earnings in real 2000 dollars of $7.473
(implied geometric mean real earnings $1,760).
       The low mean log earnings in bins 2 and 3 suggests that a large proportion of workers in
these bins are employed for only part of the year. In Table 3 we present information about the
labor-force activity of workers in each of the three earnings bins. Each row in the table (except the
residual category “All Other”) represents a specific combination of quarters worked and number of
quarters in the longest job, truncated at a maximum of six quarters. The number of quarters in
the longest job takes on values from one to six. A five-quarter longest job is active in either the
fourth quarter of the previous year or the first quarter of the subsequent year, while a six-quarter
longest job is active in both. Thus a six-quarter active job is active at the beginning of a calendar
year, the end of a calendar year, and all quarters in the middle. The most prevalent pattern in
each earnings category is listed first, followed by the next most prevalent, and continuing until the
table contains the patterns for approximately 80% of the workers in a typical year.
  21
    Appendix A provides a detailed analysis of the earnings coverage for each of our frames in comparison with BEA
National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) annual wages and salary estimates.
 22
    Bin 1 is reserved for eligible but inactive workers, who are not included in the summaries described in Table 2.

                      Maximum        8.795   ($6,600)   10.750 ($46,800)   16.140 ($10,230,000)


Notes: The table presents statistics on real earnings for three categories of workers: (i) Bin 2 : bottom 20% of the
pooled annual-earnings distribution of eligible workers from 2004-2013, (ii) Bin 3 : the middle 60%, and (iii) Bin 4 :
the top 20%. The rows show the minimum, mean, and maximum log earnings, log(eit ), of each bin. The
exponentiated values (implied geometric means) are listed in parentheses. All earnings are in real 2000 dollars
(adjusted using CPI-U). Note that the minimum and maximum values of each bin are rounded to four significant
digits.


       The dominant labor-force attachment pattern varies substantially across bins: 31% of the
workers in the bottom 20% of the earnings distribution work only one quarter. In contrast, for
workers in the top 20% of the earnings distribution, the most common labor force status is employ-
ment with at least one firm for the entire year. Although there are almost certainly large differences
in average wages for workers at the bottom, middle and top of the earnings distribution, one of the
primary reasons average annual earnings for workers in the bottom earnings category are so low is
they are employed for only a small portion of the year.
       Finally, we combine the earnings bins discussed above with the active/inactive status infor-
mation available for the eligible-workers frame to create four mutually exclusive earnings/inactivity
categories:

    1. eligible to work, but no reported UI earnings (inactive);

    2. working and in the bottom 20% of the overall UI earnings distribution;

    3. working and in the middle 60% of the overall UI earnings distribution; and

    4. working and in the top 20% of the overall UI earnings distribution.

We analyze these four bins comprehensively in Sections 4 and 5, when we study the dynamics of
earnings distribution changes and the role of the firm.


3     Inequality Trends in the LEHD Infrastructure Data (1990-2013)
The determination of an appropriate frame for studying changes in earnings inequality led us to
analyze our eligible-workers frame, which is the complete population for the United States during
the critical period from 2004-2013. The results in this section, and the rest of the paper, relate
exclusively to the eligible-workers frame. Where we have also analyzed comparable data for the
all-workers frame, we reference results in Appendix B.
       We begin by examining the evolution of the percentiles of the earnings distribution. To

Notes: Each row in the table represents a specific combination of quarters worked and number of quarters in the
longest job. The number of quarters in the longest job takes on values from one to six. A five-quarter longest job is
active in either the fourth quarter of the previous year or the first quarter of the subsequent year, while a
six-quarter longest job is active in both. The most prevalent pattern in each earnings bin is listed first with the next
most prevalent second, continuing until the table contains the patterns for approximately 80% of the workers in a
typical year. All Other is the residual category. The counts are averages per year from the eligible-workers frame.
The full table of counts is available in Appendix Table A.4.


understand how state entry into the LEHD partnership might affect the earnings distribution
over time, we estimate percentiles of the earnings distribution for workers in each of the four date
regimes by year. Figure 2 plots the 10th , 20th , 50th , 80th , 90th , and 95th percentiles of the cumulative
earnings distribution by date regime. The cumulative distribution contains data for all regimes less
than or equal to the sampling regime shown in the legend.
       Notice that differences in the 10th , 20th , and 50th percentiles are virtually indistinguishable
across date regimes. Above the median, however, there is some variation in the 80th , 90th , and 95th
percentiles across date regimes. In particular, the inclusion of data from high earnings and populous
states, like CA and NY, in date regime 2 increases the estimated quantile values, especially for the
95th percentile. However, once these states have entered, the effect of the states entering in regimes
3 and 4 is much less pronounced. The level differences in the percentiles are relatively minor,
especially after 1995 (regime 2). The trends in inequality are very similar across date regimes. We
conclude that the date of state entry does not appear to significantly affect earnings inequality
measures, especially after 1995.23
  23
    Appendix Figure B.1 plots the same percentiles comparing the two worker frames for all available years, equivalent
to the regime 4 cumulative distribution in Figure 2. That comparison indicates that the levels of all percentiles are
greater in every year in the eligible-worker frame, as compared to the all-worker frame, but the trends are nearly
identical. For both frames, there is no evidence of differences that are due to the dates in which states entered the
frames, except for the jump associated with the entry of CA and NY in regime 2. Appendix Figure B.2 plots the ratio
of the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile for each date regime using the all-workers frame. The figure confirms
that there are some differences in the levels of these curves but the trend analysis is largely unchanged. The fact that

      Figure 2: Percentiles of the Earnings Distribution for Eligible Workers by Date Regime




Notes: The figure plots the 10th , 20th , 50th , 80th , 90th , and 95th percentiles of the earnings distribution of eligible
workers by date regime and year. The cumulative distribution plots the data for all regimes less than or equal to
the indicated regime. For example, “P95 Regime 2” indicates the 95th percentile for all states in regimes 1 and 2.


       We next turn to the evolution of earnings inequality over the past 23 years. Figure 3 presents
the following measures of earnings inequality: (i) the ratio of the 99th and the 1st percentiles (99/1
ratio, and so forth), (ii) the ratio of the 95th and the 5th percentiles, (iii) the ratio of the 90th and
the 10th percentiles, (iv) the ratio of the 80th and the 20th percentiles, and (v) the variance of log
earnings.24 These measures are all reported relative to their value in 2000.25 After 2000, there is
a persistent increase in earnings inequality according to all measures. On average, the 99/1 ratio
is 15.4% higher; the 95/5 ratio is 13.6% higher; and the 90/10 ratio is 11.4% higher than in 2000.
Much of the rise in earnings inequality occurs during the Great Recession and persists into the
recovery. For example, the 90/10 ratio was on average 6.7% higher from 2001-2007 than in 2000.
Then, during the Great Recession, the 90/10 ratio was 15.1% higher from 2008-2009 than in 2000.
This increase does not peak until 2010, resulting in inequality being 17.8% higher from 2010-2013
than in 2000. Except for the 99/1 ratio, post-2000 trends do not appear in the all-workers frame.26

the earnings distribution is unaffected by state entry is very strong evidence that the date of entry of a state into the
LEHD infrastructure can be modeled as ignorably missing (Rubin, 1987; Imbens and Rubin, 2015).
  24
     We also analyze how state entry into the LEHD data affects these measures of earnings inequality. Appendix
Figure B.2 plots the 90/10 ratio across date regimes. There are only minor differences across these regimes. Thus, the
date of state entry does not affect the analysis of earnings inequality. Therefore, in the main discussion, we present
results from the overall distribution where we include data from all available states in a given year.
  25
     For a comparison of the levels of these ratios across the two frames, see Appendix Figures B.5a, B.5b, B.6a, and
B.6b.
  26
     The statistics quoted in this paragraph are summarized in Appendix Table B.2, where they are also compared to
ratios obtained when the all-workers frame is used. Removing the immigrant candidates from the frame materially
alters the estimated trends in earnings inequality. While there is a similar decline in earnings inequality from 1995 to
2000 in both frames, post-2000, the trends in earnings inequality among eligible workers diverge from those observed
among all workers. Appendix Table B.2 shows that, on average, while the 99/1 ratio was 15.4% higher post-2000

Notes: Subplot (a) presents measures of earnings inequality for all workers in all states relative to 2000 from
1990-2013. Subplot (b) presents measures of earnings inequality for eligible workers in all states relative to 2000
from 1990-2013. The measures of earnings inequality considered are (i) P99 to P1 : the ratio of the 99th to the 1st
percentile; (ii) P95 to P5 : the ratio of the 95th to the 5th percentile; (iii) P90 to P10 : the ratio of the 90th to the
10th percentile; (iv) P80 to P20 the ratio of the 80th to the 20th percentile; and (v) Variance: the variance of log
annual earnings. Results are based on the eligible-workers frame from the LEHD infrastructure files.


       Figure 4 presents changes in the top and bottom halves of the earnings distribution by
decomposing the ratios around the median.27 At the top of the distribution, we compute the
ratio of the 99th to the 50th percentile (99/50 ratio, and so forth), the ratio of the 95th to the
50th percentile, the ratio of the 90th to the 50th percentile, and the ratio of the 80th to the 50th
percentile. At the bottom, we analyze the ratio of the 50th to the 1st percentile, the ratio of the
50th to the 5th percentile, the ratio of the 50th to the 10th percentile, and the ratio of the 50th to
the 20th percentile. These ratios are all reported relative to the their value in 2000.28 The top and
the bottom of the earnings distribution have evolved quite differently. Since 2000, the ratios of the
top percentiles to the median have been increasing very gradually, as shown in Figure 4a. However,
this increase at the top has been small compared to the rise in inequality at the bottom of the
earnings distribution as shown in Figure 4b. The ratios of the median to the bottom percentiles
have been increasing dramatically, indicating earnings growth at the bottom of the distribution has
not kept up with earnings growth at the median. The bottom of the earnings distribution is more
cyclically sensitive with much of the rise in inequality occurring during the Great Recession.29

in the eligible-workers frame compared to only 5.0% higher in the all-workers frame, none of the other post-2000
inequality measures are rising in the all-workers frame.

     For a comparison of the levels of these ratios across the two frames, see the bottom four subplots in Appendix
Figures B.5 and B.6.

     These conclusions are materially different in the all-workers frame, which shows modest changes in inequality of
roughly equal magnitudes at the top and bottom of the distribution. See Appendix Figures B.4a and B.4b.

Notes: Subplots (a) and (b) decompose the 99/1 ratio, the 95/5 ratio, the 90/10 ratio, and the 80/20 for eligible
workers in all states relative to 2000 from 1990-2013 relative to the median. Subplot (a) plots the following ratios for
the top half of the earnings distribution: (i) P99 to P50 : the ratio of the 99th to the 50th percentile; (ii) P95 to P50 :
the ratio of the 95th to the 50th percentile; (iii) P90 to P50 : the ratio of the 90th to the 50th percentile; and
(iv) P80 to P50 the ratio of the 80th to the 50th percentile. Subplot (b) plots the following ratios for the bottom
half of the earnings distribution: (i) P50 to P1 : the ratio of the 50th to the 1st percentile; (ii) P50 to P5 : the ratio
of the 50th to the 5th percentile; (iii) P50 to P10 : the ratio of the 50th to the 10th percentile; and (iv) P50 to P20
the ratio of the 50th to the 20th percentile. The estimates are based on the eligible-workers frame from the LEHD
infrastructure files. See Appendix Figure B.4 for comparable data using the all-worker frame.


              To summarize, earnings inequality has been on the rise since 2000 and spiked during the Great
Recession. This conclusion depends materially on our use of the eligible-workers frame. Direct use
of the all-workers frame–that is, using all the job records in the LEHD infrastructure files– produces
earnings inequality measures and trends that appear not to change from 2000 through the Great
Recession to 2013. Constructing the eligible-workers frame by excluding immigrant candidate
records shifts the earnings distribution of eligible workers to the right of the earnings distribution
of all workers. While this shift in the earnings distribution is not particularly surprising, the
resulting change in the trends in earnings inequality between the two frames is. When studying
changes in earnings inequality over time, especially when using administrative data, the choice of
worker frame matters substantially.

3.1           Comparison of LEHD Data to the CPS and ACS
To understand the differences between analyses using respondent-provided earnings data in large-
scale household surveys and those using administrative data on earnings in the unemployment
insurance system, we constructed detailed analysis samples from the Current Population Survey-
Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC, 1990-2004) and the American Community
Survey (ACS, 2000-2013). We also linked the LEHD earnings data to the ACS data at the individual
record level (2005-2013). We used the linked data to study differences between individuals found
only in the ACS data and those found in both sources.30 The details of the data construction can
  30
    Because the ACS is a sample survey while the LEHD data are essentially the population over this period, we
cannot distinguish between individuals found only in the LEHD data who should have linked to the ACS and those

be found in Appendix C.1. The details of the data linkage can be found in Appendix C.3.
       In the household survey data, we defined “covered workers” to be individuals who worked in
a job that should have appeared in the LEHD data. Table 4 show that the estimated percentile
values of the earnings distribution tend to be greater for covered workers than for all workers in
the household survey data.31 For percentiles at or above the median, the values from the LEHD
eligible-workers frame are close to the ones from the covered workers in household surveys. Below
the median, however, the differences are greater, with the percentiles estimated from the household
surveys being much greater than the percentiles estimated from the LEHD eligible-workers frame.
For example, earnings associated with the 10th percentile in the CPS/ACS data are close to the
20th percentile in the LEHD data.32 We conclude that the differences between survey-reported
and administrative earnings data at or above the median are minimal, but that, below the median,
household surveys capture earnings that are not captured by the administrative data.33

Notes: The first row presents the average percentile values from the earnings distribution of covered workers in the
combined CPS/ACS data from 1995-2013. The second row presents the average percentile values from the earnings
distribution of eligible workers in all states from 1995-2013. The third row computes the difference between the
average percentiles in the household surveys and the same ones computed from the LEHD eligible-workers frame.
The last row computes the ratio of each percentile from the covered workers in the household surveys to the LEHD
eligible- workers frame.


       Figures 5a and 5b show that the trends in earnings inequality in the household survey data
are consistent with our findings from the eligible-worker frame in the LEHD data, and inconsistent
with the findings from the all-worker frame. This conclusion also holds for the analysis of trends
in the top and bottom separately.34 The pattern of inequality ratios around the Great Recession is
also similar to the one found in the eligible-workers frame, and dissimilar to the the analysis based
on the all-workers frame.35 Additional results and discussion are in Appendix C.2.
who were not sampled by the ACS. For this reason, we don’t study the records of those in the LEHD-only group.

     Also compare Appendix Figure C.1 with Appendix Figure B.1.

  33
     This conclusion is not sensitive to using the eligible-workers frame. There are many more very low earnings
records among the immigrant candidates, which would only exacerbate the differences below the median.

Notes: Subplot (a) presents measures of earnings inequality for all workers in CPS/ACS relative to 2000 from
1990-2013. Subplot (b) presents measures of earnings inequality for covered workers in CPS/ACS relative to 2000
from 1990-2013. The measures of earnings inequality considered are (i) P95 to P5 : the ratio of the 95th to the 5th
percentile; (ii) P90 to P10 : the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile; (iii) P80 to P20 the ratio of the 80th to the
20th percentile; and (iv) Variance: the variance of log annual earnings.


              To better understand the discrepancies at the bottom of the earnings distribution, we ana-
lyzed linked ACS and LEHD individual records. We find that 85% of the individuals we expect
to find in both the ACS and LEHD data are present in both with positive earnings. The other
15% are not found in the LEHD data, and, therefore, have zero administrative earnings.36 The
result suggests that survey respondents are giving answers that imply that their job should be cov-
ered in the administrative data, but there are not corresponding administrative records to match
the survey-reported income. The reported income of these individuals appears to be the reason
for the discrepancy between the survey and administrative data at the bottom of the earnings
distribution.37 Additional results and discussion are in Appendix C.3.
              Our analysis of the trends in earnings inequality using the various samples of workers in
the CPS/ACS and the two worker frames in the LEHD data shows that, whether the data were
designed or found, an understanding of contributions of individuals included or excluded from the
sample is essential. Conclusions regarding fundamental trends in inequality depend upon these
decisions.

3.2           Effects of Inactivity on Earnings Inequality
We used our household survey to confirm that the trends in the estimated employment-to-population
ratio produced directly from the micro-data match those of the official estimates. In particular, the
employment-to-population ratio fell during the Great Recession, and had not recovered through
2013.38
              We document that around 30 million eligible workers per year had no earnings in the current

year but positive earnings in at least one of the past four years.39 Their treatment materially
affects the distribution of earnings in any given year. It also materially affects the cyclical features
of inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient.40 Additional results and discussion are in
Appendix D.2.
         Although it is unclear which of the adjusted inequality measures correctly weights the inactive
workers, it is worthwhile to consider adjusted measures that count at least some of the zero-earning
workers as part of any general analysis of changes in earnings inequality.


4        Decomposing Changes in the Earnings Distribution
4.1      Evolution of the Earnings/Inactivity Distribution
Beginning in 2004 our eligible-workers frame is complete, including all states, DC, and the federal
government. The adventitious timing of the start of the complete-data period presents us with
the opportunity to study the evolution of the earnings distribution and the dynamics of non-
employment during three distinct epochs of labor market conditions. According to the NBER,
the Great Recession began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Applying this definition
to annual data we have a pre-recession epoch spanning 2004-2007, a recession epoch running from
2008-2009, and a post-recession epoch beginning in 2010 and ending in 2013.
         As we did in Section 2.4, we simplify the earnings distribution by assigning each active
worker to one of three earnings categories (bottom, middle and top) and assign inactive, but
eligible workers to a fourth category. Using the estimated annual earnings/inactivity distributions,
we start by comparing the distribution in 2005 with the distribution in 2004, repeating this process
for each subsequent year until 2013. Each year, the earnings/inactivity distribution may change
relative to the previous year. The extent of this change depends on the number of workers entering
and exiting the eligible-workers frame; the number of workers moving between earnings/inactivity
categories; and changes in average earnings within each category.41
         From 2004 through 2013 there is relatively strong growth in the number of eligible workers,
averaging about 1% per year through 2009, declining to about half that rate after 2009, although
growth within each category is uneven. For example, the largest growth in the number of workers
occurs in the among those eligible to work but inactive (i.e., no earnings in the indicated year),
a category with a growth rate almost twice that of any other group. The growth rate of workers
in the bottom and middle earnings categories is less than half the overall growth rate. When we
examine total earnings, most of the growth is found in the top 20% of the earnings distribution,
with relatively little growth in the bottom 80%. Given that average earnings are falling for the

     The distribution of eligible workers across the four earnings/inactivity categories by year is shown in Appendix
Table E.1. The table also shows the total earnings per year, average earnings per year (total earnings/eligible
workers with positive earnings). The last panel shows the cumulative change over the entire period for each of the
three previous panels.

Notes: The figure plots the share of total earnings in each earnings category by year for the following categories:

distribution in red, and (iii) Bin 4 : the top 20% of the earnings distribution in green.


bottom 80% of workers, it should not be surprising that total earnings for this group fails to keep
pace with the growth in the number of workers. The situation for workers at the top, however,
is much brighter: the top 20% of workers have relatively strong earnings growth of 4.4% over the
period, resulting in growth in total earnings (12.2%) that outpaces the growth in the number of
workers (7.8%).
       The relatively high growth in both the number of eligible workers and average earnings in
the top 20% of the earnings distribution has a strong effect on the distribution of total earnings.
Figure 6 shows the share of total earnings attributed to each earnings category by year. We see
a large amount of earnings inequality: earnings for the top 20% of workers are greater than both
the bottom and middle combined, with the relative share of the top increasing almost continuously
except for a brief pause in 2008 during the height of the Great Recession. We can also see the
declining share of income accruing to the middle 60% of workers. Although the number of workers
in the middle recovered after the Great Recession, average earnings continued to decline while
higher growth in the number of workers at the bottom and top resulted in a declining share of
earnings for workers in the middle 60% of the earnings distribution.

4.2    Earnings/Inactivity Distribution: Decomposition of the Changes
In the previous section we discussed the changing structure of the earnings/inactivity distribution
around the time of the Great Recession. Several key facts stand out. First, there is enormous
growth in the number of eligible workers with no reported earnings from 83,200,954 in 2004 to
96,959,047 in 2010, and still 96,151,327 in 2013. Second, average earnings stagnate (bottom 20%)
or decline (middle 60%) for active workers. Third, the growth in the share of earnings accruing to




                                                          20
the top 20% results from growth in the number of workers and average earnings in that category.42
       In order to better understand these changes, we turn our focus to the flows of workers
moving between active and inactive status as well as between different earnings categories. When
interpreting these results, we implicitly assume average earnings within each category are stable
between 2004-2013. Although changes in average earnings have a role to play, the data suggest that
we focus on the worker flows because the percentage change in the number of workers dominates
the change in average earnings for each category.43
       Starting in 2005, each year we calculate the change in the number of workers between the
current and the previous year for the four earnings/inactivity categories. The year-to-year change
in the number of workers in a specific category is driven by changes in the number of workers
entering (inflows) and the number of workers leaving (outflows). Appendix Section E.1 provides
the derivation of the flow accounting that we summarize here.
       Figure 7 shows the change in the number of workers for each earnings/inactivity category
by year. The data used to calculate the year-to-year differences can be found in the first panel
of Appendix Table E.1. Each line in the graph represents the year-to-year change in the number
of workers for one of the four earnings/inactivity categories. For example, in 2009 there were
94,864,949 eligible workers with no reported UI earnings while in 2008 there were only 88,245,425
workers in the same category, resulting in an increase of 6,619,524 workers. This increase in the
number of eligible but inactive workers occurred during the height of the Great Recession and dwarfs
the change in any other period, even the relatively large increases in the preceding and subsequent
years. The area between the inactive line (blue) and the x-axis represents the cumulative increase in
the number of eligible workers with no earnings over the entire period of 12,950,373. We can clearly
see that the recovery has largely failed to reduce the number of eligible workers with no earnings
through 2013. In contrast, the middle 60% (green line) faced a large reduction in numbers during
the Great Recession, but, unlike the inactive category, the number of workers in the middle has
returned to pre-recession levels, as reflected by the area between middle 60% line and the x-axis.
       Table 5 presents an overview of the flow analysis, flows we will decompose further using the
transition count matrix. The Count (t − 1), Count (t), and Net Change columns are shown in
Appendix Table E.1 and Figure 7. They are reproduced here for comparison with sums of the
transition counts. The stayers (i.e., c22 ) are also included, and while they do not directly affect
the net change in the flows, they represent the number of workers who remain in a given category
for at least two years–giving an indication of the earnings stability of the typical worker. The
outflows, inflows, and net change columns show the results of using Appendix equation E-1. The
difference between the inflows and the outflows equals the net change, which should also equal
the difference in counts between the current and the previous period. For example, returning to

     See Appendix Table E.1.

     When examining only the flows, we also implicitly assume average earnings are the same for each flow. Although
this assumption is false it does not affect trends, since average earnings for a given flow are typically stable over time.
It does, however, affect the scale or magnitude of each flow relative to another flow. Additional earnings change
results and discussion, including the average earnings for each flow, are shown in Appendix E.

the eligible workers with no earnings in 2009, we can see that the inflows were 16,166,420 and the
outflows were 9,546,896. The large increase in the number of workers in this category was due
primarily to a large increase in the inflows relative to the previous year and a small decrease in the
number of outflows. That is, a relatively large number of workers who had a job in the previous
year were unable to find an employer in the current year, while a relatively small number of workers
without a job in the previous year were able to find one in the current year or moved out of the
eligible-workers frame.
       The table also shows a relatively large increase in the number of eligible workers with no
earnings for at least two years over the entire period (stayers in the “Eligible, but no Reported
UI Earnings” Panel). The change in the number of stayers equals the difference between the
inflows in the previous period (the candidates to become stayers) minus the outflows in the current
period. For example, in 2008 there were 13,271,459 eligible workers with at least one year without
reported earnings (inflows), and 9,546,896 of these workers transitioned to another category in 2009
(outflows), resulting in an increase in the stayers between 2008 and 2009 of 3,724,563 workers. The
stayers are useful for understanding the short term (two-year) volatility differences between each
of the categories. For example, the bottom 20% of the UI earnings distribution has relatively few
stayers compared to the middle and the top, consistent with the results presented earlier that most
of these jobs are of relatively short duration. The results also imply that a large number of workers
in the bottom 20% of the earnings distribution only stay there for a year or two before moving to
another category, frequently inactivity.
       Table 6 presents demographic characteristics for the 24 possible year-to-year transitions,
excluding workers not eligible to work in both year t − 1 and year t. The transitions labeled 0
represent workers moving into or out of the eligible-workers frame. The workers moving into the
eligible-worker frame are typically young and predominately non-white, while the workers leaving
the eligible workforce are typically older (60 plus years of age) and predominately white. One

Notes: The estimates are based on the authors’ calculations using characteristics of workers who transition into
and out of the eligible-workers frame used to construct the earnings distributions, including inactive workers, and
transitions between the earnings categories.


interesting transition group is the 0 4 (workers not eligible in t − 1 who transition to the top 20%
of the earnings distribution in t). These workers are predominately older than other newly eligible
workers, male, non-white, and overwhelmingly not born in the U.S. The remaining transitions
have roughly similar characteristics, although older male workers are generally more prevalent in
transitions associated with bin 4 (the top 20%), while female workers are more likely to be associated
with transitions with bin 2 (the bottom 20%).
       Next, we decompose the inflows and outflows further by using the transition matrix of counts.
Figures 8 through 12 show the outflows and inflows for each earnings/inactivity category and the
relevant transition counts by year. In particular, each year, an individual can be in one of the
following five employment states:

   0. Ineligibility: did not meet the requirements to be in the eligible-workers frame

   1. Inactivity: part of the eligible-workers frame, but did not report positive UI earnings

   2. Bottom 20% : annual UI earnings in the bottom 20% of the earnings distribution

   3. Middle 60% : annual UI earnings in the middle 60% of the earnings distribution


                                                             24
  4. Top 20% : annual UI earnings in the top 20% of the earnings distribution

We remind the reader that the cutoffs for the real earnings distribution bins are based on the pooled
years 2004-2013, and do not change over time. It is possible for substantially more or less than
20% of current earners to be in the top 20% bin, for example, in any given year.
      The first subplot in each figure shows the gross outflows (blue line) and the gross inflows
(red line) into an earnings/inactivity category. The difference between the two lines is the net
inflows presented in the last column of Table 5. The second subplot shows the transitions to other
categories associated with the gross outflows line in the first graph. Note that the sum of each series
in the second subplot is equal to the gross outflows line in the first subplot. The third subplot shows
the transition counts associated with gross inflows. Similarly, the sum of each of the series in the
third subplot is equal to the gross inflows line in the first subplot.
      Figure 8 plots the counts of workers moving out of the eligible-workers frame and those
moving into the frame. Notice that gross inflows into eligibility are always greater than gross
outflows from eligibility. Thus, net inflows into eligibility are always positive, but decline and
fail to recover after the Great Recession. This decline is primarily due to a decrease of inflows
into eligibility, although there is a small increase in outflows as well. Notice that the outflows
from eligibility come primarily from inactivity. Recall that inactive individuals are part of the
eligible-workers frame but have no reported earnings. The first row of the second panel in Table 6
shows that inactive workers moving to ineligibility (1 0) tend to be older with an average age of
68. The inflows into eligibility tend to be young workers around the age of 20 moving into either
inactivity or the bottom 20% of the earnings distribution. The exception are individuals moving
into the top 20% of the earnings distribution (0 4), who tend to be older (average age is 33 years
old), male (79.1% are male), and foreign born (12.7% are born in the U.S.). Prior to the Great
Recession, on average, 38.3% of workers moving into eligibility went into inactivity and 49.1% went
into the bottom of the earnings distribution. This flipped during the Great Recession, with 47.5%
of newly eligible workers moving into inactivity and 43.4% moving into the bottom of the earnings
distribution.
      Figure 9 plots the flows into and out of inactivity. Net inflows are generally close to zero,
except during the Great Recession when they became very positive. This spike in net inflows into
inactivity was driven by both a large increase in inflows and a substantial decline in outflows. The
increase in inflows is seen for every category except for the top of the distribution. The decrease in
outflows during the Great Recession is primarily due to a reduction in workers moving to jobs in the
bottom and middle of the earnings distribution, however these flows return to their pre-recession
levels fairly quickly. The net result is a roughly symmetric increase in gross outflows and decrease
in gross inflows. Without either a very large relative increase in gross outflows or a relatively large
decrease in gross inflows, little progress can be made towards reducing the almost 13 million person
increase in the number of eligible workers with no reported earnings during the Great Recession.
      Figure 10 plots the flows into and out of the bottom 20% of the earnings distribution.
Compared to some of the other categories, the counts for the bottom 20% are relatively stable.

The transitions show large changes occurring during the Great Recession. Outflows increased to
nonemployment, while outflows to the middle of the earnings distribution fell (fewer workers moving
up). At the same time inflows from nonemployment decreased and inflows from the middle of the
distribution increased. Workers who moved to nonemployment are being replaced (not at the job
level, but in terms of earnings) with workers from the middle of the distribution.
             Figure 11 shows the flows into and out of the middle 60% of the earnings distribution. There
is a large decrease in net inflows in 2009. This is largely due to an increase in the outflows of
workers to the bottom 20% and nonemployment and a decrease in workers moving up from the
bottom 20%. Although net inflows turn positive again after the Great Recession, these inflows are
not large enough to halt the decreasing share of earnings accruing to workers in the middle 60%.
There has also been a decline in workers moving from the middle to the top 20%, which peaked in
2007, implying a decrease in upward earnings mobility. A decrease in workers moving from the top
to the bottom is also present, implying a decrease in downward earnings mobility. Post-recession,
workers in the middle are more likely to stay in the middle and workers at the top are more likely
to stay at the top.
             Figure 12 plots the flows into and out of the top 20% of the earnings distribution. Notice
that there is a strong net inflow of workers to the top 20% prior to the Great Recession and a

decrease during the recession. Although net inflows turn positive again in 2012, they do not return
to the heights seen prior to the Great Recession. Workers at the top are relatively disconnected
from the rest of the earnings distribution. The only substantial flows are to and from the middle,
but the magnitudes of both of these flows appear to be declining post recession.44
            Overall, mobility occurs most often between neighboring parts of the earnings/inactivity
distribution. It is relatively rare to jump more than one earnings/inactivity category. For example,
moving from the bottom to the top is a relatively rare event, while moving from the bottom to the
middle is a common transition.45
  44
     The disconnect is likely even greater than it may appear, especially for workers at the very top of the earnings
distribution. Most of the workers moving from the bottom 20% to the top 20% and vice-versa have earnings near
the minimum value of the top earnings bin, suggesting that most of the transitions may be associated with small
earnings changes than one might infer from the average earnings in each bin.
  45
     Appendix Figures E.1-E.3 repeat the analysis shown in Figures 10-12 using earnings changes instead of counts.
The conclusions are essentially unchanged.

5        Firm Differences in Worker Earnings and Mobility
5.1      The Worker-Firm Earnings Decomposition
Having established that the eligible-workers frame is more likely to be representative of the entire
U.S. labor market than uncorrected administrative record frames, and having established that it
is complete and suitable for studying changes in the entire earnings distribution, including the
movements into and out of activity, we now turn to the role of the employer as a source of earnings
inequality. We use the statistical approach introduced to the labor economics literature in AKM.
         To understand the role of firms in the rise in earnings inequality we estimate the following
AKM model for the eligible-worker sample:

                                          ln yijt = xit β + θi + ψj + εijt ,                                        (3)

where yijt is real annual earnings for worker i = 1, ..., 200, 665, 944, employed at firm j = 1,
..., 14, 645, 104 in year t = 2004, ..., 2013.46 On the right hand side we include θi , the fixed
person effect; ψj , the fixed firm effect; and the vector xit , which includes a constant, demographic
characteristics interacted with actual labor-force experience, labor-force attachment variables, date-
regime variables, and aggregate labor market conditions.
         During the process of converting job-level firm-effect estimates to person-level firm-effect
estimates, we move back and forth between dollars (levels) and logarithms as appropriate. We
estimate equation (3) in semi-logarithmic form due to the approximately lognormal conditional
distribution of the dependent variable. However, a semi-log specification returns estimated firm
effects showing the log points of earnings attributable to the employer (approximately proportions
for small effects). In order to combine the estimated job-level firm effects for workers who have
multiple employers during the year into a single person-level firm effect the relative firm effects
must be converted to dollar values. For example, suppose we have a worker who earns $10,000 at
job 1 and $50,000 at job 2, with fixed firm effects of 0.2 and 0.1, respectively, in logs. Although the
estimated firm effect is twice as large in job 1, the earnings are only 20% of the earnings in job 2.
To account for the earnings differences across jobs, we convert the estimated firm effects to dollars,
aggregate the dollar amounts, and then convert the dollar value of the person and firm components
back to logs.
         First, we isolate the real dollar value of the firm component of earnings for a given job in a
given year. Specifically, for individual i, working at firm j in year t, the firm component of earnings
yijt is defined as:                                                   
                                         firm
                                        yijt  = yijt − exp ln yijt − ψ
                                                                     cj .                                           (4)
    46
    This is a slight abuse of notation. Two billion person-firm-year observations were used in the estimation from
826 million jobs held by 201 million persons at 14.7 million firms. Unlike the standard AKM approach of using only
the employer with the highest earnings per worker per year, we use all jobs. The i, j, t subscripting is standing in for
a more complicated notation to indicate multiple employers in a particular year. The model is fit to the 2004-2013
period, where the eligible-worker frame is complete for the entire U.S. labor market. See Appendix E.2 for further
details.


                                                          31
We define the non-firm component of earnings yijt as the residual from the above equation:

                                                non-firm           firm
                                               yijt      = yijt − yijt  .                                       (5)

       Aggregating across jobs for each worker gives a decomposition of total annual earnings into
two person-level components:


                                      X                  X               X
                                                               firm             non-firm
                                              yijt =          yijt  +          yijt
                                        j                 j                j
                                             total        firm        non-firm
                                            yit      =   yit     +   yit       .                                (6)

The person-level log firm component is recovered by taking the difference between the log of person-
level earnings and the log of the non-firm component:

                                            firm       total       non-firm
                                        ln yit   = ln yit    − ln yit       .                                   (7)

       Continuing the example above, the total earnings for the hypothetical worker are $60,000.
After applying equations (4), (5), and (6) the estimated dollar value of the firm component across
all jobs is $6,571 and the estimated non-firm component is $53,429. Applying equation (7) results
in a log firm component of 0.116. Conceptually, the resulting person-level firm component is very
similar to taking the earnings-weighted average of the log firm components.
       We also extract a component of log earnings that we can associate with the worker’s skill
type. This component consists of the constant, which has been standardized to a year with average
unemployment, and full-year full-time work, the estimated effects associated with labor force ex-
perience, and the estimated person effect. Thus the skill component can represent the log earnings
associated with the annual wage rate for a worker with a given person effect and labor experience.47
       We calculated both dollar and log estimates of the firm and non-firm earnings components.
We calculated only the log component for estimating the skill type. We used the skill component,
which is logarithmic, to classify workers by bottom 20%, middle 60% and top 20% of the skill
distribution. When referencing the discrete distribution of the skill component, we refer to skill
types. When referencing the value, we refer to the skill component of log earnings.
       We used the log firm and log non-firm components to similarly classify firms and the non-firm
contribution to earnings in bottom, middle and top bins. When referencing the discrete distribution
of the firm component, we refer to firm types. We do not classify the cells of the discrete distribution
of the non-firm component of earnings. In all cases, distributions were estimated using the pooled
person-level observations over the 2004-2013 period. See Table 7 for the minimum, maximum, and
average log values of all three components.
       Our approach has two main benefits. First, all workers at a firm with only one job during
  47
   We included all the effects labeled actual labor-force experience in Appendix Table E.4 using the coefficients in
Appendix Table E.5.

Notes: The estimates are based on the authors’ calculations using the decomposition of person-level log earnings
into firm non-firm components that sum to log total earnings. Firm-type and non-firm-type bins are formed for
each component separately using the logarithmic scale. The skill component, also on a logarithmic scale, uses only
the constant, person effect and actual labor-force experience effects as the basis for the skill-type bins. Distributions
are based on the pooled person-level observations for the eligible-workers frame from 2004-2013. Statistics are
rounded to four significant digits.


the year are placed in the same firm-type bin. Second, the total earnings of the worker do not
affect the firm-type bin assignment. Third, classifying the workers by their skill bin, rather than
the non-firm bin, controls for the state of the labor market and labor force attachment as well as
eliminating the influence of the AKM residual. Using the log values of each component also allows
us to study all possible mixes of worker skill types. If we had used the dollar-value bin assignments,
the highest-paid workers would have dominated the top and bottom categories for each estimated
component. For example, a worker with a very small log firm effect, but high earnings, would likely
dominate a low earning worker with a large log firm effect.
       Comparing the earnings bins in Table 2 with the firm and non-firm component bins in
Table 7, notice that, except for a relatively small number of extreme values, the distribution of
log earnings and log non-firm earnings component are similar within bin. This result is due to the
small relative magnitude of the log firm component.48 In spite of their relatively small magnitude
in logs, the firm components can have a substantial effect, conditional on the size of the non-firm
component of earnings. The log firm component is about -0.716 for the typical firm in the bottom
of the firm compensation distribution, 0.113 in the middle and 0.807 at the top. All statistics
are worker duration-weighted averages, implying that a worker at the middle-type firm receives
about 11% more than would be expected given the worker’s characteristics. In comparison, the
   48
      The non-firm component here includes the constant, person effect θi , index (xit β), and εijt . The estimated
constant is equal to 6.01, and the average value of the person effect and residual, across all observations in the
estimation sample, are both zero. The average experience component is 0.57, the labor force attachment component
is 2.24, and the aggregate labor market conditions component is -0.045.

difference between the average log earnings value and the average log non-firm earnings component
for workers in the middle is 0.135 (= 9.938 − 9.803), which is very similar to the 0.113 estimated for
the worker duration-weighted average log firm component. Although this comparison is not a true
worker-level comparison, it should be similar given that most workers are in the same non-firm-type
and overall-earnings bins.
      There is some evidence of worker sorting. Taking the difference between the average log
earnings for each overall-earnings bin (Table 2) and the average log non-firm components for the
same non-firm bin (Table 2) shows that workers at the bottom of the overall-earnings distribution
and the bottom of the non-firm component distribution tend to work in lower-paying firms (7.473 −
7.708 = −0.235) compared with workers at the top (11.236 − 10.976 = 0.260).
      Consider the magnitude of the average firm effect for each firm type and its potential effect on
workers in different parts of the non-firm component distribution. For example, the typical worker at
the bottom of the non-firm component distribution has average log earnings of 7.708. If this worker
were employed at a firm in the middle of the firm component distribution, his log earnings would
be greater by about 0.113, which is not enough to move him to the middle of the overall-earnings
distribution (7.708 + 0.113 = 7.821 < 9.938). Even if this worker were able to transition to a firm
at the top of the firm component distribution, ceteris paribus, his log earnings would be greater
by 0.694 (= 0.807 − 0.113) log points. The resulting log earnings of 8.515 (= 7.708 + 0.807) would
still not be large enough to move the worker to the middle overall-earnings bin. In comparison, for
a worker in the top of the non-firm component distribution, moving from a middle to a top firm,
results in an earnings increase large enough for the worker to transition from the middle to the top
of the overall-earnings distribution (10.976 + 0.807 = 11.783 > 11.236). Although the relative effect
is the same, the dollar value of the effect of working at a high paying firm increases the greater is
a worker’s non-firm component of earnings.
      Table 6 shows characteristics of workers associated with each of the 24 possible earnings
and inactivity transitions. Given that the overwhelming majority of workers are in the same bin
in the overall earning and non-firm component distributions, the characteristics of the workers in
each corresponding non-firm component bin will largely be the same. In Table 8 we show the
characteristics of firms across each of the three firm-type categories. There are clear differences
in the industry distribution by where the firm lies in the firm component distribution. Low-
paying firms are highly concentrated in “Trade, Transportation, & Utilities” and “Leisure and
Hospitality,” with over 50% of workers at low paying firms in these two industries. Firms in the
middle of the pay distribution are not nearly as concentrated by industry, but nevertheless workers
in these firms are prevalent in “Trade, Transportation, & Utilities,” “Education and Health,” and
“Manufacturing.” Somewhat surprisingly, except for “Leisure and Hospitality” and “Finance,” the
distribution of workers in high-paying firms across industries is relatively diffuse. Most industries
have a substantial number of workers in high-paying firms, implying that, except for “Leisure and
Hospitality,” it isn’t necessary to change industries to work at a high-paying firm. As found in other
studies, low-paying firms tend to be both younger and smaller than high-paying firms (Haltiwanger

5.2    Earnings and Mobility by Person and Firm Type
In this section we use the AKM decomposition to explore how the three types of workers (bottom,
middle and top of the skill-type distribution) sort into the three types of firms (bottom, middle
and top of the firm-type distribution). The results for each worker type are presented separately.
Tables 9, 10 and 11 present outcomes for workers in the bottom, middle and top bins of the skill-type
distribution, respectively.
       The tables were created as follows. Bin types are based on the previous year’s data; i.e., year
t − 1 classifications. Beginning in 2004 and ending in 2012, for every year that an eligible worker
has positive earnings a single observation is added to one of the three tables. The appropriate table
classification for each observation is determined by the skill type of the worker for that year, which
can vary over time as workers accumulate experience. Within each skill type, the earnings record
is further classified based on the firm type, resulting in each earnings observation being classified
into one of nine possible cells.49 Within each of the skill-type × firm-type cells, we break down the
results by the three possible overall-earnings outcomes (bottom, middle and top). There are, thus,
twenty-seven cells for which we present information on the number of workers, average earnings for
the previous year (t − 1), and average earnings for the current year (t) by flow type.50
       To fix ideas, we will take a detailed look at two rows in Table 9. To be recorded in this table,
the person must have been in the bottom (lowest) bin of the skill-type distribution in the previous
year; i.e., t − 1.
       Consider the first row of the table. This row is in the panel labeled “Bottom Firm,” indicating
that this person is employed at a firm in the bottom bin of the firm-type distribution in t−1. Persons
in this row are also in the bottom bin of the overall-earnings distribution in year t − 1, and 0.0782 is
the share of such persons relative to those in the middle or top of the overall-earnings distribution.
The flow labeled “2 0” is the movement from the bottom of the overall-earnings distribution (bin
2) to the ineligible (bin 0); that is, this is the flow out of the frame for persons at the bottom
of the overall-earnings distribution. There were, on average, 39,565 such persons each previous
year (t − 1). They represent 0.7% of the flows from bin 2 of the overall-earnings distribution for
low-skill workers in bottom-paying firms. Average earnings in t − 1 were $1,921 of which −$2, 285
are attributed to the firm component of our decomposition and $4,207 are attributed to the non-
firm component of our decomposition. There were no earnings in the current year (t), because the
person has moved out of the frame in t.
       Next consider the row labeled “Middle” in the “All Earnings” column in the “Middle Firm”
panel with a “3 3” flow. All persons in this row were, once again, at the bottom of the skill
  49
     The estimated AKM firm effects do not vary during the period, the value of the firm effect used in the firm-
type bins depends upon all employers during the year, and actual earnings. Hence, these effects do change values
even when workers do not change employers. Of course, the AKM firm effect changes when an individual changes
employers as well.
  50
     The earnings observation we used for classification are labeled “previous year” in the tables.

component distribution in year t − 1. Of all such persons, 60% are employed by a firm in the
middle of the firm-type distribution. Of all persons at the bottom of the skill-type distribution and
in the middle of the firm-type distribution in year t − 1, the proportion 0.608 were in the middle
of the overall-earnings distribution. Among such persons, the “3 3” row shows those who remain
in the middle of the overall-earnings distribution in the current year, t, of which there were, on
average, 8,507,780 in the 9 pairs of years for which the table was constructed. Those who stayed
in the middle of the overall-earnings distribution represented 82.4% of all persons who were in the
middle of the overall-earnings distribution, in the low-skill bin, and in a middle-paying firm in year
t − 1, on average. In year t − 1, their earnings averaged $17,361 of which $2,337 are attributed to
the firm component of our decomposition and $15,024 are attributed to the non-firm component of
our decomposition. In the current year, year t, average earnings were $18,013 of which $2,619 are
associated with the firm component and $15,394 are associated with the non-firm component.
       We use these tables to investigate worker sorting directly by looking at the interaction of
the skill and firm type for each worker-year-earnings observation. If there were no sorting, the
distribution of earnings observations across firm types would be similar for all three tables, because
outcomes would be unaffected by which part of the skill-type distribution an individual occupied,
given his place in the overall-earnings distribution. This hypothesis is clearly not supported by the
data, and forms the basis of our major conclusion that the influence of the firm operates through
channels that are, at least in part, different from the channels that intermediate the skill-type effect.
For example, again using Table 9 showing the bottom of the skill-type distribution, about 27% of
the earnings observations are in firms at the bottom of the firm-type distribution, 60% are in firms
of the middle type, and only 13% are in top firms. By comparison, Tables 10 and 11 show that
persons in the middle and top of the skill-type distributions are much less likely to be employed
at firms in the bottom type (17% and 21%, respectively), and much more likely to be employed at
top firms (21% and 25%, respectively).
       Focusing on each skill type, we start with the earnings observations for low-skill types in
Table 9. For workers at the bottom of the skill-type distribution, working at a higher-paying firm
has two advantages: higher earnings than otherwise and a greater chance of moving to a higher bin in
the overall-earnings distribution. For example, a worker at the bottom of the skill-type and overall-
earnings distributions has a probability of moving to the middle of the overall-earnings distribution
of 16.8% at a low-paying firm, 24.2% at a middle-paying firm, and 23.3% at a high paying firm.
Prior to the 2 3 transition, the average low-skill worker at a low, middle, and high-paying firm
earns $3,398, $3,726, and $3,749, respectively.51 After the transition, the average low-skill worker
at a low, middle, and high-paying firm earns $10,487, $11,739, and $15,047, respectively. Most of
the additional increase in earnings for workers employed at a top-paying employer in the previous
year is due to working at a top paying employer in the next year.
  51
     Notice that the non-firm component of earnings declines as we move up the firm-type distribution. Although
it is unclear exactly which covariate is primarily responsible for this decline, weeks worked perhaps, the impact of
working at a higher-paying firm would be much greater if the person component of earnings were the same across
firm types.

Notes: Estimates are based on the authors’ calculations using the nine paired years from 2004-2005 to 2012-2013.
The first year in the pair is the “previous year” in the table, and the second year in the pair is the “current year.”
Bins associated with the flows are “0” inflow/outflow from the eligible-workers frame, “1” inactive but eligible, “2”
bottom of the overall-earnings distribution, “3” middle of the overall-earnings distribution, and “4” top of the
overall-earnings distribution. “Average count” is the average number of persons in the row during the year labeled
“previous year” (t − 1). Pct is the percent distribution of transitions for all persons who started the year in the same
overall-earnings distribution bin. For “Previous Year” and “Current Year,” “Total” is the average real earnings in
2000 dollars, “Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the firm component in our decomposition, and
“Non-Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the non-firm component in our decomposition.

      Table 10 supports a similar conclusion. Middle-skilled workers in the bottom of the overall-
earnings distribution also have a greater chance of moving to the middle of the earnings distribution
the higher the firm-type for which they work. When they transition, their current-year earnings
will also be greater the higher is the firm-type for which they work. The vast majority (62%)
of workers in the middle of the skill-type distribution are employed at middle-paying firms. The
next most prevalent outcomes for such workers are employment at top- and bottom-paying firms,
21% and 17% respectively. However, in spite of the majority of earnings observations being in
the middle of the overall-earnings distribution, average earnings differ substantially across firm
types. A middle-skill worker in the middle (bin 3) of the overall-earnings distribution who stays
in bin 3 of the overall distribution (a “3 3” flow) at a bottom-type firm has t − 1 earnings of
$15,820, a middle-skill worker in a middle-type firm has t − 1 earnings of $24,165, and a middle-
skill worker at a top firm has earnings of $31,965. Most of the difference is due to a larger firm
effect, although the non-firm component declines as a middle-skill person is found in increasing firm
types, giving back some of the gains. Another benefit of finding employment at a high-paying firm
is a greater probability of moving to the top of the earnings distribution. For middle-skill workers
in the middle bin of the overall-earnings distribution in the previous year, the relevant comparisons
are as follows. The estimated probability of a 3 4 transition for workers in a low-paying firm is
0.6%. The estimated probability of the same transition for workers in a middle-paying firm is 2.6%.
Finally, the estimated probability of a transition to the top of the overall-earnings distribution for
middle-skill workers in a top-paying firm is 11.8%.

Notes: Estimates are based on the authors’ calculations using the nine paired years from 2004-2005 to 2012-2013.
The first year in the pair is the “previous year” in the table, and the second year in the pair is the “current year.”
Bins associated with the flows are “0” inflow/outflow from the eligible-workers frame, “1” inactive but eligible, “2”
bottom of the overall-earnings distribution, “3” middle of the overall-earnings distribution, and “4” top of the
overall-earnings distribution. “Average count” is the average number of persons in the row during the year labeled
“previous year” (t − 1). Pct is the percent distribution of transitions for all persons who started the year in the same
overall-earnings distribution bin. For “Previous Year” and “Current Year,” “Total” is the average real earnings in 2000
dollars, “Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the firm component in our decomposition, and
“Non-Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the non-firm component in our decomposition.

Notes: Estimates are based on the authors’ calculations using the nine paired years from 2004-2005 to 2012-2013.
The first year in the pair is the “previous year” in the table, and the second year in the pair is the “current year.”
Bins associated with the flows are “0” inflow/outflow from the eligible-workers frame, “1” inactive but eligible, “2”
bottom of the overall-earnings distribution, “3” middle of the overall-earnings distribution, and “4” top of the
overall-earnings distribution. “Average count” is the average number of persons in the row during the year labeled
“previous year” (t − 1). Pct is the percent distribution of transitions for all persons who started the year in the same
overall-earnings distribution bin. For “Previous Year” and “Current Year,” “Total” is the average real earnings in
2000 dollars, “Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the firm component in our decomposition, and
“Non-Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the non-firm component in our decomposition.
                                                          41
       Table 11 shows that most of the high-skill workers are also in the top of the overall-earnings
distribution, since the top bin of the overall-earnings distribution shows shares of 0.241, 0.585 and
0.891 for low, middle and top-type firms, respectively. There is also a substantial minority in
the middle of the overall-earnings distribution. Since transitions to the top of the overall-earnings
distribution (3 4) are more likely at top-paying firms (32.7%) as compared to low- or middle-paying
firms (4.8% and 14/5%, respectively), we note that once again working at such a firm offers an
advantage distinct from the worker’s skill-type. In the high-skill category, the earnings differences
between working at a middle- compared to a bottom-type firm after making a 3 4 transition are
relatively small, but the earnings gains from working at a top-paying firm are very large. While
working at a top-paying firm is clearly preferred and the gains are large, a typical worker in any
part of the skill distribution would also have a strong preference for working at a middle-paying
rather than a bottom-paying firm. Although the dollar gains may be relatively small, the difference
in the earnings for bottom- and middle-paying firms is significant. For example, 78% of the low-skill
persons employed at a bottom-paying firm are at the bottom of the overall-earnings distribution,
while only 38% of the the low-skill persons employed at a middle-paying firm are at the bottom of the
overall-earnings distribution. Overall earnings within the bottom bin are not dramatically different
in this case, but workers in the middle bin of the overall-earnings distribution have noticeably
higher earnings at a middle-paying firm ($17,361) vs. a bottom-paying firm ($12,342). Somewhat
surprisingly, there are a relatively large number of top-skill workers at bottom- and middle-type
firms. On average, these workers, especially in the middle, are employed at worse-paying firms than
middle skill-type workers.52
       Table 12 analyzes the earnings of individuals who do not move in the earnings distribution
between consecutive years by firm and skill type. This table allows us to analyze the potential
effects of redistributing the skill types across firm types or redistributing the firm types across skill
types. For the bottom and middle skill types, there is almost no advantage to being employed in
a higher paying firm type, given their place in the earnings distribution. For example, a bottom-
skill person in the top 20% of the earnings distribution earns $66,745 in a bottom-paying firm and
$72,919 in a top-paying firm. But for a top-skill person, there is a big advantage to employment in a
top-paying firm, $80,717 as compared to $143,736 when in the top 20% of the earnings distribution.
The skill pay premium for all firms is approximately the same when considering a bottom-skill as
opposed to a middle-skill worker. For example, $12,342 vs. $15,820 for bottom firm and $17,361
vs. $24,165 for a middle firm. This is also the case for considering a middle-skill vs. top-skill
worker, except for the top-paying firms, where that premium is much greater than for middle or
low-paying firms–$67,457 vs. $143,296 for the top-paying firm as compared to $61,625 vs. $92,507
for the middle-paying firm.

    See Appendix Section E.3 for an analysis of the changes in earnings inequality using only the firm-type and non-
firm-type distributions. Some anomalies appear in that analysis that do not appear when we use only the skill-type
to characterize worker differences. We thank a referee for suggesting this modification.

Notes: Estimates are based on the authors’ calculations using only individuals who do not change cells in the
overall-earnings distribution between years t − 1 and t. The column labeled “Flow: indicates the bin in the
overall-earnings distribution that the individual occupied. For example, 2 2 means the individual was in the bottom
20% of the income distribution in both years. The column labeled “Earnings” is the average earnings for the
indicated firm type, skill type and flow cell. The column labeled “Ratio” is the ratio of the earnings in the indicated
row to the earnings in the 3 3 cell of the same firm and skill type.



6     Conclusion
We use administrative earnings data from the LEHD infrastructure files to analyze the role of
the employer in explaining the rise in earnings inequality in the U.S. from 2004-2013. In order
to demonstrate the importance of carefully selecting the frame and defining the earnings universe
under study, we supplement these earnings data with information from a variety of sources, which
we analyze to establish the validity of our final analysis of change in the earnings distribution.
       We use SSA-supplied data to identify both invalid SSNs and the fraudulent use of valid SSNs.
This allows us to transform the found jobs data in the all-workers frame into the designed eligible-
workers frame that references a consistent population over time. When comparing the evolution of
the ratios of top-to-bottom percentiles of the earnings distribution between the two worker frames,
we find that while both frames show a decrease in earnings inequality in the late-1990s, their
patterns diverge starting in 2000. The found frame of all workers shows little to no change in the
earnings inequality since 2000. On the other hand, upon removing the immigrant candidates, the
designed frame of eligible workers shows a rise in inequality starting in 2000 that is robust across
several measures of earnings inequality. This difference highlights the need to be mindful of the
sample of workers used when interpreting results from studies of earnings inequality. Furthermore,
we compare these inequality results to ones from CPS/ACS. We find that the trends in earnings
inequality observed among the eligible workers in the LEHD data are very similar to those observed
among the workers expected to be covered under UI in CPS/ACS.
       Our results also suggest that, unlike in previous recessions, substantial numbers of persons
employed prior to the Great Recession did not return to employment even five or more years after
the start of that recession. While previous research focused primarily on employed persons or
persons in the labor force, the large and persistent decrease in the employment-to-population ratio


                                                          43
for all workers and for covered workers only, during and after the Great Recession, argues strongly
for an expansion of inequality measures to include at least some inactive but eligible workers. Using
our eligible-workers frame, we have shown that such persons are attached to the labor force, as
evidenced by their dynamic employment histories, but the exclusion of their inactive periods from
earnings inequality measures understates the degradation at the bottom of the distribution.
      Using our designed frame, we assess the role firms play in the rise in earnings inequality. We
decomposed earnings in to firm and non-firm component. Using a part of the non-firm component
that relates only to measured and unmeasured individual characteristics and controls for differences
in labor-force attachment and macroeconomic conditions, we characterize the individuals as low-,
medium- or high-skill types. Using the firm component, we characterize the firms as low-, medium-
or high-paying firm types. Using the model for changes in the earnings distribution that we con-
structed for the eligible-workers frame, we analyzed the role played by the position of the worker
in the skill-type and firm-type distributions. We show that a typical worker of any skill type would
benefit from working at a middle-paying firm relative to a low-paying firm, but it is the workers
of any skill type employed at high-paying firms who benefit the most. These individuals not only
make higher earnings, they also experience an increase in the probability of moving up the earnings
distribution in the following year. While we make no structural claim for this relation between
the firm type and placement in the overall-earnings distribution, it is clear that the influence of
firms works through channels that are not the same as those through which the effects of individual
differences operate.

ONLINE APPENDIX
A     Additional Data Source and Methods Tables and Figures
In Section 2 we discussed the construction of our eligible-workers frame. Here we provide further
details on which workers are excluded from the all-workers frame to arrive at the eligible-workers
frame and how this impacts the earnings coverage of LEHD when compared to NIPA.

A.1    All-Workers Frame
The all-workers frame contains earnings for all jobs reported on the UI data for each date regime
in the relevant years from 1990-2013, as noted in Figure 1 and summarized in Table A.1 below.
       Using the person level earnings, eit , an estimate of annual earnings for the all-workers frame
in year t is calculated as follows:                  X
                                          EtAW =          eit ,
                                                  i∈AWt

where AWt is the set of workers in the all-workers frame in year t.

Notes: The first column presents of the total number of earnings records excluded from the eligible-workers frame
each year. The remaining columns disaggregate this count by the different eligibility requirements the record failed
to meet: (i) Invalid SSN are records that are only on the UI; (ii) Age<5 are records where the SNN is valid, but
the age of the worker is less than 5; (iii) 5≤Age<13 are records where the worker is between 5 and 13 years old; (iv)
13≤Age<18 are records where the worker is between 13 and 18 years old; (v) Age>70 are records where the worker
is more than 70 years old; (vi) #Jobs>12 are records where the worker has more than 12 jobs a year; and (vii)
Other are records that fail to meet the other eligibility requirements, such as the year is greater than or equal to the
SSN year of issue and less than year of death (when available). The frame is complete from 2004 forward.


A.2     Comparison to NIPA
The BEA NIPA estimates are based primarily on the BLS Quarterly Census of Employment and
Wages (QCEW), an alternative source of employment and earnings with similar coverage as the
UI based job level data used in this paper. A firm typically files a QCEW firm-level report in
conjunction with the UI job-level data each quarter. The QCEW report is sent to BLS where
it undergoes edits and imputations before the final statistics are released.53 These data are then
used by BEA as the primary input when estimating the wage and salary component of the NIPA
tables.54
       Table A.3 presents a comparison of our estimates of annual earnings with the BEA NIPA
data. Figure A.2 plots this comparison. Our estimates of total annual earnings using the all-workers
frame vary from 16.5% of NIPA wage and salary estimates in 1990, the beginning of LEHD date
regime 1; to 60.1% in 1995, the beginning of date regime 2; to 76.4% in 1998, the beginning of
date regime 3; to 90.6% in 2004, the beginning of date regime 4. Once LEHD data are complete
in 2004, the two series track almost exactly. By 2013 the all-workers estimate is about 91.7% of

    The BLS QCEW estimates account for about 95% of the BEA wage and salary component of the NIPA tables.

the NIPA wage and salary estimates. The eligible-workers estimates follow a similar pattern as the
all-workers estimates, with about two percentage points lower coverage relative to the all-workers
frame after 2004.
       The coverage of both the all-workers and eligible-workers frames is very low relative to the
NIPA estimates in the early 1990s but increases dramatically in 1995 once the historical data for
the more populous states (CA, FL, NY, and TX) have entered the LEHD infrastructure files. When
the frame is complete (date regime 4), there is an apparent coverage gap of about eight to nine
percentage points for the all-workers frame and ten to 11 percentage points for the eligible-workers
frame. About half of this gap is due to differences between the statutory-employer population for
UI wage records and the NIPA definition of wage and salary income. When comparing frames
with similar coverage definitions (UI wage records vs. QCEW), our results suggest that the gap
between the two frames is about four to five percentage points for the all-workers frame and five
to six percentage points for the eligible-workers frame.

Notes: This table compares total earnings as measured in the BEA NIPA to earnings computed from LEHD.
LEHD Total presents total annual earnings for the all-workers frame. This total is decomposed into earnings
attributed to workers included in the eligible-workers frame (Eligible Workers) and to workers who are not included
(Immigrant Candidates). Units are in billions of real (2000) dollars, converted using CPI-U. The frame is complete
from 2004 forward.

Notes: Each row in the table represents a specific combination of quarters worked and number of quarters in the
longest job. A five quarter longest job is active in either the fourth quarter of the previous year or the first quarter
of the subsequent year, while a six quarter longest job is active in both. The number of quarters in the longest job
takes on values from one to six. The counts are averages per year.

B         Inequality Trends in the LEHD All-Workers Frame (1990-2013)
In Section 3 we discussed the trends in earnings inequality observed in the eligible-workers frame.
Here, we detail the inequality trends in the all-workers frame, and analyze how they differ from the
trends observed in the eligible-workers frame.
       With a better understanding of how the exclusion of specific workers affects the distribution of
earnings, we then turn our attention to earnings inequality. We analyze how various measurements
of the gap between the top and bottom of the earnings distribution have changed over time and
how the trends change as we move from the all-workers to the eligible-workers frame.
       Figure B.1 plots selected percentiles for the two worker frames: the solid lines are the per-
centiles computed from the all-workers frame, while the dotted lines are the percentiles computed
from the eligible-workers frame. Comparing the solid and dotted lines in Figure B.1, it is clear that
the main consequence of shifting the frame from all workers to eligible workers is an increase in the
percentile values, particularly at the bottom of the earnings distribution.

Notes: This figure plots the 10th , 20th , 50th , 80th , 90th , and 95th percentiles of the earnings distribution by worker
frame and year. The solid lines are the percentiles of the earnings distribution of all workers (AW) by year. The
dotted lines are the percentiles of the earnings distribution of eligible workers (EW) by year.


      Figure B.2 plots the ratio of the 90th percentile to the 10th percentile for each date regime
using the all-workers frame. The figure confirms that there are some differences in the levels of
these curves but the trend analysis is largely unchanged.

Notes: This figure plots the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile for all workers by date regime.

       To see this more clearly, Table B.1 presents the average percentile values from 1995-2013
for both the all-workers and the eligible-workers frames, and the last row computes their ratio
(eligible workers to all workers). First, notice that the ratio is always above one, meaning that
each percentile computed from the eligible-workers frame is greater than the equivalent percentile
computed from the all-workers frame. Removing the immigrant candidates from the all-workers
frame to construct the eligible-workers frame eliminates an unknown number of individuals who
make very low earnings and, thus, tend to be at the bottom of the all-workers earnings distribution.
For example, in 2006, immigrant candidates held about 8% of all jobs, but only contributed about
2% to total earnings. Furthermore, average earnings for immigrant candidates were about $6,150
in 2006 as compared with $32,865 for eligible workers. Thus, the removal of these low-earnings
workers from the all-workers frame makes the ratio of EW to AW percentiles in Table B.1 higher
towards the bottom of the earnings distribution. Specifically, notice that the 1st percentile in the
eligible-workers earnings distribution is, on average, about 32% greater than the 1st percentile in
the all-workers earnings distribution; the 5th percentile is about 41% greater, the 10th percentile is
about 36% greater, and the 20th percentile is about 26% greater. From the median onwards, while
the absolute differences in the percentile values are large, the relative differences are not as stark,
with the percentiles in the eligible-workers earnings distribution being about 2% to 8% greater than
the corresponding percentile in the all-workers earnings distribution. Finally, notice that regardless
of the worker frame used, there is a large number of workers with very low earnings in LEHD, with
the average 10th percentile at only $1,858 in the all-workers frame and $2,527 in the eligible-workers
frame.

Notes: The first row presents the average percentile values from the earnings distribution of all workers in all

eligible-workers frame to all-workers frame.


                                                                                B-2
       Starting with the all-workers frame in Figure B.3, notice that all the measures show a decline
in earnings inequality from 1995 to 2000. This can also be seen in Table B.2. The first row presents
the average of each ratio from 1995-1999. Notice that they are all above one, meaning that earnings
inequality was greater in the late 1990s than in 2000. Then, after 2000, except for the 99/1 ratio,
which has a slight upward trend, all other measures of earnings inequality remain relatively stable.
The second row of Table B.2 presents the average of each ratio (relative to 2000) from 2001-2013.
Notice that aside from the 99/1 ratio, which on average increased by about 5% after 2000, the other
measures have remained around their 2000 levels. Thus, aside from differences at the very top or
the very bottom of the earnings distribution, earnings inequality among all workers has apparently
seen little or no change over the last 10 years.

Notes: The first panel presents measures of earnings inequality for all workers in all states relative to 2000, while
the second panel presents the same measures for eligible workers. The measures of earnings inequality considered
are (i) 99th/1st: the ratio of the 99th to the 1st percentile; (ii) 95th/5th: the ratio of the 95th to the 5th percentile;
(iii) 90th/10th: the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile; (iv) 80th/20th the ratio of the 80th to the 20th
percentile; and (v) Variance: the variance of log annual earnings. The values in the table are averages before and
after 2000: (i) pre-2000 : 1995-1999; and (ii) post-2000 : 2001-2013. The post-2000 years are further subdivided into
three periods: (i) pre-GR: 2001-2007; (ii) GR: 2008-2009; and (iii) post-GR 2010-2013.

Notes: Subplots (a) and (b) decompose the 99/1 ratio, the 95/5 ratio, the 90/10 ratio, and the 80/20 for eligible
workers in all states relative to 2000 from 1990-2013 relative to the median. Subplot (a) plots the following ratios for
the top half of the earnings distribution: (i) P99 to P50 : the ratio of the 99th to the 50th percentile; (ii) P95 to P50 :
the ratio of the 95th to the 50th percentile; (iii) P90 to P50 : the ratio of the 90th to the 50th percentile; and
(iv) P80 to P50 the ratio of the 80th to the 50th percentile. Subplot (b) plots the following ratios for the bottom half
of the earnings distribution: (i) P50 to P1 : the ratio of the 50th to the 1st percentile; (ii) P50 to P5 : the ratio of the
50th to the 5th percentile; (iii) P50 to P10 : the ratio of the 50th to the 10th percentile; and (iv) P50 to P20 the ratio
of the 50th to the 20th percentile. The estimates are based on the all-workers frame from the LEHD infrastructure
files.

Notes: This figure plots ratios of top and bottom percentiles for all workers (solid lines) and for eligible workers
(dotted lines). Subplot (a) plots the ratio of the 99th to the 1st percentile by worker frame. This ratio is decomposed
into the ratio of the 99th to the 50th percentile in subplot (c) and the ratio of the 50th to the 1st percentile in subplot
(e). Subplot (b) plots the ratio of the 95th to the 15th percentile by worker frame. This ratio is decomposed into the
ratio of the 95th to the 50th percentile in subplot (d) and the ratio of the 50th to the 5th percentile in subplot (f).

Notes: This figure plots ratios of top and bottom percentiles for all workers (solid lines) and for eligible workers
(dotted lines). Subplot (a) plots the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile by worker frame. This ratio is decomposed
into the ratio of the 90th to the 50th percentile in subplot (c) and the ratio of the 50th to the 10th percentile in
subplot (e). Subplot (b) plots the ratio of the 80th to the 20th percentile by worker frame. This ratio is decomposed
into the ratio of the 80th to the 50th percentile in subplot (d) and the ratio of the 50th to the 20th percentile in
subplot (f).

C       Comparison with Household Surveys
In Section 3, we discussed the trends in earnings inequality based on our analysis of the eligible-
workers frame, which we constructed using the LEHD infrastructure data and supplementary infor-
mation from the Census Bureau’s enhanced version of SSA’s Numident file. Section 3.1 discussed
the highlights of the comparison of our data to the Current Population Survey and the American
Community Survey. To put our inequality measures in the context of a broader literature, we com-
pare results based on the administrative data frame discussed in main text with similar measures
constructed using household survey data.55

C.1       Household Survey Data
To create our household survey analysis file, we use the following records from the Current Pop-
ulation Survey-Annual Social and Economic Supplement (March) and the American Community
Survey:

      • Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement (CPS-ASEC): all per-
        sons from survey years 1990-2004
      • American Community Survey (ACS): all persons from survey years 2000 to 2013

       In the CPS-ASEC, the respondent is surveyed in March and reports earnings for the previous
calendar year. We date the earnings accordingly. However, in the ACS the respondent reports
earnings for the past 12 months and the survey is in the field continuously throughout the year.
Our approach in this case is to date the earnings with the calendar year containing the majority
of the months covered by the response, with ties going to the more recent year. As in the LEHD
data, nominal earnings are deflated to real 2000 dollars using the CPI-U. In all cases, we used the
internal (confidential) versions of the CPS-ASEC and ACS. None of the household survey data are
topcoded. We did not replace the Census Bureau’s edit and imputation routines with our own. We
used the allocated values in the files.
       Similar to the workers in LEHD, we consider two samples of individuals from the household
surveys. The first includes all individuals. The second isolates workers whose employment should be
covered under Unemployment Insurance (including federal employees) and who should, therefore,
appear in the LEHD administrative data. We designate a survey respondent as a “covered worker”
if he or she meets the following conditions:

      • Person interviewed is not living in group quarters
      • Individual is employed at a private firm, the local/state/federal government, or is self-
        employed in an incorporated firm
      • Labor earnings are positive
      • Individual is between 18 and 70 years old, inclusive.

The last two restrictions combined are included to match the earnings and age restrictions used to
identify active eligible workers in the LEHD data.
       Finally, in most of the results to follow, we do not report results separately for CPS-ASEC and
ACS individuals. Instead, in the overlapping years (2000-2003), we interpolate estimates computed
from the CPS-ASEC and the ACS to create a single time series using the method in Abowd and
Vilhuber (2011).

C.2       Comparison of Aggregate Summaries
We start by analyzing how the earnings distribution in household surveys compares to the one
computed from administrative records. In the household survey data, the estimated percentile
values tend to be greater for covered workers than for all workers. Figure C.1 presents the percentiles
of the earnings distribution for all and covered workers in the CPS/ACS. Comparing these values to
the ones estimated from the LEHD data, shown in Figure B.1, notice that for percentiles above the
median, the values from the eligible-workers frame are fairly close to the ones from the household
surveys. Below the median, however, the differences are greater, with the percentiles estimated
from the household surveys being much greater than the percentiles estimated from LEHD. For
example, notice that earnings associated with the 10th percentile in the CPS/ACS data are close
to the 20th percentile in LEHD.

Notes: This figure plots the 10th , 20th , 50th , 80th , 90th , and 95th percentiles of the earnings distribution for all
workers (ALL) and for covered workers (CW) in the CPS-ASEC (1990-2003) and the ACS (2000-2013) surveys by
year. Covered workers include respondents whose employment relation should be covered as a statutory employee
under state UI or as a federal employee, and therefore appear in the LEHD data.


       To see these differences in percentiles more clearly, Figure C.2 plots the ratio of the percentiles
of the earnings distribution measured using the LEHD eligible-workers frame to the same percentiles
measured from the covered workers in the combined CPS/ACS data. First, notice that all the ratios
in Figure C.2 are below one, meaning that the percentiles estimated from the household surveys are
always greater than the corresponding percentiles estimated from the administrative data. However,
the magnitude of this difference varies greatly across the percentiles of the earnings distribution.
Specifically, notice that the relative differences in the 95th , 90th , and 80th percentiles are very small
compared to the relative differences in the 5th , 10th , and 20th percentiles.
       In the main text, Table 4 presents averages of the percentiles from 1995 to 2013 for CPS/ACS
and LEHD. Notice that on average the earnings associated with the 80th , 90th , and 95th percentiles
are about $3,500 less in the LEHD data than in CPS/ACS data. Further, as can be seen in


                                                                      C-2
Figure C.2, this gap is decreasing over time, such that in 2013 the difference in the 95th percentile
is only $264. In the bottom half of the earnings distribution, however, a CPS/ACS covered worker
earns about $4,000 more than an LEHD worker at the same point in the earnings distribution. While
this absolute difference may not seem that large, relatively, a CPS/ACS worker at the 10th percentile
is making 2.54 times more than his LEHD counterpart, and 3.40 times more for a CPS/ACS worker
in the 5th percentile. This means that the survey data include more low-earning jobs that are not
statutory employment relationships, or are not reported as such to state UI systems. Lastly, notice
that the percentiles in LEHD increase faster than their CPS/ACS counterparts since all the ratios
exhibit an upward trend, especially after the Great Recession.

Notes: This figure presents the ratio of earnings for eligible workers in LEHD to the earnings reported by covered
workers in CPS/ACS for the 5th , 10th , 20th , 50th , 80th , 90th , and 95th percentile.

       To see whether differences in the earnings distribution between workers in CPS/ACS and
eligible workers in the LEHD data translate into differences in trends in inequality, we compute
various measures of earnings inequality in CPS/ACS and compare them to their LEHD counter-
parts. In particular, we compute the 95/5, 90/10, and 80/20 ratios, and the variance of log annual
earnings. We plot their time series in Figures 5a and 5b for all workers and covered workers, respec-
tively. Both the all-workers and the covered-workers samples show a decline in earnings inequality
during the late 1990s that reverses after 2000. However, in the all-workers sample, the magnitude
of this increase in inequality in the post-2000 period strongly depends on the measure considered.
For example, from 2000 to 2013, the 95/5 ratio increased by 66% from 36.30 to 60.26, while the
90/10 ratio increased by 42% from 12.95 to 18.35. On the other hand, the 80/20 ratio increased
by 26% from 4.64 to 5.86, while the variance of log earnings increased by only 5% from 1.23 to
1.26. Thus, while the measures are all trending upwards after 2000 in the all-workers sample, it
is unclear whether this increase has been large or small. In the covered-workers sample, earning
inequality has also been increasing after 2000, however the magnitude of this increase is relatively
consistent across the different measures of earnings inequality. The 95/5 ratio increased by 32%
from 2000 to 2013, while the 90/10 ratio increased by 26%. The 80/20 ratio and the variance in log
earnings increased less over this period, by about 13% and 14%, respectively. On the other hand,
notice that the decline in inequality in the 1990s is very similar across the various measures and
samples.
       These trends in earnings inequality are very similar to the ones observed among eligible

                                                                                C-3
workers in the LEHD data. Specifically, comparing the time series of earnings inequality for covered
workers in CPS/ACS (Figure 5b) to the one for eligible workers in LEHD (Figure 3), notice that
the general patterns are very similar. Both of these figures show a decline in inequality during the
1990s and a steady increase in inequality after 2000. The magnitude of this increase is also similar
between the covered workers in CPS/ACS and the eligible workers in the LEHD data. Compare the
second panel of Table C.1 to the second panel of Table B.2. The second row in both tables shows
the average of the 95/5 ratio, the 90/10, ratio, the 80/20 ratio, and the variance of log earnings
(relative to 2000) after 2000. Both the covered workers in CPS/ACS and the eligible workers in
LEHD saw an increase in the 95/5 ratio and the 90/10 ratio above 10%, and an increase in the
80/20 ratio and the variance of log earnings around 5-6%. Furthermore, most of this increase
occurred during or after the Great Recession.

Notes: The first panel presents measures of earnings inequality for all workers in CPS/ACS, while the second
panel presents the same measures for covered workers. The measures of earnings inequality considered are (i)
95th /5th : the ratio of the 95th to the 5th percentile; (ii) 90th /10th : the ratio of the 90th to the 10th percentile; (iii)
80th /20th the ratio of the 80th to the 20th percentile; and (iv) Variance: the variance of log annual earnings. The
values in the table are averages before and after 2000: (i) pre-2000 : 1995-1999; and (ii) post-2000 : 2001-2013. The
post-2000 years are further subdivided into three periods: (i) pre-GR: 2001-2007; (ii) GR: 2008-2009; and (iii)
post-GR 2010-2013. All measures are 1.00 in 2000.


       To see whether it is changes in the top or bottom half of the earnings distribution that are
driving these trends, we decompose these ratios around the median, as we did using the two worker
frames from LEHD. Notice that since 2000 the ratio of the top percentiles to the median has
been gradually increasing for both the all-workers sample and the covered-workers sample (Fig-
ures C.3a and C.3c). The bottom of the earnings distribution, however, has evolved differently
across these two samples. In the all-workers sample, there has been a substantial rise in inequality
(Figure C.3b). Among the covered workers, the rise has been much more mild (Figures C.3d). In
fact, the trends in earnings inequality among the covered workers is very similar to those observed
among the eligible workers in LEHD both in terms of the correlation of the times series and the
magnitude of the changes. However, one notable difference is the change in earnings inequality
around the Great Recession. In LEHD, inequality increased dramatically during the Great Re-
cession. In CPS/ACS, inequality actually drops substantially just prior to the onset of the Great
Recession. However, these gains are lost during the recession years as inequality quickly increases
back to trend. Thus, while both the household surveys and the administrative data highlight the


                                                              C-4
sensitivity of the bottom of the earnings distribution to the Great Recession, the precise cyclical
patterns are not consistent across these two data sources.

Notes: Subplots (a) and (b) decompose the 99/1 ratio, the 95/5 ratio, the 90/10 ratio, and the 80/20 for all workers
in CPS/ACS relative to 2000 from 1990-2013 relative to the median. Subplot (a) plots the following ratios for the
top half of the earnings distribution: (i) P95 to P50 : the ratio of the 95th to the 50th percentile; (ii) P90 to P50 :
the ratio of the 90th to the 50th percentile; and (iii) P80 to P50 the ratio of the 80th to the 50th percentile. Subplot
(b) plots the following ratios for the bottom half of the earnings distribution: (i) P50 to P5 : the ratio of the 50th to
the 5th percentile; (ii) P50 to P10 : the ratio of the 50th to the 10th percentile; and (iii) P50 to P20 the ratio of the
50th to the 20th percentile. Subplots (c) and (d) present the same decomposition for covered workers in CPS/ACS
relative to 2000 from 1990-2013.

          C.3          Detailed Analysis of Linked Records
          To understand where the discrepancies between the administrative and household survey earnings
          distributions occur, we analyze the individual ACS records from 2005-2013–linking them to LEHD
          UI records from the eligible-workers frame using a crosswalk between the two person identifiers


                                                                                           C-6
developed and maintained by the Census Bureau. This allows us to see how earnings differ among
workers who do and do not match to the LEHD individual data. We focus on records from 2005
forward because, for these years, both the ACS and LEHD are fully national.
       For an individual in the ACS, there are three types of matches to the eligible-workers frame
in the LEHD data: (i) reported earnings are positive in ACS, but UI earnings are zero; (ii) no
reported earnings in ACS, but UI earnings are positive; (iii) both ACS reported earnings and UI
earnings are positive. We present these match results in Table C.2. The left panel presents the
statistics for all individuals in ACS and the right panel presents the same statistics for covered
workers in ACS. When we include all individuals in ACS, about 96% report positive earnings when
surveyed in ACS. However, 21% have no UI earnings. A very small fraction of the individuals in
ACS, the remaining 4%, have positive UI earnings but did not report any earnings when surveyed.
When we consider only covered ACS workers, all these individuals should report positive earnings
in ACS. Of these covered workers, 85% also have positive UI earnings and 15% do not match to
any UI records.

                           ACS            UI          Percent          ACS         UI       Percent

Notes: The first row reports the fraction of individuals in ACS that report positive earnings when surveyed and
match to the eligible-workers frame in the LEHD data, and therefore have positive UI earnings. The second row
reports the fraction of individuals in ACS that do not report earnings when surveyed, but match to the LEHD data,
and, therefore, have positive UI earnings. The third row reports the fraction of individuals in ACS who do not
match to LEHD data. The left-side panel presents the statistics for all individuals in ACS and the right-side panel
presents the same statistics for covered workers in ACS.


      Using these matched records, we compare the earnings distribution of four samples of ACS
individuals in Figure C.5:

       • Individuals with positive UI earnings, but no reported ACS earnings (dotted red line)
       • Individuals with positive reported ACS earnings, but no UI earnings (solid red line with
         diamonds)
       • Individuals with positive reported ACS earnings and positive UI earnings using ACS earnings
         to compute the earnings distribution (solid green line)
       • Individuals with positive reported ACS earnings and positive UI earnings using UI earnings
         to compute the earnings distribution (dotted green line with circles).

We compute these distributions for both all workers and covered workers in the ACS. Note that
for covered workers, having only UI earnings is vanishingly rare since all covered workers should
report positive earnings in the ACS. The earnings distributions from these samples are compared
to the one constructed from the eligible-workers frame in LEHD (dotted blue line with squares).
Figure C.5 plots the 5th , 50th , and 95th percentiles of these various earnings distributions.56
      For workers whose earnings are both reported in the ACS and found in LEHD (matched
workers), the percentiles computed using the ACS earnings are nearly identical to those computed
using UI earnings. Specifically, notice that in Figure C.5 the solid green line and the dotted
  56
       For similar comparisons of the 10th, 20th, 80th, and 90th percentiles, see Figure C.4.


                                                                C-7
green line with circles are very close to each other in all subplots, and especially at and above the
median. The differences in the CPS/ACS percentiles and the LEHD percentiles in Figure C.2 are,
therefore, very unlikely to be due to misreporting in household surveys. Instead, they must be due
to differences in the workers who are surveyed and report earnings in the ACS and those who are
found in LEHD. Workers who report positive ACS earnings, but do not match to LEHD (ACS-
only) tend to have lower earnings than the workers who do match (solid red lines with diamonds in
Figure C.5). However, this gap is less pronounced for workers at the top of the earnings distribution
for both the all-workers and covered-workers samples in ACS.
       While the ACS-only workers do not earn as much as the matched workers, they do earn
significantly more than a large portion of workers in LEHD. This means that the LEHD eligible-
workers frame captures more workers in the bottom half of the earnings distribution than the ACS.
To see this, notice in Figure C.5b, the 95th percentiles of both the matched and ACS-only samples
are nearly identical to the 95th percentile of the eligible-workers earnings distribution in LEHD.
However, for the median and lower percentiles, the differences are not trivial. The median matched
worker tends to make about 21.5% more than the median eligible-worker in LEHD (≈$4,770), while
the median ACS-only worker makes about 6.4% less (≈$1,417). At the bottom, the differences in
the 5th percentiles are most stark. A matched worker at the 5th percentile tends to make about 3.22
times as much as an eligible worker at the 5th percentile in LEHD (≈$2,649). Even an ACS-only
worker at the 5th percentile makes about 2.44 times as much as a corresponding eligible worker
(≈$1,459). Thus, the left tail of the earnings distribution in ACS is much shorter than the one
for eligible workers in the LEHD data, resulting in the LEHD percentiles being less than those
computed from household surveys.

D     Inactive Workers and Inequality
In Section 2.2 we tracked both active and inactive workers in our eligible-workers frame. In Sec-
tion 3.2 we briefly discussed how the treatment of inactivity affects measures of earnings inequality.
This Appendix presents details supporting those analyses and conclusions.
       In Appendix B, we excluded inactive workers from the analysis so that we could focus on
trends in the ratios of top and bottom percentiles over time. While some inactive workers, given
the wages and employment terms on offer, choose to be nonparticipants, others are involuntarily
excluded from the labor market. In this section, we present an analysis of how including inactive
workers, especially those who were recently employed, affects earnings inequality measures. We
begin by analyzing how inactivity has changed in recent years considering comparisons with the
employment to population ratio from the CPS/ACS data. Next, we turn our attention to the
eligible workers in the LEHD data.

D.1    The Employment-to-Population Ratio
If the U.S. labor market tends to stay relatively close to full employment except for brief periods
after the start of a recession, the resultant implied rapid employment growth during a recovery
should generate a quick increase in the employment-to-population ratio and a quick decline in the
unemployment rate to pre-recession levels. However, our results using annual CPS/ACS survey
data show a different pattern around the Great Recession.
       Figure D.1 shows the estimated employment-to-population ratio by year from 1990-2013 for
all workers (solid blue line) and covered workers (dashed red line) in the CPS/ACS. The NBER
identifies three recessions during this period, beginning in the following years: 1990, 2001, and 2008
(December, 2007). Both CPS/ACS series show a dip in 1993 and then a sustained increase until
1999, when the covered-worker sample employment-population ratio begins to decline while the
all-workers sample remains relatively flat. Until 1999, the trends for both series are similar, but
then the two series diverge, with a decline in the covered workers as a proportion of all workers–
suggesting a movement of workers into self-employment. At the beginning of the Great Recession,
all three series show a large sustained drop in the employment to population ratio, bottoming out
in 2009/2010, with only a mild recovery during the ensuing years. These results suggest that unlike
previous recessions, substantial numbers of persons employed prior to the Great Recession did not
return to employment even five or more years after the start of the Great Recession. While previous
research focused only on employed persons, the large and persistent decrease in the employment-to-
population ratio for all workers and for covered workers only, during and after the Great Recession,
argues strongly for an expansion of inequality measures to include at least some inactive but eligible
workers.

Notes: This figure plots the estimated employment-to-population ratio by year from 1990-2013 for all workers
(solid blue line) and covered workers (dashed red line) in CPS/ACS. Estimates based on the authors’ calculations
from the microdata. These are not the official statistics as released by the BLS from the CPS.


D.2     Inactivity-Adjusted Inequality Measures
We estimate three traditional measures of inequality (Gini, Hoover, and Theil), both with and
without a category for inactive workers. Deciles of the earnings distribution, estimated as discussed
in section 2.4, were used to compute each statistic, with an additional category added for eligible
workers with no reported earnings (the inactive category). The earnings value for each person in
the inactive category was set to $1, a modification necessary to facilitate the consistent calculation
of all measures (particularly the Theil index, which uses logarithms).57 We create three samples,
each with a different set of eligible but inactive workers:

   1. All eligible workers each year : This sample assumes all eligible workers are at risk to be
      employed. Note that this sample is complete and has no dependence on previous years, but
      the majority of the inactive eligible workers are probably not in the labor force.

   2. Active workers and eligible workers most at risk to be employed : This sample includes all
      active workers and workers not active in the current year, but who were active in at least one
      of the past 4 years. For years prior to 2008 we do not have complete data for every state. In
      particular, workers with jobs in MA, DC, AR, NH, and MS will be slightly under-represented
      (see Table A.1). Some of these workers will have earnings in the previous fours year that we do
      not observe. An upper bound of the impact of this exclusion might be 5% of the jobs in 2004,
      but the actual impact is likely much less since the largest state, MA, entered in 2002Q1, and
      is therefore missing only two years of history in 2004Q1. In addition, employment in every
      state is at risk at some point during 2003, the year a worker not employed in 2004 is most
      likely to have previously been employed.

   3. Only active workers: This sample includes only active workers, so no modifications are made
      to the standard formulas.
  57
   The results for the Gini and Hoover measures using $0 show very small differences in levels and identical trends
compared with setting the earnings value to $1.



                                                                            D-2
       Table D.1 shows the results. The first panel is for all eligible workers, while the second panel
shows results for workers most at risk to be eligible workers. The last panel includes only active
eligible workers.
       All three of the inequality measures increase substantially as the proportion of eligible workers
included in the calculation increases. Not surprisingly, including a large block of workers with only
$1 of annual earnings greatly increases measured inequality. Comparing our results with another
administrative data source, estimates of inequality using SSA data, we find that ours are somewhat
larger, although the exact source of the difference is unclear due to coverage differences imposed on
the SSA estimation sample. For example, in 2004 the estimated Gini coefficient using a restricted
sample of currently eligible SSA recipients is 0.471, while in our data the estimated Gini is 0.510
(Kopczuk et al., 2010).

Notes: This table presents traditional measures of inequality (Gini, Hoover, and Theil) for three samples of
persons: (i) all eligible workers (top panel), (ii) most at-risk eligible workers (middle panel), and (iii) only active
workers (bottom panel).

who are most at risk to be active (dashed red line) relative to the base year 2004. The solid blue

line represents the share of eligible workers not currently working each year–the difference between
the number of workers in the first panel of Table D.1 and the number of workers in the third panel.
The dashed red line represents the share of workers most at risk to be active not currently working
each year–the difference between the number of workers in the second panel of Table D.1 and the
number of workers in the third panel. The dashed red line is noticeably more responsive to changes
in labor demand, suggesting that we chose a reasonable group to represent the workers most at
risk to be active. However, a closer look at the source of the decline in the most at risk group (red
line) from 2011 forward shows that the decline is due both to the growth in employment during
the recovery and a lack of growth in the number of workers most at risk to be active. Many of
the at risk workers who had positive earnings just prior to or at the start of the Great Recession
have not had positive earnings in the subsequent four years. By 2011, they are dropping out of the
at risk group. It is difficult to know the labor force status of these workers due to limitations of
administrative data, it does highlight the benefit of having multiple measures of inactive status for
the eligible-workers population.

Notes: This figure shows the share of eligible workers who are inactive (solid blue line) and the share who are “at
risk” (dashed red line) relative to the base year 2004. In a given year, a person is inactive if that person did not
make positive earnings that year. In a given year, a person is “at risk ” if that person did not make positive earnings
that year, but did make positive earnings sometime in the last four years.


       In Section 3 we documented the increase in inequality post-2000 using ratios of various
percentiles of the earnings distribution. For the eligible-workers frame, the increase in earnings of
the top 20% relative to the bottom 20% of earners accelerates during the Great Recession, with
annual earnings increases for workers at the 80th percentile and small declines or no increases for
at the 20th percentile. The increases for the 99/1 ratio, the 95/5 ratio, and the 90/10 ratio are
even larger, with the ratios increasing faster the more extreme the comparison (Figure 3). Here
we have taken an alternative approach. Instead of comparing two specific points in the earnings
distribution, the portmanteau inequality measures presented here weight the changes occurring
across the earnings distribution and combine them to produce a single measure of overall inequality.
Each measure uses different weights and combining rules, therefore it is useful to compare each
approach.
       The relative changes in the Gini coefficients for each of the three samples are presented in
Figure D.3. The results for the first two samples are almost identical. The Gini coefficients for

                                                          D-4
the third sample, only active workers, grow faster before the Great Recession, but do not show
the increase in inequality at the start of the Great Recession present for the eligible-workers and
at-risk-workers samples. Part of the reason for this difference is that the Gini coefficient is very
sensitive to changes in earnings at the top of the distribution. At the beginning of the recession,
earnings at the top of the distribution declined or stagnated. In spite of the large number of workers
moving from active to inactive status at the beginning of the Great Recession, the Gini coefficient
for the active-only sample shows inequality declining, although it does start to climb as earnings
growth at the top of the distribution resumes in 2009. In contrast, the Gini coefficients for the
all-eligible, and most at-risk samples show increasing inequality at the start of the Great Recession,
similar to the 80/20 ratio (also shown in the figure).

       The results for the Hoover index, shown in Figure D.4, are similar to the Gini coefficient,
although the relative increase in inequality during the Great Recession is larger when measured
using the Hoover index. The increase before the Great Recession is also larger when using only
active workers.

active and all inactive workers, (ii) At Risk : includes active workers and inactive workers who made positive
earnings sometime in the last four years, and (iii) Active Only: includes only active workers. The ratio of the 80th
to the 20th percentile is also plotted for reference.


       The final measure we consider is the symmetric Theil index. The results using this measure
are shown in Figure D.5. Over the entire period, the Theil measure is more responsive to earn-
ings distribution changes than either the Gini coefficient or the Hoover index, but it is especially
responsive to the addition of inactive workers. The relative change in the Theil index computed
using all eligible workers (sample one) is almost identical to the 80/20 ratio through 2009, with
greater inequality after that 2009 reflecting the slow decline in inactive workers during the recovery.
The relative change in the Theil index computed using only the most at-risk workers (sample two)
could arguably be viewed as an exaggerated version of the 80/20 ratio. The inclusion of inactive
at-risk workers in sample two introduces additional information into the Theil index calculation,
magnifying the decline in inequality prior to the Great Recession, the increase during the Great
Recession, and the decline during the recovery.

to the 20th percentile is also plotted for reference.


       Introducing information about inactive but at-risk workers into the calculation of the Gini
coefficient and Hoover index changes the trend, but the inequality levels in 2013 are largely the same
relative to 2004 using either measure. The Theil index changes in similar ways with the addition
of inactive but at-risk workers; however, the Theil index is much more sensitive to both changes in
the earnings distribution and the addition of inactive workers. The growth in the Theil index using
only active workers is larger than either the Gini or Hoover index. Similar to the Gini and the
Hoover indices, by not including inactive workers the Theil index fails to capture the increase in
inequality at the start of the Great Recession. Adding inactive workers to the Theil index (sample
one), results in a measure similar to the 80/20 ratio through 2009; after 2009 the two measures
diverge due to the slow decline in the number inactive workers during the recovery from the Great
Recession. The Theil index for the most at-risk workers (sample two) shows the largest changes in
inequality.
       Although it is unclear which of the adjusted inequality measures correctly weights the inactive
workers, it is worthwhile to consider adjusted measures that count at least some of the zero-earning
workers as part of any general analysis of changes in earnings inequality.




                                                                  D-7
E     Decomposing Changes in the Earnings Distribution
In Section 4 we presented the evolution of the earnings/inactivity distribution in terms of the year
to year flows of workers across different parts of the earnings distributions and into and out of
active status.

E.1   Worker Flows
Starting in 2005, each year we calculate the change in the number of workers between the current
and the previous year for the four earnings/inactivity categories. The year-to-year change in the
number of workers in a specific category is driven by changes in the number of workers entering
(inflows) and the number of workers leaving (outflows). Specifically, to compute the flows between
two employment states, let A and B be arrays of counts for each category in years t − 1 and t,
respectively:


                         year t − 1:         A = [ a0 a1 a2 a3 a4 ]
                             year t:         B = [ b0          b1      b2    b3   b4    ]

      In order to complete the decomposition and capture all possible transitions we must add an
additional category, zero, representing workers not eligible to work in one of the two periods, but
who are eligible to work in the other. Let CAB be the transition matrix of counts:
                                                                 
                                          c00 c01 c02 c03 c04
                                         c10 c11 c12 c13 c14 
                                                                 
                                CAB =   c20 c21 c22 c23 c24 
                                                                  
                                         c30 c31 c32 c33 c34 
                                          c40 c41 c42 c43 c44

The rows of the transition matrix represent the origin state (A) and the columns represent the
destination state (B). For example, c21 is the number of workers who were in the bottom 20%
of the overall-earnings distribution in year t − 1 and transition to the eligible but no reported UI
earnings category in year t.
       To compute the total net inflows into an employment category, we first introduce some
notation. Let ι be a (5 × 1) column vector of ones. Then:

                                CA• = CAB · ι = outflows + stayers
                                      T
                               C•B = CAB · ι = inflows + stayers

Net inflows into each employment state ∆C
                                        AB are defined as:

                              ∆C
                               AB ≡ B − A
                                       = C•B − CA•
                                                 T
                                       =       CAB ·ι          −       CAB · ι

                                           inflows + stayers       outflows + stayers
                                                  T
                                       =        (CAB    − CAB ) · ι                           (E-1)
                                                |        {z       }
                                           inflows − outflows = net inflows




                                                       E-1
Note the position of the stayers on the main diagonal. When we take the difference between CAB      T

and CAB , the resulting matrix will have zeros on the main diagonal, showing that the stayers do not
directly affect the earnings distribution except through changes in average earnings. It should also
be noted there is a direct relationship between the number of outflows and the number of stayers.
If more workers leave a given category then there will be fewer stayers, ceteris paribus.
       Table E.1 provides descriptive statistics on the individuals in each earnings category. It is
expanded in the main text in Table 5, which shows the net change in workers between the previous
year and the current year from 2005-2013.
       The flows of workers affect the earnings distribution, but the average earnings of each category
and the change in average earnings for stayers also affect the change in the earnings distribution.
Here we show the complete decomposition of the change in the earnings distribution. Table E.2
shows the earnings changes we decompose here. Unlike Table 5 in the main text, the decomposition
for earnings does not include net inflows into the eligible-worker frame or net inflows to inactive
status. As we show below, these flows have no associated earnings and therefore have a weight of
zero.
       The corresponding earnings transition matrix for a given transition matrix of counts CAB is:
                                                                     

       Unlike the transition matrix of counts, each element of the transition matrix of earnings has
two associated total earnings values, the total earnings for the workers in period A and the total
earnings for those same workers in period B. Each element of the earnings transition matrix is an
ordered pair of elements. For example, e23 = {eA        B
                                                  23 , e23 } represents the earnings of workers moving
from the bottom 20% to the middle 60% of the earnings distribution. The first element is the total
earnings in the previous period (when each worker is in the bottom 20%) and the second element
is the total earnings in the current period (when each worker is in the middle 60%. Elements with
an ordered pair of two zeros are shown as zeros in the earnings transition matrix.
       Applying the net inflow formulas for the counts to the earnings transition matrix,

and choosing the appropriate earnings value from each tuple, using an A or B superscript to indicate
the first or second element chosen, respectively, we have:

distribution. The sum of the first two rows is zero; each element of the first two rows is zero, there
are no earning when not eligible or eligible but inactive. Multiplying each element of the next three
rows by a conformable vector of ones we can separate each total earnings value into the product
of average earnings and the counts for that value. For example, the net inflows between period A
and period B for earnings category two is:

                                     + (ēB            A
                                          42 · c42 − ē24 · c24 )                                                   (E-3)

       The year-to-year change in the earnings associated with a given part of the earnings dis-
tribution is a linear function (weighted sum) of the average earnings and the transition counts.
Table E.2 shows the results, after first grouping the stayers, inflows, and outflows together for the
bottom 20%, middle 60%, and top 20% categories.
       The change in earnings reduces to a simple (signed) sum of the counts if the average earnings

       Although the simple formula will rarely hold in practice, it is useful as the earnings change for
each category is now a scaled function of the counts. For the data in this paper a different constant
average earnings value for each category does a reasonable job approximating the gross outflows
and inflows. However, when using a constant the individual flows are not always scaled correctly
since the weights (average earnings) differ substantially in some cases. Even though there are level
differences across flows, the average earnings values are for the most part stable over time, allowing
the counts to proxy for the change in the earnings distribution over time, once the appropriate
scale factor is known for a given flow. The table below shows the average earnings and measures
of variability for each of the flows.

E.2       AKM Decomposition
We estimate the following AKM model:

                                              ln yijt = xit β + θi + ψj + εijt                               (E-5)

where yijt is log real annual earnings of person i, employed at firm j in year t; θi is individual
i’s person effect; ψj is firm j’s fixed effect; and xit includes controls for experience, labor force
attachment, and aggregate labor market conditions detailed in Table E.4. Estimates of all these
controls are in Table E.5.

Notes: The specification also includes a fixed worker effect for each individual in the eligible-workers frame and a
fixed firm effect for each employer in that frame. The AKM estimation occurs only during date regime 4, which is
the complete population; however, our labor-force attachment variables require an additional quarter to calculate
(2014Q1), which is missing for one state and DC. The “right” variable controls for the case where a sixq variable is
set to zero due to data availability instead of actual labor-force attachment.

E.3      Analyzing Earnings Inequality Changes Using Only Firm-Type and Non-
         Firm-Type
In the main text Section 5, we use the AKM decomposition to create firm, non-firm, and skill
components of earnings. These components are used to create firm-type, non-firm-type and skill-
type bins that we subsequently employ to characterize the worker and firm contributions to changes
in earnings inequality.
        An earlier version of this paper used the non-firm-type bins in a manner similar to the use of
the skill-type bins in the main text. We discuss these results here for each non-firm-type separately.
We remind the reader that the non-firm-component contains the effects of changes in the labor-force
attachment, macroeconomic conditions, date regime boundaries, and the residual, all of which are
excluded from the skill-type in the main text.
        Table E.6 presents outcomes for workers in the bottom bin of the non-firm component.
Table E.7 presents outcomes for workers in the middle bin of the non-firm component distribution.
Table E.8 presents outcomes for workers in the top bin of the non-firm component distribution.
        The tables were created as follows. They are based on classifying workers in the previous
year, i.e., year t − 1. Beginning in 2004 and ending in 2012, for every year that an eligible worker
has positive earnings a single observation is added to one of the three tables. The appropriate table
classification for each observation is determined by the non-firm type for that year, which can vary
over time as workers accumulate experience, work more/less hours during the quarter, receive a
positive or negative aggregate demand shock, or have a large positive or negative residual. Within
each non-firm type, the earnings record is further classified based on the firm type, resulting in each
earnings observation being classified into one of nine possible cells.58 Within each of the non-firm-
type × firm-type cells, we break down the results by the three possible overall-earnings outcomes
(bottom, middle and top). There are, thus, twenty-seven cells for which we present information on
the number of workers, average earnings for the previous year (t − 1), and average earnings for the
current year (t) by flow type.59
        To fix ideas, we will take a detailed look at two rows in Table E.6. To be recorded in this table,
the person must have been in the bottom bin (lowest bin) of the non-firm-component distribution
in the “Previous Year,” i.e., t − 1.
        Consider the first row of the table. This row is in the panel labeled “Bottom Firm,” indicating
that this person is employed at a firm in the bottom bin of the firm component distribution in t − 1.
Persons in this row are also in the bottom bin of the overall-earnings distribution in year t − 1, and
the share of such persons (relative to those in the middle or top of the overall-earnings distribution)
is 1.000, indicating that no person in the bottom of the non-firm component distribution and the
bottom of the firm component distribution is employed outside of the bottom bin of the overall-
earnings distribution. The flow labeled “2 0” is the movement from the bottom of the overall-
earnings distribution (bin 2) to ineligible; that is, this is the flow out of the frame for persons
at the bottom of the overall-earnings distribution. There were, on average, 59,554 such persons
each “previous year” (t − 1). They represent 0.7% of the flows from bin 2 of the overall-earnings
distribution. Average earnings in t − 1 were $1,381 of which −$1, 463 are attributed to the firm
component of our decomposition and $2,844 are attributed to the non-firm component of our
decomposition. There were no earnings in the current year (t), because the person has moved out
of the frame in t.
        Next, consider the row labeled “Middle” in the “All Earnings” column in the “Middle Firm”
panel with a “3 3” flow. All persons in this row were, once again, at the bottom of the non-
 58
      The estimated AKM firm effects do not vary during the period, but workers can and do change employers.
 59
      The earnings observation we used for classification are labeled “previous year” in the tables.

firm component distribution in year t − 1. Of all such persons, 56% are employed by a firm in the
middle of the firm component distribution. Of all persons at the bottom of the non-firm component
distribution and in the middle of the firm component distribution in year t−1, the proportion 0.159
were in the middle of the overall-earnings distribution. Among such persons, the “3 3” row shows
those who remain in the middle of the overall-earnings distribution in the current year, t, of which
there were, on average, 1,470,659 in the 9 pairs of years for which the table was constructed. Those
who stayed in the middle of the overall-earnings distribution represented 58.9% of all persons who
were in the middle of the overall-earnings distribution in year t − 1, on average. In year t − 1, their
earnings averaged $8,498 of which $2,180 is attributed to the firm component in our decomposition
and $6,318 is attributed to the non-firm component. In the current year, year t, average earnings
were $15,688 of which $3,555 is associated with the firm component and $12,132 is associated with
the non-firm component.
       We use these tables to investigate worker sorting directly by looking at the interaction of
the non-firm and firm type for each worker-year-earnings observation. If there were no sorting,
the distribution of earnings observations across firm types would be similar for all three tables,
because outcomes would be unaffected by which part of the non-firm component distribution an
individual occupied, given his place in the overall-earnings distribution. This hypothesis is clearly
not supported by the data. For example, again using Table E.6 showing the bottom of the non-firm-
type distribution, about 33% of the earnings observations are in firms at the bottom of the firm-type
distribution, 56% are in firms of the middle type, and only 11% are in top firms. In comparison,
Tables E.7 and E.8 show that persons in the middle and top of the non-firm type distributions are
much less likely to be employed at firms in the bottom type (14% and 24% respectively), and much
more likely to be employed at top firms (23% and 20% respectively). Interestingly, the relationship
is not monotonic; workers in the middle are more likely to work at both middle and top firms
relative to top workers.
       Next, we focus on each non-firm-type in turn, starting with the earnings observations for
workers in the bottom of the non-firm component distribution in Table E.6. For workers at the
bottom of the non-firm-component distribution, working at a high-paying firm has two advantages:
higher earnings than otherwise and a greater chance of moving to a higher bin in the overall-earnings
distribution. For example, a worker at the bottom of the non-firm-component and overall-earnings
distributions has a probability of moving to the middle of the overall-earnings distribution of 18%
at a low paying firm, 29.5% at a middle paying firm, and 27.5% at a high paying firm. Prior to the
transition the average worker with a low non-firm component at a low-, middle- and high-paying
firm earns $2,084, $3,556, and $3,806, respectively.60 After the transition the average worker at a
low-, middle- and high-paying firm earns $11,640, $13,752, and $18,017, respectively. Most of the
additional increase in earnings for workers employed at a top-paying employer in the previous year
is due to working at a top-paying employer in the next year.
  60
    Notice that the non-firm component of earnings declines as we move up the firm type distribution. Although it is
unclear exactly which covariate is primarily responsible for this decline (fewer hours worked during the year perhaps),
the impact of working at a higher paying firm would be much greater if the non-firm component of earnings were the
same across firm types.

Notes: The estimates are based on the authors’ calculations using the nine paired years from 2004-2005 to
2012-2013. The first year in the pair is the “previous year” in the table, and the second year in the pair is the
“current year.” Bins associated with the flows are “0” inflow/outflow from the eligible-workers frame, “1” inactive
but eligible, “2” bottom of the overall-earnings distribution, “3” middle of the overall-earnings distribution, and “4”
top of the overall-earnings distribution. “Average count” is the average number of persons in the row during the
year labeled “previous year” (t − 1). Pct is the percent distribution of transitions for all persons who started the
                                                         E-13
year in the same overall-earnings distribution bin. For “Previous Year” and “Current Year,” “Total” is the average
real earnings in 2000 dollars, “Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the firm component in our
decomposition, and “Non-Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the non-firm component in our
decomposition.
       The vast majority (63%) of workers in the middle of the non-firm component distribution are
employed at middle-paying firms, as Table E.7 shows. The next most prevalent outcomes for such
workers are employment at top- and bottom-paying firms, 23% and 14% respectively. Similar to
workers at the bottom of the non-firm type distribution, who also generally appear at the bottom
of the overall-earnings distribution (84%) when employed by middle-paying firms, the majority of
workers in the middle of the non-firm type distribution, no matter the firm type, are in the middle
of the overall-earnings distribution. However, in spite of the majority of earnings observations being
in the middle of the overall-earnings distribution, average earnings differ substantially across firm
types. A middle-type worker in bin 3 of the overall-earnings distribution who stays in bin 3 of the
overall distribution (a “3 3” flow) at a bottom-type firm has t−1 earnings of $12,356, a middle-type
worker in a middle-type firm has t − 1 earnings of $22,978, and a middle-type worker at a top firm
has earnings of $32,321. Most of the difference is due to a larger firm effect, although the non-firm
component declines somewhat as a middle-type person is found in increasing firm types, giving
back some of the gains. Similar to bottom-type workers, one of the additional benefits of finding
employment at a high-paying firm is a greater probability of moving to the top of the earnings
distribution (0.2% vs. 2.7% vs. 11.9% in rows 5, 25, and 40, respectively).
       Similar to bottom and middle non-firm-type workers, Table E.8 shows that about 64% of
top non-firm type workers are also in the top of the overall-earnings distribution, but there is also
a substantial minority in the middle. The differences between working at a middle- compared to
a bottom-type firm are relatively small, but the gains from working at a top-type firm are very
large. Somewhat surprisingly perhaps, there are a relatively large number of top-type workers at
bottom- and middle-type firms. On average, these workers, especially in the middle, are employed
at worse-paying firms than middle non-firm type workers.

Notes: The estimates are based on the authors’ calculations using the nine paired years from 2004-2005 to
2012-2013. The first year in the pair is the “previous year” in the table, and the second year in the pair is the
“current year.” Bins associated with the flows are “0” inflow/outflow from the eligible-workers frame, “1” inactive
but eligible, “2” bottom of the overall-earnings distribution, “3” middle of the overall-earnings distribution, and “4”
top of the overall-earnings distribution. “Average count” is the average number of persons in the row during the
year labeled “previous year” (t − 1). Pct is the percent distribution of transitions for all persons who started the
                                                         E-15
year in the same overall-earnings distribution bin. For “Previous Year” and “Current Year,” “Total” is the average
real earnings in 2000 dollars, “Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the firm component in our
decomposition, and “Non-Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the non-firm component in our
decomposition.

Notes: The estimates are based on the authors’ calculations using the nine paired years from 2004-2005 to
2012-2013. The first year in the pair is the “previous year” in the table, and the second year in the pair is the
“current year.” Bins associated with the flows are “0” inflow/outflow from the eligible-workers frame, “1” inactive
but eligible, “2” bottom of the overall-earnings distribution, “3” middle of the overall-earnings distribution, and “4”
top of the overall-earnings distribution. “Average count” is the average number of persons in the row during the
year labeled “previous year” (t − 1). Pct is the percent distribution of transitions for all persons who started the
                                                         E-16
year in the same overall-earnings distribution bin. For “Previous Year” and “Current Year,” “Total” is the average
real earnings in 2000 dollars, “Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the firm component in our
decomposition, and “Non-Firm” is the average real earnings associated with the non-firm component in our
decomposition.
