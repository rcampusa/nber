Despite the rapid expansion of U.S.-China trade ties, the increase in U.S. FDI in China, and the expanding
amount of economic research exploring these developments, a number of misconceptions distort the
popular understanding of U.S. multinationals in China. In this paper, we seek to correct four common
misunderstandings by providing a statistical portrait of several aspects of U.S. affiliate activity in the
country and placing this activity in its appropriate economic context.

U.S. Firms in China: The Hype vs. the Hard Facts

         In the late 1970s, China began to adopt economic policies that were more market

oriented than policies it had pursued in the past, and this shift has been very successful in

promoting economic growth.1 Rising levels of industrial output have been accompanied

by increases in foreign direct investment inflows, leading many to conclude that foreign

direct investment has played an important role in China’s success. Since China’s official

entry to the WTO in 2001, China’s economy has continued to expand rapidly, FDI

inflows have continued on a large scale, and China’s role in world trade has continued to

increase.

         These developments have heightened American public interest in China.

Numerous recent books seek to explain the Chinese economy to the general reader, and

the popular press has expanded its coverage of Chinese economic developments. Despite

this growing level of information, however, significant misconceptions continue to cloud

the popular understanding of the role of foreign firms in China, and, particularly, the role

of U.S.-based multinationals. Some of these misconceptions have even taken root in the

thinking of professional economists who are outside the small community of China

specialists.

and Lardy (2006), Lardy (2002), and Naughton (1996). For a more analytical approach which applies
formal political economy models of policy formation to the Chinese context, see Branstetter and Feenstra
(2002).
                                                                                                             1
        In the late 1990s, when popular and professional interest in the general

phenomenon of expanding foreign direct investment was increasing, Robert Feenstra

wrote a useful article called “Facts and Fallacies about Foreign Direct Investment.” The

article corrected a number of widely misconceptions about the subject. Inspired by his

title as well as his approach, we seek to dispel four widely held beliefs about U.S.

affiliate activity in China by using the most recent available data.



Fallacy Number 1. U.S. FDI in China is large.

        The attention paid to China and its economic engagement with the rest of the

world has led many to conclude that it is a leading destination of U.S. FDI. Casual

observers believe that China’s abundance of labor, high growth rates, and huge consumer

markets attract large amounts of U.S. FDI. This view is even held by many corporate

executives. A 2004 AT Kearney study found that China was perceived as the most

favored location for FDI. The amount of capital flowing to China from the U.S. in the

form of FDI is thought to be sufficient to have a large effect on Chinese capital formation.

However, data collected by Chinese statistical agencies indicate that U.S. FDI is a small

component of total FDI in China, and data collected by U.S. agencies show that

American firms’ investment in China is a small part of their total investment abroad.

        Statistics from the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China track

investment by approved Foreign Invested Enterprises (FIEs) on an annual basis. Figure 1

breaks down this growth in investment by the nationality of the foreign owner or partial

owner of the FIE.2 Prior to 1989, FDI inflows were limited and dominated by Hong


2
  Because of official restrictions on direct Taiwanese investment in the mainland, some Taiwanese FDI
gets routed through Hong Kong or through “tax haven” nations such as the Cayman Islands. Such tax
                                                                                                        2
Kong and Taiwan-based investors seeking to exploit opportunities in China’s special

economic zones. After the international unease generated by the Tiananmen Incident

dissipated, there was a sharp increase in FDI inflows and a pronounced diversification in

its sources. It was in these years that Western countries and Japan began to enter the

Chinese market in earnest. However, the role of American firms in these inflows has

been and remains relatively modest.

        It is worth noting that even overall levels of FIE investment are modest. As

indicated in Figure 2, FIE investment in fixed assets accounts for only about 10% of total

fixed asset investment in China.

        Just as American firms collectively account for a relatively small component of

FDI in China, American investment in China accounts for a relatively small portion of

total U.S. multinational activity around the world. Table 1 shows 2004 total assets, sales,

and employment of U.S. affiliates in China and in four regions that are the major

destinations of U.S. FDI. China’s share of U.S. MNE total affiliate sales and assets were

1.9% and 0.7%, respectively, in 2004. Although the compound annual growth rate of

U.S. MNE sales in China over the 1982-2004 period exceeds 40%, this rapid growth has

proceeded from a small base, and it has taken place in a context of growing multinational

activity worldwide.3 Chinese affiliates comprise 4.5% of U.S. total affiliate employment,

which is a larger share than their share of assets and sales, suggesting that work



haven jurisdictions are a prominent component of the “other nations” category shown in Figure 1. Some
advanced countries also preferred to invest in China through Hong Kong-based subsidiaries, further
exaggerating the apparent role played by Hong Kong. Finally, it is widely speculated that as much as one
quarter of the FDI originating in Hong Kong consists of Chinese entrepreneurs investing through Hong
Kong shell companies in order to qualify as FIEs for tax and other benefits.
3
   The reported profits of U.S. affiliates in China have also grown rapidly, especially in recent years.
Between the 1999 and 2004 benchmark surveys, net income grew nearly seven fold. However, net income
from Chinese affiliates only accounts for about 2% of the global net income of U.S. affiliates worldwide.
                                                                                                        3
performed in China is relatively labor intensive.4 As the data in Table 1 suggests, most

U.S. MNE activity takes place in other developed countries like Canada and countries in

Europe.

        Although the data from both Chinese and U.S. sources indicate levels of foreign

direct investment that are smaller than the popular press suggests, there are significant

discrepancies between data from these sources. The most comparable data sets both

attempt to provide measures of FDI flows as opposed to measures of MNE operating

activity. Table 2 presents estimates of U.S. FDI outflows to China produced by the

Bureau of Economic Analysis and Chinese Ministry of Commerce estimates of U.S. FDI

inflows into China from the U.S. over the 1994-2005 period. In each year, Chinese

Ministry of Commerce estimates exceed the BEA estimates, often by a factor of more

than two.

        A number of measurement issues seem to be important to explaining this

discrepancy. First, the Ministry of Commerce reports measures of “actually utilized

investment” by foreign invested enterprises, and these measures include investment that

is financed by capital flows from the foreign parent as well as investment that is financed

through local sources, including borrowing from local banks.5

        Table 3 provides some indication of how important such local sources of capital

are for foreign firms in China. In 2004, only 70% of U.S. affiliates based in China were

wholly owned. Joint ventures often involve a local partner who provides equity capital as


4
   These employment figures need to be placed in some context. The total Chinese urban workforce in
2005 was 273 million persons. Foreign invested enterprises from all source countries collectively
employed about 12.4 million persons, less than 5% of the total. Clearly, U.S. firms’ contribution to
employment in China is vanishingly small.
5
   We are extremely grateful to Nicholas Lardy for a series of detailed discussions which clarified our
understanding of Chinese statistics on FDI, including the degree to which it may reflect investment
financed by the local borrowing of FIEs.
                                                                                                          4
well as other inputs, and these types of organizational forms are more prevalent in China

than in the other regions displayed in the table. Slightly more than one half of the assets

of U.S. affiliates based in China are financed with debt, and 61.4% of this debt is

provided by local sources. The widely documented shortcomings of Chinese financial

markets make it surprising that Chinese lenders would figure so prominently.6 However,

given the hazards attending other classes of borrowers, the local subsidiaries of foreign

multinationals can be seen as relatively creditworthy borrowers, ultimately backed by

deep-pocketed foreign parents, and in possession of brand name and technological

advantages over potential foreign competitors. Loans from the parent are 18.9% of total

debt. While this share exceeds shares of intrafirm debt elsewhere around the world, it is

still fairly small.7 As a consequence of these issues, the official Chinese statistics can be

viewed as overstating the contribution of U.S. firms to Chinese investment.

        A second factor that might contribute to the discrepancy concerns how source

countries are determined in FDI flow data. In the U.S. data, any capital flow from the

parent company to an affiliate in China through a holding company located in a third

country is captured as a outflow from the U.S. to the third country, not from the U.S. to

China. The exact procedures followed by Chinese statistical authorities are not clear, and

it is possible that data collectors use information about the ultimate nationality of foreign

investors to classify some of the FDI routed through tax haven holding companies

according to the nationality of the ultimate parent.



6
   Scholarship critical of the efficiency of Chinese financial institutions includes Lardy (1998), Lardy
(2004), Tsai (2002), and Branstetter (2007), among many other sources.
7
  Desai, Foley, and Hines (2004) document that multinationals tend to make extensive use of parent
provided capital in countries with poor financial development, and Antras, Desai, and Foley (2006) provide
a theoretical explanation for why this would be the case, this regularity does not seem to hold for China.
                                                                                                        5
        Differences in measured FDI inflows could also be a consequence of other

deviations between Chinese and international statistical practice. The view that much of

the discrepancy lies in differences in statistical practice was strengthened recently by

massive revisions of the Chinese government’s own official estimates of the net inward

FDI stock. Beginning in 2005, the Ministry of Commerce released revised estimates of

China’s net FDI stock that reduced its size by half. Previous estimates of the stock had

been based on accumulated inflows, and these data may not have captured reductions in

FDI capital provided by foreigners. The new, revised FDI stock measures are not broken

down by source country, but the magnitude of this revision amounts to an admission that

the previously reported figures were far too high, and suggests that the true level of FDI

may lie closer to that indicated by U.S. data.8 Given this, and the extent to which, even in

the Chinese data, U.S. FDI is a relatively small component of cumulated total inflows, we

remain quite confident in our conclusions regarding the relative size of U.S. FDI in China.

        In order to explore why U.S. FDI in China appears to be small, we run gravity

specifications to explain levels of U.S. MNE activity by country. 9 In these tests, we use

confidential data from BEA’s 2004 Benchmark Survey of U.S. Direct Investment Abroad

on the operations of majority-owned nonbank affiliates of nonbank U.S. parents, which

we aggregate to the country level.10 We employ three different measures of U.S. MNE

activity as dependant variables, the log of affiliate sales, the log of affiliate assets, and the

log of affiliate employment compensation. Our base line specification controls for

geographic distance from the U.S. and the log of GDP (measured at market exchange

   The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) issued a briefing pointing out
this and other issues regarding Chinese FDI data and the challenges involved in comparing Chinese FDI
statistics with those of other sources. See UNCTAD (2007).

   We thank Shang-Jin Wei and Robert Feenstra for suggesting that we explore this question.

   For a detailed explanation of these data, see Mataloni (1995).
                                                                                                        6
rates). It also includes a China dummy that is equal to one for China and zero for other

countries. If the coefficient on the China dummy is negative, this would indicate that

measures of U.S. MNE activity in China are lower in China than a simple gravity

specification would suggest they should be.

       Once we have estimates from this base line specification, we include other

country characteristics that could explain the extent to which U.S. MNEs engage in

activity in China. Given the potential importance of taxes and corruption noted by Desai,

Foley, Hines (2004) and Wei (2000), we include a measure of each country’s corporate

income tax rate and the corruption index taken from the ICRG political risk data set. In

order to control for factors related levels of wealth and economic development more

generally, we also include the log of GDP per capita (measured at market exchange rates).

Descriptive statistics for the data used in the analysis presented in Table 5, as well as the

analysis presented in Table 7, appear in Table 4.

       The results of the gravity specifications appear in Table 5. The dependent

variable used in columns 1-4 is the Log of Affiliate Sales, in 5-8 the Log of Affiliate

Assets, and in 9-12 the Log of Affiliate Employment Compensation. Our base line

specifications appear in columns 1, 5, and 9. In each of these specifications, the

coefficient on the Log of Distance is negative and significant, and the coefficient on the

Log of GDP is positive and significant. These findings are consistent with previous work

and indicate that U.S. MNEs engage in more activity in larger countries that are closer to

the U.S. In each of these specifications, the coefficient on the China dummy is negative

and significant. These results point out that levels of U.S. MNE activity in China are




                                                                                                7
lower than would be predicted by a simple model in which levels of MNE activity vary

with distance and country size.

       The specifications in columns 2, 6, and 10 include measures of corporate tax rates.

This variable is not significant in these specifications, and its inclusion does not change

the negative coefficient on the China Dummy very much. Controlling for corruption, as

in columns 3, 7, and 11, reduces the magnitude and significance of the China dummy.

This dummy becomes insignificant although still negative in Column 3 and marginally

significant in column 11 while the coefficient on the corruption index is positive and

significant. China has a corruption index of 2 on a scale of 0 to 6 where higher numbers

imply lower levels of corruption. These results suggest that China’s low level of US

MNE activity is at least in part a consequence of corruption or a factor that is correlated

with corruption. The specifications presented in columns 4, 8, and 12 also include the

Log of GDP per capita. Once this variable is included, the coefficient on the China

Dummy is no longer significant. These results indicate that US MNE activity is actually

not lower than one would expect if one accounts for the fact that per capita income is low

in China and corruption is high.

       While caution is surely warranted in using regression coefficients derived from

cross-sectional evidence to make predictions about the evolution of economic variables

over time, it is interesting to consider what our regression coefficients imply about the

future of U.S. FDI in China. Given its rapid rate of current economic growth, it is likely

that per capita income and aggregate GDP in China will rise sharply over the next 10

years. If the overall Chinese economy were to maintain growth rates of 10% per year




                                                                                              8
over the next decade, the combined effects of the estimated coefficients on GDP and

GDP per capita would predict that U.S. affiliate sales in China would more than triple.




Fallacy Number 2. U.S. FDI in China is Export-Oriented

          As the U.S.-China trade deficit has grown in recent years, a number of

commentators have suggested that it has been driven by U.S. purchases of goods

produced by U.S. affiliates in China. For example, in a 2000 briefing paper for the

Economic Policy Institute, James Burke wrote, “The activities of U.S. multinational firms,

together with China’s protectionist trade policies, have had a significant role in increasing

the U.S. trade deficit with China.”11

          Foreign firms in China have indeed played an increasingly dominant role in

China’s trade. Figure 3 shows the role of foreign firms in Chinese imports and exports,

respectively. In a period in which Chinese exports and imports have been growing

rapidly, these shares have been rising. By 2000, the share of FIEs in Chinese exports had

reached more than 50%, and it continued to expand. Clearly, FIEs have accounted for a

disproportionately large share of export growth during the years in which China has come

to loom so large in world trade.

          What role do U.S. affiliates play in this incredible surge of export growth?

Almost none. Table 6 presents statistics on the extent to which U.S. affiliates in China

sell their goods to customers located in the U.S. and the extent to which they trade with

the U.S. The data illustrate that in 2004, about $39.7 billion of local affiliate sales were

directed to the local market and only $3.7 billion were directed to the U.S. market. In
11
     See Burke (2000).
                                                                                               9
that year, U.S. exports to affiliates and U.S. imports from affiliates comprised less than

5% of affiliate sales. These patterns are not consistent with the hypothesis that U.S.

affiliates operating in China are contributing to the large U.S. trade deficit by producing

there and selling back to the U.S. Intrafirm trade by U.S. multinationals does not loom

nearly as large in intermediating U.S.-China trade as the overall role of FIEs in Chinese

trade might suggest. In fact, a comparison of the total exports to and imports from China

ascribed to U.S. multinationals seems rather small in comparison to the magnitudes of

bilateral trade flows in 2004. Total U.S. imports from China were $196.7 billion and

total U.S. exports were $34.7 billion.12 U.S. imports and exports between U.S. affiliates

in China and their U.S. parents were $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion respectively.

        What is true of U.S. multinationals seems to broadly true of multinationals from

other Western countries. Every year the Chinese Ministry of Commerce publishes a list

of the top 200 largest mainland Chinese firms by export value. The 200 firms included in

the 2005 list accounted for one-third of total mainland exports in that year, providing a

useful, if incomplete, sample of important exporting firms of all nationalities.

Inspections of this list suggest that the total share of U.S., European, and Japanese

multinationals in the exports of the top 200 is only 11%.13 The majority of firms in this

list are indeed foreign invested, but the foreigners hail from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and

South Korea. Like American firms, the leading European multinationals in China appear

to be focused primarily on the domestic market, not exports. The Chinese export miracle



12
    These figures were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau web site at http://www.census.gov/foreign-
trade/balance/c5700.html#2004. In 1999, U.S. exports to China totaled about $13 billion and imports from
China were almost $82 billion.
13
    See Anderson (2006), from whom the statistics in this paragraph and the next are taken. The language
here closely follows his.
                                                                                                     10
largely reflects the activity of the foreign affiliates of firms based in Asia’s other newly

industrialized countries.

          The role played by Japanese firms in Chinese exports appears to lie somewhere in

between the roles played by Western firms and firms headquartered in developing

countries in Asia. Ahn, Fukao, and Ito (2007) have used Japanese data and South Korean

data to undertake an extensive study of the role played by these firms’ affiliates in

regional trade flows. Because many Japanese firms route their exports through Hong

Kong, these authors aggregate Chinese and Hong Kong trade statistics. They find that

the exports of Japanese firms’ Chinese affiliates collectively account for nearly 41% of

total Chinese/Hong Kong exports to Japan. Likewise, about 30% of total Japanese

exports to China go to the Chinese affiliates of Japanese firms. The relatively greater role

of Japanese affiliates in mediating Japan-China trade is likely to be related to geographic

proximity and history. China is the closest major economy to the Japanese home islands,

and many Japanese companies were quite active in parts of China prior to the end of

World War II.

          The limited role played by U.S. firms in mediating U.S.-China trade is surprising

given the extent to which large U.S. retail chains distribute Chinese goods. According to

some estimates, Wal-Mart accounts for almost $20 billion of Chinese exports to the U.S.

However, Wal-Mart and other large-scale U.S. retailers typically procure their goods

from China-based export-oriented manufacturing plants that are not U.S.-owned to any

significant degree.14 They tend to purchase from the same Taiwanese, Hong Kong, and

Korean firms they sourced from a decade or two ago, expect that the final production is

now based in mainland China.
14
     See Anderson (2006).
                                                                                               11
        In order to explore in more detail if U.S. affiliates based in China are more

focused on serving the local market that one should expect, we again make use of gravity

specifications. In Table 7, we report results of tests that are identical to those presented

in Table 5 except that dependant variables measure the extent to which U.S. affiliates

based in different countries focus on serving markets outside of their host country. These

tests use data aggregated to the country level for the year 2004.

        The dependent variable used in columns 1-4 is the log of affiliate sales to persons

outside the affiliate’s host country; in 5-8 it is the share of affiliate sales to persons

outside the host country and the U.S., and in 9-12 it is the share of affiliate sales to

persons in the U.S. Our baseline specifications are given in columns 1, 5, and 9, and

these include the log of distance from the U.S., host country GDP, and a China dummy as

controls. The coefficient on the China dummy in column 1 is negative and marginally

significant; it is negative and significant in column 5; but it is positive and insignificant in

column 9. Therefore, there is only some evidence that U.S. affiliates in China are less

focused on serving consumers outside their host country than are U.S. affiliates elsewhere.

In fact, the share of sales to persons in the U.S. is not lower than one would expect once

one accounts for country size and distance from the U.S.

        Levels of sales to countries other than the host country are higher for affiliates

located closer to the U.S. and for affiliates in larger countries. Shares of sales to persons

in the U.S. are higher for affiliates located closer to the U.S., but distance from the U.S.

does not, perhaps unsurprisingly, affect the share of sales to persons in countries other

than host countries and the U.S. The log of GDP is also not significant in explaining

shares of sales to the U.S. or countries other than the host country and the U.S.


                                                                                             12
       Adding corporate tax rates to our specifications reduces the coefficients on the

China dummy. The negative coefficients on this dummy presented in columns 2 and 6

are both statistically significant. The negative coefficients on host country tax rates imply

that sales to persons outside the host country are higher in low tax countries. Tax rates

faced by multinationals are relatively low in China. Therefore, accounting for corporate

tax rates would lead one to predict that affiliates based in China should be more focused

on serving markets outside of China. When we add the corruption index to the

specifications, the coefficients on this variable are positive and significant in columns 3

and 7, indicating that affiliates in countries with less corruption sell more output outside

the host country. Once this variable is included, none of the coefficients on the China

dummy are significant. The specifications presented in columns 4, 8, and 12 also include

a control for the log of GDP per capita. In each of these specifications, the coefficient on

the China dummy is positive, although these coefficients are not significant. These

results suggest that once one accounts for levels of corruption and country wealth, as well

as tax rates, distance, and country size, U.S. affiliates in China are not less export

oriented that affiliates based in other countries.



Fallacy Number 3. U.S. multinational investment in China displaces investment

elsewhere.

       U.S. workers often express concerns about increased competition for workers

located in countries like China. Given the vast supply of labor in China, the low costs of

production, and the alleged existence of technologically skilled workers, few employees

outside of China feel secure. In the extreme, these concerns would predict that increased


                                                                                            13
activity in China by U.S. multinationals would displace activities that had been

performed elsewhere.

       The results of the previous sections suggest these concerns may be misplaced. As

we have already demonstrated, levels of U.S. affiliate activity in China are modest.

Furthermore, these affiliates have been and remain overwhelmingly focused on the

domestic market. Given this, one would not expect increased activity in China to

displace activity in other countries to a significant degree. However, we can approach

this question much more directly. Using the BEA data, it is possible to see if

multinationals that expand employment in China cut it at home or among their other

affiliates. The data presented in Table 8 address this issue by providing number counts of

incidents in which firms that increase or decrease employment in China increase or

decrease employment in other locations. The data include observations computed using

firm-level data from the 1989, 1994, 1999, and 2004 benchmark survey results, so there

are three periods over which increases and decreases are considered, the 1989-1994,

1994-1999, and 1999-2004 periods. Entries into China by existing multinationals are

counted as increases in employment in China and exits from China are counted as

decreases.

       The data in the top panel reflect the growth in employment that has taken place

among Chinese affiliates of U.S. multinationals. It also points out that firms that expand

in China are almost as likely to expand employment domestically as they are to cut it.

This evidence is not what one would expect if growth in China were strictly displacing

activity in the U.S. The bottom panel displays similar data, but instead of considering the

tradeoff between activity in China and activity in the U.S., it considers the tradeoff


                                                                                         14
between activity in China and activity among other affiliates. It appears that firms that

are increasing employment in China are increasing, and not decreasing, it elsewhere.

Although somewhat crude, these statistics suggest that at least extreme notions that

would give rise to concerns of multinational employees in the U.S. and elsewhere in the

world are unfounded.



Fallacy Number 4: U.S. multinationals are aggressively exploiting China’s growing

technological prowess

        In the U.S., China is often perceived as being an emerging technological

superpower. Industrialists, economists, and policy makers believe that China is

becoming an attractive location to perform innovative activity. In 2003, Intel CEO Craig

Barrett identified China’s rising technological strength as constituting a competitive

threat to U.S.-based high-technology industries.15 Harvard economist Richard Freeman

(2006) has outlined the potential consequences of the globalization of the science and

engineering workforce for America’s historical pattern of comparative advantage in high-

technology industries. Freeman points to the striking rise in the number of multinational

R&D centers in China – more than 700 by the end of 2004 – and argues that this is only

the harbinger of greater reallocation yet to come.16 Trefler and Puga (2005) point to the

rise of R&D activity in China and declare that the economics profession should “wake up

and smell the ginseng!” In its 2005 annual survey of global FDI trends, the World

Investment Report produced by UNCTAD highlighted the internationalization of R&D,

and singled out the growth of foreign R&D centers in China as a development of

particular significance. Management scholar Minyuan Zhao (2006) has studied the

patents generated by these centers for clues as to how American multinationals have

apparently learned to engage in large-scale, sophisticated R&D in a national context with

notoriously weak intellectual property rights.

        Proponents of the view that China is quickly emerging as a favorable location for

high tech activity often point to evidence on the growing sophistication of China’s

exports as proof of their claims. Schott (2006), for example, finds that over time Chinese

exports exhibit rising sophistication relative to countries with similar aggregate

endowments.17 Rodrik (2006) finds an unusually high degree of technological

sophistication in China’s export pattern. Cui and Syed (2007) suggest that recent changes

in China’s trade patterns indicate that it is rapidly becoming a surprisingly mature

economy. Preeg (2004, 9), a researcher with the Manufacturers Alliance, charges that

China’s emergence as a major supplier of information technology, communication, and

electronic products poses a major challenge to U.S. commercial and security interests.

        Several considerations suggest these views are overblown. First, the extent of

innovative activity performed in China by U.S. multinationals is surprisingly modest.

Table 9 provides 2004 data on expenditures for research and development performed by

U.S. affiliates in China, U.S. affiliates based in other regions, and the U.S.-based parent

operations of U.S. MNEs. Only $622 million was spent by U.S. MNEs on R&D in China,

an amount that is about 3 tenths of one percent of the total R&D undertaken globally by

U.S. MNEs.18 Nearly 85% of R&D performed by U.S. multinationals in 2004 was


17
    However, Schott qualifies this finding by documenting a decline in the prices of Chinese exports
relative to OECD exports of similar products.
18
    The fraction takes as its denominator the sum of expenditures on R&D preformed by the U.S. parent
and the R&D expenditures performed by all affiliates of U.S. firms in all countries.
                                                                                                        16
performed by the U.S.-based parent company. Less than 13% of the $4.9 billion of the

R&D that U.S. multinationals performed in the Asia and Pacific region was performed in

China.

         U.S. patent data also indicate that China’s innovative capability is more limited

than some have suggested and that U.S. firms are not performing much innovative

activity there. Anyone seeking to protect intellectual property within the borders of the

United States must apply for patent protection from the U.S. Patent and Trademark

Office (U.S. PTO). Given the importance of the U.S. economy to the world in general

and to China in particular, it is reasonable to regard patents taken out by China-based

inventors in the U.S. as a useful indicator of inventive activity. The CASSIS CD-ROM

produced by the U.S. PTO provides information about U.S. patents, and we use the

December 2006 version to produce Figure 4.

         Figure 4 tracks China-generated patents in various categories over time. The

dramatic growth in patenting over time is evident in this graph, but levels of patenting

activity remain low. From the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2006, the U.S. PTO

granted 3,447 patents to inventors based in China or teams of inventors that included at

least one member with a Chinese address. Over the same period, inventors with ties to

Japan received nearly 241,000 patents, inventors with ties to Taiwan received over

39,000 patents, and inventors with ties to Israel received over 8,000 patents.

         It is informative to break out patents generated in China into patents in which all

listed inventors at the time of invention were based in China and also to break out patents

that were assigned to U.S. corporate entities. As Figure 4 indicates, a large and growing

fraction of patents with Chinese inventors reflect collaborative work with inventors


                                                                                             17
located elsewhere.19 U.S. corporate entities appear to be associated with fewer than

1,000 the granted patents, and only a relatively small percentage of China-generated

patents assigned to U.S. multinationals reflect the inventive of input of a purely Chinese

team of inventors. This could reflect a deliberate attempt on the part of U.S. R&D

centers in China to conduct research that only has value when combined with a

complementary research input from the U.S. or from another relatively advanced country.

Zhao (2006) describes this strategy as a way for U.S.-based multinationals to cope with

the poor intellectual property rights regime in China. Another interpretation is that

Chinese scientists and engineers, despite impressive levels of raw talent and basic skills,

find it difficult to innovative effectively at the technological frontier on their own, and

often require the input of R&D managers and experts based elsewhere in the world to go

beyond the existing state of the art.

         While China may not yet be an important generator of U.S. patents in the

aggregate, it is possible that China-based research activities may be important for

particular American firms. To assess this, we examined the total patent portfolios of U.S.

corporate entities that hold patents in China. As of late 2006, about 120 U.S. corporate

assignees have been granted at least 2 patents for which at least one inventor was based in

China. The Chinese patents of these firms comprise only slightly more than 1% of the

annual patenting activity of these firms in 2006.20


19
    Nearly 40% of China-generated U.S. patents identify inventors based in at least one other country. In
contrast, nearly 90% of U.S. patents granted to U.S. firms in the last three years are generated by inventors
based solely in the U.S. and a similar percentage of Japan-generated U.S. patents represent the product of
only Japanese inventors.
20
   One can combine the patent data with the R&D data to generate crude estimates of the patents per R&D
dollar generated by U.S. affiliate R&D spending in China and compare that to the patents per R&D dollar
generated by R&D spending by the parent firm in the U.S. According to our estimates, the ratio of U.S.
patents per R&D dollar in China is less than half this ratio in the U.S. This difference is consistent with the
view that the R&D conducted in Chinese affiliates tends to be more focused on modification of the parent
                                                                                                            18
         By far, the leading U.S. firm, in terms of China-generated patents, is Microsoft.

Table 10 lists the top 10 corporate assignees in terms of China-generated U.S. patents.

Microsoft has nearly three times as many China-generated patents as IBM and Intel.

After years of fractious relationships with the Chinese government, Microsoft sought to

cultivate more harmonious ties with key government officials by opening multiple

research centers in the PRC.21 Microsoft lavished rather large sums of money on these

facilities and sought to attract high-profile researchers to them, an effort described at

length in a recent book by Buderi and Huang, Guanxi: The Art of Relationships. Senior

Microsoft executives, including former CEO Bill Gates, have regularly reiterated their

commitment to conducting world class research in China at the very frontier of software

technology. In the context of that public commitment, it is interesting to note that

Microsoft’s China-generated patents amount to less than 4% of its total cumulative

patents to date.22 If we restrict ourselves to patents with solely Chinese inventor teams,

this fraction drops to about 1.5%.

         Interestingly, the leading patent-generating firm in China, with more than four

times Microsoft’s cumulated patent stock and a commanding lead over any indigenous

mainland Chinese firm, is the Taiwanese contract manufacturing firm, Hon Hai, also

known by its English trade name, Foxconn. Hon Hai is one of four Taiwanese

manufacturing firms to appear on this top 10 list. As is the case with export-oriented


firm’s technology for the Chinese market or the development of technology specifically for that market
than it is on the kind of fundamental, strategically sensitive research conducted in the parents’ own labs.
21
    An interesting account of Microsoft’s early missteps in the People’s Republic is provided by Khanna
(1997). Poor relationships with the central government of the PRC ensured that rates of piracy of
Microsoft products in China remained among the highest in the world for years.
22
    In private conversations with the authors, some U.S. corporate managers have referred to the R&D
centers opened by their firms in China as “PR&D” centers – that is, they were as much about public
relations efforts directed at a mainland regime reluctant to enforce intellectual property rights as they were
about “real” research and development.
                                                                                                            19
manufacturing, it appears the Taiwanese firms are more aggressively exploiting the

opportunities to conduct research in China, such as they are, than are their U.S.

counterparts.

         Although the amount of innovative activity performed in China is lower than it is

often perceived to be, the types of goods China exports are fairly technologically

advanced. This has posed a puzzle to some economists. However, China is able to

export huge quantities of high tech goods only because it imports most of the high value-

added parts and components that go into these goods.23 Figure 5 displays the level of

Chinese exports and imports in electronic and information industry products. The

domestic value-added component of the value of exported electronic and information

technology products, while growing, remains quite low. 24 Even in the most recent years

for which data are available, more than 70% of the value of these exports is comprised of

imported inputs.25

         While U.S. multinationals, with a few exceptions, do not play a major role in

Chinese exports of high-tech goods, we also see in U.S. affiliate data a strong correlation

in high-tech industries between imports from the parent and sales. Regression analyses

of affiliate sales on measures of imported intermediates from the parent show a

dramatically stronger connection for more R&D intensive industries, underscoring the

relatively higher dependence of such activity in China on key inputs from the parent.

facts and figures in the following paragraphs reproduce points made in Lardy’s presentations and in
Branstetter and Lardy (2006).
24
    An entertaining specific example of this is provided by Linden, Kraemer, and Dedrick (2007), who
break down the production process for an Apple iPod, all of which are assembled in and exported from
China. The authors’ careful, if incomplete, cost accounting suggests that Chinese value added represents at
most a few dollars of the roughly $150 factory cost for the typical iPod.
25
    In light manufacturing, in contrast, domestic content accounts for nearly 70% of the value of exports.
See Anderson (2007) for a useful review of the most recent data.
                                                                                                          20
Taken together, levels of R&D conducted in China, the amount of patenting associated

with innovation based in China, and the low Chinese value added in high tech Chinese

exports suggest that China is far from becoming a technological superpower that will be

home to a large share of U.S. MNE innovative activity.



Conclusions

        The emergence of China as an important trading economy has been one of the

most significant economic developments of our time. Nevertheless, the scale of U.S.

affiliate activity in China remains relatively modest. U.S. affiliates based in China

account for less than 2% of total U.S. affiliate sales, they contribute relatively little to

aggregate Chinese investment, and they play a surprisingly small role in mediating the

expansion of U.S.-China trade. Partly because of their strong focus on the domestic

market and partly because of the small scale of their operations, U.S. affiliates in China

do not appear to have significantly displaced investment elsewhere as they have increased

the scale and scope of their operations in China.

        Limited levels of U.S. affiliate activity in China do not indicate an unusual degree

of “China aversion” on the part of U.S. investing firms. Rather, it reflects the fact that

most U.S. affiliate activity takes place in countries that are large, that are geographically

proximate to the United States, that have low levels of corruption, and that are wealthy.

Controlling for distance, GDP, tax rates, corruption, and GDP per capita, U.S. MNE

activity in China and the extent to which U.S. affiliates in China sell goods to the U.S.

and other countries besides China is neither especially low, nor especially high. Rapid

growth in Chinese aggregate GDP and income per capita is likely to motivate U.S. firms


                                                                                               21
to continue to expand the base of their operations in China. But given the existing scale

of U.S. activity elsewhere, the relative size of affiliate activity in China is likely to remain

modest for some time to come.

        Despite widespread interest in the possible emergence of China as a center of

technological innovation, U.S. affiliates conduct relatively little R&D in the country, and

affiliate activity in technology-intensive industries appears to remain quite dependent on

the supporting activities of the parent firm. China’s ability to innovate, as evidenced by

numbers of U.S. patents with at least one China-based inventor, remains well behind the

much more developed capabilities of other East Asian countries like Japan, Taiwan, and

South Korea. Rapid growth of R&D and invention proceeds in China, but from an

extremely small base. The picture traced out by rapid changes in the structure of Chinese

exports of an emerging technological superpower belies a more modest reality. China’s

exports of high-technology goods are still quite dependent on imported components,

technology, and expertise. Despite impressive progress and spectacular growth in human

capital, China’s transition to status as a significant net exporter of innovative goods and

services almost certainly lies many years in the future.

This table presents results of specifications explaining measures of 2004 affiliate sales aggregated to the country level. The dependant variable in the specifications presented in columns (1)-(4) is the log of affiliate
sales outside of the host country, and it is the share of affiliate sales to countries other than the host country and the US and the share of affiliate sales to the US in the specifications (5)-(8) and (9)-(12). Sales are
measured in thousands of US dollars. The China Dummy is equal to one for China and zero for other countries. The Log of Distance is the log of the distance between US and affiliate host country capital cities
measured in miles. The Log of GDP and the Log of GDP per Capita measure host country gross domestic product and gross domestic product per capita, and these variables are drawn from the World Bank's World
Development Indicators. The Country Tax Rate is a measure of the median effective corporate tax rate paid by US multinationals in a host country. The Corruption Index is an index of corruption that ranges from 0 to
6, with lower numbers indicating higher levels of corruption, and it is taken from the ICRG political risk data. Heteroskedasticity-consistent standard errors are presented in parentheses.
