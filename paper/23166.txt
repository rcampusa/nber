                                         ABSTRACT

In response to unsustainable growth in health care spending, there is enormous interest in
reforming the payment system to “pay for quality instead of quantity.” While quality measures
are crucial to such reforms, they face major criticisms largely over the potential failure of risk
adjustment to overcome endogeneity concerns. In this paper we implement a methodology for
estimating the causal relationship between hospital quality measures and patient outcomes. To
compare similar patients across hospitals in the same market, we xploit ambulance company
preferences as an instrument for patient assignment. We find that a variety of measures used by
insurers to measure provider quality are successful: assignment to a higher-scoring hospital
results in better patient outcomes. We estimate that a two-standard deviation improvement in a
composite quality measure based on existing data collected by CMS is causally associated with
reductions in readmissions and mortality of roughly 15%.

1    Introduction

There is considerable interest in improving the quality and efficiency of health care in the United
States. This interest is motivated in part by influential research demonstrating widespread geographic
variation in treatment intensity that yields little apparent benefit in terms of patient health outcomes
(Fisher, Bynum, and Skinner 2009; Fisher et al. 2003a; Fisher et al. 2003b; Chandra and Skinner
2011). At the same time, a parallel body of research has documented consistent gaps between the
quality of care patients receive and what the medical system could provide if it were productively
efficient and operating at its full potential (Chandra and Staiger 2007; McGlynn et al. 2003).

     The contention that the U.S. health care system simultaneously provides too much low-value
care and too little high-quality care lies at the heart of many delivery-system reform initiatives. A
central focus of such initiatives is the creation of more direct linkages between provider reimbursement
and measures of quality. The Medicare Hospital Readmission Reduction Program (HRRP), for
example, penalizes hospitals with above-average 30-day readmission rates for certain conditions
(Desai et al. 2016; Berenson, Paulus, and Kalman 2012). Another example is the Hospital Value-
Based Purchasing Program (HVBP), which explicitly ties financial incentives to hospital quality
performance (Chen et al. 2016; Das et al. 2016).

     Measures of hospital quality remain highly controversial despite their increasingly widespread
use (Lilford and Pronovost 2010; Austin et al. 2015; Gestel et al. 2012; Shahian et al. 2012). A
primary concern is the potential inadequacy of risk adjustment to control for patient selection (also
known as referral bias). Patients who are in the poorest health may be referred to the hospitals
that are of the highest quality, potentially biasing performance assessments and comparisons across
hospitals.

     Efforts to address this concern through risk adjustment face three challenges. The first is the
weak explanatory power of observable variables for health outcomes. The second is that missing or
unrecorded data may also be correlated with underlying quality, which could compromise efforts
to profile hospital performace and make quality comparisons across hospitals (Ash et al. 2012;
Shahian and Normand 2008). Third, risk-adjustment is often made using diagnoses recorded in
billing claims. Critically, these recorded diagnoses may capture both underlying patient health as
well as the endogenous influence of reimbursement system incentives on coding practices (Song et al.
2010). All of these concerns place a premium on adjudicating common measures of quality based on


                                                   2
comparisons of outcomes among patients exogenously assigned to hospitals.

       In this paper we develop an instrumental variables (IV) framework based on earlier work
that aims to purge patient selection to different hospitals (Doyle et al. 2015).1 We do so by
leveraging ambulance company referral patterns as an instrument for hospital assignment. Ambulance
companies are exogenously assigned to emergency patients based on availability at the time of the
emergency. In many cases ambulances take patients to a nearby hospital, but there is often a choice
made among the set of nearby hospitals. As we have shown in previous work, this means that in
some areas, otherwise identical patients can end up in hospitals with very different characteristics
depending on which ambulance company is called upon to transport them (Doyle et al. 2015).

       We use this ambulance referral framework to test whether patients treated at hospitals that
score well on widely-used quality measures achieve better outcomes for patients whose hospital
assignment is plausibly exogenous. Our approach provides a compelling lens through which we
can evaluate hospital performance measures, at least for emergency care subject to the type of
variation we can use to control for patient selection (our sample of emergency conditions amounts
to approximately one-quarter of inpatient care for Medicare patients nationwide).2

       Our primary analyses consider four composite measures constructed to capture different and
commonly-measured dimensions of quality: (1) process measures quantifying the frequency with
which hospitals provide services that are considered effective in improving patient outcomes; (2)
risk-adjusted patient satisfaction scores from patient surveys, which are increasingly used by insurers
to “pay for quality”; (3) risk-standardized 30-day readmission rates among all discharged patients;
and (4) risk-standardized 30-day mortality rates among all admitted patients. For each domain, we
estimate how assignment to hospitals that score well on these various measures affects both patient
readmission and mortality outcomes.

       Using our IV strategy we find that each of these measures used by the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services (CMS) is related to patient outcomes in important ways. First, hospitals
with higher process measures of quality have lower long-term mortality for the marginal patient.
Second, hospitals with lower patient satisfaction scores have higher odds of readmission and death.
   1
     This is akin to the education literature that seeks to substantiate whether or not controversial quality measures
predict better outcomes (e.g. Chetty, Friedman, and Rockoff (2014)).
   2
     In contemporaneous work, Hull (2016) develops a model with a more ambitious goal to not just demonstrate that
the widely used CMS mortality measure has a causal relationship with quality, but to build a better quality measure.
We discuss his work at more length below.




                                                          3
Third, we find a strong and significant positive effect of hospital readmission rates on the odds of
readmission, and an even stronger positive effect of hospital mortality rates on the odds of mortality.
Our findings suggest that, even correcting for patient selection, the outcome measures utilized in
value-based payment reform efforts by CMS and other payors are useful proxies for hospital quality.

     Our framework also allows us to asses the issue of “competing risks” that may occur when an
outcome like mortality precludes other outcomes such as readmission. For example, if hospitals have
high readmission rates in part due to those hospitals achieving lower mortality (or more troubling,
achieve lower readmission rates in part by having high levels of mortality), then systems that
reimburse on one or the other could be at odds with each other. Among our ambulance cases we
find modest, though statistically insignificant, evidence of competing risks.

     To summarize the magnitude of our findings, we use our regression estimates to create an
overall hospital quality measure that incorporates all of the individual indicators included in the
analysis, weighted by the relative association between that quality indicator and a given patient
outcome. We find that a two standard deviation improvement in this composite readmission quality
is associated with a 3.4% reduction in the odds of readmission, which is almost 20% of the mean.
We also find that a two standard deviation improvement in composite mortality quality is associated
with a 3.2 to 5.4 percentage point (20% to 14% compared to the mean) decrease in the odds of
death over 30 days and 1 year, respectively.

     We conclude that the measures used today by CMS to reimburse and rate hospitals on their
quality are reliable and valid indicators of hospital quality, not only for patients treated for the
conditions they measure but for other types of emergency care. This is encouraging as reformers
move forward to tie reimbursement to these measures. And our estimates can be useful in assessing
the magnitude of the relationship between these indicators and outcomes that can be used by
policy-makers to set reimbursement levels.

     The remainder of this paper proceeds as follows. The next section provides relevant institutional
background on hospital quality reporting in the U.S., as well as a review of the literature on the
relationship between quality report cards and patient outcomes. We then motivate our identification
strategy and lay out the key structural equations we seek to estimate. Following that, we discuss the
data sources and quality measures we constructed and used. We then present the results and then
conclude with a discussion of the implications of our findings for hospital reimbursement policy.

2     Background: Approaches to Measuring Hospital Quality

The measures of hospital quality we consider are defined across three primary dimensions: process
measures of timely and effective care, self-reported patient experience of care measures, and risk-
standardized rates of patient outcomes. We discuss the relevant details of quality measurement
below.


2.1      Process Measures

Process quality measures quantify the rate at which hospitals provide timely and effective care.
In this context, effective care constitutes activities with sufficient clinical evidence linking that
care to improved patient outcomes. The percentage of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients
administered aspirin upon arrival, for example, has long been used to assess whether hospitals
regularly incorporate high-value, evidence-based care.

      The number of process measures used in hospital report cards has grown considerably in recent
years. These measures are a key component of the CMS and National Quality Forum’s Hospital
Compare program, the Leapfrog Group, and the U.S. News and World Report’s annual hospital
rankings. The number of process measures reported on Hospital Compare, for example, has risen
from 20 in 2005 (the first year of public reporting) to over 40 by 2014.

      While the number of process quality measures has increased over time, so too has observed
hospital performance. For example, Figure 1 plots the distribution in each year of our composite
process quality measure (described below) between 2005 and 2012. This figure summarizes, for
a consistent set of 3,027 hospitals, how their performance on a fixed set of 13 measures evolved
over an eight-year period (the specific process measures are listed in Table A1). As can be seen in
the figure, in the early years of public reporting there was wide variation in performance. These
hospitals collectively performed better over time, as evidenced by the fact that the distribution of
scores compresses and shifts towards 1 (the highest possible score). By 2015 the average score was
97.8 (out of a maximum of 100), compared to a mean of 73.2 among the same hospitals in 2005.
The amount of variance among hospitals similarly declined, with the standard deviation declining
from 10.4 in 2005 to 2.4 in 2015. Figure 1 makes clear that some measures of quality will naturally
become less relevant when little variation remains after nearly all hospitals achieve high scores,
although laggards may reveal themselves to be particularly low quality.

                                                 5
2.2    Patient Experience Measures

Measures of patient experience are captured by the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare
Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey. HCAHPS surveys are administered to a sample of
patients between 48 hours to 6 weeks after discharge. The survey covers multiple aspects of patient
experience, ranging from the cleanliness of facilities, the effectiveness of pain management, and how
well physicians, nurses, and other hospital staff communicated with the patient.

      Hospital-specific scores on 11 patient experience domains, including an overall summary score,
are adjusted for the mode of the survey (e.g., phone-only or in-person) and are risk-adjusted for
patient characteristics including age, education, self-reported health, source of admission, primary
language, and hospital service line used (e.g., surgical vs. medical). These risk-adjusted scores are
reported individually on the Hospital Compare website, and more recently a “Five Star” ranking is
constructed based on a composite average of hospital HCAHPS performance.


2.3    Outcome Measures

Outcome quality measures compare the observed number of patients who experience a given outcome
(e.g., mortality or readmission within a 30 days) to the number expected to experience the outcome
based on a national risk model (Ash et al. 2012). That is, these measures ask: is the case-mix-
adjusted number of patients who experience the outcome in a given hospital consistent with what
would be expected in a hypothetical hospital with the same patient case mix and with average
quality?

      This “indirect standardization” approach is used to construct hospital report cards by CMS
and by other organizations such as U.S. News and World Report. Typically, the basis for these
measures is a logistic regression model that includes patient-level measures of clinical acuity (e.g.,
past diagnoses and comorbidities as recorded in billing claims), demographics (e.g., age, gender) and
a hospital-specific random effect that is assumed to be drawn from a known (normal) probability
distribution. Some important patient-level attributes (e.g., race, ethnicity and socio-economic
status) are deliberately excluded from risk adjustment so that the risk-standardized measures do
not condition out important racial or socio-economic disparities in care across facilities.3
  3
    Sensitivity analyses based on comparing outcome rates to hospitals that treat large numbers of
Medicaid patients and African American patients yield a similar range of performance relative to
other hospitals.    See, for example https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-


                                                   6
        More formally, define as a binary indicator of whether patient treated at hospital experienced
the outcome, and define as a vector of patient-level characteristics. The current CMS model assumes
the following:

  (1)
                                        Yih |–h , —, xih ≥ Bernoulli(–h + —xih )
                                                        ind



  (2)
                                                   –h |µ, ‡ 2 ≥ N (µ, ‡ 2 )
                                                               iid



Based on this model, the risk-standardized rate for hospital h (RSRh ) is estimated as

  (3)                                            qnh                           2
                                                  i=1 E(Yih |–h , µ, —, xih , ‡ )
                                    RSRh (xih ) = q                               Ȳ
                                                          i=1 E(Yih |µ, —, xih , ‡   )
                                                    nh                       2


where Ȳ is the national average outcome and nh is the number of patients treated in hospital h
(Ash et al. 2012).

        In practice, equation (1) is estimated as a hierarchical Bayes logistic regression model that
includes a hospital random effect (–h ). The underlying patient-level data and the estimated model
parameters (ˆ        ˆ ‡
            –h , µ̂, —, ˆ 2 ) are used to construct predicted values, which are then fed into equation
(3) to obtain the risk-standardized rate for each hospital.4


2.4      Concern: Risk-Adjustment is Insufficient

As noted in the introduction, a common issue with outcome measurement is a concern that a
selection-on-observables assumption inherent in risk adjustment is highly controversial. Further,
outcomes are assumed independent of hospital-level attributes conditional on observable patient
characteristics, xih in Equation 1 above. That is, the random effects model assumes that the
patient-level risk adjustors capture the relevant clinical characteristics such that other hospital level
Instruments/HospitalQualityInits/Downloads/MedicareHospitalQualityChartbook2012.pdf (pp. 23-36).
    4
      The numerator in equation (3) is simply the sum of predicted values for each patient in the hospital, where the
predicted values are based on observed patient values, µ̂, —,ˆ and the estimated hospital random effect (–    ˆ h ). The
denominator is similarly estimated as the sum of patient-level predictions, but only µ̂ – the estimated national mean
of –
   ˆ h – is used. This measure is then multiplied by Ȳ to place the risk standardized measure on the same scale as
the outcome. In effect, outcome-based quality assessments are determined primarily by how much each hospital’s
estimated random effect (–ˆ h ) deviates from µ̂. The hypothetical reference hospital in the denominator of equation (3)
has the same patient case-mix as the hospital in question, however it has average quality, as reflected by the use of
only µ̂ to summarize hospital-level factors. In this way each hospital is evaluated against a hypothetical reference
hospital with an identical case-mix and with average quality.


                                                           7
attributes (e.g., patient volume, teaching status, etc.) are not independent predictors of patient
outcomes. This is a strong assumption, particularly in light of the large medical and health services
literature linking hospital attributes such as volume to improved patient outcomes (Birkmeyer et al.
2002; Daley 2002; Dudley et al. 2000; Halm, Lee, and Chassin 2002; Hughes, Hunt, and Luft 1987;
Luft, Hunt, and Maerki 1987; Shahian and Normand 2003); the relatively limited number of patient
characteristics available in billing data; the deliberate exclusion from the model (on substantive
grounds) of certain important confounders like race and socio-economic status; and growing evidence
on the endogeneity of patient-level diagnoses as recorded hospital billing codes (Song et al. 2010).


2.5    Concern: Inter-Hospital Comparisons Are Inappropriate

A more subtle concern with indirect standardization is that an individual hospital’s observed
performance is compared to the predicted performance for a hypothetical hospital with average
quality and with the same patient case mix. Thus, performance comparisons between two hospitals
are complicated by the fact that those hospitals may not treat the same profile of patients (Shahian
and Normand 2008).

      For example, suppose there are two types of patients, healthy and sick, and that two hospitals
(A and B) treat both types of patients at the same level of quality, with 5% of healthy patients
readmitted and 30% of sick patients readmitted. Suppose further that the national risk adjustment
model is unbiased and that, on average, healthy patients are expected to be readmitted 5% of the
time while sick patients are expected to be readmitted 20% of the time. In other words, both A and
B treat healthy patients as expected but are of equally poor quality when treating sick patients.

      In the above scenario, if hospital A and B had the same patient case mix (e.g., equal proportions
of healthy and sick patients) they would be profiled with identical risk-standardized readmission
rates. But if their case mix were different (e.g., if Hospital A treated predominantly healthy
patients and Hospital B treated predominantly sick patients) then Hospital B would receive a higher
risk-standardized readmission rate simply because it treats more sick patients. Moreover, it would
be inappropriate to compare A vs. B and conclude that hospital B was of poorer quality; had
patients been randomly assigned to A vs. B we would find no evidence of a difference in patient-level
readmission outcomes between the two.

      In short, the indirect standardization method does not, by construction, facilitate inter-hopsital


                                                   8
comparisons, despite the fact that such comparisons are consistently made by even seasoned experts,
and are even facilitated by the CMS website entitled “Hospital Compare” (Ash et al. 2012). Thus,
an open question is whether outcome rates can also be used to guide patient choice of the “best”
hospital among local options. Fortunately, this is a question our instrumental variables approach
can answer because we observe patients who are effectively randomly assigned to different hospitals
with varying quality and case mix. That is, our framework can assess whether high performing
hospitals achieve better outcomes for the marginal patient who is effectively randomized to a local
hospital.



3     Empirical Strategy

3.1    Ambulance Referral Patterns

Our empirical approach builds on our earlier work that relies on plausibly exogenous sources of
hospital assignment determined by ambulance company preferences for certain hospitals (Doyle
et al. 2015). The key ingredient is the recognition that the locus of treatment for emergency
hospitalizations is, to a large extent, determined by pre-hospital factors, including ambulance
transport decisions and patient location. Critically, areas are often served by multiple ambulance
companies, and the ambulance company assignment is effectively random.

      Rotational assignment of competing ambulances services–as well as direct competition between
simultaneously dispatched competitors–is increasingly common in the U.S. In some communities, the
opportunity for ambulance transport is broadcast to multiple companies and whichever arrives there
first gets the business. Similarly, in most cities private ambulance companies work in conjunction
with fire departments to provide Emergency Medical Services (EMS) (Chiang, David, and Housman
2006; Johnson 2001; Ragone 2012).

      We are aware of no systematic evidence on the basis for rotational assignment of ambulances.
To understand the dispatch process, in Doyle et al. (2015) we conducted a survey of 30 cities with
more than one ambulance company serving the area in our Medicare data. The survey revealed that
patients can be transported by different companies for two main reasons. First, in communities
served by multiple ambulance services, 911 systems often use software that assigns units based on a
rotational dispatch mechanism; alternatively, they may position ambulances throughout an area and


                                                 9
dispatch whichever ambulance is closest, then reshuffle the other available units to respond to the
next call. Second, in areas with a single ambulance company, neighboring companies provide service
when the principal ambulance units are busy under so-called “mutual aid” agreements. Within a
small area, then, the variation in the ambulance dispatched is either due to rotational assignment or
one of the ambulance companies being engaged on another 911 call. Both sources appear plausibly
exogenous with respect to the underlying health of a given patient.

       Previous case studies suggest that these ambulances have preferences about which hospital
to choose. For example, Skura (2001) studied ambulance assignment in the wake of a new system
of competition between public and private ambulances in New York City. He found that patients
living in the same ZIP code as public Health and Hospital Corporation (HHC) hospitals were less
than half as likely to be taken there when assigned a private, non-profit ambulance (29%) compared
to when the dispatch system assigned them to an FDNY ambulance (64%). In most cases, the
private ambulances were operated by non-profit hospitals and stationed near or even within those
facilities, so they tended to take their patients to their affiliated hospitals.

       To operationalize ambulance preferences, we calculate a set of instrumental variables based on
the characteristics of hospitals where each ambulance company takes other patients—a leave-out
mean approach that helps avoid weak instrument concerns similar to jackknife instrumental variable
estimators (Stock, Wright, and Yogo 2012). For patient i assigned to ambulance a(i), we calculate
the average hospital measure (e.g., the readmission rate) among the patients in our analysis sample
for each ambulance company:

 (4)
                                                                Na(i)≠1
                                                         1       ÿ
                                        Za(i) =                           Hj
                                                  Na(i)≠1 ≠ 1    j”=i

       This measure is essentially the ambulance company fixed effect in a model for Hj in a model
that leaves out patient i . Below, we consider values for Hj that include a variety of quality measures,
such as the hospital’s publicly reported 30-day readmission rate, its 30-day mortality rate or a
composite process measure.

We use this instrument to estimate the first-stage relationship between hospital quality H and the
instrument, Z: the hospital measure associated with the ambulance assigned to patient i with
principal diagnosis d(i) transported from from an origin in ZIP code z(i) in year t(i):

                         Hi = –0 + –1 Za(i) + –2 Xi + –3 Ai + “d(i) + ◊z(i) + ⁄t(i) + ‹i

        where Xi is a vector of patient controls including age, race, and sex, and indicators for 17
common comorbidities controlled for in the CMS quality scores; Ai represents a vector of ambulance
characteristics that summarise the level and scope of treatment provided in the ambulance; indicators
for distance traveled in miles; whether the transport utilized Advanced Life Support (e.g., paramedic)
capabilities; whether the transport was coded as emergency transport; and whether the ambulance
was paid through the outpatient system rather than the carrier system. We cluster standard errors
at the Hospital Service Area (HSA) level, as each local market may have its own assignment rules.5

        We also include a full set of controls for principal diagnosis, year and ZIP code ◊ patient
origin fixed effects.6 This regression, in other words, compares individuals who are transported
from similar origins (e.g., at home, in a nursing home, or at the scene of an accident or illness) and
who reside in the same ZIP code, but who are picked up by ambulance companies with different
“preferences” across hospitals with different quality scores. A positive coefficient –1 would indicate
that ambulance company “preferences” are correlated with where the patient actually is admitted.

        Our main regression of interest is the relationship between hospital quality on outcomes such
as mortality, M , for patient i:

  (6)
                           Mi = —0 + —1 Hi + —2 Xi + —3 Ai + “d(i) + ◊z(i) + ⁄t(i) + ‘i

        For this regression we consider various patient outcomes, such as whether they are readmitted
to another acute care hospital facility within 30 days of discharge, or whether they died within 30
days or one year of admission. Finally, since patient selection is likely to confound this structural
model, we estimate equation (6) using two-stage least squares, with the instrument defined as above.
   5
     As a robustness check we also cluster standard errors at the ambulance company level, which yields standard
errors that are roughly 20% smaller than our preferred HSA-based clustering strategy.
   6
     The principal diagnosis is the 3-digit ICD-9-CM diagnosis code, as shown in Appendix Table A2.



                                                      11
       Doyle et al. (2015) discusses at length potential limitations with this strategy and various
specification checks that begin to address them. In particular, that study finds that the results are
highly robust to controls for both patient characteristics and the characteristics of pre-hospital care
in the ambulance; that selection into the inpatient data from the full ambulance transport sample is
not correlated with observable ambulance company characteristics, that the impact of ambulance
assignment on health outcomes occurs not on the first day but over longer horizons, which suggests
that different (unobserved) levels of care in the ambulance are not driving outcome differences; and
that the results are robust to the level of heterogeneity in patient characteristics across ZIP codes,
which is inconsistent with potential locational bias in ambulance assignment within a ZIP.

       As noted, the goal of this empirical strategy is to develop a causal framework through which
we can assess the validity of the widely used CMS quality measures. In contemporaneous work, Hull
(2016) builds on the ambulance-instrument approach to address a more ambitious goal: revising the
quality measure towards one which more accurately reflects patient outcomes. In particular, the
paper uses the closest ambulance company office location for each hospital as a proxy for hospital
affiliation to arrive at one instrument for each of the 2,357 hospitals in the estimation sample.
Given the difficulty of precisely estimating quality at each hospital, Hull develops a valuable new
methodology that uses a Roy model to investigate nonlinear selection on gains (e.g. patients are
often sorted to hospitals based on their expected improvement in outcomes such as sending patients
to trauma centers).7 To overcome precision concerns that arise from estimating thousands of effects
using instruments based on thousands of ambulance companies, the semi-parametric approach
developed in the paper shrinks the raw estimates based on the quasi-experimental variation due
to ambulance-company assignment using distributional assumptions on the latent quality variable,
as well as incorporating estimates generated with the more precisely estimated but likely biased
estimates that come from more traditional random-effects models to result in a lower mean squared
prediction error. This shrinkage estimator results in posterior quality estimates for each hospital.

       Thus, we view Hull’s work as complementary to our approach. If the goal is to demonstrate
convincingly that existing CMS quality measures causally measure hospital quality, then our
approach is a minimally structural approach to doing so; as emphasized earlier, this is akin to
important work in education evaluating existing teacher quality measures. If the goal is to improve
   7
    We can also estimate nonlinear relationship between the quality measure and subsequent outcomes as in Doyle
(2012), but such estimates are not particularly precisely estimated. Hull’s important insight is that a parametric
structure on the problem can help resolve this imprecision problem.



                                                       12
on the CMS measure, given the imprecision in the data, then more structure must be imposed,
and Hull provides an innovative way of doing so. In practice, Hull’s new quality measure is highly
correlated with the CMS measure (0.68 correlation within Health Service Areas), but there are
major differences in magnitudes. This combined set of results confirms that CMS quality measures
are predictive, and that they can be improved. As one step towards that goal, we consider adding
other quality measures to the mix in our empirical work below.



4     Data

4.1    Medicare Claims Data

Our primary source of patient-level data are Medicare claims between 2008-2012: the time period
where we observe the CMS quality measures under investigation. We use these data to identify
an uncensored sample of patients admitted to an acute care hospital after being transported by
ambulance to the emergency department.

      CMS reimburses ambulance companies using two systems captured by the Carrier file and the
Outpatient claims file. We can access Carrier and outpatient claims for a 20% random sample of
beneficiaries. Most ambulance claims are paid via the Carrier claims, and we increase our sample by
6% by including the outpatient claims—claims that are affiliated with a hospital or other facility file.
We link each ambulance patient’s claims to her inpatient claims in the Medicare Provider Analysis
and Review (MEDPAR) files, which records pertinent information on date of admission, primary
and secondary diagnoses, and procedures performed. Diagnoses and procedures recorded in each
patient’s claims for the year prior to (but not including) the ambulance admission are then mapped
to Hierarchical Condition Codes (HCC) to construct a set of comorbidity measures. We also link
each ambulance patient to a Medicare denominator file that contains other information on age, race,
and gender. Finally, the claims data also include the ZIP code of the beneficiary, where official
correspondence is sent; in principle, this could differ from the patient’s home ZIP code. In addition,
vital statistics data that record when a patient dies are linked to these claims, which also allow us
to measure mortality at different timeframes, such as 30 days or one year.




                                                  13
4.2    Sample Selection

We rely on two primary analytic samples. The primary sample consists of patients admitted to the
hospital after an ambulance transport to the emergency room with 29 “non-disretionary” conditions.
As described in Doyle et al. (2015), these are conditions where selection into the health care system
is largely unavoidable (i.e., femur fracture, poisoning and stroke). Discretionary admissions see a
marked decline on the weekend, but particularly serious emergencies do not. Following Dobkin
(2003) and Card, Dobkin, and Maestas (2007), diagnoses whose weekend admission rates are closest
to 2/7ths reflect a lack of discretion as to the timing of the hospital admission. Using our Medicare
sample, we chose a cutoff of all conditions with a weekend admission rate that was as close or closer
to 2/7ths as hip fracture, a condition commonly thought to require immediate care.

      An advantage of this sample is that it provides the broadest possible sample to which our key
instrument is well matched; the disadvantage is that it extends far beyond the three conditions
that are embedded in the CMS quality measures we examine, which are measured for patients
with diagnoses of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia (PN) or heart failure (HF). We
therefore also extend our results to a second sample: ambulance-transported patients admitted via
the emergency department for these three conditions.

      For this three-condition sample, we include all patients who had not been admitted for any
of these within the previous 365 days. We also exclude patients who are 100 miles or more from
their residential ZIP code to focus on emergency patients who are close to home at the time of their
episode. Finally, our sample exclusion criteria removed patients treated at hospitals with fewer than
30 episodes (in the 20% Medicare files), as well as patients whose ambulance company transported
30 or fewer patients over the study period. These criteria resulted in 546,700 patient episodes for
the primary sample and 171,246 patients for the three-condition sample. In addition, for regressions
that consider one-year mortality outcomes we utilize the sub-sample of 451,503 non-discretionary
patients and 142,424 CMS condition patients with uncensored one-year outcomes (i.e., those treated
between 2008-2011).

      Appendix Table A2 shows the distribution of admissions across these diagnostic categories for
the primary sample. These conditions represent 39% of the hospital admissions via the emergency
room, 61% of which arrived by ambulance. Given that roughly 60% of all Medicare admissions
originate in the emergency room, these condiditions constitute approximately 23% of all hospital


                                                 14
care for Medicare patients in the U.S. Moreover these conditions are particularly expensive, such as
sepsis – the most costly inpatient condition in the United States.

      The reliance on ambulance transports allows us to focus on patients who are less likely to
decide whether or not to go to the hospital. This sample is slightly older, and has a higher 365-day
mortality rate (37%) compared to all Medicare patients who enter the hospital via the emergency
room (20%). These are relatively severe health shocks, and the estimates of the effects of hospital
types on mortality apply to these types of episodes, so the applicability of our results to less emergent
hospitalizations may be limited; we discuss this point further in the conclusion.


4.3    Hospital Quality Measures

Our primary source for hospital quality measures is archived Hospital Compare data from CMS.
Hospital Compare began publicly reporting process measures in 2005, while 30-day mortality
measures and patient satisfaction scores were added in 2008 and the 30-day readmission measures
were added in 2009.

      Reported process measures generally have a one year time lag, while HCAHPS scores are
typically reported after a one- to two-year lag. Risk-standardized readmission and mortality outcome
rates are based on claims from a pooled 3-year sample of fee-for-service Medicare and Veterans
Health Administration patients, with a one year lag between the most recent claims year used and
the public reporting date. Thus, public reporting of hospital quality does not capture concurrent
quality, but rather the quality of care received by patients treated within (approximately) 4 years
prior to the reporting date.

      The use of a lagged measure ensures that our quality measures are “leave out” with respect to
the patient associate with that regression observation. That is, when we consider the impact of
standardized hospital mortality rates on the odds that patient X dies, we are not including patient
X him/herself in the calculation.

      Our composite process score is based on the pooled average of 13 individual measures of
timely and effective care for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), pneumonia (PN), and heart failure
(HF) patients (see Appendix Table A1) (Yasaitis et al. 2009). Similarly, the 30-day mortality and
readmission composite measures are based on the average mortality/readmission rates for AMI, PN
and HF patients.


                                                   15
      For all of our regressions the quality measures enter as a continuous measure that has been
demeaned and standardized by 2 standard deviations to facilitate interpretation and comparison
across measures. Thus, each has an overall mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 0.5. This
standardization procedure is designed so that the coefficients can be interpreted as if they were
estimated on a binary low vs. high “quality” measure. For context, the main results provide both
the unstandardized mean and standard deviation for each composite measure.


4.4    Outcome Measures for Assessing Validity of Quality Measures

In order to assess the validity of quality measures, we want to measure their impact on welfare-
relevant outcomes. In this paper, we consider two such outcomes. The first is the rate of hospital
readmissions over the 30 days after the initial admission. This is a key outcome since hospital
readmissions are often viewed as a signal of inefficiencies in the delivery of hospital care. As a result,
CMS introduced the readmissions penalty as part of the Affordable Care Act, as noted earlier.
The 30-day patient readmission outcomes we consider are defined as unplanned readmission to any
hospital within 30 days of live discharge from the indexing visit.

      The second outcome is mortality. While CMS and other payers do not yet directly reimburse
providers based on patient mortality rates alone, public reporting on mortality is a common feature
of hospital quality report cards. These measures typically use mortality within 30 days of hospital
admissions. A disadvantage of this approach, however, is that hospital actions can impact mortality
over shorter time horizons. In particular, Maxwell et al. (2014) show that there is a discontinuity in
patient mortality at 30 days for cardiac surgery, suggesting the possibility of hospital manipulation
of morality at shorter horizons. For this reason, we show mortality results at 30 days but also focus
on a longer horizon, assessing the impact of quality on mortality over the first year post-admission.



5     Do CMS Quality Measures Actually Measure Quality?

5.1    Balance

To evaluate the relationship between measured hospital performance and patient outcomes we
rely on an instrumental variables approach that assumes patients are quasi-randomly assigned to
ambulances in an emergency. If this assumption holds then our empirical approach should purge


                                                   16
endogeneity stemming from patient-level selection into different hospitals. To test whether this is
plausible along observable dimensions, Table 1 shows means of patient-level demographic and health
measures across those whose ambulances tend to transport patients to hospitals with high versus
low 30-day mortality rates: a measure that we emphasize in our results below. In particular, the
data are divided into quartiles based on the distribution of the ambulance instrument for 30-day
mortality after it has been de-meaned at the ZIP code level.

      The table shows that our sample is remarkably balanced on observable demographic and health
characteristics. The age distribution of patients whose ambulances are more likely to take patients
to hospitals across these quartiles is nearly identical, with 12.5 to 12.6% of patients aged 70-74 for
example. Likewise, patients in the lowest quartile are transported by ambulance an average of 6.9
miles, versus 7.1 miles in the highest quartile. Balance is similar even across measured dimensions
of health as captured by our comorbidity measures: 28.2% of patients in the lowest quartile have
an indicator of hypertension in their Medicare claims for the previous year – the same percentage
with hypertension in the highest quartile. Similar results are found across quartiles of an inpatient
reimbursement-based instrument, as documented in Doyle et al. (2015).


5.2    Quality Measures and Patient Outcomes – OLS Correlations

We begin, in Table 2, by showing the results for OLS estimates of the CMS quality measures. The
OLS results show correlations between the composite quality measures and the outcomes of interest,
focusing separately on 30-day readmissions, 30-day mortality, and one-year mortality. The means
of the key dependent variables, as reported in the Table note, are 15.0% for 30-day readmission,
17.0% for 30-day mortality, and 37.2% for one year mortality. The first column shows the (raw)
means and standard deviation of each composite quality measure. Each cell represents a separate
regression; e.g. the first row of the second column shows the OLS relationship between the quality
process score and 30-day readmission.

      We find that the CMS process measure of quality is uncorrelated with readmission rates, and
with 30 day mortality. There is a modest correlation with one-year mortality rates, with a two
standard-deviation increase in the process score (i.e., a change of 10.2 points) associated with a 0.4
percentage point decline in one-year mortality, which is only about 1% of the mean.

      The next row of Table 2 shows the findings for composite patient experience score. Patients


                                                 17
treated in high-performing hospitals have a marginally lower (and statistically signficant) likelihood
of readmission within 30-days. They exhibit no differences in 30-day mortality outcomes, but show
a small and significant impact on one-year mortality.

      The next two rows focus on composite performance scores based on 30-day readmission and
mortality rates. Once again, there is no mechanical relationship between these measures and the
associated outcomes, as they are leave out means of the relevant measures.

      Here, we find that in OLS there is a stronger positive correlation between the CMS outcomes
measures and patient outcomes in our sample. We find that a two standard deviation increase in the
composite readmission rate (i.e., a difference of 3.0 points) is associated with a 1.5 percentage point
increase in the probability of readmission. Likewise, we find that a two standard deviation increase
(2.6) in the composite 30-day mortality rate at the hospital is associated with a 1.1 percentage point
higher probability of death within 30 days, or more than 6% of baseline value.

      The results in Table 2 suggest modest links between the CMS measures and patient outcomes.
But these results are only correlations. It is possible that the associated relationships merely reflect
patient selection and not true underlying differences in quality. To the extent that hospitals that
have higher quality scores treat patients in worse (unobservable) health, we would expect 2SLS
estimates to be larger in magnitude.


5.3    First Stage

We now turn to showing that ambulance assignment is associated with hospital assignment—our
first stage. Table 3 shows that assignment to an ambulance company that takes other patients to
hospitals with an average risk-adjusted 30-day mortality that is two standardized deviations higher
is strongly linked with patients being treated at higher 30-day mortality hospitals, and the estimate
is similar with and without patient and ambulance controls. We find similarly strong first stage
effects for our other quality measures. The only noticeable difference is a slightly weaker first stage
for the reported process quality measure. All of the estimates are highly statistically significant.8

      The fact that our first stage estimates are less than one is informative of the nature of variation
the estimation strategy is using. For example, when an ambulance company is dispatched to
  8
    The standard error estimates do not correct for the fact that the measure is a leave out mean, although this
should have little impact given the large number of observations per ambulance companies: an average of TK.



                                                      18
help a nearby community through a “mutual aid” agreement, the first-stage estimate implies that
the ambulance company is more likely to transport the patient back to the hospitals where the
ambulance company usually operates, but not at the same rate that it transports patients living
where the company usually operates. This results in a strong positive correlation, but one that is
not one-to-one.


5.4     Quality Measures and Patient Outcomes – 2SLS Estimates

In order to address the potential correlation with patient selection, we turn now to 2SLS estimates
based on our ambulance instrument. The results are shown in Table 4, which parallels Table 2 in
format. Once again, each cell is from a separate regression. Overall, this 2SLS strategy largely
confirms the OLS results, although with point estimates that are larger in magnitude.

      We begin with process measures. For the process quality measure, we continue to find no effect
on readmissions. But we find large impacts on mortality at one year: a two standard deviation
improvement in quality measured along this dimension leads to a 3.8 percentage point (10%)
reduction in one-year mortality.

      For the patient experience measure, we find slightly smaller effects, although still sizeable, for
mortality; at one year, the effect is 2.8 percentage points (8% of the mean). This measure also has
a sizeable and significant impact on readmission probability; a two-standard deviation increase in
patient experience quality leads to a 1.9 percentage point (13%) reduction in the rate of readmission.

      In addition, our 2SLS results show strong effects for the patient outcome rate measures. We find
that hospitals with a high readmission rate are also much more likely to readmit the marginal patient
controlling for patient selection. A two standard deviation increase in the rate of readmissions
(i.e., a difference of 3.0 points on the composite readmission rate scale) leads to a 2.9 percentage
point rise in the odds of 30 day readmission among patients with non-deferrable conditions (19%
compared to the mean).

      We also find that hospitals with a high 30-day mortality rate are much more likely to have
patients die within 30 days of admission (after controlling for patient selection). The effect size is
large with a reduction of 2.1 percentage points compared to a baseline 30-day mortality rate of 17%.
The effect on one-year mortality is only slightly larger, so that it is only about 7% of the baseline
mean.


                                                   19
      To conclude, we continue to find that, in general, the types of quality measures used by CMS
are strongly associated with patient outcomes. Hospitals that perform well on timely and effective
care processes, better patient experience, and lower hospital mortality rates (for other patients) are
associated with a significant and meaningful decline in the odds that randomly assigned patient
dies in the subsequent year. And better patient experience and lower readmission rates (for other
patients) are strongly associated with a lower odds that the randomly assigned patient is readmitted
to a hospital.


5.5    Sensitivity Checks

One possibility is that the 2SLS results in Table 4 suffer from residual confounding, since the
specifications used for the regressions rely on our ambulance framework for identification and do
not include a large array of controls for (potentially endogenous) comorbidity measures. Moreover,
there could be important cross-correlations among the quality measures with, for example, hospitals
with low mortality rates also scoring well on patient experience of care surveys. We investigate the
interdependence of the measures in this section.

      Table 5 considers several sensitivity checks on our results. In the first panel, we add comorbidity
(diagnosis) controls to our regressions to assess sensitivity. By and large, the results are not very
sensitive to these controls, which is consistent with the exogeneity of our ambulance instrument.

      In the second panel, we move from using separate regressions for each quality measure to a
“horse race” framework where we include all of the quality measures together in one regression with
all patient controls. This allows us to account for cross-correlations across quality measures in
interpreting their effects. In fact, we find that the results are remarkably consistent, even conditional
on including the other quality measures.

      In the final panel, we turn to a more limited sample that consists of just the three conditions
that are incorporated into the CMS quality measures themselves. Two of these conditions are
included in our larger non-discretionary conditions sample, while the third, Congestive Heart Failure,
is not considered non-discretionary where we expect our instrument to be most appropriate. That
said, the instrument values are well balanced on observable characteristics this secondary sample,
similar to the balance achieved in the main sample shown in Table 1.

      For this sample, we find results that are very similar, albeit generally larger, than for the 29


                                                   20
non-discretionary conditions sample. The difference is particularly striking for the effect of patient
experience on mortality, where the effects more than double from the larger sample results. This
may reflect a closer correspondence between the quality measures and the sample or the change in
conditions studied, although the standard errors are larger as well.


5.6    Competing Risks

One important question about quality measurement is possible bias arising from competing risks
concerns. For example, suppose that hospitals that perform well on readmissions do so by raising
mortality risk. This would suggest that a lower readmission rate is not a strong measure of better
hospital outcomes because this may come at the expense of another outcome of even greater
importance. The issue of competing risks therefore poses yet another challenge to the usefulness of
quality measures.

      Reviewing Tables 4 and 5, we find modest, but not consistent, evidence for competing risks. In
no specifications do we find statistically significant evidence that admission to a hospital with a
higher readmission rate leads to lower mortality - the effects are particularly small when focusing
on one year mortality. We do find marginally significant evidence in Table 4 that admission to
a hospital with a higher 30 day mortality rate lowers the odds of readmission, which suggests
competing risks. But this result is not robust to the various changes we make in Table 5. In Panel
C of Table 5 we also find some evidence of competing risks for 30-day readmission outcomes in the
CMS condition sample, with point estimates that offset each other for the 30-day readmission rate
(-2.3 percentage points) and 30-day mortality rate (+2.4 percentage points) composite measures.
However, both of these coefficients are not statistically signficiant. Similarly, we also find partially
offseting, though somewhat noisy, coefficients for the 30-day mortality outcome.


5.7    Composite Quality Measure

Thus far in the paper we have considered a variety of widely-used quality measures. Each of these
measures help explain our readmission and mortality outcomes. Using our 2SLS results we can build
a composite quality index for each outcome based on the four quality measures. More specifically, we
use the coefficients from the horse-race regressions in Panel B of Table 5 to calculate relative weights
and create a weighted average quality measure for each of the three main outcomes of interest:


                                                  21
readmission, 30-day mortality and 1-year mortality. These measures incorporate any competing risk
considerations of the type raised above.

      Table 6 shows the results from using these composite quality measures. We show only “on-
diagonal” estimates because the composites were constructed to create measures most likely to be
related to each particular outcome. Interpretation of the off-diagonal estimates may be misleading,
as the mortality outcome composite, for example, has information on the readmission quality
measure contained within it.

      In the first row we show the results of using our weighted average readmission quality measure.
We find that a two standard deviation increase in this composite [+2.0] leads to 3.4 percentage
point reduction in readmissions, or about 22% of the baseline mean. In the second and third rows,
we show that a mortality composite quality indicator has very large impacts on mortality outcomes.
A two standard deviation increase in the 30 day mortality composite lowers patient mortality by 3.2
percentage points, or about 19% of the mean; a two standard deviation increase in the one-year
mortality composite lowers one-year mortality by 5.4 percentabe points, or 15% of the mean.


5.8    Quality Scores for Different Types of Hospitals

Given that hospital 30-day mortality rates appear informative of quality even after controlling
for patient selection, it becomes important to understand which hospital characteristics are most
associated with high patient quality. In Table 7, we provide an initial exploration of this question
for the sample of 2,116 hospitals in our sample in 2012. In the first panel of the Table, each cell
shows the regression coefficient from a regression of the quality measure listed at the top of each
column on a set of hospital characteristics. In these regressions, the dependent variable is expressed
in terms of standard deviations.

      We first consider whether the hospital is a teaching hospital, defined as having an accredited
residency program. We then include a measure of standardized hospital size based on the number
of beds. Finally, we include ownership type, including dummies for for-profit (i.e., investor-owned)
and public hospitals, relative to the omitted category of non-profit hospitals.

      The results in this top panel show that there are strong associations between these quality
measures and hospital characteristics. Teaching hospitals are more likely to score better on process
measures and mortality outcomes measures; for example, teaching hospitals score 0.43 of one


                                                 22
standard deviation better on process quality, and 0.14 of one standard deviation better on mortality
quality. Larger hospitals have better outcomes on process quality and mortality, but score much
worse on patient experience and 30 day readmission. For-profit hospitals deliver higher process
quality (relative to non-profit hospitals), but score worse on every other quality measure; the effect
is particularly large for patient experience, where for-profit hospitals score two standard deviations
worse than others. Finally, government hospitals score much worse on process and mortality, with
no significant effect on the other quality indicators.



6    Conclusions

The use of quality scores to guide consumer choice or as a central part of a move toward paying
for quality instead of quantity is controversial. Providers take on risk when evaluated in this way,
especially for outcomes that they do not fully control such as readmissions and mortality. A primary
criticism of the scores is that patients differ across hospitals in ways that are difficult to control
using comorbidities and other patient characteristics. Another criticism of readmissions measures is
that higher mortality can improve a hospital’s readmission score, and we would not want to set up
our quality measurements to reward such an outcome.

     We address both of these criticisms using an instrumental variables strategy that controls for
patient selection. We find within this framework that quality scores are very informative. In general,
higher scores on each of the quality metrics that we study are associated with better outcomes along
a variety of dimensions. And we do not find consistent and compelling evidence that competing
risks undo the validity of these measures.

     Overall, our findings suggest that these quality scores may be useful metrics for new payment
models. There are at least two important caveats, however. First, the results here apply to
emergency situations where ambulance transport is involved, though it is worth noting that nearly
60% of inpatient stays in the Medicare program initiate through the ED. The results may be most
appropriately applied to commonly discussed payment models that pay for quality within episodes
of care associated with particular health conditions and events such as those studied here. Second,
once payments are made for quality scores, there is concern that hospitals may game the scores
through patient selection, changes in coding behavior that affect the risk adjustment, or creative
accounting. When such models are put into place, it will be important to emphasize the use of risk


                                                  23
adjusters that are less likely to be gamed and carefully monitor changes in the patient mix as part
of the compensation model.

In Panel A, each cell reports two-stage least squares (2SLS) coefficient estimates for a separate regression. In Panel B,
each column reports 2SLS estimates for a ’horse race’ specificiation that includes all quality measures in a single
regression. In Panel C, each cell reports two-stage least squares (2SLS) coefficient estimates for a separate regression
using a sample of only Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI), Pneumonia (PN) and Heart Failure (HF) patients. All
models include patient demographic, comorbidity and ambulance controls as listed in Table 1, as well as the diagnosis
controls as listed in Table A2. Quality Measures have been demeaned and standardized by 2 standard deviations
so they can be interpreted like binary (low-to-high) indicators. The underlying mean and standard deviation of
each quality measure is provided the first column to facilitate interpretation on the original scale. Outcome means
for non-discretionary condition sample: 30D Readmission = 15.0%, 30D Mortality = 17.0%, 365D Mortality =
37.2%. Sample sizes for non-discretionary condition sample: 546,700 (30-Day outcomes), 451,503 (1-Year Mortality).
Outcome means for CMS condition sample: 30D Readmission = 19.0%, 30D Mortality = 15.8%, 365D Mortality =
41.0%. Sample sizes for CMS condition sample: 171,246 (30-Day outcomes), 142,424 (1-Year Mortality). Standard
errors, clustered at Health Service Area (HSA) level, are reported in parentheses.
