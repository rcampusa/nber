I. Introduction

   In the last decade, discussions of environmental economics and policy have become

increasingly permeated by issues related to technological change. An understanding of the

process of technological change is important for two broad reasons. First, the environmental

impact of social and economic activity is profoundly affected by the rate and direction of

technological change. New technologies may create or facilitate increased pollution, or may

mitigate or replace existing polluting activities. Further, because many environmental problems

and policy responses thereto are evaluated over time horizons of decades or centuries, the

cumulative impact of these technological changes on the severity of environmental problems is

likely to be large. Indeed, uncertainty about the future rate and direction of technological change

is often an important sensitivity in ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù forecasts of the severity of environmental

problems.    In global climate change modeling, for example, different assumptions about

autonomous improvements in energy efficiency are often the single largest source of difference

in predictions about the cost of achieving given policy objectives (Weyant 1993; Energy

Modeling Forum 1996).

   Second, environmental policy interventions themselves create new constraints and incentives

that affect the process of technological change. These induced effects of environmental policy




                                                1
on technology may have profound implications for the normative analysis of policy decisions.

They may have quantitatively important consequences in the context of cost-benefit or cost-

effectiveness analyses of such policies. They may also have broader implications for welfare

analyses, because the process of technological change is characterized by externalities and

market failures with important welfare consequences beyond those associated with

environmental issues.

           Our goals in this chapter are to summarize for environmental economists current thinking

on technological change in the broader economics literature; to survey the growing literature on

the interaction between technology and the environment; and to explore the normative

implications of these analyses.            This is a large task, inevitably requiring unfortunate but

necessary omissions. In particular, we confine ourselves to the relationship between technology

and problems of environmental pollution, leaving aside a large literature on technological change

in agriculture and natural resources more broadly. 1 Because of the significant environmental

implications of fossil fuel combustion, however, we include in our review some of the relevant

literature on technological change and energy use. 2

           Section II provides a brief overview of the general literature on the economics of

technological change. It is intended less as a true survey than as a checklist of issues that the

interested reader can use to find entry points into the literature. Sections III, IV and V each deal

with particular topics where technological change and the environment interact. Section III

discusses the idea of ‚Äúinduced innovation‚Äù and related literature on the idea that environmental

    Because our focus is technological change, we also exclude the growing literature on political and policy
    innovation, including the political economy of environmental policy. See the chapter on ‚ÄúPolitical Economy of
    Environmental Policy‚Äù in this volume.

policy can stimulate the creation of new environmentally friendly technology.         Section IV

focuses on environmental issues related to technology diffusion. Section V surveys the growing

literature analyzing the comparative technological impacts of alternative environmental policy

instruments. Section VI provides concluding observations and suggestions for future research.


II. Fundamental Concepts in the Economics of Technological Change

       The literature in economics on technological change is large and diverse. Major sub-areas

(with references to surveys related to those areas) include: the theory of incentives for research

and development (Tirole 1988; Reinganum 1989; Geroski 1995); the measurement of innovative

inputs and outputs (Griliches 1984 and Griliches 1998); analysis and measurement of

externalities resulting from the research process (Griliches 1992; Jaffe 1998a); the measurement

and analysis of productivity growth (Jorgenson 1990; Griliches 1998; Jorgenson and Stiroh

2000); diffusion of new technology (Karshenas and Stoneman 1995; Geroski 2000); the effect of

market structure on innovation (Scherer 1986; Sutton 1998); market failures related to innovation

and appropriate policy responses (Martin and Scott 2000); the economic effects of publicly

funded research (David et al. 2000); the economic effects of the patent system (Jaffe 2000); and

the role of technological change in endogenous macroeconomic growth (Romer 1994; Grossman

and Helpman 1994).      In this section, we present a selective overview designed to provide

environmental economists with entry points into this large literature.

       A. Schumpeter and the Gale of Creative Destruction

       The modern theory of the process of technological change can be largely traced to the

ideas of Josef Schumpeter (1942), who saw innovation as the hallmark of the modern capitalist

system. Entrepreneurs, enticed by the vision of the temporary market power that a successful

new product or process offers, continually introduce such products. They enjoy excess profits

                                                 3
for some period of time, until they are displaced by subsequent successful innovators, in a

continuing process that Schumpeter called ‚Äúcreative destruction.‚Äù

           Schumpeter distinguished three steps or stages in the process by which a new, superior

technology permeates the marketplace.                  Invention constitutes the first development of a

scientifically or technically new product or process. 3 Inventions may be patented, though many

are not.       Either way, most inventions never actually develop into an innovation, which is

accomplished only when the new product or process is commercialized, that is, made available

on the market. 4 A firm can innovate without ever inventing, if it identifies a previously existing

technical idea that was never commercialized, and brings a product or process based on that idea

to market. The invention and innovation stages are carried out primarily in private firms through

a process that is broadly characterized as ‚Äúresearch and development‚Äù (R&D). 5                             Finally, a

successful innovation gradually comes to be widely used in relevant applications through

adoption by firms or individuals, a process labeled diffusion. The cumulative economic or

environmental impact of new technology results from all three of these stages, 6 which we refer to

collectively as the process of technological change.



3
    The Schumpeterian ‚Äútrichotomy‚Äù focuses on the commercial aspects of technological change. As discussed in
    Section II.C.4 below, the public sector also plays an important role. In addition, a non-trivial amount of basic
    research‚Äîwhich one might think of as prior even to the invention stage‚Äîis carried out by private firms
    (Rosenberg 1990).
4
    More precisely, an invention may form the basis of a technological innovation. Economically important
    innovations need not be based on new technology, but can be new organizational or managerial forms, new
    marketing methods, and so forth. In this chapter, we use the word innovation as short-hand for the more precise
    technological innovation.
5
    Data regarding R&D expenditures of firms are available from the financial statements of publicly traded firms, if
    the expenditure is deemed ‚Äúmaterial‚Äù by the firm‚Äôs auditors, or if the firm chooses for strategic reasons to report
    the expenditure (Bound, et al. 1984). In the United States, the government carries out a ‚Äúcensus‚Äù of R&D activity,
    and reports totals for broad industry groups (National Science Board 1998). Many industrialized countries now
    collect similar statistics, which are available through the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development
    (OECD 2000).
6
    Typically, for there to be environmental impacts of a new technology, a fourth step is requiredÔ£ß utilization, but
    that is not part of the process of technological change per se. Thus, for example, a new type of hybrid motor

                                                           4
        B. Production Functions, Productivity Growth, and Biased Technological Change

        The measurement of the rate and direction of technological change rests fundamentally

on the concept of the transformation function,

                                             T (Y, I, t ) ‚â§ 0 ,                                                  (1)

where Y represents a vector of outputs, I represents a vector of inputs, and t is time. Equation (1)

describes a production possibility frontier, that is, a set of combinations of inputs and outputs

that are technically feasible at a point in time.                  Technological change is represented by

movement of this frontier that makes it possible over time to use given input vectors to produce

output vectors that were not previously feasible.

        In most applications, separability and aggregation assumptions are made that make it

possible to represent the economy‚Äôs production technology with a production function,

                                          Y = f (K ,L ,E ;t ) ,                                                  (2)

where Y is now a scalar measure of aggregate output (for example, gross domestic product). The

list of inputs on the right-hand side of the production function can be made arbitrarily long. For

illustrative purposes, we conceive of output as being made from a single composite of capital

goods, K, a single composite of labor inputs, L, and a single composite of environmental inputs,

E. Again, technological change means that the relationship between these inputs and possible

output levels changes over time.

        Logarithmic differentiation of Equation (2) with respect to time yields

                                    yt = At + Œ≤ Lt lt + Œ≤Kt kt + Œ≤Et et ,                                        (3)



 vehicle engine might be invented, which emits fewer pollutants per mile; the same or another firm might
 commercialize this engine and place the innovation in new cars available for purchase on the market; individuals
 might purchase (or adopt) these cars, leading to diffusion of the new technology; and finally, by driving these cars
 instead of others (utilization), aggregate pollutant emissions might be reduced. Conversely, if higher efficiency



                                                          5
in which lower case letters represent the growth rates of the corresponding upper case variable;

the Œ≤ ‚Äôs represent the corresponding logarithmic partial derivatives from Equation (2); and the t

indicate that all quantities and parameters may change over time. 7 The term At corresponds to

‚Äúneutral‚Äù technological change, in the sense that it represents the rate of growth of output if the

growth rates of all inputs were zero. But the possibility that the Œ≤ ‚Äôs can change over time

allows for ‚Äúbiased‚Äù technological change, that is, changes over time in relative productivity of

the various inputs.

           Equations (2) and (3) are most easily interpreted in the case of process innovation, in

which firms figure out more efficient ways to make existing products, allowing output to grow at

a rate faster than inputs are growing.                In principle, these equations also apply to product

innovation. Y is a composite or aggregate output measure, in which the distinct outputs of the

economy are each weighted by their relative value, as measured by their market price. Improved

products will typically sell at a price premium, relative to lower quality products, meaning that

their introduction will increase measured output even if the physical quantity of the new goods

does not exceed the physical quantity of the old goods they replaced. In practice, however,

product improvement will be included in measured productivity only to the extent that the price

indices used to convert nominal GDP or other nominal output measures to real output measures

are purged of the effects of product innovation.                   In general, official price indices and the

corresponding real output measures achieve this objective only to a limited extent.




    and the resulting reduced marginal cost causes users to increase utilization, then the emissions reduction associated
    with higher efficiency may be partially or totally offset by higher utilization.
7
    This formulation can be considered a first-order approximation to an arbitrary functional form for Equation (2).
    Higher-order approximations can also be implemented.


                                                            6
           On its face, Equation (3) says nothing about the source of the productivity improvement

associated with the neutral technological change term, At. If, however, all inputs and outputs are

properly measured, and inputs (including R&D) yield only normal investment returns, then all

endogenous contributions to output should be captured by returns to inputs, and there should be

no ‚Äúresidual‚Äù difference between the weighted growth rates of inputs and the growth rate of

output. The observation that the residual has been typically positive is therefore interpreted as

evidence of some source of exogenous technological change. 8

           There is now a large literature on the measurement and explanation of the productivity

residual. There are two basic approaches to the measurement of productivity. The ‚Äúgrowth

accounting‚Äù approach relies on neoclassical production theory under constant returns to scale for

the proposition that the Œ≤ ‚Äôs in Equation (3) are equal to the corresponding factor shares, and

thereby calculates the At as an arithmetic residual after share-weighted input growth rates are

subtracted from the growth rate of output (Denison 1979; U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2000).

The ‚Äúeconometric‚Äù approach estimates the parameters of Equation (3) from time series data and

infers the magnitude of At as an econometric residual after the estimated effects of all measurable

inputs on output have been allowed for (Jorgenson and Griliches 1967; Jorgenson and Stiroh,

2000).       In both of these approaches, much attention has focused on the difficulties of

appropriately measuring both inputs and outputs (Jorgenson and Griliches 1967; Griliches 1994).

A particular focus has been understanding the slowdown in productivity growth in the 1970s and




8
    Fabricant (1954) was the first to observe that the growth of conventional inputs explained little of the observed
    growth in output in the twentieth century. This observation was elaborated by Abramowitz (1956), Kendrick
    (1956) and Solow (1957). The early writers were clear that the large ‚Äúresidual‚Äù of unexplained growth was ‚Äúa
    measure of our ignorance‚Äù (Abramowitz, 1956) rather than a meaningful measure of the rate of technological
    progress.


                                                          7
1980s relative to the earlier postwar period, including the role played by rising energy prices in

that slowdown (Berndt and Wood 1986).

       In many contexts, it is difficult to distinguish the effects of innovation and diffusion. We

observe improvements in productivity (or other measures of performance) but do not have the

underlying information necessary to separate such improvements between movements of the

production frontier, and movements of existing firms towards the frontier. A related issue, and

one that is often significant for environment-related technological change, is that innovation can

be undertaken either by the manufacturers or the users of industrial equipment. In the former

case, the innovation must typically be embodied in new capital goods, and must then diffuse

through the population of users via the purchase of these goods, in order to affect productivity or

environmental performance. In the latter case, the innovation may take the form of changes in

practices that are implemented with existing equipment. Alternatively, firms may develop new

equipment for their own use, which they then may or may not undertake to sell to other firms.

The fact that the locus of activity generating environment-related technological change can be

supplying firms, using firms, or both, has important consequences for modeling the interaction of

technological change and environmental policy.

       The embodiment of new technology in new capital goods creates an ambiguity regarding

the role played by technology diffusion with respect to Equations (2) and (3). One interpretation

is that these equations represent ‚Äúbest practice,‚Äù that is, what the economy would produce if all

innovations made to date had fully diffused.         In this interpretation, innovation would drive

technological change captured in Equation (3); the issue of diffusion would then arise in the form

of the presence of firms producing at points inside the production possibility frontier. Frontier

estimation techniques (Aigner and Schmidt 1980) or data envelopment methods (Fare et al.

1994) would be needed to measure the extent to which such sub-frontier behavior is occurring. 9

Alternatively, one can assume that the users of older equipment make optimal, informed

decisions regarding when to scrap old machines and purchase newer ones that embody better

technology. In this formulation, observed movements of the frontier‚Äîmeasured technological

change‚Äîcomprise the combined impacts of the invention, innovation and diffusion processes.

           C. The Microeconomics of Invention and Innovation

           As noted above, the production function/productivity growth paradigm says little about

what generates technological change. There has been some tendency to treat technology as a

‚Äúblack box‚Äù (Rosenberg 1982). But following Schumpeter, there has been a line of theoretical

and empirical analysis that has cast invention and innovation as a purposive economic activity,

and has attempted to discern its determinants and effects. Milestones in this line of research are:

Schmookler 1966; Mansfield 1968; Rosenberg 1982; Griliches 1984; Nelson and Winter 1982;

and Scherer 1986. 10

            It is useful to identify two major strands of thought regarding the determinants of

innovative activity. We call these two broad categories of modeling approaches the ‚Äúinvestment

subject to market failure‚Äù approach and the ‚Äúevolutionary‚Äù approach.

                    1. The Investment/Market Failure Model

           Under the ‚Äúinvestment subject to market failure‚Äù (hereinafter, ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù) approach,

firms undertake an investment activity called ‚ÄúR&D‚Äù with the intention of producing profitable

new products and processes. Decisions regarding the magnitude and nature of R&D activities

     potential for improvements at paper and glass plants that increase productivity and reduce pollution.

are governed by firms‚Äô efforts to maximize their value, or, equivalently, to maximize the

expected discounted present value of cash flows. In some applications, the output of R&D is

explicitly modeled as ‚Äúknowledge capital,‚Äù an intangible asset that firms use together with other

assets and other inputs to generate revenues. 11

           When viewed as an investment activity, R&D has important characteristics that

distinguish it from investment in equipment or other tangible assets. First, although the outcome

of any investment is uncertain to some extent, R&D investment appears to be qualitatively

different. Not only is the variance of the distribution of expected returns much larger than for

other investments, but much or even most of the value may be associated with very low-

probability but very high value outcomes (Scherer et al. 2000). This skewness in the distribution

of the outcomes of the research process has important implications for modeling firms‚Äô R&D

decision making (Scherer and Harhoff, 2000). In addition, the asset produced by the R&D

investment process is specialized, sunk and intangible, so that it cannot be mortgaged or used as

collateral. The combination of great uncertainty and intangible outcomes makes financing of

research through capital market mechanisms much more difficult than for traditional investment.

The difficulty of securing financing for research from outside sources may lead to under-

investment in research, particularly for small firms that have less internally generated cash and/or

less access to financial markets.

           In addition to these financing difficulties, research investment differs from physical

investment because the asset produced by the research process ‚Äî new knowledge about how to

make and do things ‚Äî is difficult to exclude others from using. As first noted in the classic




11
     See Griliches (1979) for the seminal statement of this research approach. An example of a recent application
     measuring the knowledge capital of firms is Hall et al. (2000).


                                                         10
paper by Arrow (1962a), this means that the creator of this asset will typically fail to appropriate

all or perhaps most of the social returns it generates. Much of this social return will accrue as

‚Äúspillovers‚Äù to competing firms, to downstream firms that purchase the innovator‚Äôs products, or

to consumers (Griliches 1979, 1992; Jaffe 1986, 1998a). This ‚Äúappropriability problem‚Äù is

likely to lead to significant underinvestment by private firms in R&D, relative to the social

optimum (Spence 1984).

       An important special case of the appropriability problem is created by ‚Äúgeneral purpose

technologies‚Äù (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995). GPTs are technologies that find use in many

distinct application sectors within the economy, such as the electric motor, the steam engine, the

internal combustion engine and now, the semiconductor and possibly the Internet.               The

development of such technologies increases the returns to R&D designed to incorporate them

into the different applications sectors; development of such applications in turn increases the

return to improving the GPT. Because of these dynamic feedback effects, GPTs may be an

important factor in economic growth (Helpman, 1998). The dynamic feedback between a GPT

and its applications sectors also creates an important example of ‚Äúpath dependence,‚Äù discussed in

Section IV below. With respect to the environment, whether the GPTs that drive a particular era

are pollution-intensive or pollution-saving may have profound implications for the long-term

environmental prognosis.

       As a profit-motivated activity, R&D investment decisions are governed by the cost of

R&D and its expected return. Theory and evidence suggest that the most important factors

affecting the optimal level of R&D are the after-tax cost of R&D (Hall and van Reenen 2000),

the size of the market (Schmookler 1966), technological opportunity (Rosenberg 1982), and

appropriability conditions (Jaffe 1988). Each of these varies intrinsically across time, markets,



                                                 11
and technologies, and also is affected by government policy. In particular, patents and other

forms of intellectual property are used by firms to overcome the appropriability problem,

although the effect of these institutions on investment in R&D or inventive activity has not been

clearly demonstrated empirically (Jaffe, 2000: Cohen, et al, 2000).

       The recognition that R&D is a profit-motivated investment activity leads to the

hypothesis that the rate and direction of innovation are likely to respond to changes in relative

prices. Since environmental policy implicitly or explicitly makes environmental inputs more

expensive, the ‚Äúinduced innovation‚Äù hypothesis suggests an important pathway for the

interaction of environmental policy and technology, and for the introduction of impacts on

technological change as a criterion for evaluation of different policy instruments. These issues

are discussed in Sections III and V below.

               2. The Evolutionary Model

       While viewing R&D as a profit-motivated investment activity comes naturally to most

economists, the large uncertainties surrounding the outcomes of R&D investments make it very

difficult for firms to make optimizing R&D decisions. Accordingly, Nelson and Winter (1982)

used Herbert Simon‚Äôs idea of boundedly rational firms that engage in ‚Äúsatisficing‚Äù rather than

optimizing behavior (Simon 1947) to build an alternative model of the R&D process. In this

‚Äúevolutionary‚Äù model, firms use ‚Äúrules of thumb‚Äù and ‚Äúroutines‚Äù to determine how much to

invest in R&D, and how to search for new technologies. The empirical predictions of this model

depend on the nature of the rules of thumb that firms actually use (Nelson and Winter 1982;

Winter et al 2000).

       Because firms are not optimizing, a logical consequence of the evolutionary model is that

it cannot be presumed that the imposition of a new external constraint (for example, a new



                                                12
environmental rule) necessarily reduces profits. There is at least the theoretical possibility that

the imposition of such a constraint could be an event that forces a satisficing firm to rethink its

strategy, with the possible outcome being the discovery of a new way of operating that is

actually more profitable for the firm. This possibility of environmental regulation leading to a

‚Äúwin-win‚Äù outcome in which pollution is reduced and profits increased is discussed in Section III

below.

                    3. Market Structure and Innovation

           The recognition that the costs and benefits of R&D for the firm are affected by the

appropriability problem and financing issues has led to a large literature on the effects of market

structure on innovation. In the older literature, it was argued that both the difficulty of financing

uncertain R&D investments, and the problem of appropriating the returns to R&D, would be

overcome more easily by large firms and/or firms operating in concentrated industries

characterized by market power. From these observations, it was hypothesized that innovation

comes disproportionately from large firms and concentrated industries. This conjecture is known

as the ‚ÄúSchumpeterian Hypothesis,‚Äù despite the fact that it does not appear in any of

Schumpeter‚Äôs writings. 12 After much debate about what the Schumpeterian Hypothesis really

means, the volume of evidence seems to show that: (1) much innovation in modern economies

comes from large firms in moderately concentrated industries, if only because much economic

activity comes from such firms; (2) truly competitive industries (for example, construction)



12
      Schumpeter did emphasize that large corporations were important engines of innovation in modern economies,
     and that atomistic competitive firms were unlikely to engage in much R&D. He does not, however, seem to have
     endorsed, at least in writing, the notion of a monotonic relationship between innovative intensity and size or
     concentration (Cohen and Levin 1989). Note that the ‚ÄúSchumpeterian Hypothesis‚Äù discussed here is distinct from,
     and in some ways inconsistent with, the notion of ‚ÄúSchumpeterian competition‚Äù that is invoked in many modern
     endogenous growth and other R&D models. The latter refers to the idea that innovators achieve market power in




                                                          13
perform little R&D; (3) beyond minimal size and concentration, there is little evidence of any

monotonic relationship between innovation intensity and either size or concentration; and (4)

innovation and market structure interact dynamically in a way that is not captured by an alleged

causal influence of firm size and market concentration on innovation. 13

            More recently, a large game-theoretic literature related to strategic R&D incentives has

emerged (surveyed by Reinganum 1989). This literature has two strands. One views R&D or

other innovative activities in a context of continuous competition in which, for example,

marginal R&D investments result in marginal cost reductions or product improvements (for

example, Dasgupta and Stiglitz 1980a; Levin and Reiss 1988; Spence 1984). Industry structure,

represented by the number of competing firms, can be viewed either as an exogenous element of

industry structure, or the endogenous result of a free-entry equilibrium.                          In these models,

innovation intensity tends to be positively associated with industry concentration, because firms

with larger market shares can spread the cost of R&D over more unit sales and suffer less from

R&D spillovers.

            The other R&D theory literature focuses on patent races. Firms compete to be the first to

achieve a specific innovation goal (for example, Dasgupta and Stiglitz 1980b; Reinganum 1982;

Fudenberg, et al 1983).              In this literature, there is no necessary connection between the

competitiveness of the R&D process and the competitiveness of the market itself. For this

reason, the ‚Äúmarket share‚Äù effect that makes competition unconducive to innovation in the

continuous competition models does not operate. Results regarding the relationship between




     the short run, but that ‚Äúcreative destruction,‚Äù modeled as a dynamic free-entry equilibrium causes all firms to earn
     zero expected profits.

competition and the rate of innovation tend to be less robust, depending on the structure of the

game and the way in which the ‚Äúrate of innovation‚Äù is characterized (Reinganum 1989).

                    4. Public Policy and Innovation

           As noted above, both the appropriability problem and the possibility of capital market

failures in the financing of R&D lead to a presumption that laissez-faire levels of investment in

innovation will be too low from a social perspective. There is, however, an offsetting negative

externality that suggests that private R&D incentives may be too great. R&D is a fixed cost that

must, in equilibrium, be financed by the stream of quasi-rents it produces. The entry of another

R&D competitor, or an increase in the R&D investment level of a competitor, reduces the

expected quasi-rents earned by other R&D firms. This ‚Äúrent-stealing‚Äù effect (Mankiw and

Whinston 1986) could, as a theoretical matter, lead to over-investment in R&D.                               This is

analogous to the over-fishing of a common-property fishery by a competitive fishing industry. 14

           The empirical evidence suggests, however, that positive externalities associated with

knowledge spillovers dominate the rent-stealing effect, leading to social rates of return to R&D

substantially in excess of the private rates of return (Griliches 1992). In practice, virtually all

industrialized countries engage in policies designed to encourage investment in innovation

(Guellec and van Pottelsberghe 2000; Mowery and Rosenberg 1989). It is difficult to determine

how well these policies do in moving R&D toward optimal levels. There is some evidence that

social rates of return remain well above private levels (Griliches 1992; Jones and Williams

1998), but there is also evidence that R&D subsidies drive up the wages of scientists enough to



14
      There is also a dynamic analogue to the tension between spillovers and rent-stealing. Over time, innovation may
     become cumulatively easier because subsequent inventors ‚Äústand on the shoulders‚Äù of those who came before; or it
     may become harder, because the pool of potential inventions is ‚Äúfished out.‚Äù In the 1980s, there was considerable
     interest in the idea that ‚Äúfishing out‚Äù of invention potential may explain the productivity slowdown of the 1970s



                                                           15
prevent significant increases in real R&D (Goolsbee 1998). This implies that the supply of

scientists and engineers is relatively inelastic; whether such inelasticity could hold in the long

run remains unresolved.

            Policy can try to increase social investment in R&D by engaging in R&D in the public

(and/or nonprofit) sector, or by trying to reduce the after-tax cost of R&D for private firms.

R&D in the public sector and in universities is an important, though declining component of the

overall research effort in the U.S. and other developed nations. 15                           The evidence on the

effectiveness of public research is mixed, partly because of the difficulty of measuring the output

of the basic research process (Jaffe 1998b), and partially because of the difficulty of determining

the extent of complementarity or substitutability between public research investment and private

investment (David, et al 2000). Examples of successful government technology development (as

opposed to research) have been particularly few (Cohen and Noll 1991). Nonetheless, public

R&D may well play a particularly important role with respect to environment-related science and

technology.

            Government policy affects the after-tax cost of R&D via tax incentives (Hall and Van

Reneen (2000), 16 direct subsidies and grants for research (Klette, et al. 2000; Trajtenberg 2000),

and also via educational policies that affect the supply of scientists and engineers (Romer 2000).



     (Evenson 1991). But the surge in patenting and productivity growth rates in the 1990s has led to a fading of the
     fishing-out idea (Jaffe, 2000).
15
      Research performed in government labs, universities and other non-profit institutions is currently about one-fourth
     of all research performed in the U.S., versus three-quarters performed in the for-profit sector. In addition, some of
     the research performed by firms is funded by public money; altogether, over one-third of all R&D is funded by
     public sources (National Science Board, 1998). This estimate excludes the implicit public subsidy for private
     research represented by the Research and Experimentation Tax Credit.
16
      The effect of taxation on R&D incentives is theoretically complex. On the one hand, any tax on profits derived
     from R&D drives a wedge between the before- and after-tax returns and hence discourages R&D investment. On
     the other hand, returns from R&D are taxed much more lightly than returns from investment in equipment and
     structures, both because of explicit R&D incentives, and also because R&D can be expensed rather than
     amortized. Thus relative to traditional investment, R&D is strongly tax-preferred.

                                                             16
Public policies can affect the market for new technologies via direct government purchase, and

also subsidies for purchase or installation of products incorporating particular technologies

(Stoneman 1987). Finally, policies can affect the extent to which firms can successfully

appropriate the returns to their research, by establishing the institutional environment of patent

systems, employment relations, and antitrust or other competition policies. 17

           D. The Microeconomics of Diffusion

           From the mechanical reaper of the nineteenth century (David 1966), through hybrid corn

seed (Griliches 1957), steel furnaces (Oster 1982), optical scanners (Levin, et al. 1987) and

industrial robots (Mansfield 1989), research has consistently shown that the diffusion of new,

economically superior technologies is a gradual process. Typically, the fraction of potential

users that has adopted a new technology follows a sigmoid or ‚ÄúS-shaped‚Äù path over time, rising

only slowly at first, then entering a period of very rapid growth, followed by a slowdown in

growth as the technology reaches maturity and most potential adopters have switched (Geroski

2000).

           The explanation for the apparent slowness of the technology diffusion process has been a

subject of research in a variety of disciplines. Two main forces have been emphasized. First,

potential technology adopters are heterogeneous, so that a technology that is generally superior

will not be equally superior for all potential users, and may remain inferior to existing

technology for some users for an extended period of time after its introduction.                          Second,

adopting a new technology is a risky undertaking, requiring considerable information, both about

the generic attributes of the new technology and about the details of its use in the particular



17
      The primary explicit non-fiscal mechanism for encouraging innovation in industrialized countries is the patent
     system. Empirical evidence on the impact of patent protection on the rate of innovation is ambiguous. For a
     survey, see Jaffe (2000).


                                                          17
application being considered.            It takes time for information to diffuse sufficiently, and the

diffusion of the technology is limited by this process of diffusion of information.

           The two main models of the diffusion process each emphasize one of these two aspects of

the process. 18 The probit or rank model, first articulated in an unpublished paper by Paul David

(1969), posits that potential adopters are characterized by a distribution of value or returns

associated with the new technology. 19 Because adoption is costly, at any moment in time there is

a threshold point on this distribution, such that potential users with values at or above this

threshold will want to adopt, and users for whom the value of the new technology is below this

threshold will not want to adopt. Because the new technology will typically get cheaper and

better as time passes after its initial introduction, this threshold will gradually move to the right,

and eventually sweep out the entire distribution. If the distribution of underlying values is

normal (or another single-peaked distribution with similar shape), this gradual movement of the

threshold across the distribution will produce the typical S-shaped diffusion curve.

           The other widely-used model is called the epidemic model (Griliches 1957; Stoneman

1983). The epidemic model presumes that the primary factor limiting diffusion is information,

and that the most important source of information about a new technology is people or firms who

have tried it. Thus technology spreads like a disease, with the instigation of adoption being

contact between the ‚Äúinfected‚Äù population (people who have already adopted) and the uninfected

population. Denoting the fraction of the potential using population that has adopted as f, this

                                            df
leads to the differential equation             = Œ≤ f (1 ‚àí f ) . Solution of this equation yields a logistic
                                            dt



18
     For an empirical example that integrates the two models, see Trajtenberg (1990).
19
     This has sometimes been called the rank model since potential adopters can be ranked in terms of their potential
     benefits from adoption (Karshenas and Stoneman 1995).


                                                           18
function, which has the characteristic S-shape. The parameter Œ≤ captures the ‚Äúcontagiousness‚Äù

of the disease, presumably related to the cost of the new technology and the degree of its

superiority over the technology it replaces (Griliches 1957). 20

            The probit model emphasizes adoption as the result of value-maximizing decisions by

heterogeneous adopters. As such, at least in its basic form, it does not suggest that the slow

diffusion of new technology is anything but optimal. In contrast, in the epidemic model each

adopter generates a positive externality by transferring information to other potential adopters.

This suggests that laissez-faire adoption rates may indeed be socially suboptimal. We return to

this issue in Section IV below.

            Finally, we note an important issue of feedback from the diffusion process to the earlier

stages of invention and innovation. The rate at which a technology diffuses determines in large

part the rate at which its production volume grows. And as stated earlier, market size tends to be

an important determinant of R&D effort and innovative activity, so that growing use increases

the incentive for R&D to improve the product. Furthermore, if the production process is

characterized by learning by doing, then quality may rise and production costs fall as production

experience is accumulated. This possibility creates an additional source of positive externality

associated with technology adoption, and may introduce dynamic increasing returns to scale for

individual technologies. This issue is also discussed in Section IV.




20
      Both the probit and epidemic models focus on the fraction of the population that had adopted at a point in time. If
     one has individual-level data on adopters, one can take as the dependent variable the individual time until
     adoption. This leads to a duration or hazard model (Karshenas and Stoneman 1995; Rose and Joskow 1990). Kerr
     and Newell (2000) employed a duration model to analyze technology adoption decisions by petroleum refineries
     during the phasedown of lead in gasoline, as discussed in Section IV and V below.


                                                             19
            E. Technological Change and Endogenous Economic Growth

            In the last two decades there has emerged a large macroeconomic literature that builds on

the above concepts to produce models of overall economic growth based on technological

change (Romer 1990, 1994; Grossman and Helpman 1994).                              In these models, R&D is an

endogenous equilibrium response to Schumpeterian profit incentives. Spillovers associated with

this R&D generate a form of dynamic increasing returns, which allows an economy

endogenously investing in R&D to grow indefinitely. 21 This stands in contrast to the older

neoclassical growth model, in which exogenous technological change, in the presence of

decreasing returns to investment in physical capital, typically yields an economy that tends

towards a steady state in which income per capita does not grow. 22

            Endogenous growth theory has played an important role in re-introducing technological

change‚Äîand the associated policy issues deriving from R&D market failures‚Äîinto discussions

about economic growth. 23 Modeling growth as a process driven by the endogenous creation and

diffusion of new technology ought to have implications for important environmental issues such

as sustainable development and global climate change.                       Its policy utility has been limited,

however, by its relative lack of empirical foundation, and by the difficulty of linking the

macroeconomic endogenous growth models to the microeconomic foundations of technological



21
     It is also possible to generate such endogenous growth through human capital investment (Lucas 1988).
22
      Thus, in the literature, ‚Äúendogenous technological change‚Äù and ‚Äúinduced technological change‚Äù refer to different
     concepts, even though the opposite of each is often described by the same phrase, that is, exogenous technological
     change. Endogenous technological change refers to the broad concept that technological change is the result of
     activities within the economic system, which are presumed to respond to the economic incentives of the system.
     Induced technological change refers to the more specific idea that changes in relative factor prices affect the rate
     and direction of innovation. In practice, papers that use the phrase ‚Äúendogenous technological change‚Äù tend to
     focus on aggregate R&D expenditure and neutral technological change. Papers that used the phrase ‚Äúinduced
     technological change‚Äù or ‚Äúinduced innovation‚Äù tend to focus on the direction of R&D efforts and biases in
     technological change.
23
      See, for example, Jones and Williams (1998), and the symposium on ‚ÄúNew Growth Theory‚Äù in the Winter 1994
     Journal of Economic Perspectives.

innovation and diffusion (Caballero and Jaffe 1993). This remains an important area for future

research.


III. The Induced Innovation Hypothesis and its Importance for Environmental Economics

           As discussed in the introduction, if the imposition of environmental requirements can

induce innovation that reduces the (static) cost of complying with those requirements, this has

profound implications for both the setting of environmental policy goals and the choice of policy

instruments. In this section we discuss the two main theoretical frameworks for analyzing

induced innovation, and evaluate the empirical evidence, particularly as it relates to inducement

associated with environmental objectives. 24

           A. Neoclassical Induced Innovation

           The induced-innovation hypothesis was first articulated by Sir John Hicks:

           ‚Äúa change in the relative prices of the factors of production is itself a spur to invention,
           and to invention of a particular kind ‚Äî directed to economizing the use of a factor which
           has become relatively expensive.‚Äù (Hicks 1932), p. 124) 25

Analysis of this hypothesis has a long and somewhat tortured history in economics. Early

empirical work was largely confined to aggregate data, and focused primarily on questions such

as whether historical cross-country differences in wage levels could explain the location of

development of labor-saving inventions (Thirtle and Ruttan 1987).

           Hicks did not link the induced-innovation hypothesis in a formal way to the research

process, or to profit-maximizing R&D decisions by firms. This link was formalized in the 1960s



24
      In this and the following section, we focus separately on induced innovation and the economic forces driving
     diffusion. As noted above, however, the analytical distinction between innovation and diffusion may be blurred in
     practice.
25
      Writing before Schumpeter, Hicks does not appear to use the word ‚Äúinvention‚Äù in the specific sense used by
     Schumpeter and adopted by later authors. Rather, Hicks uses it in a general sense encompassing both invention
     and innovation, as used today.


                                                           21
by Ahmad (1966) and Kamien and Schwartz (1968), and developed further by Binswanger

(1974). Binswanger and Ruttan (1978) summarize this literature. The general approach is to

postulate a ‚Äúmeta‚Äù production function according to which investing in R&D changes the

parameters of a production function such as Equation (2). Unfortunately, theoretical conclusions

regarding the induced affect of changes in factor prices on the parameters of the production

function are sensitive to the specification of the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù production function governing the

research process.

       Although formulated in terms of the R&D decisions of firms, this theory is nonetheless

aggregate, because the result of the research process is change in the parameters of the aggregate

production function. That is, ‚Äúlabor-saving‚Äù innovation in these models means a change in the

parameters of Equation (2) that results in less labor being used. The model abstracts entirely

from what kinds of new machines or processes might be yielding these changes.               Further,

because of the ambiguity described in Section II.B as to whether the production frontier does or

does not encompass technology diffusion, there is really no distinction in these models between

induced innovation and the effect of factor prices on the rate of technology diffusion.

       A natural way to move the modeling of induced innovation to the microeconomic level is

to recognize that factor-saving technological change comes about largely through the

introduction of new capital goods that embody different input ratios. These input ratios can then

be thought of as attributes or characteristics of the capital goods in the sense of Lancaster (1971).

Newell (1997, Chapter 2) and Newell, et al. (1999) showed that improvements in the energy

efficiency of equipment can be modeled in this way. The existing technology for making a given

type of equipment at a point in time is identified in terms of vectors of characteristics (including

cost of manufacture) that are feasible. The process of invention makes it possible to manufacture



                                                 22
‚Äúmodels‚Äù (characteristics vectors) that were previously infeasible. Innovation means the offering

for commercial sale of a model that was not previously offered for sale. Induced innovation is

then represented as movements in the frontier of feasible models that reduce the cost of energy

efficiency in terms of other attributes.

           Hicks formulated the induced innovation hypothesis in terms of factor prices. Newell, et

al. (1999) generalized this concept to include inducement by regulatory standards, such as

labeling requirements that might increase the value of certain product characteristics by making

consumers more aware of them. More generally, non-price regulatory constraints can fit within

the inducement framework if they can be modeled as changing the shadow or implicit price that

firms face in emitting pollutants.

           B. Regulation and Innovation in the Evolutionary Paradigm

           The neoclassical theory of induced innovation is a positive theory, not a normative one.

There is no suggestion that inducing technological change is a desirable thing. In general, if

firms are choosing R&D to maximize profits, then the imposition of a constraint that induces a

change in the R&D level would tend to lower profits (Palmer, et al 1995). 26

           The evolutionary approach replaces optimizing firms with satisficing firms, and thereby

admits greater scope for a variety of consequences when the firm‚Äôs environment is modified.

Satisficing firms may miss opportunities for increased profits simply because they don‚Äôt look

very hard for such opportunities as long as things are going reasonably well. An external shock

such as a new environmental constraint can therefore constitute a stimulus to new search,

possibly leading to discovery of previously undetected profit opportunities. This observation



26
      Of course, if R&D creates net positive externalities, than an induced increase in R&D could increase social
     welfare even if it reduces profits. We return to this issue below.


                                                         23
forms the basis for the normative observation that environmental regulation may not be as costly

as we expect, because the imposition of the new constraint may lead to the discovery of new

ways of doing things. In the limit, these new ways of doing things might actually be more

profitable than the old ways, leading to an asserted ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù outcome. 27

            In general, advocates of the ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù view of the consequences of environmental

regulation seem unaware of the connection between their argument and the evolutionary school

of technological change. 28 But the ideas are similar:

            It is sometimes argued that companies must, by the very notion of profit seeking, be
            pursuing all profitable innovation‚Ä¶In this view, if complying with environmental
            regulation can be profitable, in the sense that a company can more than offset the cost of
            compliance, then why is such regulation necessary?

            The possibility that regulation might act as a spur to [profitable] innovation arises
            because the world does not fit the Panglossian belief that firms always make optimal
            choices‚Ä¶[T]he actual process of dynamic competition is characterized by changing
            technological opportunities coupled with highly incomplete information, organizational
            inertia and control problems reflecting the difficulty of aligning individual, group and
            corporate incentives. Companies have numerous avenues for technological improvement,
            and limited attention. (Porter and van der Linde 1995, pp. 98-99)

            Porter and other ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù theorists argued that in this non-optimizing world, regulation

may lead to ‚Äúinnovation offsets‚Äù that ‚Äúcan not only lower the net cost of meeting environmental

regulations, but can even lead to absolute advantages over firms in foreign countries not subject

to similar regulations‚Äù (Porter and van der Linde 1995, p. 98). Of course, the fact that firms

engage in non-optimizing behavior creates a possibility for profit improvements, without



27
      Another related idea is that of ‚ÄúX-inefficiency‚Äù (Leibenstein, 1966). It is also, of course, possible to model
     apparently inefficient firm behavior as the (second-best) efficient outcome of imperfect information and divergent
     incentives among managers or between owners and managers in a principal/agent framework.
28
      Neither Simon (1947) nor Nelson and Winter (1982) appear in the references of Porter and van der Linde (1995).
     Interestingly, Nelson and Winter themselves anticipated the connection. In their 1982 book, they say ‚ÄúIn a regime
     in which technical advance is occurring and organizational structure is evolving in response to changing patterns
     of demand and supply, new nonmarket interactions that are not contained adequately by prevailing laws and
     policies are almost certain to appear, and old ones may disappear‚Ä¶The canonical ‚Äòexternality‚Äô problem of



                                                            24
suggesting that such improvements would be the norm, would be systematic, or even likely. But

win-win theorists propose several reasons why innovation offsets are likely to be common.

        First, they argue that regulation provides a signal to companies about likely resource

inefficiencies and potential technological improvements; that pollution is, by its very nature,

indicative of resources being wasted, or at least not fully utilized. Regulation focuses attention

on pollution, and such attention is likely to lead to the saving of resources, which will often

lower costs.     Second, regulation provides or requires the generation of information; since

information is a public good it may be underprovided without such incentives. Third, regulation

reduces uncertainty about the payoffs to investments in environmental innovation. There may be

potential investments that are believed to be profitable in an expected value sense, and also

deliver environmental benefits, but which are highly risky in the absence of regulation that

ensures that the environmental benefits are also privately valuable.                   Regulation, in effect,

provides ‚Äúinsurance‚Äù against the risk of investing in new technology, part of whose benefit

cannot be internalized. Fourth, new technology that is initially more costly may produce long-

run competitive advantage, because of learning-by-doing or other ‚Äúfirst-mover‚Äù advantages, if

other countries eventually impose similarly strict standards. Finally, regulation simply creates

pressure. Such pressure plays an important role in the innovation process, ‚Äúto overcome inertia,

foster creative thinking and mitigate agency problems‚Äù (Porter and van der Linde 1995, p. 100).

        It should be emphasized that win-win theorists do not claim that all environmental

regulations generate significant innovation offsets. Indeed, they emphasize that regulation must




 evolutionary theory is the generation by new technologies of benefits and costs that old institutional structures
 ignore.‚Äù (page 368) See also Kemp and Soete (1990).


                                                       25
be properly designed in order to maximize the chances for encouraging innovation. We return to

this issue in Section V.

       Generally, economists have been skeptical of the win-win theory (Palmer, et al 1995;

Oates et al. 1993). It is not clear that pollution generally signals ‚Äúwaste;‚Äù most physical and

biological processes have by-products of some sort, and whether the extent of such by-products

is ‚Äúwasteful‚Äù or not is inherently a question of prices and costs.          More generally, firms‚Äô

rationality is surely bounded, but that does not mean that unexploited profit opportunities are

frequent. For regulation to have important informational effects, the government must have

better information than firms have about the nature of environmental problems and their

potential solutions.   This seems questionable.       Of course, the government may have better

information about which environmental problems it considers most important, but it is not clear

how conveying this type of information would produce win-win outcomes. As to overcoming

inertia, most firms in today‚Äôs world feel a lot of pressure, so it seems unlikely that the additional

pressure of regulation is going to have beneficial stimulating effects on innovation. Finally,

while it seems likely that environmental regulation will stimulate the innovation and diffusion of

technologies that facilitate compliance, creation and adoption of new technology will typically

require real resources, and have significant opportunity costs. The observation that the new

technology is cost-saving on a forward-looking basis is not sufficient to conclude that the firm

was made better off by being induced to develop and/or adopt the new technology.

       C. Empirical Evidence on Induced Innovation

       Thirtle and Ruttan (1987) provided a review of the non-environmental literature on

induced innovation. Much of this work is in the agricultural area in which excellent microdata




                                                 26
has long provided fertile ground for empirical work on innovation and diffusion. 29 In general,

available empirical analyses confirm that factor price changes are associated with factor-saving

technological change.

           The greatest challenge in testing the induced innovation hypothesis specifically with

respect to environmental inducement is the difficulty of measuring the extent or intensity of

inducement across firms or industries (Jaffe, et al. 1995). Ideally, one would like to look at the

relationship between innovation and the shadow price of pollution or environmental inputs. In

practice, such shadow prices are not easily observed. Consequently, one must use proxies for

this shadow price, such as expert judgements about relative regulatory stringency in different

states (Gray and Shadbegian 1998), number of enforcement actions (Gray and Shadbegian 1995),

Clean Air Act attainment status (Greenstone 1998), specific regulatory events (Berman and Bui

1998), or expenditures on pollution abatement (Lanjouw and Mody 1996). 30

           Lanjouw and Mody (1996) showed a strong association between pollution abatement

expenditures and the rate of patenting in related technology fields. Jaffe and Palmer (1997)

examined the correlation between pollution expenditures by industry and indicators of

innovation more broadly. They found that there is a significant correlation within industries over

time between the rate of expenditure on pollution abatement and the level of R&D spending.

They did not, however, find evidence of an effect of pollution control expenditure on overall

patenting.




29
      More recently, the availability of computerized firm-level data on R&D and patents has led to an increase in
     parallel analyses in the industrial sector.
30
     Of course, there is a parallel problem with respect to measurement of the rate of invention or innovation. See
     Griliches (1990) and Lanjouw and Schankerman (1999).


                                                          27
           There is a large literature on the impact of environmental regulation on productivity and

investment. 31 To the extent that regulation inhibits investment and/or slows productivity growth,

this can be viewed as indirect evidence suggesting that induced innovation effects are either

small or are outweighed by other costs of regulation. Results of this type seem to be industry

and methodology dependent.               For example, Berman and Bui (1998) found significant

productivity increases associated with air pollution regulation in the oil refining industry, but

Gray and Shadbegian (1998) found that pollution abatement investment ‚Äúcrowds out‚Äù productive

investment almost entirely in the pulp and paper industry. Greenstone (1998) found overall that

air pollution regulation has a statistically significant but very small impact on overall costs,

implying a small negative productivity impact.

           Evidence of inducement has also been sought by examining the response to changing

energy prices. Newell, et al. (1999) examined the extent to which the energy efficiency of the

menu of home appliances available for sale changed in response to energy prices between 1958

and 1993, using the model (discussed above) of induced innovation as changing characteristics

of capital goods. By constructing a series of dynamic simulations, they examined the effects of

energy price changes and efficiency standards on average efficiency of the menu of products

over time. They found that a substantial amount of the improvement was what may be described

as autonomous (that is, associated with the passage of time), but significant amounts of

innovation were also due to changes in energy prices and changes in energy-efficiency standards.

They found that technological change in air conditioners was actually biased against energy

efficiency in the 1960s (when real energy prices were falling), but that this bias was reversed



31
     See, for example, Gollop and Roberts (1983), Kolstad and Turnovsky (1998) and Yaisawarng and Klein (1994).
     This literature is discussed at greater length in the chapter on ‚ÄúCalculating the Costs of Environmental
     Regulation.‚Äù


                                                        28
after the two energy shocks of the 1970s. In terms of the efficiency of the average model

offered, they found that energy efficiency in 1993 would have been about one-quarter to one-half

lower in air conditioners and gas water heaters, if energy prices had stayed at their 1973 levels,

rather than following their historical path.

       Popp (2000a and 2000b) looked more broadly at energy prices and energy-related

innovation.   In the first paper, he found that patenting in energy-related fields increases in

response to increased energy prices, but that the effect fades over time. Popp attributed this

fading to diminishing returns to R&D. In the second paper, he attempted to decompose the

overall reduction in energy use that is associated with changing energy prices between the

substitution effect‚Äîmovements along a given production frontier‚Äîand the induced innovation

effect‚Äîmovement of the production frontier itself induced by the change in energy prices.

Using energy-related patents as a proxy for energy innovation, he found that approximately one-

third of the overall response of energy use to prices is associated with induced innovation, with

the remaining two-thirds associated with factor substitution. Because energy patents are likely to

measure energy innovation only with substantial error, one might interpret this result as placing a

lower bound on the fraction of the overall response of energy use to changing prices that is

associated with innovation.

       Porter and van der Linde (1995) provided numerous case studies of particular firms who

developed or adopted new technology in response to regulation, and appear to have benefited as

a result. Palmer, et al (1995) surveyed firms affected by regulation‚Äîincluding those cited by

Porter and van der Linde as success stories ‚Äî and found that most firms say that the net cost to

them of regulation is, in fact, positive. Overall, the evidence on induced innovation and the win-




                                                29
win hypothesis seems to be a case of a ‚Äúpartially full glass‚Äù that analysts see as mostly full or

mostly empty, depending on their perspective. This balance is summarized in Table 1.


       D. Induced Innovation and Optimal Environmental Policy

       Though the magnitude of induced innovation effects remains uncertain, a few researchers

have begun to explore the consequences of induced innovation for environmental policy.

Section V addresses the important question of how considerations related to technological

change (including induced innovation) affect the normative choice among different policy

instruments. In this section, we consider the larger question of whether the possibility of induced

innovation ought to change environmental policy targets, or the pace at which we seek to

achieve them.

       Intuitively, it seems logical that if environmental policy intervention induces innovation,

this in some sense reduces the social cost of environmental intervention, suggesting that the

optimal policy is more stringent than it would be if there were no induced innovation. This

intuition contains an element of truth, but a number of complexities arise. First, there is no

theoretical reason to believe that welfare changes associated with innovation are necessarily

large relative to the welfare effects associated with getting the right static incentives to reduce

pollution (Parry, et al (2000)). Second, one has to be careful what is meant by ‚Äúreducing the cost

of intervention.‚Äù As shown by Goulder and Schneider (1999), if the policy intervention induces

a reduction in the marginal cost of abatement, then any given policy target (for example, a

particular aggregate emission rate or a particular ambient concentration) will be achieved at

lower cost than it would without induced innovation. On the other hand, the lower marginal

abatement cost schedule arising from induced innovation makes it socially optimal to achieve a

Historical evidence indicates that a significant but not predominant fraction of innovation in the energy and environment area is
induced.
Environmental regulation is likely to stimulate innovation and technology adoption that will facilitate environmental compliance.
Much existing environmental regulation uses inflexible mechanisms likely to stifle innovation; ‚Äúincentive-based‚Äù mechanisms are
likely to be more conducive to innovation.
Firms are boundedly rational so that external constraints can sometimes stimulate innovation that will leave the firm better off.
First-mover advantages may result from domestic regulation that correctly anticipates world-wide trends.

Pollution is evidence of waste, suggesting why cost-reducing          Costs are costs; even if firms are not at the frontier, side-effects of

Existing productivity or cost studies do not capture innovation       Existing productivity and cost studies suggest that innovation

There is much evidence of innovation offsets even though              Since there is agreement that bad regulations stifle innovation, the
existing regulations are badly designed. This suggests that offsets   apparent beneficial effects of existing regulation only show that

greater level of pollution abatement. For a plausible social benefit function, this results in

greater total expenditure on abatement (at the social optimum) even as the marginal abatement

cost falls.

            Another important issue is the general equilibrium effect of induced environmental

innovation on innovation elsewhere in the economy (Schmalensee1994). If inducement operates

through increased R&D expenditure, then an issue arises as to the elasticity of supply of R&D

inputs. To the extent that this supply is inelastic, then any induced innovation must come at the

expense of other forms of innovation, creating an opportunity cost that may negate the

‚Äúinnovation offsets‚Äù observed in the regulated portion of the economy. 32 The general equilibrium

consequences of these effects for welfare analysis depend on the extent of R&D spillovers or

other market failures, and the magnitude of these distortions in the regulated firms or sectors

relative to the rest of the economy (Goulder and Schneider 1999).

            Goulder and Mathai (2000) looked at optimal abatement in a dynamic setting,

considering not only the optimal overall amount of abatement but also its timing. In addition to

R&D-induced innovation, they considered (in a separate model) reductions in abatement costs

that come about via learning-by-doing. In the R&D model, there are two effects of induced

innovation on optimal abatement: it reduces marginal abatement costs, which increases the

optimal amount of abatement. But it also reduces the shadow cost of emissions today, because

of lower abatement costs in the future. The combination of these effects implies that with R&D-

induced innovation, optimal abatement is lower in early years and higher in later years than it

would otherwise be. In the learning-by-doing model, there is a third effect: abatement today




32
      Goolsbee (1998) provided evidence that the supply of R&D inputs (scientists and engineers) is relatively inelastic
     in the short run. It seems less likely that this supply is inelastic in the long run. See Romer (2000).


                                                            32
lowers the cost of abatement in the future. This reinforces the tendency for cumulative optimal

abatement to be higher in the presence of induced innovation, but makes the effect on optimal

near-term abatement ambiguous.

       Goulder and Mathai also considered the impact of innovation on the optimal tax rate.

One might suppose that the potential for induced technological change justifies a higher

environmental tax rate (or higher time-profile for an environmental tax), since in this setting

environmental taxes have a dual role: discouraging emissions and triggering new technologies.

Goulder and Mathai showed, however, that under typical conditions (a downward-sloping

marginal damages curve) the presence of induced innovation implies a lower time-profile for the

optimal environmental tax. The reason is that with induced innovation, a lower tax is all that is

needed to achieve the desired abatement, even when the desired extent of abatement is higher.

       Nordhaus (2000) introduced induced technological change into the ‚ÄúDICE‚Äù model of

global climate change and associated economic activities. To calibrate the model, he needed

parametric estimates of the private and social returns to fossil-fuel-related R&D. Using the

existing R&D intensity of the fossil sector to derive these parameters, he found that the impact of

induced innovation is modest. Essentially, the existing share of R&D investment in this sector is

so small that even with large social returns the overall impact is modest. Indeed, comparing a

model with induced innovation (but no factor substitution) with a model that has factor

substitution but no induced innovation, he concluded that induced innovation has less effect than

factor substitution on optimal emissions levels.

       Overall, there is considerable ambiguity regarding the importance of induced innovation

for the optimal stringency of environmental policy. Partly, this is because predictions depend on

the magnitudes of parameters that are hard to measure.             But, more fundamentally, if



                                                   33
environmental policy affects the innovation process, and the innovation process is itself

characterized by market failure, then this is a classic problem of the ‚Äúsecond best.‚Äù We know

that robust results are generally hard to come by with respect to such problems. It will typically

make a big difference whether we imagine optimizing R&D policy first, and then environmental

policy, or vice versa, or if we imagine simultaneous optimization in both realms, or if we assume

that we are designing optimal environmental policy taking non-optimal R&D policy as given.

Theory may be able to indicate the considerations that come into play, but is unlikely to provide

robust prescriptions for policy.


IV. Technology Diffusion and the Potential for Green Technology

       While the induced innovation literature focuses on the potential for environmental policy

to bring forth new technology through innovation, there is also a widely-held view that

significant reductions in environmental impacts could be achieved through more widespread

diffusion of existing economically-attractive technologies, particularly ones that increase energy

efficiency and thereby reduce emissions associated with fossil fuel combustion. For example, the

report of the Interlaboratory Working Group (1997) compiled a comprehensive analysis of

existing technologies that reportedly could reduce energy use and hence CO2 emissions at low or

even negative net cost to users. The observation that energy-efficient technologies that are cost-

effective at current prices are diffusing only slowly dates back to the 1970s, having been

identified as a ‚Äúparadox‚Äù at least as far back as Shama (1983).

       As discussed in Section II above, the observation of apparently slow diffusion of superior

technology is not a surprise when viewed in historical context.        Nonetheless, the apparent

potential for emissions reductions associated with faster diffusion of existing technology raises

two important questions. First, what is the theoretical and empirical potential for ‚Äúinduced


                                                34
diffusion‚Äù of lower-emissions technologies? That is, what is the likely magnitude of the impact

on the diffusion rate of these technologies of environmental policy interventions that implicitly

or explicitly increase the economic incentive to reduce emissions?

         A second and related question is the degree to which historical diffusion rates have been

limited by market failures in the energy and equipment markets themselves (Jaffe and Stavins

1994). To the extent that diffusion has been and is limited by market failures, it is less clear that

policies that operate by increasing the economic incentive to adopt such technology will be

effective. On the other hand, if such market failures are important, then policies focused directly

on correction of such market failures provide, at least in principle, opportunities for policy

intervention that are social-welfare increasing, even without regard to any environmental benefit.

Table 2 summarizes the potential influence on technology diffusion of many of the factors

            A. Theory and Evidence on Induced Diffusion

            In the literature unrelated to environmental technology, both theory and empirical

evidence are clear that technology diffusion rates depend on the strength of economic incentives

for technology adoption. Both of the models discussed in Section II predict that the present

value of benefits from adoption and the initial adoption cost enter into decisions affecting the

diffusion rate. 33 In the probit model, this net present value comparison determines the location of

the adoption threshold that determines what fraction of potential adopters will adopt at a moment

in time. In the epidemic model, this net present value comparison determines the magnitude of

the ‚Äúcontagiousness‚Äù parameter, which in turn determines the speed at which the technology

spreads from adopters to previous non-adopters.

            Empirical studies have addressed the influence on diffusion of factors such as firm size,

R&D expenditure, market share, market structure, input prices, technology costs, firm

ownership, and other institutional factors. The classic empirical study is Griliches (1957), which

showed that the rate of adoption of hybrid corn seed in different regions depended on the

economic superiority of the new seed in that region. David (1966) showed that the first adopters

of the mechanical reaper were larger farms, who benefited more from the decreased variable cost

it permitted. Mansfield (1968) also found the rate of diffusion to depend on firm size (as do

most studies), as well as the riskiness of the new technology and the magnitude of the investment

required for adoption. Rose and Joskow (1990) find a positive, though statistically insignificant




33
      The fact that technology costs enter into the adoption decision demonstrates the close link between technology
     innovation and diffusion in both theory and reality. A key mechanism of diffusion is the gradual adoption of a new
     technology as its cost falls (and/or quality improves). Such cost and quality improvements represent innovation.
     Likewise, incentives for innovation will depend on the eventual demand for a new or improved product, that is,
     diffusion. This linkage also points to the difficulty of empirically distinguishing between technology innovation
     and diffusion since they depend on one another and also both depend on similar external incentives such as
     relative price changes.

effect of fuel prices on the adoption of a new fuel-saving technology in the U.S. electricity-

generation sector. 34

            Jaffe and Stavins (1995) carried out econometric analyses of the factors affecting the

adoption of thermal insulation technologies in new residential construction in the United States

between 1979 and 1988. They examined the dynamic effects of energy prices and technology

adoption costs on average residential energy-efficiency technologies in new home construction. 35

They found that the response of mean energy efficiency to energy price changes was positive and

significant, both statistically and economically. Interestingly, they also found that equivalent

percentage adoption cost changes were about three times as effective as energy price changes in

encouraging adoption, although standard financial analysis would suggest they ought to be about

equal in percentage terms. This finding offers confirmation for the conventional wisdom that

technology adoption decisions are more sensitive to up-front cost considerations than to longer-

term operating expenses.

            Hassett and Metcalf (1995) found an even larger discrepancy between the effect of

changes in installation cost (here coming through tax credits) and changes in energy prices.

There are three interrelated possible explanations for this. One possibility is a behavioral bias

that causes purchasers to focus more on up-front cost than they do on the lifetime operating costs

of an investment. An alternative (but probably indistinguishable) view is that purchasers focus

equally on both, but uncertainty about future energy prices makes them give less weight to the

current energy price (which is only an indicator of future prices) than they do to the capital cost,




34
     For further evidence and discussion, see the survey by Karshenas and Stoneman (1995).
35
     The effects of energy prices can be interpreted as suggesting what the likely effects of taxes on energy use would
     be, and the effects of changes in adoption costs can be interpreted as indicating what the effects of technology
     adoption subsidies would be. See Section V of this chapter.


                                                            37
which is known.           A final interpretation might be that consumers actually have reasonably

accurate expectations about future energy prices, and their decisions reflect those expectations,

but our empirical proxies for their expectations are not correct.

           Kerr and Newell (2000) used a duration model to analyze the influence of plant

characteristics and the stringency and the form of regulation on technology adoption decisions by

petroleum refineries during the leaded gasoline phasedown.                        They found that increased

stringency (which raised the effective price of lead) encouraged greater adoption of lead-

reducing technology. They also found that larger and more technically sophisticated refineries

were more likely to adopt the new technology.

           B. Market Failures in the Technology Diffusion Process

           Inadequate Information.          As discussed in Section II, above, information plays an

important role in the technology diffusion process. There are two reasons why the importance of

information may result in market failure.               First, information is a public good that may be

expected in general to be underprovided by markets. Second, to the extent that the adoption of

the technology by some users is itself an important mode of information transfer to other parties,

adoption creates a positive externality and is therefore likely to proceed at a socially suboptimal

rate. 36 Howarth, et al. (2000) explored the significance of inadequate information in inhibiting

the diffusion of more efficient lighting equipment.                  Metcalf and Hassett (1999) compared

available estimates of energy savings from new equipment to actual savings realized by users

who have installed the equipment.




36
      Transfer of useful information via technology adoption is a special case of the more general phenomenon of
     consumption externalities in technology adoption (Berndt and Pindyck 2000). If early adopters act randomly
     rather than on the basis of better information, then consumption externalities can result in socially excessive
     adoption or ‚Äúherding‚Äù effects.


                                                          38
            Agency Problems.          Also related to imperfect information are a variety of agency

problems that can inhibit the adoption of superior technology. The agency problem can be either

external or internal to organizations. An example of an external agency problem would be a

landlord/tenant relationship, in which a landlord pays for utilities but the tenant makes decisions

regarding which appliances to purchase, or vice versa. Internal agency problems can arise in

organizations where the individual or department responsible for equipment purchase or

maintenance differs from the individual or department whose budget covers utility costs. 37

DeCanio (1998) explored the significance of organizational factors in explaining firms‚Äô

perceived returns to installation of energy-efficient lighting. 38

            Other Market Imperfections.             For households and small firms, adoption of new

technologies with significant capital costs may be constrained by inadequate access to financing.

Finally, in some countries, import barriers may inhibit the adoption of technology embodied in

foreign-produced goods (Reppelin-Hill 1999).

            C. Other Barriers to Technology Diffusion

            Uncertainty. Uncertainty is a factor limiting the adoption of new technology (Geroski

2000). Such uncertainty is not a market failure, merely a fact of economic life. Uncertainty can

be inherent in the technology itself, in the sense that its newness means that users are not sure

how it will be perform (Mansfield 1968). For resource-saving technology, there is the additional

uncertainty that the economic value of such savings depends on future resource prices, which are



37
      For a discussion of the implications of the insulation of environmental decision-making in major firms from
     relevant economic signals, see: Hockenstein et al., (1997). A series of related case studies are provided by
     Reinhardt (2000).
38
      Agency problems are probably part of the basis for the hypothesis that energy-saving investments are ignored
     simply because energy is too small a fraction of overall costs to justify management attention and decisionmaking.
     This idea actually dates back to Alfred Marshall; one of his four laws of demand was ‚Äúthe importance of being



                                                            39
themselves uncertain. This uncertainty about future returns means that there is an ‚Äúoption value‚Äù

associated with postponing the adoption of new technology (Pindyck 1991; Hassett and Metcalf

1995, 1996).

            Discount Rates. Closely related to the issue of uncertainty is the issue of the discount

rate or investment hurdle rate used by purchasers in evaluating the desirability of new

technology, particularly resource-conserving technology. A large body of research demonstrates

that purchasers appear to use relatively high discount rates in evaluating energy-efficiency

investments (Hausman 1979; Ruderman et al. 1987; Ross 1990). The implicit or explicit use of

relatively high discount rates for energy savings does not represent a market failure in itself; it is

rather the manifestation of underlying aspects of the decision process including those just

discussed.        At least some portion of the discount rate premium is likely to be related to

uncertainty, although the extent to which the premium can be explained by uncertainty and

option value is subject to debate (Hassett and Metcalf 1995, 1996; Sanstad et al. 1995). 39 Capital

market failures that make it difficult to secure external financing for these investments may also

play a role.

            D. Increasing Returns and Technology Lock-In

            Increasing returns to adoption ‚Äî in the form of learning curves and positive adoption

externalities ‚Äî are a significant feature of market penetration processes for many technologies.

Learning-by-doing describes how cumulative production experience with a product leads to

reduced production costs, while learning-by-using captures how the value of a good increases for




     unimportant.‚Äù Marshall (1922) argued that inputs with small factor shares would receive little attention from firms
     and hence face inelastic factor demand curves.
39
      Option values can arise for investments that can be postponed, and unless explicit account is taken of the option
     value, it will result in an increased effective hurdle rate for the investment.


                                                            40
consumers as they gain experience using it. Positive adoption externalities arise when a non-

user‚Äôs probability of adoption is increased the greater the number of potential users who have

already adopted (Berndt and Pindyck 2000). This could occur because of fad or herding effects,

or because of ‚Äúnetwork externalities.‚Äù Network externalities exist if a product is technologically

more valuable to an individual user as other users adopt a compatible product (for example,

telephone and computer networks).       These phenomena can be critical to understanding the

existing technological system, forecasting how that system might evolve, and predicting the

potential effect of some policy or event.

       Furthermore, increasing returns to adopting a particular technology or system have been

linked with so-called technology ‚Äúlock-in,‚Äù in which a particular product, technical standard,

production process, or service is produced by a market, and it is difficult to move to an

alternative competing technology. Lock-in implies that, once led down a particular technological

path, the barriers to switching may be prohibitive. This can be problematic if it would have been

in the broader social interest to adopt a fundamentally different pattern of technological capacity.

In turn, it raises the question of whether policy interventions ‚Äî possibly involving central

coordination and information assessment, direct technology subsidies, or publicly funded

research, development, demonstration, and procurement programs ‚Äî might avoid undesirable

cases of technology lock-in by guiding technological paths in directions superior to those that

would be taken by the free market.

       A classic, although somewhat controversial, example given is the QWERTY keyboard

layout (David 1985). As the story goes, the so-called Dvorak keyboard system is ergonomically

more efficient than the standard layout. In other words, we could all type faster and better if we

learned the Dvorak system. Unfortunately, the QWERTY system got there first, so to speak, and



                                                 41
we may be stuck with it, due in part to network externalities and learning-by-doing. In the

energy and environment arenas, similar claims are made regarding renewable energy (Cowan

and Kline 1996), alternative-fuel vehicles (Cowan and Hulten 1996), pesticides (Cowan and

Gumby 1996), electricity supply (Islas 1997), and nuclear power (Cowan 1990). The idea that

we are ‚Äúlocked into‚Äù a fossil-fuel-based energy system is a recurring theme in policy discussions

regarding climate change and other energy-related environmental problems.

       Increasing returns are necessary but not sufficient conditions for persistent and

undesirable lock-in. There must also be costs associated with maintaining parallel rival networks

or ‚Äúswitching costs‚Äù associated with moving between systems (for example, cost of buying a

new keyboard or learning to type on a new keyboard layout). The presence of these factors,

however, in theory has the potential to lead to a market equilibrium in which a socially

suboptimal standard or technology is employed. Nonetheless, an inefficient outcome need not

necessarily result, and if it does it may not be lasting. Market forces will eventually tend to

challenge the predominance of an inferior technology (see Ruttan 1997).

       A related characteristic of products or systems subject to increasing returns or ‚Äúpositive

feedbacks‚Äù is that history can be critical. While other markets can often be explained by current

demand and supply, markets subject to increasing returns may not be fully understandable

without knowing the pattern of historical technology adoption. Work by Arthur (1989, 1990,

1994), David (1985, 1997) and others (Foray 1997) on the importance of such ‚Äúpath

dependence‚Äù have focused on the lasting role that chance historical events can play in leading

market outcomes down one rather than another possible path. It is important to note that

increasing returns and technology lock-in do not necessarily imply market failure. In cases




                                               42
where they may, the question becomes what policies, markets, or institutions, if any, can

ameliorate undesirable technological paths or eventual lock-in.

            We are far from having a well-established theoretical or empirical basis for when

intervention is preferable to an unregulated market outcome or the form that intervention should

take. David (1997, p 36) suggested that perhaps the most productive question to ask is ‚Äúhow can

we identify situations in which it is likely that at some future time individuals really would be

better off had another equilibria been selected‚Äù from the beginning. One thing that public policy

can do, David suggested, is try to delay the market from irreversible commitments before enough

information has been obtained about the likely implications of an early, precedent-setting

decision. 40 One could construe current policy discussions surrounding certain biotechnology

developments as potentially doing just that. At a more aggregate level, there has been much

discussion of the question of whether it is possible for developing countries to take less

environmentally-damaging paths of development than did currently industrialized countries, for

example by relying less on fossil fuels. 41

            Network Externalities.         Besen and Farrell (1994), Katz and Shapiro (1994), and

Liebowitz and Margolis (1994) together provide an overview of issues surrounding network

effects. Several properties of ‚Äúnetwork markets‚Äù distinguish them from other markets, influence

the strategies firms pursue, and may lead to market inefficiencies including oligopoly or

monopoly. Network markets tend to tip; that is, the coexistence of incompatible products may

be unstable, resulting in a single standard dominating the market. Two potential inefficiencies

can also arise due to demand side coordination difficulties in the presence of network

externalities: excess inertia (users wait too long to adopt a new technology) or excess momentum

(users rush to an inferior technology to avoid being stranded) (see Farrell and Saloner 1985). The

role of information is central; the possibility of locking into an inferior technology is greater

when users have incomplete information, and it is expectations about the ultimate size of a

network that is crucial to which technology dominates. The root problem is the difficulty of

collective coordination in a decentralized process (David 1997).

          One way to address this coordination problem is through standards ‚Äî that is, a particular

technology chosen for universal adoption ‚Äî which are often adopted by government or industry

associations when network externalities are present (telephone signals, for example). 42 While

standards may help avoid excess inertia and reduce users‚Äô search and coordination costs, they

can also reduce diversity and may be subject to the strategy of a dominant firm. Katz and

Shapiro (1994) pointed out that while network effects can lead to market inefficiencies, there are

many possible market responses to these problems that do not necessarily involve government

intervention. Furthermore, there is a question about whether the government has the proper

incentives and information to improve the situation. Although network externalities can be an

important element of increasing returns, especially for information and communication

technologies, their role in environmental technologies is less evident.

          Learning-by-Doing and Learning-by-Using. In early production stages, the manufacture

of technologically complex products is fraught with difficulties. As a firm produces more and

more of the product, however, it learns to produce it more efficiently and with higher levels of

quality. Production experience leads to the rationalization of processes, reduced waste, and



42
     See, for example: Katz and Shapiro (1986, 1994).

                                                        44
greater labor force expertise. When this is so, average production costs will tend to decrease

over time and with increases in the firm's cumulative output, albeit at a decreasing rate.

Alternative terms used to denote this characteristic learning pattern and related phenomena

include ‚Äúlearning curve‚Äù, ‚Äúexperience curve‚Äù, ‚Äúlearning-by-doing‚Äù, and ‚Äúprogress function.‚Äù

Energy and environment-related examples include work related to renewable energy and climate

modeling (Nakicenovic 1996; Neij 1997; Gr√ºbler and Messner 1999; Gr√ºbler, et al. 1999),

nuclear reactors (Joskow and Rozanski 1979; Zimmerman 1982; Lester and McCabe 1993), and

electricity supply (Sharp and Price 1990). Learning-by-using, the demand-side counterpart of

learning-by-doing, can complement and reinforce these learning effects as adoption increases

with greater experience in use and increased productivity over time by the user (see Sunding and

Zilberman 2000).

           A technology with an initial cost advantage can allow for pricing that increases market

share. In turn, increased market share can lead to even greater learning, cost reductions, and

competitive advantage ‚Äî a virtuous circle for the firms producing the technology.

Unfortunately, as with network effects, this persistent cost advantage can create a kind of entry

barrier if knowledge spillovers are incomplete.                  In the extreme, the cost advantage may

completely deter or ‚Äúlock out‚Äù the entry of new technologies or rival systems, at least for a time.

Spence (1981) showed that the main factors affecting costs and competition in the presence of

learning are the rate of learning, the extent of learning-induced cost decline relative to the

market, the intertemporal pattern of demand (that is, demand elasticity and growth), and the

degree of spillovers of learning to other firms. 43

V. Effects of Alternative Environmental Policy Instruments on Technological Change


            The effect of environmental policies on the development and spread of new technologies

may, in the long run, be among the most important determinants of success or failure in

environmental protection (Kneese and Schultze 1975). 44                       It has long been recognized that

alternative types of environmental policy instruments can have significantly different effects on

the rate and direction of technological change (Orr 1976). Environmental policies, particularly

those with large economic impacts (for example, those intended to address global climate

change) can be designed to foster rather than inhibit technological invention, innovation, and

diffusion (Kempe and Soete 1990).
            A. Categories of Policy Instruments and Criteria for Comparisons


            For purposes of examining the link between environmental policy instruments and

technological change, policies can be characterized as either command-and-control or market-

based approaches. Market-based instruments are mechanisms that encourage behavior through

market signals rather than through explicit directives regarding pollution control levels or

methods. These policy instruments ‚Äî such as pollution charges, subsidies, tradeable permits,

and some types of information programs ‚Äî have been described as ‚Äúharnessing market forces.‚Äù

This is because if they are well designed and implemented, they encourage firms (and/or

individuals) to undertake pollution control efforts that are in their own interests and that

collectively meet policy goals. 45




     provide an excellent overview of the fairly large empirical literature on learning curves, which spans the fields of
     economics, marketing, and business administration.
44
       Whereas we focus in this section of the chapter on the effects of environmental policy instruments on
     technological change, it is also the case that exogenous technological change can differentially affect the
     performance of alternative environmental policy instruments. For example, technological change in monitoring
     and enforcement, such as improvements in remote-sensing of motor vehicle emissions, could render particular
     policy instruments that focus on emissions, rather than abatement equipment, more attractive.
45
     See the chapter on ‚ÄúExperience with Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Protection‚Äù in this volume.


                                                             46
            Conventional approaches to regulating the environment are often referred to as

‚Äúcommand-and-control‚Äù regulations, since they allow relatively little flexibility in the means of

achieving goals. Such regulations tend to force firms to take on similar shares of the pollution-

control burden, regardless of the cost. Command-and-control regulations do this by setting

uniform standards for firms, the most prevalent of which are technology- and performance-based

standards.         Technology-based standards specify the method, and sometimes the actual

equipment, that firms must use to comply with a particular regulation. A performance standard

sets a uniform control target for firms, while allowing some latitude in how this target is met.

            Holding all firms to the same target can be expensive and, in some circumstances,

counterproductive. While standards may effectively limit emissions of pollutants, they typically

exact relatively high costs in the process, by forcing some firms to resort to unduly expensive

means of controlling pollution. Because the costs of controlling emissions may vary greatly

among firms, and even among sources within the same firm, 46 the appropriate technology in one

situation may not be appropriate (cost-effective) in another.

             All of these forms of intervention have the potential for inducing or forcing some

amount of technological change, because by their very nature they induce or require firms to do

things they would not otherwise do. Performance and technology standards can be explicitly

designed to be "technology forcing," mandating performance levels that are not currently viewed

as technologically feasible or mandating technologies that are not fully developed. One problem

with these approaches, however, is that while regulators can typically assume that some amount

of improvement over existing technology will always be feasible, it is impossible to know how

much. Standards must either be made unambitious, or else run the risk of being ultimately

unachievable, leading to great political and economic disruption (Freeman and Haveman 1972).




46
      Control costs can vary enormously due to a firm‚Äôs production design, physical configuration, inputs, age of assets,
     and other factors.


                                                             47
           Technology standards are particularly problematic, since they tend to freeze the

development of technologies that might otherwise result in greater levels of control. Under

regulations that are targeted at technologies, as opposed to emissions levels, no financial

incentive exists for businesses to exceed control targets, and the adoption of new technologies is

discouraged. Under a ‚ÄúBest Available Control Technology‚Äù (BACT) standard, a business that

adopts a new method of pollution abatement may be ‚Äúrewarded‚Äù by being held to a higher

standard of performance and thereby not benefit financially from its investment, except to the

extent that its competitors have even more difficulty reaching the new standard (Hahn and

Stavins 1991). On the other hand, if third parties can invent and patent better equipment, they

can ‚Äî in theory ‚Äî have a ready market. Under such conditions, a BACT type of standard can

provide a positive incentive for technology innovation. Unfortunately, as we note below, there

has been very little theoretical or empirical analysis of such technology-forcing regulations.

           In contrast with such command-and-control regulations, market-based instruments can

provide powerful incentives for companies to adopt cheaper and better pollution-control

technologies. This is because with market-based instruments, it pays firms to clean up a bit more

if a sufficiently low-cost method (technology or process) of doing so can be identified and

adopted.
       In theory, the relative importance of the dynamic effects of alternative policy instruments

on technological change (and hence long-term compliance costs) is greater in the case of those

environmental problems which are of great magnitude (in terms of anticipated abatement costs)

and/or very long time horizon. 47 Hence, the increased attention that is being given by scholars




47
      Parry et al. (2000) showed that the importance of the welfare gains from cost-reducing technological change
     relative to the welfare gains from optimal pollution control using existing technology tends to be higher when
     marginal benefits are flatter, marginal costs are steeper (and optimal abatement is lower), the discount rate is
     lower, the rate of technological change is faster, and research costs are lower.

and by policy makers to the problem of global climate change 48 has greatly increased the

prominence of the issues that are considered in this part of the chapter.

            There are two principal ways in which environmental policy instruments can be

compared with regard to their effects on technological change. First and foremost, scholars have

asked ‚Äî both with theoretical models and with empirical analyses ‚Äî the most direct question:

what effects do particular instruments have on the rate and direction of relevant technological

change? In keeping with the Schumpeterian trichotomy identified above, such investigations can

be carried out with reference to the pace of invention, innovation, or diffusion of new

technologies.

            It is also possible to ask whether environmental policies encourage efficient rates (and

directions) of technological change, or more broadly, whether such policies result in overall

economic efficiency (that is, whether the efficient degree of environmental protection is

achieved). This second principal mode for comparison is linked more directly with criteria

associated with welfare economics, but such comparisons have been made much less frequently

than have direct assessments of technology effects. Within the limits of the existing literature,

we consider both sets of criteria. 49

            Most of the work in the economics literature on the dynamic effects of environmental

policy instruments on technological change has been theoretical, rather than empirical, and so we

consider the theoretical literature first.

     between technological change and global climate policy, see: Jaffe, et al. (1999).
49
      Enforceability of environmental regulations is another criteria for policy choice that it is rarely emphasized in the
     technology literature. See Macauley and Brennan (1998) for an evaluation of the potential role of remote sensing
     technology in the enforcement of environmental regulations.


                                                              49
        B. Theoretical Analyses of the Effects of Alternative Policy Instruments


        As emphasized above, both supply-side and demand-side influences affect each of the

three stages of technological change, but demand-side factors become relatively more important

the further we progress from invention, to innovation, to diffusion. The major force encouraging

adoption behavior is essentially anticipated utilization, just as the major force affecting

commercialization appears to be expected sales (adoption). The upstream link with inventive

activity, however, is somewhat weaker. We begin our review of theoretical analyses of the

effects of policy instruments with studies that have focused on effects on invention and

innovation, moving subsequently to studies that focus on effects on diffusion.


                1. Theoretical Analyses of Effects of Policy Instruments on Invention and
                   Innovation


        Although, as we suggested above, decisions about technology commercialization are

partly a demand-side function of anticipated sales (adoption), the relevant literature comparing

the effects of alternative environmental policy instruments has given greater attention to the

supply side, focusing on incentives for firm-level decisions to incur R&D costs in the face of

uncertain outcomes. Models of innovation have either allowed for firms to choose their research

and development expenditures (Magat 1978, 1979) or have somehow incorporated uncertainty

over the outcome of research (Biglaiser and Horowitz 1995; Biglaiser, et al. 1995). Such R&D

could be either inventive or innovative, and the theoretical literature in this area makes no

particular distinction.

        Magat (1978) compared effluent taxes and CAC standards using an innovation

possibilities frontier (IPF) model of induced innovation, where research can be used to augment

capital or labor in a standard production function. He compared the output rate, effluent rate,

output-effluent ratio, and bias (in terms of labor or capital augmenting technical change), but this

produced ambiguous results.       Magat (1979) compared taxes, subsidies, permits, effluent

standards, and technology standards, and showed that all but technology standards would induce

                                                 50
innovation biased toward emissions reduction. 50 If taxes and permits are set so that they lead to

the same reduction in emissions as an effluent standard at all points in time, then the three

instruments provide the same incentives to innovate.

           A theoretical ranking of policy instruments in terms of their ability to achieve the optimal

level of innovation was provided by Fischer, et al. (1998). Once the benefits of innovation were

assessed (rather than the level of innovation), however, an unambiguous ranking of policy

instruments was not forthcoming. Rather, the ranking of policy instruments was shown by the

authors to depend on firms‚Äô adoption costs, environmental benefit functions, and the number of

firms producing emissions. The basic model consists of three stages. First, firms decide how

much to invest in R&D by setting their marginal cost of innovation equal to their marginal

benefits.       Second, firms decide whether or not to adopt the technology, use an (inferior)

imitation, or do nothing. Finally, firms minimize control expenditures by setting their marginal

costs equal to the price of pollution. Policy instruments affect the firms‚Äô decisions through four

effects: (1) an abatement cost affect; (2) an emissions payment effect; (3) an imitation effect; and

(4) an adoption price effect. Generally, market-based instruments encourage innovation through

the abatement cost effect, but discourage it through the imitation and adoption price effects,

although there is some variation in this pattern depending on the instrument. Table 3 summarizes

the direction of the four effects under three alternative policy instruments. The ranking of

instruments depends on the relative strength of the four effects.




50
     Technology standards provided no incentives for innovation whatsoever.

            In an analysis that is reminiscent of Fischer, et al. (1998), Ulph (1998) compared the

effects of pollution taxes and command-and-control standards, and found that increases in the

stringency of the standard or tax had ambiguous effects on the level of R&D, because

environmental regulations have two competing effects: a direct effect of increasing costs, which

increases the incentives to invest in R&D in order to develop cost-saving pollution-abatement

methods; and an indirect effect of reducing product output, which reduces the incentive to

engage in R&D. 51

            Laffont and Tirole (1996a) recognized the inability of the government to induce the

optimal level of innovation through an ordinary tradeable permit system, and asked how such

systems could ‚Äî in theory ‚Äî be modified to achieve the desired incentive effects. They

demonstrated that although spot markets for permits cannot induce the socially optimal degree of

innovation, futures markets can improve the situation (Laffont and Tirole 1996a). 52



51
     In addition, Ulph (1998) examined a situation where two firms produce identical products with two characteristics.
     If both firms innovate on the same characteristic, price competition will eliminate any gains from R&D; but
     consumer pressure can affect the direction of R&D by influencing the characteristic that firms focus on improving.
     See also: Ulph and Ulph (1996).
52
     In a subsequent analysis, Laffont and Tirole (1996b) examined the government‚Äôs ability to influence the degree of
     innovative activity by setting the number of permits (and permit prices) in various ways in a dynamic setting.


                                                            52
           The literature on the effects of alternative policy instruments on technology innovation in

non-competitive settings is limited.             Montero (2000) compared instruments under non-

competitive circumstances, but found ‚Äî not surprisingly ‚Äî that the results are less clear than

with perfect competition is assumed. He modeled a two-firm oligopoly facing environmental

regulation in the form of emissions standards, freely-allocated permits, auctioned permits, and

taxes. Firms can invest in R&D to lower their marginal abatement costs, and they can also

benefit from spillover effects from the other firm‚Äôs R&D efforts. In choosing whether and how

much to invest in R&D in order to maximize profits, a firm must consider two effects of its

investment choice: (1) the increase in profits due to a decrease in its abatement costs (less the

R&D cost); and (2) the decrease in profits due to changes in the other firm‚Äôs output, as a result of

spillover from the first firm‚Äôs R&D. The result is that standards and taxes yield higher incentives

for R&D when the market is characterized by Cournot competition, but the opposite holds when

the market is characterized by Bertrand competition. 53

           Cadot and Sinclair-Desgagne (1996) posed the following question:                   if a potentially

regulated industry has private information on the costs of technological advances in pollution

control (frequently a reasonable assumption), then since the industry has an incentive to claim

that such technologies are prohibitively expensive (even if that is not the case), can the

government somehow design an incentive scheme that will avoid the problems of this

information asymmetry? The authors developed a solution to this game-theoretic problem. Not

surprisingly, the scheme involves government issued threats of regulation (which diminish over

time as the firm completes stages of technology development).

           Taking a somewhat broader view than most economic studies, Carraro and Siniscalco

(1994) suggested that environmental policy instruments should be viewed jointly with traditional

industrial policy instruments in determining the optimal way to attain a given degree of pollution


53
     Addressing the same trade-off, Katsoulacos and Xepapadeas (1996) found that a simultaneous tax on pollution
     emissions and subsidy to environmental R&D may be better suited to overcoming the joint market failure
     (negative externality from pollution and positive externality or spillover effects of R&D).


                                                        53
abatement. They showed that innovation subsidies can be used to attain the same environmental

target, but without the output reductions that result from pollution taxes. Similarly, Carraro and

Soubeyran (1996) compared an emission tax and an R&D subsidy, and found that an R&D

subsidy is desirable if the output contractions induced by the tax are small or if the government

finds output contractions undesirable for other reasons.


                     2. Theoretical Analyses of Effects of Policy Instruments on Diffusion


            The predominant theoretical framework for analyses of diffusion effects has been what

could be called the ‚Äúdiscrete technology choice‚Äù model: firms contemplate the use of a certain

technology which reduces marginal costs of pollution abatement and which has a known fixed

cost associated with it.            While some authors have presented this approach as a model of

‚Äúinnovation,‚Äù 54 it is more appropriately viewed as a model of adoption.

            With such models, several theoretical studies have found that the incentive for the

adoption of new technologies is greater under market-based instruments than under direct

regulation (Zerbe 1970; 55 Downing and White 1986; Milliman and Prince 1989; Jung, et al.

1996). With the exception of Downing and White (1986), all of these studies examined the gross

impacts of alternative policy instruments on the quantity of technology adoption. 56

            Theoretical comparisons among market-based instruments have produced some

inconsistencies, but these disagreements seem to have been resolved. In a frequently-cited



54
     Downing and White (1986) and Malueg (1989) framed their work in terms of ‚Äúinnovation.‚Äù Milliman and Prince
     (1989) used one model to discuss both diffusion and ‚Äúinnovation,‚Äù the latter being defined essentially as the initial
     use of the technology by an ‚Äúinnovating‚Äù firm.
55
     Zerbe (1970) compared taxes, subsidies, and direct regulation (emissions standards). If a technology reduces
     emissions levels, rather than costs, taxes are still superior to direct regulation, but subsidies are not.
56
     Downing and White (1986) compared market-based instruments and command-and-control standards, and found
     for the case of small changes in emissions (so that the optimal pollution tax or permit quantity is unchanged) that
     all of the instruments except CAC standards would induce the socially optimal level of adoption. But for non-
     marginal emission changes, where the control authority does not modify the policy (tax or quantity of available
     permits), market-based instruments would induce too much diffusion, relative to the social optimum.


                                                             54
article, Milliman and Prince (1989) examined firm-level incentives for technology diffusion

provided by five instruments: command-and-control; emission taxes; emission subsidies; freely-

allocated emission permits, and auctioned emission permits. Firm-level incentives for adoption

in this representative-firm model were pictured as the consequent change in producer surplus.

They found that auctioned permits would provide the largest adoption incentive of any

instrument, with emissions taxes and subsidies second, and freely allocated permits and direct

controls last. The Milliman and Prince (1989) study was criticized by Marin (1991) because of

its assumption of identical firms, but it was subsequently shown that the results remain largely

unchanged with heterogeneous abatement costs (Milliman and Prince 1992).
      In 1996, Jung, et al. built on Milliman and Prince's basic framework for comparing the

effects of alternative policy instruments, but rather than focusing on firm-level changes in

producer surplus, they considered heterogeneous firms, and modeled the ‚Äúmarket-level

incentive‚Äù created by various instruments. 57 Their rankings echoed those of Milliman and Prince

(1989): auctioned permits provided the greatest incentive, followed by taxes and subsidies, free

permits, and performance standards.

            More recent theoretical analyses (Parry 1998; Denicol√≤ 1999; Keohane 1999) have

clarified several aspects of these rankings. First, there is the question of relative firm-level

incentives to adopt a new, cost-saving technology when the price of pollution (permit price or tax

level) is endogenous. Milliman and Prince (1989), as well as Jung, et al. (1996), argued that

auctioned permits would provide greater incentives for diffusion than freely-allocated permits,

because technology diffusion lowers the equilibrium permit price, bringing greater aggregate

benefits of adoption in a regime where all sources are permit buyers (that is, auctions). But when

technology diffusion lowers the market price for tradeable permits, all firms benefit from this



57
     This measure is simply the aggregate cost savings to the industry as a whole from adopting the technology.


                                                           55
lower price regardless of whether or not they adopt the given technology (Keohane 1999). Thus,

if firms are price takers in the permit market, auctioned permits provide no more adoption

incentive than freely-allocated permits.

            The overall result is that both auctioned and freely-allocated permits are inferior in their

diffusion incentives to emission tax systems (but superior to command-and-control instruments).

Under tradeable permits, technology diffusion lowers the equilibrium permit price, thereby

reducing the incentive for participating firms to adopt. Thus, a permit system provides a lower

adoption incentive than a tax, assuming the two instruments are equivalent before diffusion

occurs (Denicol√≤ 1999; Keohane 1999). 58

            Complete theoretical analysis of the effects of alternative policy instruments on the rate

of technological change must include modeling of the government‚Äôs response to technological

change, because the degree to which regulators respond to technologically-induced changes in

abatement costs affects the magnitude of the adoption incentive associated with alternative

policy instruments. 59 Because technology diffusion presumably lowers the aggregate marginal

abatement cost function, it results in a change in the efficient level of control. Hence, following

diffusion, the optimal agency response is to set a more ambitious target. Milliman and Price

(1989) examined the incentives facing private industry, under alternative policy instruments, to

oppose such policy changes. Their conclusion was that firms would oppose optimal agency



58
     The difference between diffusion incentives of permits and taxes/subsidies depends upon four conditions: (1)
     some diffusion occurs; (2) firms have rational expectations and recognize that diffusion lowers the permit price;
     (3) taxes and permits are equivalent ex ante; and (4) the level of regulation is fixed over the time horizon
     considered. Parry (1998) found that the welfare gain induced by an emissions tax is significantly greater than that
     induced by tradable permits only in the case of very major innovations. Similarly, Requate (1998) included an
     explicit model of the final output market, and finds that whether (auctioned) permits or taxes provide stronger
     incentives to adopt an improved technology depends upon empirical values of relevant parameters. See, also:
     Parry (1995).
59
     See our discussion, above, of ‚ÄúInduced Innovation and Optimal Environmental Policy‚Äù in Section III.D.


                                                            56
adjustment of the policy under all instruments except taxes. Under an emissions tax, the optimal

agency response to cost-reducing technological change is to lower the tax rate (assuming convex

damages); under a subsidy, the optimal response is to lower the subsidy; under tradeable permit

systems, the optimal response is to decrease the number of available permits, and thereby drive

up the permit price. Thus, firms have unambiguous incentives to support the optimal agency

response only under an emissions tax regime.

       In a comparison of tradeable permits and pollution taxes, Biglaiser, et al. (1995)

examined these instruments‚Äô ability to achieve the first-best outcome in a dynamic setting. They

found that effluent taxes can do so, but permits cannot. With an effluent tax, the optimal tax is

presumably determined by marginal damages (which the authors assume to be constant),

yielding a policy which is time consistent. Whether or not firms adopt a cost-saving technology,

the government has no incentive to change the tax rate.         From this perspective, however,

tradeable permits are not time consistent, because the optimal number of permits in each period

depends on both firms‚Äô costs, which are determined by all previous investments, and marginal

damages. With constant marginal damages, and marginal abatement costs decreasing over time,

the optimal number of permits should also be decreasing over time. Firms may internalize this,

and thereby invest less than optimally in pollution control technology.

       The unambiguous result of Biglaiser, et al. (1995) depends, however, on the assumption

of constant marginal damages. If marginal damages are not constant, then the optimal policy is

determined by the interaction of marginal damages and marginal abatement costs for both taxes

and permits. The result appears to be analogous to Weitzman's (1974) rule: if the marginal

damage curve is relatively flat and there is uncertainty in marginal costs (from the regulator's




                                                57
perspective) due to potential innovation at the firm level, then a price instrument is more

efficient.



        C. Empirical Analyses of the Effects of Alternative Policy Instruments


        Empirical analyses of the relative effects of alternative environmental policy instruments

on the rate and direction of technological change have been limited in number. Most analyses

have investigated technological change in energy-efficiency, and thus are related to

environmental policy partly because of the relevance of fossil-fuel energy generation for global

climate policy and other air pollution problems. These studies can be considered within the three

stages of technological change ‚Äî invention, innovation, and diffusion. We take these in order,

beginning with invention and innovation.


               1. Empirical Analyses of Effects of Policy Instruments on Invention and
                  Innovation

        As described in Section III.A, above, the innovation process can be thought of as

affecting improvements in the characteristics of products on the market, and the process can be

framed as the shifting inward over time of a frontier representing the tradeoffs between different

product characteristics for the range of models available on the market. If one axis is the cost of

the product and another axis is the energy flow associated with a product, that is, its energy

intensity, then innovation is represented by inward shifts of the curve ‚Äî greater energy

efficiency at the same cost, or lower cost for given energy efficiency. With this approach,

Newell, et. al (1999) assessed the effects of changes in energy prices and in energy-efficiency

standards in stimulating innovation (see Section III.C, above). Energy price changes induced

both commercialization of new models and elimination of old models. Regulations, however,

worked largely through energy-inefficient models being dropped, since that is the intended effect


                                                58
of the energy-efficiency standards (models below a certain energy efficiency level may not be

offered for sale).

        A closely related approach to investigating the same phenomena is that of hedonic price

functions. Given the attention paid to automobile fuel economy over the past two decades, it is

not surprising that several hedonic studies of automobiles have addressed or focused on energy-

efficiency, including Ohta and Griliches (1976) and Goodman (1983). Atkinson and Halvorsen

(1984) found that the fuel efficiency of the new car fleet responds more than proportionally to

changes in expected fuel prices. Using an analogue to the hedonic price technique, Wilcox

(1984) constructed a quality-adjusted measure of automobile fuel economy over the period

1952‚Äì1980, finding that it was positively related to oil prices. Ohta and Griliches (1986) found

that gasoline price changes over the period 1970‚Äì1981 could alone explain much of the observed

change in related automobile characteristics.

        More recently, Pakes, et. al (1993) investigated the effects of gasoline prices on the fuel

economy of motor vehicles offered for sale, and found that the observed increase in miles per

gallon (mpg) from 1977 onward was largely due to the consequent change in the mix of vehicles

on the market. Fewer low-mpg cars were marketed, and more high-mpg cars were marketed.

Subsequently, Berry, et al. (1996) combined plant-level cost data for the automobile industry and

information on the characteristics of models that were produced at each plant to estimate a

hedonic cost function ‚Äî the supply-side component of the hedonic price function ‚Äî finding that

quality-adjusted costs generally increased over the period 1972‚Äì1982, thus coinciding with

rising gasoline prices and emission standards.

        Finally, Goldberg (1998) combined a demand-side model of discrete vehicle choice and

utilization with a supply-side model of oligopoly and product differentiation to estimate the



                                                 59
effects of Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards (CAFE) standards on the fuel economy of

the new car fleet. She found that automobile fuel operating costs have had a significant effect,

although a gasoline tax of a magnitude that could match the effect of CAFE on fuel economy

would have to be very large. 60



                    2. Empirical Analyses of Effects of Policy Instruments on Diffusion


           Turning to the effects of environmental policy instruments on technology diffusion, the

analysis by Jaffe and Stavins (1995), described above in Section IV.A, provided evidence of the

likely effects of energy taxes and technology adoption subsidies on the adoption of thermal

insulation technologies in new residential construction in the United States.                    Their findings

suggest the response to energy taxes would be positive and significant, and that equivalent

percentage technology cost subsidies would be about three times as effective as taxes in

encouraging adoption, although standard financial analysis would suggest they ought to be about

equal in percentage terms. These results were corroborated by the study of residential energy

conservation investments by Hassett and Metcalf (1995), also described in Section IV.A, which

suggested that tax credits for adoption would be up to eight times more effective than

‚Äúequivalent‚Äù energy taxes.

           Although empirical evidence from these two studies indicate that subsidies may be more

effective than ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù taxes in encouraging technology diffusion, it is important to

recognize some disadvantages of such subsidy approaches. First, unlike energy prices, (energy-

efficiency) adoption subsidies do not provide incentives to reduce utilization.                          Second,

technology subsidies and tax credits can require large public expenditures per unit of effect,

since consumers who would have purchased the product even in the absence of the subsidy still



60
      In one of the few attempts to analyze directly the effects of environmental policy instruments on technology
     innovation, Bellas (1998) investigated changes in scrubbers at electric power plants.


                                                         60
receive it.       In the presence of fiscal constraints on public spending, this raises questions about

the feasibility of subsidies that would be sizable enough to have desired effects. 61

            What about conventional command-and-control approaches? Jaffe and Stavins (1995)

also examined the effects of more conventional regulations on technology diffusion, in the form

of state building codes. They found no discernable effects. It is unclear to what extent this is

due to inability to measure the true variation across states in the effectiveness of codes, or to

codes that were in many cases not binding relative to typical practice. This is a reminder,

however, that although energy taxes, for example, will always have some effect, typical

command-and-control approaches may have little effect if they are set below existing standards

of practice.

            One of the great successes during the modern era of environmental policy was the

phasedown of lead in gasoline, which took place in the United States principally during the

decade of the 1980's. The phasedown was accomplished through a tradeable permit system
                                                                                                                62
among refineries, whereby lead rights could be exchanged and/or banked for later use.                                As

noted in Section IV.A, Kerr and Newell (2000) used a duration model to assess the effects of the

phasedown program on technology diffusion.                     They found that the tradeable permit system

provided incentives for efficient technology adoption decisions. Refineries with relatively low

costs of individual compliance (‚Äúsellers‚Äù versus ‚Äúbuyers‚Äù in the permit market) were more likely

to adopt lead-reducing technology than they would have been under a conventional performance

standard. 63


61
     Mountain, et al. (1989) attempted to assess the effects of relative prices on relevant technology diffusion in the
     Ontario manufacturing sector from 1962 to 1984. They found that fuel choices changed in response to changes in
     fuel prices, but given the nature of their analysis, they could not distinguish between product substitution and
     technology diffusion.
62
     The tradeable permit system was also a great success. See the chapter on ‚ÄúExperience with Market-Based
     Instruments for Environmental Protection‚Äù in this volume.
63
     Another prominent application of tradeable permit systems which provides an opportunity for empirical analysis of
     the effects of policy instruments on technology diffusion is the sulfur dioxide allowance trading program, initiated
     under the U.S. Clean Air Act amendments of 1990. Several research efforts are currently underway, and a number
     of relevant hypotheses are described by Stavins (1998).


                                                            61
            Attention has also been given to the effects on technology diffusion of voluntary

environmental programs. Howarth, et al. (2000) examined two voluntary programs of the U.S.

Environmental Protection Agency, the Green Lights and Energy Star programs, both of which

are intended to encourage greater private industry use of energy-saving technologies. A natural

question from economics is why would firms carry out additional technology investments as part

of a voluntary agreement? The authors respond that there are a set of agency problems that

inhibit economically wise adoption of some technologies (see discussion of these issues in

Section IV). For example, most energy-saving investments are small, and senior staff may

rationally choose to restrict funds for small projects that cannot be perfectly monitored. The

Green Lights program may be said to attempt to address this type of agency problem by

providing information on savings opportunities at the level of the firm where decisions are

made. 64

            Although there are strong theoretical arguments against the efficiency or cost-

effectiveness of command-and-control technology standards, there has been relatively little

empirical research on the actual effects of technology-mandates on the rate and direction of

technology diffusion. In addition to the work described above by Jaffe and Stavins (1995), in

which building codes were found to be ineffective at encouraging the adoption of particular

energy-efficiency technologies in new home construction, Purvis and Outlaw (1995) carried out

a case study of EPA‚Äôs permitting process for acceptable water-pollution control technologies in

the U.S. livestock production sector. Those authors concluded that the relevant regulations

encouraged the use of ‚Äútime-tested‚Äù technologies that provided lower levels of environmental

protection than other more innovative ones, simply because producers knew that EPA was more

likely to approve a permit that employed the established approach.




64
     Another potential explanation arises where the benefits and costs of a project are born by different units of a firm.
     Under such circumstances, projects that are good for the firm may not be undertaken. See discussion of this
     phenomenon in the chapter on ‚ÄúExperience with Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Protection.‚Äù


                                                             62
            More striking in regard to the effects of command-and control standards on technology

diffusion (and environmental quality) is a body of research that has examined the effects of such

standards when combined with ‚Äúdifferential environmental regulations.‚Äù In many situations

where command-and-control standards have been used, the required level of pollution abatement

has been set at a far more stringent level for new sources than for existing ones. 65                        There is

empirical evidence that such differential environmental regulations have lengthened the time

before plants were retired (Maloney and Brady 1988; Nelson et al. 1993). Further, this dual

system can actually worsen pollution by encouraging firms to keep older, dirtier plants in

operation (Stewart 1981; Gollop and Roberts 1983; McCubbins et al. 1989).

            In addition to economic incentives, direct regulation, and information provision, some

research has emphasized the role that ‚Äúinformal regulation‚Äù or community pressure can play in

encouraging the adoption of environmentally clean technologies. For example, in an analysis of

fuel adoption decisions for traditional brick kilns in Mexico, Blackman and Bannister (1998)

suggested that community pressure applied by competing firms and local non-governmental

organizations was associated with increased adoption of cleaner fuels, even when those fuels had

relatively high variable costs.

VI. Conclusion

            In opening this chapter, we suggested that an understanding of the process of

technological change is important for economic analysis of environmental issues for two broad

reasons. First, the environmental impact of social and economic activity is greatly affected by

the rate and direction of technological change. This linkage occurs because new technologies

may either create or mitigate pollution, and because many environmental problems and policy




65
     It could be argued that new plants ought to have somewhat more stringent standards if their abatement costs are
     lower, although such standards should obviously be linked with actual abatement costs, not with the proxy of plant
     vintage.


                                                            63
responses are evaluated over timeframes in which the cumulative impact of technological

changes is likely to be large.

        The importance of the first link is manifest in determining the economic and

environmental ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù against which to measure the impacts of proposed policies. That is,

before we can discuss what we should or should not do about some environmental problem, we

need to forecast how severe the problem will be in the absence of any action. Such forecasts are

always based, in some way, on extrapolation of historical experience. Within that historical

experience, the processes of technological change have been operating, often with significant

consequences for the severity of environmental impacts. Forecasts for the future based on this

historical experience depend profoundly on the relative magnitude of the effects of price-induced

technological change, learning-by-doing and learning-by-using, public sector R&D, and

exogenous technical progress. Sorting out these influences with respect to environmentally

relevant technologies and sectors poses a major modeling and empirical challenge.

        A particularly important aspect of this set of issues is the historical significance of ‚Äúlock-

in‚Äù phenomena for environmentally significant technologies.          We understand the theory of

increasing returns and other sources of path dependence, but we have almost no evidence

regarding their quantitative importance. We know that it is theoretically possible, for example,

that the dominant place of the internal combustion engine in our economy results from a

combination of historical accidents and path dependence. But the actual magnitude of such

effects, relative to the role played by the superior attractiveness of the technology to individual

users, has enormous consequences for the question of whether developing nations will be able or

likely to find a different path.




                                                  64
       Another important area is in the conceptual and empirical modeling of how the various

stages of technological change are interrelated, how they unfold over time, and the differential

impact that various policies (for example, public-sector R&D, R&D subsidies to the private

sector, environmental taxes, information programs) may have on each phase of technological

change. We have reviewed the existing literature on various aspects of technology policy, but

there has been relatively little empirical analysis of these policy options directed specifically at

the development of environmentally beneficial technology.

       There has been much debate surrounding the ‚Äúwin-win‚Äù hypothesis. Much of this debate

has been explicitly or implicitly ideological (Do firms really profit-maximize) or political (Can

we afford a variety of new environmental mandates).             More useful would be detailed

examinations regarding the kinds of policies and the kinds of private-sector institutions that are

most likely to generate innovative, low-cost solutions to environmental problems.

       This observation is a natural bridge to the second broad linkage between technology and

environment, the effect of environmental policy interventions on the process of technological

change. The empirical evidence to date is generally consistent with theoretical findings that

market-based instruments for environmental protection are likely to have significantly greater,

positive impacts over time than command-and-control approaches on the invention, innovation,

and diffusion of desirable, environmentally-friendly technologies.        Further, these empirical

studies suggest that the response of technological change to relevant price changes can be

surprisingly swift, typically less than five years for much of the response in terms of patenting

activity and introduction of new model offerings. Substantial diffusion can sometimes take

considerably longer, depending on the rate of retirement of previously installed equipment. The

longevity of much equipment reinforces the importance of taking a longer-term view toward



                                                 65
improvements ‚Äî on the order of decades. Existing empirical studies have also produced some

results that are not consistent with theoretical expectations, such as the finding from two

independent analyses that the diffusion of energy-efficiency technologies is more sensitive to

variation in adoption-cost than to commensurate energy price changes.         Further theoretical

and/or empirical work may resolve this apparent anomaly.

       A variety of refutable hypotheses that emerge from theoretical models of alternative

instruments have not been tested rigorously with empirical data. For example, the predictions

from theory regarding the ranking of alternative environmental policy instruments is quite clear,

but much of the empirical analysis has focused on energy-efficient technologies, rather than

pollution abatement technologies per se. The increased use of market-based instruments and

performance-based standards has brought with it considerably more data with which hypotheses

regarding the effects of policy instruments on technology innovation and diffusion can be tested.

       The potential long-run consequences of today‚Äôs policy choices create a high priority for

broadening and deepening our understanding of the effects of environmental policy on

innovation and diffusion of new technology. Unfortunately, these issues cannot be resolved at a

purely theoretical level, or on the basis of aggregate empirical analyses. For both benefit-cost

and cost-effectiveness analysis, we need to know the magnitudes of these effects, and these

magnitudes are likely to differ across markets, technologies, and institutional settings. Thus,

taking seriously the notion of induced technological change and its consequences for

environmental policy requires going beyond demonstration studies that test whether or not such

effects exist, to carry out detailed analyses in a variety of sectors in order to understand the

circumstances under which they are large or small.         This will require significant research

attention from multiple methodological viewpoints over an extended period of time. But the



                                                66
alternative is continuing to formulate public policies with significant economic and

environmental consequences without being able to take into account what is going on ‚Äúinside the

black box‚Äù of technological change.
