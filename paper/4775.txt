                                          ABSTRACT

       Real estate markets are periodically plagued by excess supply, rent concessions and few

arms-length transactions. During such periods, valuation is problematic. The model presented

here requires the forecasts of future vacancy rates, and equilibrium and actual rental rates.

Vacancy rate forecasts of market participants are obtained, the equilibrium rental rate is specified

as the cost of capital, and a rental adjustment equation is estimated in which real effective

Sydney office market rents are related to gaps between both natural and actual vacancy rates and

equilibrium and actual real effective rental rates.
       Value estimates (relative to replacement cost) for 1992, including that for above-market

leases, are computed and the sensitivity to key assumptions is shown. Value/i'eplaccmentcost

calculations are then made for the entire 1985-92 period and contrasted with comparable

estimates implicit in data published by BOMA and LW, two prominent Australian real estate

sources. Lastly, the ratios of real effective rents to equilibrium rents and value to replacement

cost are projected for the 1993-2006 period.

        In equilibrium,     real estate will be valued at (approximately)

replacement cost.       When value exceeds replacement cost in a market, new

construction surges, raising vacancies and lowering rents and thus        value.
When replacement cost exceeds value, replacement construction is deferred,

lowering vacancies and raising rents and value. Moreover, expectations of the

construction, vacancy and rent responses imply that existing real estate

values will be only modestly sensitive to changes in required real after—tax

returns caused by real interest rate or     tax   changes.' Because hig1er long—

term real interest rates lower real estate values, construction declines and

rental income on existing properties rise. That is, the rental cash flows on

existing real estate are more analogous to those on a sluggishly adjusting

adjustable—rate     loan than to the fixed coupons on a long—term bond; thus the
percentage real estate value decline would be far less than that of a long—
tern   bond.

        As a result of the construction response mechanism, deviations of real

estate values greater than five percent from replacement cost would be rare in

relatively stable markets, i.e., those without substantial excess supply or

demand.        Unfortunately, stable well—functioning is not the way one would

describe office markets in many part of the western world. In London, Tokyo,

most national capitals of Scandinavia, most state capitals of Australia, and

many large U.S. cities, vacancy rates of 20 to 30 percent have been common,

real effective rents have plunged, and values are almost certainly far below

replacement cost. And in the transforming socialist economies of Central and

Eastern Europe, the profit—motivated construction equilibrating mechanism

described above has not existed for at least a half a century. For the value


        Hendershott, Follain and Ling (1987) make this point in their analysis
of the impact of the 1986 tax act on real estate values. Ling (1992) extends
the argument in his analysis of the impact of capital gains tax rate changes.
of any type real estate in any locale there to be near replacement cost would

be pure happenstance.

            This paper illustrates a method for valuing real estate in overbuilt (or

underbuilt) markets with office building          data   from Sydney, Australia.     The

method is presented in Section 1, where fundamental value is expressed as

replacement cost less the present value of expected below—equilibrium real

rental income.         Underpinnings for the calculation of below—equilibrium real

rents  are given in Section II; equilibrium real rents are specified and real
rental adjustment equations are estimated using data from the 1970—92 period.
The percentage change in real effective rents is related to gaps between both
the natural and actual vacancy          rates and equilibrium and    actual real rental
rates.        Expectations of future equilibrium real rents (including real discount

rates) and vacancy rates thus provide a future rental income stream from which

the present value of expected below—equilibrium rental income, and thus

fundamental       value,   can be computed.

            The value/replacement—cost ratio is calculated for       Sydney in Section
III, and its sensitivity to a number of assumptions ts                indicated.     Most

importantly, the 1992 ratio is not sensitive to real interest rate (and thus

risk premium)       assumptions   owing to offsetting adjustments in below equilibrium

rents and the discount rate.           Also, the value of above—market leases, which

likely existed on Sydney buildings leased up in the early l990s, is computed.

            In the absence of price Thubbles," price should equal     fundamental   value

plus the value of above—market leases.2             In Section IV,    estimates    of the

will clearly limit their duration.

compared and contrasted with ratios derived from series commonly reported in

two prominent Australian real estate sources, JLW and BOM&.3        During the

1990—92 period, the .JLW and BOMA series were SO to 100 percent greater than

fundamental value (plus the value of enforceable above—market leases).       An

important issue is whether the reported series are misrepresentations of

market value or reflect a speculative bubble. While independent evidence on

Sydney land values is offered for the development of a speculative bubble in

the second half of the l9BOs, the same evidense implies the bubble burst in

the early l990s.    Further, the surge in Sydney office market construction in

the late l9BOs, a reasonable builder response to a prices exceeding

fundamental          almost guarentees the bursting of such a bubble in the
early 1990s.     That is, the 1992 BOMA data (and the JIM data to a lesser
extent) appear to overstate market value significantly.4

the Frank Russell company in the U.S. (the appreciation return component is
based on appraisals, not transactions).

       Some have argued that appraisers are reluctant to revalue properties
sharply over short periods. This tendency could be exaggerated for downward
adjustments owing to incentives of investment managers to maintain the values
upon which their percentage fees are based.

       Technically, the zero—coupon rate (plus an appropriate risk premium)
for each maturity should be used to discount each period's cash flow. When
the yield curve is steeply sloped and the cash flows are markedly uneven,
using different—period discount rates can greatly affect valuation.
Similarly, the expected inflation rate between the current period and when the
cash flow will be received should be used to compute each cash flow.

         The keys to valuation are first specifying equilibrium rents (the real

interest and depreciation rates and the expense ratio) and second determining

both how far the rental rate (g adjusted for vacancies) is currently below the

equilibrium rate and the time path along which the rental rate will return to

equilibrium. The latter involves projecting the time path of vacancy rates

and the real gross rental rate.       We now turn to estimates of a real gross

rental adjustment equation.



                    II. Explanation of Sydney   Real   Effective Rents

         A long tradition exists of relating the percentage change in real

effective rents to the difference between the "natural"         and observed   vacancy

rates (Eubank and Sirmans, 1979. Rosen and    Smith,    1983, and   Wheaton and   torto,
1988):

                               Ig,_1 = A (v—v+_1) .                        (5)
As popular as this relation is, it suffers from three problems. First, the

equation provides no relationship between the levels of actual and   equilibrium
rents, which must be equal in equilibrium.     Second, the adjustment equation

requires substantial overshooting of the natural rate in response to shocks

other than a change in the equilibrium rental rate.6        Third, the equation

cannot hold simultaneously for leases of different terms.

      Say that the market is initially in equilibrium with gross rents equal

to equilthrium rents, the vacancy rate equal to the natural rate, and value

equal to replacement cost. A negative demand or positive supply shock (excess

space unexpectedly becomes available) increases vacancies and decreases rents

(and thus values).    The contraction in construction resulting from value

declines turns vacancies around, but rents continue to fall until the vacancy

rate is back to the natural rate.1 The market must then go through a reverse

adjustment with rents rising, first with falling vacancies and later with

rising vacancies, until they return to equilibrium, vacancies return to the

natural rate, and value again equals replacement cost.      To create the force

returning rents to equilibrium, the rental adjustment equation necessarily

entails the vacancy rate substantially overshooting the natural rate.       The

vacancy rate will decline below the natural rate because value is less than

replacement cost (net construction is negative) when the actual vacancy rate



       Wheaton and Torte (1993) discuss the microfoundations of the adjustment
equation and estimate a less constrained form for numerous U.S. cities on data
from the 1979—91 period. They do not impose an equilibrium rent relationship.

       If the disturbance was a decline in the real interest rate, then the
adjustment is complete at this point; rents have declined to the new lower
equtlibrjum level, and value equals replacement cost.

                                      6
first returns to the natural rate.

        Moreover, even if the rental adjustment equation characterized one—

period leases, it cannot hold for longer term leases,            With rational

expectations, the rent on multiperiod leases will be an average of expected

future one—period leases, just as longer term bond rates are averages of

future one—period bond rates.      Thus expectations that one—period rents will

rise in the future will turn rents on multiperiod leases upward before the

vacancy rate reaches its natural level.8 Logically, equation (5) cannot hold

simultaneously for leases of different term.

        To allow a more general adjustment path with pleasing long—run
properties, real effective rents are specified as adjusting to gaps between

both the natural and actual vacancy rates (v* and v_i) and equilibrium and

actual net rents (g* and g_1):


                              =   A (v*—v,_1)   +
                                                    (g*4   —               (6)
With this equation vacancy rates do not have to overshoot following a

supply shock. After high vacancy rates have dragged rents significantly below

equilibrium, the known eventual return to equilibrium acts as a force causing

real rents to rise, even when the vacancy rate is still above the natural

rate.




The Data

        Rental adjustment equations are estimated using annual data from Sydney


       In a cross—section study of individual leases, the term of the lease
can be entered as a regressor to capture the differential impact of future
expected values of one—term leases on the value of longer—term leases with
different terms. In a pooled time—series cross—section study, the impact of
term should be allowed to vary over time because the term structure of leases
varies over time.
                                         7
over the 1970—92 period.0 The natural vacancy rate is treated as a constant
over time.10    In    (5) or (6), Vtta_a       is   included   as a regressor and    the

constant   tern is Av*.     Thus the natural rate can be computed after the

estimation as the ratio of the constant tern to the coefficient on the lagged

vacancy rate (A).

      Real effective tents require the downward adjustment of real face rents

for both free rent periods and tenant improvements. Conveniently for us, JLW

(1992) has collected data on both of these terms for Sydney office markets

over the 1970—91 period. According to their data, rent incentives increased

sharply over the 1989—91 period, rising from less than four months equivalent

free months rent (including adjustment for improvements) on a ten—year lease

to almost 23 free months.         JLW also compute effective real rents by

discounting/amortizing real cash flows with a real interest rate.               We have

adjusted JLW's methodology in only one respect; they amortize the present

value of the rent incentives over the life of the building whereas the correct

amortization period is the length of the lease,                With this adjustment, the

amortized value of the rent incentives jumped from 6 percent of real face rent

in 1989 to 61 percent in 1992.11 The percentage change in the resultant real

effective rent is the dependent variable in our analysis.

      The equilibrium real gross rental rate equals the real risk—free rate


       All data were generously supplied by the Sydney JLW Research and
Consultancy office.

     10 Few degrees of freedom prevent serious testing of a nonconstant
natural vacancy rate.    It is worth noting, though, that reported evidence
seeming to suggest large time variation in natural vacancy rates may simply
reflect continuing market disturbances (llendershott and Kane, 1992).

       Their methodology understates the increase in value of rent incentives
and thus the decrease in effective rents between 1989 and 1992. Rather than a
48 percent real decline, they compute a 26 percent decline.

                                           8
plus a risk premium, the depreciation rate, and the expense ratio.           An

approximate Australian risk—free real rate was computed as (l+rf)/(l+s)—1 for

semi—annual intervals over the December 1969 to June 1992 period, using the

ten—year Treasury rate as the risk—free rate and a three—period average of

annualized percentage changes in the Deflator for Private Final Consumption

Expenditures as the expected inflation proxy. The series actually employed is

a smoothed version of the calculated series because longer term real interest

rates should move relatively smoothly, The smoothed real risk—free rate drops

from 0.02 in 1970 to zero in early 1971, stays there until the middle of 1974,

and then abruptly plunges to —0.04 and remains there though the middle of

1977.    The series then rises linearly to 0.06 in June 1982, where it stays

through June 1992.

        The risk premium and depreciation rates are set at 0.035 and 0.025,

respectively, throughout the period.       BOMA data indicate that the ratio of

outgoings (operating expenses) to gross rates has ranged from 0.285 to 0.335;

exp is set equal to 0.05, giving a gross rental rate of 0.17 and an outgoings

ratio of 0.294 (0.05/0.17). Thus the equilibrium rental rate declines from

0.13 in 1970 to 0.07 in the 1975—77 period, and rises to 0.17 throughout the

1982—92 span. To convert this gross rental rate series to a current (1992)

dollar rent per square meter number, the series is multiplied by the ratio of

the JIM—based real effective rent level to the equilibrium rental rate in a

year in which equilibrium and actual rents were equal. Given the steadiness

of both actual and equilibrium rents during the 1983—85 period, real effective

rents are assumed to have equalled equilibrium rents in June 1986.         This

equilibrium rent series and the JIM real effective rent series are plotted in

Figure 1.    A clear relationship is evident, with the JIM series generally


                                       9
lagging the equilibrium series.
      The last key input is the vacancy rate. This series began and ended the
l970s at about 3 percent. with a sharp increase and reversal in between (the

peak was 13 percent at the end of 1976). Real effective rents followed the

vacancy rate with about a two year lag.       The vacancy rate stayed below S

percent throughout the l9BOs and was 3 percent in the middle of 1989; during

the second half of the decade, real effective rents rose by 50 percent. Since

then a plethora of completions and negative absorption has driven vacancy to

23 percent and halved real effective rents.



The Estimates

      Table 1 reports some estimates of the rental adjustment equation.

Coefficient estimates and standard errors (in parentheses), the equation 1(2

(not adjusted for degrees of freedom), and the implied natural vacancy rate

are reported. The first estimate is of the naive model in which rents adjust

solely to the difference between the natural and actual vacancy rates. As is

seen, the equation explains less than a third of the variance.     The implied

natural vacancy rate is 6.0 percent.

      Adding the equilibrium rent gap more than doubles the explanatory power.

While the explanatory power is reasonable, the equation misses a significant

portion of the broad swings in real effective rents.       Mote specifically.

between 1978 and 1989 (Junes) real rents rose by $513, $375 of which was lost

by June 1992. The equation explains only 72 and 38 percent, respectively, of

the increase and reversal.

      To better explain the sharp fall in real rents during the June 1989—June

1992 period, the forward change in the vacancy rate (the December to December


                                       10
change explaining        the June to June     change   in rents) has been added. Knowing
that   substantial      capacity was coming on line should have directly reduced real

effective rents.           While adding the forward vacancy—rate change does not

increase the explanatory power much (the t—ratio on the variable is barely

above one), the equation is far better able to explain the pre1989 rise in

real rents and especially the subsequent decline. Rather than the 72 and 38

percents just mentioned, 83 of the increase and 63            percent of the   decrease are

explained.        The   estimate   of the natural vacancy rate rises slightly to 6.8

percent.

            Figure 2 plots the level of real effective rents and the level predicted

dynamically       (the initial level moved forward based on the predicted changes).
Because the annual errors in predicted changes using the difference equation
are largely independent, the predicted level tracks the actual level
reasonably well. Figure 2 also includes forecasted rent levels for the 1993—

2003 period, assuming the Sydney vacancy rate is 23 percent through December

1994 and then declines (see below). The equation predicts another $120 (27

percent) decline in real effective rents before an upturn in 1998.12



                        III. Value/Replacement—Cost Ratio! in .June 1992

        In this section, the model       is   fully parameterized, and V/RC ratios are

computed for Sydney in June 1992 under the base assumptions using each of the

real rental adjustment      equations.   The sensitivity of the V/RC ratio

percent between June 1992 and June 1993.

adjustment coefficients, and a decrease in real interest rates is illustrated.

Lastly, the value of long—lived enforceable leases, which would result in

slower declines in real rents after 1989, is also computed.



Model parameterizatton

      The V/RC ratio is unity less the present value of below—equilibrium

future cash flows divided by replacement cost. As can be seen from equations

(2) and (4), the variables to be specified are: the real risky discount rate

(r), the depreciation rate (d), the expense ratio (exp), the natural vacancy

rate (v*) and the time paths of future vacancy an4 gross rental rates.

Moreover, from equation (6), the time path of future gross rental rates is

fully specified by the other variables, With constant future values of r, d,

v' and exp, only a future tine path ef vacancy rates is needed for the

calculations.

      Most of the June 1992 values have already been specified: r —   0.095, d —
0.025, and exp — 0.05, giving a gross equilibrium rental rate of 0.17. From
the estimation, v* —     0.068.   With the assumption of equality between actual

and equilibrium rents in June 1986, the actual gross rental rate in June 1992

is 0.117.

      The last key assumption is the future time path of vacancy rates

expected by market participants. Table 2 lists assumed future vacancy rates

in Sydney as of year—end over the 1985—92 period.       Each column contains the

rate expected during June of the year heading the column to exist at the end

of the years in the far left column (the diagonal contains observed vacancy

rates). The "expectations" for 1989—92 were developed in discussions with JLW

staff (JLW was itself forecasting higher vacancy rates in 1989 and 1990).


                                         12
      Huge construction in process indicated a 7 percentage point rise in the

Sydney vacancy rate between endl99l and end1992. The expected rate is assumed

to remain in the 23 percent range throughout 1993—94, then to decline by two

percentage points a year through 1998, at which point the decline accelerates

to 2.5 points per year owing to the recognition that some stock will be

profitably converted to other uses. By 2003, the rate is S percent.13 After

that it stays below the natural vacancy rate until actual real rents return to

their equilibrium level in 2006.

1992 V/RC Calculations

      With the above described set of assumptions, the June 1992 V/RC ratio

for office buildings in Sydney Australia is 0.43S. Figure 3 shows the time

paths by which the ratios of net cash flows to equilibrium net rents and value

to replacement cost, respectively, are expected to return to unity. Net cash

flows in 1992 were just under half of equilibrium net rents, and they plunge

to under one—fifth throughout the 1994—96 span. During the same period, real

effective gross rents are decline by 27 percent. Real gross rents then turn

around gradually before jumping as a 9 to 13 percent annual rate during the

1999—2003 period. This rise, combined with the increase in occupancy, pushes

net cash flows up rapidly.     In contrast, the rise in the V/RC ratio is a

virtual constant 10 percent per year over the 1994—99 period before dampening

as the ratio dovetails into unity. Value rises immediately, in spite of the

60 percent further decline in real net cash flows, because the period of


     13 The slight overshooting in vacancy rates after 2002 is needed to get
rents to stabilize at their equilibrium level.

     " A comparable calculation of this ratio for U.S. office markets
nationwide in early 1992 was 0.6 (Hendershott and Kane, 1992). A calculation
for Melbourne Australia, using the Sydney rental adjustment equation, is 0.36,
owing to a sharper rise in vacancy rates and decline in real rents.

                                      13
higher rents is coming closer.

      Of course, our assumptions are just that, so calculations are presented

to indicate the sensitivity of the result to variations in the assumptions.

First, we assume a more optimistic vacancy rate pattern: the rate declines by

a point in 1993 and 2.5 points per year. reaching 7 percent in 1999 (and then

overshooting   through   2003).   Not only is space occupied sooner, but rents

adjust toward the equilibrium quicker. The result is a VJRC ratio of 0.565.

On the other hand, a rental adjustment equation in which the response to the

rent gap varies with the ratio of natural to actual vacancy rates fits the

1970—91 data about as well as the equation with a constant rent gap response

implies a lower value,      With this equation, rents initially decline further

and then rise back to equilibrium less rapidly. As a result, the estimated

V/RC ratio drops from 0.435 to 0.21.

      The ratio is not sensitive to the assumed real interest rate when

feedback effects are incorporated. To illustrate, consider the impact of a

decline in the real rate of interest from its unusually high June 1992 level.

While the decline reduces below—equilibrium rents directly by lowering the

equiLibrium level, and thus raises the V/RC ratio, the time path along which

actual rents rise to the lower equilibrium level is lower (the initial drop in

rents is steeper), owing to the reduced value of the equilibrium—actual rent

gap, and the present value of a given below—equilibrium rental shortfall is

greater. When the 1992 ratio is recomputed for a two percentage point lower

real rate, V/RC rises only from 0.435 to 0.45.

      The reported V/lW ratios computed so far are for buildings earning

market rents. However, in the l980s Australia had lease contracts in which

rents on existing buildings would rise with increases in market rents but not


                                        14
decline with decreases. To the extent that tenant rents have not •ratcheted"

down in response to declines in market rents, the rougtly 50 percent decline

in real effective market rents observed between 1989 and 1992 was largely

avoided. Because of their above—market leases, these buildings are worth more

than their fundamental values.

        To calculate how much more buildings with above—market teases should be

worth, real rents are adjusted upward. We consider buildings fully leased—up

with   tenants who obtained 10—year leases throughout the l980s. Thus, one—
tenth of the building "goes to market" each year over the next decade.
Nominal rents on the nonmarket leases are constant (real rents fall by 5
percent per year). By June 1999, all leases are at market. Under these
assumptions,     the replacement—cost ratio in 1992 for prime buildings, including

both fundamental value and the premium for above—market leases, is 0.558.

That is, fully enforceable above—market leases were worth another 0.12 of

replacement cost.



                        IV. Fundamental, BOMA, and JLW Values, 1985—92

        Using our framework and appropriate assumptions, a time series of the

value/replacement—cost         ratio for Sydney office buildings is            constructed for

the 1985—92 period. In addition, comparable "marker ratios are computed from

the    BOMA and JLW data. Comparison of these ratios with that estimated using
our method reveals substantial differences.
        The real interest rate, depreciation rate, and expense ratio                are set at


       The 10—year lease term is consistent with the computation of effective
rents and has been the typical term for the Sydney office market. Just as the
premium on bonds paying above—market coupons will be greater the longer the
maturity of the bond, the value of above—market leases will be greater the
longer the term of the lease.
                                                  15
the 1992 values throughout the 1985—92 period.            The Mrketn vacancy rate

forecasts were listed in Table 2. For the June 1985 though June 1988 period,

the   year—end and next        year vacancy rates are     assumed to be accurately

forecast;    the   vacancy   rate   is then increased a percentage point a year to 8

percent and then reduced over two years to the natural rate. For 1989—91, a

sharp increase in the vacancy rate (based on discussions with JLW) is followed

by a reversal, including a brief time below the natural rate.

         Column 1 of Table 3 contains the calculated Sydney V/RC ratios for the

L985—92 period. The ratio is roughly constant at 1.0 over the 1985—89 period

(the 1989 ratio is no higher than the 1985 ratio, in spite of the SO percent

greater real effective rent level in 1989, because of the substantially higher

vacancy    rates —    and thus real rent declines — forecasted in 1989 than in

1985).     Subsequent sharp jumps in vacancy rates and plunging real effective

rents lower the ratio to 0.435 in 1992.           The 1992 premium for the value of

above—market leases is also listed in the table.

         Two sources publish "market" data from which V/RC ratios can be computed

and   compared with the fundamental value ratio adjusted for above—market
leases.      A comparable ZOMA/Russel]. series comes from a two—step procedure.
First, the appreciation component of the BOMA/Russell office return series is

cuniulated to generate a nominal appraised value series.         Second, to obtain a

real constant—quality measure, this series is divided by the deflator for

private consumption (scaled to unity in June 1985) and then blown up by 1.25

percent per year to allow for depreciation in the replacement—cost
denominator.        (The 1.25 percent is less than the general 2.5 percent

depreciation rate because new buildings are continuously added to the BOMA

data base.)        The BOMA/Russell series is set equal to 1.01, the fundamental


                                             16
value/RC ratio, in June 1985, which is consistent with our assumption that

tents equalled their equilibrium values in 1986.           These values are shown in

column 2 of Table 3.        For the JLW calculation, we begin with their nominal

capital value indicator and adjust it as in step two, using a 2.5 percent

depreciation factor. The resultant V/ItO estimates, including the assumed 1.01

1985   value,   are listed in column 3.

        The BOMA and   JIM data increase sharply between June 1985 and June 1989,
53 and 68 percent respectively, and then decline abruptly between June 1989
and June 1992, 34 percent (BOMA) and            5? percent (JLW).   The smaller BOMA
movements are consistent with appraised values lagging market values.16 Both

series, but especially that based on BOMA data, are substantially above

fundamental value in June 1992.

        Two possible explanations exist for the surge in the BOIIA and JL%J series

in the second half of the l980s.          First, the real required return on real

estate (the risk premium in our model) may have declined.                 Second, a

speculative bubble (increase of market relative to fundamental value) may have

formed.     One indicator of a speculative bubble, given the constancy of the

fundamental     value series, would be an independent estimate of a sharp increase
in real land prices.17 Such an estimate exists. The Valuer—General of New
South Wales computed a 350 percent real increase in land value per square
meter   of office space in the Sydney central financial district between 1986




       Like the Russell—NCREIF data in the U.S., the BOMA—Russell data in
Australia are largely based on appraised values.   The JLW data are JLW's
estimates of market values.

       In our valuation model, land is valued together with the structure;
the rents that the two can earn jointly determines the value of the total
property.

                                           17
and 1989.18       Ii land were only 5 percent of the total value of offices

constructed in 1986, the real land increase would account for virtually all of

the computed increases in the BOMA and JLW ratios.

          Because land values may be misiaeasured in the RC measure, we compute the

ratios     of the BOMA/Russell and JLW based ratios to our fundamental value
(adjusted for leases) ratio, thereby eliminating measurement error in 1W.
Ratios of ratios, assuming 0.03, 0.06, and 0.09 in 1990—92, respectively, to
be the ratio of enforceable above—market leases to replacement cost, are
reported     in columns 4 and 5.   As can be seen, JLW's 1992 ratio is almost 50

percent greater than our estimate of fundamental value plus the value of

above—market leases, and the ratio derived from BOMA's 1992 data is almost

double our estimate.19

          These multiples suggest that the late l980s office market bubble has not

yet burst. However, data from the New South Wales Valuer—General suggest that

bubble has popped; real office market land prices have returned to their 1986

values.      Moreover, any decline in the real estate risk premium during the

1985—89 period has almost certainly also been reversed.         The implication is

that market value should be in line with fundamental value (plus above—market

leases). We conclude that the JLW, and especially BOMA, Sydney office market




        Land value data are contained invarious reports; the latest are in
Valuer.Ceneral (1992, Table 18, p 21). These data pertain to the middle of
the year and are supposed to represent market values based on the comparable
sales method.    The Valuer-Ceneral's estimates, which are the basis for
property tax assessments, may be challenged legally.
     10
       The JLW overestimate can be largely explained by their mismeasurement
of the decline in effective real rents during the 1989—92 period.

                                          V. Summary

         Real estate markets are periodically plagued by excess supply, rent

concessions and few arias—length transactions. During such periods, valuation

is problematic. The model presented here expresses fundamental value as the

difference between replacement cost and the present value of expected below—

equilibrium rents. Equilibrium rents are specified and real rental adjustment

equations are estimated using Sydney office market data during the 1970—92

period.     The percentage change in real effective office rents is related to

gaps between both the natural and actual vacancy rates and equilibrium and

actual    real rental rates.      Inclusion of the rent gap guarentees that actual

rents    will    eventually return to their equilibrium level (and more than doubles

the equation's explanatory power).           With this relationship, only market

participants' forecast of vacancy rates until the market returns to

equilibrium is needed to estimate value.         Such a forecast was obtained from

the   Sydney JUl consulting office.
         The estthated fundamental—value/replacement—cost ratio for the Sydney
office market was about 1.0          throughout the midl9B5—midl989 period.      The

subsequent       surge in vacancies from 3 to 23 percent halved effective rents and

lowered the ratio to 0.43 by mid1992.            For prime prel989 properties with

enforceable "rachet" clauses, real rents have only begun their plunge. The

above—market       rents these buildings are earning could be worth   another 0.12 of

replacement       cost.

        20 The                                         the BOMA ratio is over
                 JUl difference for Melbourne is comparable;
three times greater than our estimate of fundamental value plus the value of
above—market leases.

                                            19
       Ratios developed from the capital return component of the BOMA return

series and from the JLW capital value series indicate about a 50 percent

increase in the ratio in the second half of the 1980s.       Even with a sharp

decline since then, these ratios imply values 50 to 100 percent greater than

our estimate of fundamental value plus enforceable above—market leases. While

evidence on Sydney land values and of an office market construction boom

supports the conjecture. of a speculative bubble forming in the second half of

the   1980s, the same evidence implies that the bubble has burst and that the
BOMA data especially significantly overstate market value.
