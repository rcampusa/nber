                                              ABSTRACT

We study the effect of welfare reform, broadly defined to include social policy changes in the 1990s,
on the material well-being and expenditure patterns of poor single-mother families. Our research suggests
that welfare reform did not affect total expenditures in households headed by low-educated single
mothers. However, patterns of expenditure did change. We find strong evidence that the policy was
associated with an increase in spending on transportation and food away from home, and some evidence
of an increase in spending on adult clothing and footwear. In contrast, we find no statistically significant
changes in expenditures on childcare or learning and enrichment activities. This pattern of results
suggests that welfare reform has shifted family expenditures towards items that facilitate work outside
the home, but, at least so far, has not allowed families to catch up with more advantaged families in
terms of their expenditures on learning and enrichment items.

Introduction

        A decade long policy to “end welfare as we know it” has dramatically altered life

circumstances and opportunities faced by single mother headed families in the U.S. Approximately

69 percent of single mothers were employed in 2005, up from 61 percent a decade ago, and the

number on welfare continued to decline even during the 2001 recession after falling by half within the

first five years of the implementation of the 1996 welfare law (O’ Neill 2006, Parrott and Sherman

2006). How have these changes affected the material circumstances of families headed by single

mothers? A rich body of research has documented the effects of welfare reform on the employment

and incomes of low-educated single mothers (Blank 2002, Grogger et al. 2003). In this paper, we

provide evidence on how welfare reform affected their material well-being and patterns of

expenditure.

        In their extensive research using expenditure data, Meyer and Sullivan (2003, 2004, 2006)

find that while incomes of the poorest (bottom decile) single-mother families fell noticeably after

welfare reform, trends in expenditures indicate an improvement in the material circumstances of this

group. However, it is not clear from their analyses whether the improvement in expenditures is due to

changes in social policy or due to economic factors. From a policy perspective it is important to

separate the two effects and isolate the impact of social policy on the material well-being of low-

educated single parent families. We use a difference-in-difference-in-difference research design,

described in detail below, that allows us to separate the effect of changes in social policy from that of

other secular trends.

        The second contribution of our paper is to examine trends in expenditures on specific items,

such as those related to work or development and learning, so as to provide evidence of how single

mother families are adapting to their new life circumstances. For example, changed circumstances

may require families to spend more on work related activities such as transportation, food away from

home, or adult clothing. Realizing the significance of education in the labor market, families may

decide to spend more on development or learning activities. Working families may also purchase

more childcare (which may or may not benefit children, depending on factors such as the age of the

child and the quality of the care). Recent research from the UK suggests that focusing on detailed


                                                                                                        3
items can yield important new insights into how policy changes affect the material well-being and

expenditure patterns of low-income families (Gregg, Waldfogel, and Washbrook, in press).

        To preview our results, we find that while total expenditures in households headed by low-

educated (education    high-school) single mothers rose after welfare reform, similar increases were

also experienced in households belonging to other demographic groups that were much less affected

by welfare reform (e.g. families headed by high-educated single mothers or low-educated married-

couple families). Our research suggests that welfare reform per se did not have any statistically

significant effect on total expenditures in low-educated single mother households. However, patterns

of expenditure did change. There is strong evidence that the policy change was associated with an

increase in spending on transportation and food away from home, and some evidence of an increase in

spending on adult clothing and footwear. Welfare reform was also associated with an increase in

ownership of microwave ovens, phones, and cars. These increases were higher, in absolute as well as

relative terms, among families headed by very low educated (education < high-school) single mothers.

In contrast, we find no statistically significant changes in expenditures on childcare or learning and

enrichment activities, and, if anything, a relative decline in ownership of computers in low-educated

single mother households. This pattern of results suggests that welfare reform has shifted family

expenditures towards items that facilitate work outside the home, but, at least so far, has not allowed

families to catch up with more advantaged families in terms of their expenditures on learning and

enrichment items.



Policy Background and Previous Research

        A spate of policy changes in the 1990s shifted the focus of US welfare policy from providing

cash benefits to low-income single mothers to providing work incentives and a range of supports for

the working poor. The 1996 federal law and state initiatives discouraged welfare dependence by

eliminating the entitlement to cash assistance and by imposing mandatory work requirements and

time-limits on welfare receipt. These changes were accompanied by expansions in a plethora of work

support programs for low-income families including federal and state Earned Income Tax Credits




                                                                                                          4
(EITCs), childcare subsidies, child tax credits, and Medicaid and child health insurance programs that

radically altered the form of public assistance available to low-income single-mother families.1

        These policy changes were implemented at a time when the US economy experienced

impressive growth that generated over 20 million jobs during 1992-2000 (Blank 2000). It may be

partly due to changes in incentives brought about by tax and transfer programs and partly on account

of economic growth that the employment rate of low-educated single mothers increased from 62

percent in 1995 to 73 percent in 2000, before declining in the recent recession to 69 percent in 2005

(Parrott and Sherman 2006). Indeed, the economic expansion of the 1990s made it relatively easy for

low-income single mothers to move from welfare to work. It is, however, not easy to determine what

proportion of the increase in employment (or incomes) is due to policy and what proportion due to

economic factors (Blank 2002). Moreover, multiple policy changes occurred during a short time

period, making it difficult to attribute changes in incomes or other aspects of material well-being to a

single aspect of welfare reform or work assistance programs. This task becomes even more

challenging if we allow for the possibility that certain policy changes may have a lagged effect.

        According to the US Census Bureau, the poverty rate among children in single-mother

families declined from 54 percent in 1993 to 43 percent in 2005. Again, part of the decline in poverty

is due to the economic boom of the 1990s and part due to other factors including changes in tax and

transfer programs. Cancian et al. (1999) found that after adjusting for inflation, both earnings and

family incomes of welfare leavers increased over time (see also Haskins 2001). The scenario is less

rosy for the very poor. Haskins (2001) concluded that “there is a small to moderate-sized group of

mother-headed families that are worse off than they were before welfare reform” (p. 105). Primus et

al. (1999) found that the 1996 welfare reform caused disposable income for the bottom decile of the

population to decline (see also Meyer and Sullivan 2005). The picture is mixed as one looks at other

aspects of family well-being. Research suggests that welfare reform did not result in any deterioration

in food insecurity faced by low-income single-mother families (Winship and Jencks 2002). A number

(see Blank 2002 and Grogger et al. 2002).


                                                                                                           5
of studies have found that welfare reform affected the health insurance of single mothers and their

children (Kaushal and Kaestner 2005, Bitler et al 2005).

        Expenditures are an important aspect of material well-being and were an under-studied topic

until recently. Several researchers have argued for the superiority of an expenditure measure of

poverty over an income measure (Meyer and Sullivan 2003, 2004, 2006; Rector 2004; see also

discussion in Haskins 2001). Meyer and Sullivan (2004, 2006) find that aggregate expenditures, in

particular, expenditures on housing and transportation, increased among the lowest decile of single

mothers, although it is not clear from their analysis whether these changes were on account of changes

in policy or due to economic factors. We try to answer this question by adopting a research

methodology that allows us to separate the two effects. This methodology has been used in one recent

study of the impact of welfare reforms on family expenditures in the UK (Gregg, Waldfogel, and

Washbrook, in press), but has not been applied in the US research to date.

        Our study, as any study on expenditures, is limited by the fact that we examine only certain

aspects of material well-being, and not all aspects of individual well-being. For instance, tax

incentives and welfare reforms that increase the employment of mothers may affect the time mothers

spend with children, and may adversely affect the well-being of children in this sense, although it is

also possible that children gain when mothers are employed, due to improvements in maternal mental

health or family routines (Duncan and Chase-Lansdale 2004; Waldfogel 2006). Similarly,

employment may entail more or less physical labor than household work, and there may also be

differences in the amount of psychological stress between paid work and household work. Mother’s

self-esteem may be higher when employed and lower when on welfare. Our analysis does not factor

in these other aspects of individual well-being.



Data

        We use micro-level data from the Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CES) from 1990-1995 for

the pre-reform period, and from 1998-2003 for the post-reform period. Since all states implemented

PRWORA during 1996-1997, we exclude 1996-1997 as this period can not be categorized as pre- or

post-reform. The CES consists of two different components: a quarterly Interview Survey (IS) and a


                                                                                                         6
weekly Diary Survey (DS). Our analysis is based on the IS, which provides detailed information on

expenditures incurred by a sample of consumer units, defined as: all members of a housing unit

related by blood, marriage, adoption or some other legal arrangement; or two or more persons living

together who use their incomes to make joint expenditures; or a single person who is living with

others but is financially independent (BLS 2005). The IS sample is a rotated panel in which

approximately 7,500 units are interviewed every three months for five consecutive quarters, after

which these households are replaced by new units.2 Thus, by design 20 percent of the sample is

replaced every year. The first quarter is a contact interview, while in the second to fifth quarters

households are asked about their expenditures over the previous three months. Since the IS surveys

are based on recall data on expenditures in the past three months, they suffer from response recall

errors (Battistin, 2003).3

        We restrict the analysis to families with children, where the mother is aged 18-54 years. The

samples are stratified into four groups by mother’s education level and marital status to identify those

most and least affected by welfare reform. These are: low-educated (mother’s education high-

school) single-mother families, an exceedingly vulnerable group with a high probability of being on

welfare; low-educated married-couple families; high-educated (mother’s education>high-school)

single-mother families; and high-educated married-couple families. In supplemental analyses, we

also estimated models defining a very low education group to include only those with less than a high-

school education. This very low education group would be expected to be most sharply affected by

welfare reform. Thus, seeing whether our results hold up, and indeed are stronger, for the very low

education group provides a useful robustness check on our results.

        Since the CES provides data at the household level and not at the subfamily level, we are

unable to identify single mothers who reside in a household with parents or other family members. If

welfare reform resulted in a larger number of single mothers living with their parents, the results of

our analysis would be biased.4 Meyer and Sullivan (2003) computed the ratio of single-mother

  The sample size was increased in 1999. During 1990-1998, in any single quarter the IS consisted of about 5000
units.

                                                                                                             7
subfamilies to all single mothers using the Current Population Surveys and found that throughout the

1990s the ratio was around 0.2, suggesting that the bias on account of changes in the proportion of

single-mother subfamilies in the CES data would be modest.

         The CES provides detailed information on each household unit including the respondent’s age

(and spouse’s age), education level (and spouse’s education level), marital status, race and ethnicity

(and spouse’s race and ethnicity), region of residence, family size, number of children and number of

elderly persons (aged 65 or above) in the family. This information is used to construct various

demographic groups or control variables.

         We first classify quarterly expenditures into ten major categories -- housing and utility; food;

alcohol and tobacco; clothing and footwear; transportation; health; leisure; personal care; education

(including reading); and miscellaneous -- and study whether welfare reform affected expenditures on

these major categories. The CES also provides data on expenditures on more narrowly defined items

that can be assigned to work-related and learning or development related expenses. More specifically,

we use CES data to define the following specific expenditure categories: expenditure on food away

from home; adult’s clothing, footwear and accessories; childcare; and learning and enrichment

expenditures, defined as spending on books, magazines, newspapers, tuition (elementary, high school

and college) and school books, supplies and equipment, computers, calculators, and typewriters, toys,

games and sports.5 For comparison, we also study changes in expenditures on food at home and

children’s clothing, footwear, and accessories. Details on the measures of each expenditure category

are presented in Appendix Tables 1 (major categories) and 2 (detailed items).

         We also study ownership of several consumer durables, to examine if welfare reform has

induced families to invest in durables to save time in household work (e.g. microwave ovens, washer

and dryer, and dishwasher) and to better connect with employers (as well as family and friends) (e.g.

phone and car); or whether they are investing in durables that may be used to enhance learning (e.g.

computer and VCR). CES provides information on ownership of all of these items, except phones.



5
 In an earlier version of this paper, we examined trends in expenditures on each item that comprises our
composite variable on learning and enrichment activities. Since expenditure on many of these items is very
small, especially for the target group of families, we think it is more meaningful to use a composite variable.


                                                                                                                  8
Information on whether a family spent any money on phone services in the previous quarter is used as

a proxy for phone ownership.

           To take account of differences in household size and composition, like Gregg, Waldfogel, and

Washbrook (in press), we adjust expenditures in the ten major categories for each household using an

equivalence scale, which assigns a weight of 0.67 to the first adult, 0.33 to all other persons in the

household age over 17, and 0.2 to children 17 or under. 6 More specific items (such as adult clothing,

footwear and accessories; children’s clothing, footwear and accessories; and baby-sitting and

childcare) are deflated by the number of adults or children in the family who are likely to use these

goods and services. Expenditures are expressed in January 2003 dollars using the Personal

Consumption Expenditure index of the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

           A major limitation of the CES data is that it does not provide state identifiers for the entire

sample. For instance, in 2003, CES did not provide state codes for 15 states and suppressed state

codes for several respondents from 17 other states. Therefore, like Meyer and Sullivan (2004, 2006)

we are not able to control for time-varying state effects. We chiefly rely on the difference-in-

difference-in-difference methodology, described in detail below, to control for any time-varying state

effects.



Methodology

           Our objective is to examine whether welfare reform (and other contemporaneous policy

changes) have made any difference to the material well-being and expenditure patterns of families

headed by low-educated single mothers, a group that faces a high risk of being on welfare and was the

primary target of state and federal welfare reform. One simple way to do this is by computing the

pre- and post-welfare reform changes in expenditures incurred by these families. Following Gregg,

Waldfogel, and Washbrook (in press), we can compute the change using levels or percentage methods

as specified below:


6
  The specific scale we use is the one used by many analysts including the OECD (Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development). This scale rate assigns 0.33 to all other persons in the household 14 or over;
and 0.2 to children under 14. Since in the US all persons less than 18 are considered children, we modify the
OCED scale to meet with the US norms.


                                                                                                                9
      Levels method :            λls = E lspost − E lspre
(1)

                                         E lspost − E lspre
      Percentage method :        λls =
                                              E lspre

where Elspre is the mean real equivalized expenditure of low-educated single-mother families on an

item in the pre-reform period, and Elspost is the corresponding expenditure in the post-reform period.

Under the levels method       λ ls   estimates the absolute change in mean quarterly expenditure; and under

the percentage method, it measures the percentage change in mean quarterly expenditure. If there

were no other factors that influenced household expenditures in the pre- versus post-welfare reform

periods,   λ ls   would provide the estimated effect of welfare reform on spending on this item by low-

educated single-mother families. However, there may be other factors, for instance, economic trends

that affected incomes and therefore expenditure levels, or changes in relative prices that affected

spending patterns.

           The difference-in-difference-in-difference (D-in-D-in-D) methodology we adopt allows us to

control for time-varying factors correlated with welfare reform that may have affected expenditure

patterns (absolute as well as relative). The methodology is implemented in three steps. As a first

step, we compare the pre- versus post-policy change in expenditures on an item by low-educated

single-mother families with the pre- versus post-policy change in expenditures on this item by high-

educated single-mother families. This allows us to control for secular trends in spending patterns that

had a similar effect on low- and high-educated single-mother families. The estimated difference-in-

difference can be specified as:

(2)   λ2s = λls − λhs

where   λhs is the change in equivalized expenditure on an item by high-educated single-mother
families after welfare reform. Since high-educated single-mother families are assumed to be

unaffected by welfare reform,         λhs captures the secular trends correlated with welfare reform.   The


variable   λ2s    thus estimates whether the pre-versus post- welfare reform trend in expenditures differed



                                                                                                              10
for low-educated and high-educated single-mother households. If the estimated value of               λ2s is
positive, that would indicate that the relative gap between low and high-income single-mother

families narrowed. Equation (2) can be computed using either the level or percentage method

described in equation (1).

           The identifying assumption in equation (2) is that time-varying factors correlated with welfare

reform have the same effect on the target and comparison groups. This may be a rather restrictive

assumption since the labor market opportunities for low-educated women differed from the

opportunities that high-educated women encountered during the 1990s. To control for these

differences, we move to step 2 of the difference-in-difference-in-differences procedure, and estimate

equation (2) for married-couple families, stratified by mother’s education, given by equation (2`).

(2`)   λ2m = λlm − λhm

           Since married parents are at low risk of being on welfare,        λ2m , the second difference-in-
difference, captures the difference in the effect of factors other than welfare reform on the expenditure

patterns of low-educated married-couple families and high-educated married-couple families.

Assuming that the convergence (or divergence) in the spending patterns across groups with different

education levels was the same irrespective of mother’s marital status, in step 3 we examine whether

the gap between expenditures of families headed by less-educated single mothers and families headed

by more-educated single mothers closed more quickly than the gap between families headed by less-

educated married mothers and more-educated married mothers. This provides the D-in-D-in-D

estimate, given by equation (3):

(3)    λ3 = λ2s − λ2m
The D-in-D-in-D estimate in equation (3) can also be obtained in one step using the following

regression on a combined sample of single-mother and married-couple families:

       E it = λ 0 + λ p Policy t + λ s Sm it + λ e Le it + λ es ( Sm it * Le it ) + λ sp ( Policy t * Sm it )
(4)
              + λ ep ( Policy t * Le it ) + λ esp ( Policy   jt   * Le ijt * Sm it ) + X it Γ + δ m + u it




                                                                                                                11
In equation (4), E it , the quarterly equivalized expenditure incurred by family i in period t, is a

function of Policyt (equal to 1 if an observation is taken from the post welfare reform period,

otherwise 0); family characteristics ( X it ) namely mother’s age, race and ethnicity, education, whether

family lives in an urban area, family size, number of children under 18, and number of persons in the

family aged 64 or above; and        δ m , which is a vector representing month of interview effects.   The

variable   Smit is an indicator for whether the family is headed by a single mother and Le it is a

dummy variable indicating whether the mother is low-educated. The level first-difference, D-in-D

and D-in-D-in-D coefficients are given by λ p       + λep + λsp + λesp , λep + λesp and λesp ,

respectively. Following Gregg, Waldfogel, and Washbrook (in press), the percentage estimates are

given by dividing the pre- versus post-policy changes in expenditures for a group by the mean

expenditure in the pre-policy period:

           λ p + λep + λsp + λesp

            λ0 + λe + λs + λes

In the empirical analysis, base level expenditures adjust for family characteristics. We compute

Huber/White/sandwich standard errors that allow for arbitrary heteroscedasticity in the data. To

adjust for potential non-independence among observations belonging to the same family, standard

errors are computed by clustering at the family unit.

           Ideally, we would have liked to have chosen comparison groups that were similar to low-

educated single mothers, but unaffected by welfare reform. But it is difficult to get comparison

groups that meet both the criteria. In our sample, a small proportion of low-educated married mothers

(about 5 percent) received welfare in 1994. Similarly, a small proportion of high-educated single

mothers also received welfare. In addition, several other social policy changes (e.g. changes in EITC)

affected low-educated married-mother families as well as single-mother families. Therefore, the


                                                                                                             12
coefficient estimated through equation (3) could be downward biased.7 At the very least, however,

the D-in-D-in-D approach we employ identifies whether any observed effects of welfare reform on

expenditure patterns are group-specific, and whether the effects are primarily found for the group of

interest—the low-educated single-mother target group. We realize the limitations of our research

methodology, and therefore present the estimated first-difference, D-in-D, and D-in-D-in-D

coefficients.



Results

Major Expenditure Categories: Descriptive Analysis

          Figure 1 presents total quarterly equivalized real expenditures for low- and high-educated

single-mother and married-couple families before and after welfare reform. Expenditure figures are

adjusted for mothers’ age, race and ethnicity, education, whether the family lives in an urban area,

family size, number of children under 18, number of persons in the family aged 65 or above, and

month effects. Total equivalized household expenditures for all four demographic groups increased

between 1990-1995 and 1998-2003, reflecting the 1990s economic boom that benefited all education

groups. The increase seems to be slightly higher for single-mother families, and among them, the

high-educated appear to have gained more than the low-educated. However, it is difficult to comment

on proportional changes in household expenditures relative to the base. We return to this point shortly

when we present the results of the multivariate analyses.

          In the pre-welfare reform period, low-educated single-mother families spent approximately

62 percent of their household budget on two items of consumption: food and housing. In contrast,

high-educated single- mother families spent 54 percent of their total expenditures on food and

housing, and were therefore left with a higher proportion of their larger budgets (relative to the low-

educated single-mother target group) for other consumption. The proportion of household budget

  If welfare reform influenced marriage our selection of the target and comparison groups on the basis of marital
status may yield biased results. However, previous results suggests that welfare reform did not have any effect
on marital status (Kaushal and Kaestner 2001; Schoeni and Blank 2002). A related issue is that if welfare
reform affected cohabitation, this may bias the results of the analysis. CES, the dataset we use, does not provide
information on cohabitation. To some extent, we address this issue by including controls for number of family
members and number of children in the family.


                                                                                                               13
spent on these two basic items in married-couple families was even lower - between 46 and 48

percent. In the pre-reform period, low-educated single-mother families spent a much smaller share of

their budgets on items of enrichment such as education and leisure than the other three groups. Did

households reallocate their budgets in the face of changes in life circumstances brought about by

welfare reform? Next, we apply multivariate regression models to examine this issue.



Major Expenditure Categories: Multivariate Analysis

        Table 1a presents a summary of estimates of the association between welfare reform and

major categories of expenditures based on models outlined in equations (1) and (4) for low-educated

(education     high-school) single-mother families. The columns labeled I and II show the adjusted

mean real equivalized expenditures per quarter (adjusted for mothers’ age, race or ethnicity,

education, whether she lives in an urban area, family size, number of children under 18 and number of

persons in the family aged 65 or above, and month effects) in the five years before welfare reform

(1990-1995) (column I) and the five years after the policy change (1998-2003) (column II). The

column labeled III shows the difference in levels between the mean expenditures in the pre- and post

welfare reform period (II-I) and the column labeled VI contains the same expressed in percentage

terms. The columns labeled IV and V show the results of the levels analysis based on equation (4),

and in columns VII and VIII the same are presented in percentage terms (using the percentage

method). Heteroskodasticity adjusted standard errors clustered at the consumer unit are in

parentheses.

        Estimates in the first row suggest that between 1990-1995 and 1998-2003, total real

equivalized quarterly expenditures in low-educated single-mother families increased by a statistically

significant $605 or 13.9 percent. On an annualized basis, this represents a gain of $2420. As

observed in Figure 1, total equivalized expenditure among the comparison group of high-educated

single-mother families increased by a higher level than the increase experienced by the low-educated

single-mother target group. The D-in-D estimate for the target group of families, with high-educated

single-mother families as the comparison, is a statistically insignificant $292 decline per quarter.

Relative to the pre-reform base level expenditures incurred by the target and comparison groups


                                                                                                       14
(using the percentage method), the D-in-D estimate indicates a marginal one percent increase in total

expenditure for the target group, and this effect is also statistically insignificant.

           The D-in-D estimate may be biased if time-varying factors such as business cycle effects

influenced incomes and therefore expenditures in low- and high-educated families differently. To

control for these factors, we estimate the D-in-D-in-D coefficient and find that welfare reform had no

statistically significant effect on the total expenditures of the target group. The statistically

insignificant results indicate that welfare reform lowered the total expenditures of the target group by

$77, by the level method. Using the percentage method, the change in total equivalized expenditure,

relative to pre-reform base spending, also was modest: a statistically insignificant 1.1 percent

increase.

           The pre- to post-welfare reform increase in expenditures among the target group of low-

educated single-mother families was largely on account of increases in expenditures in three major

categories: housing, transportation, and, to a lesser extent, leisure.8 Between 1990-1995 and 1998-

2003, the target group’s quarterly expenditures on housing increased by $254 or 15 percent; on

transportation by $252 or 42 percent; and on items of leisure by $39 or 24 percent. These changes

may be on account of several factors including changes in tastes, relative prices, economy-wide

trends, or policy. To purge the effects of factors, other than the policy change, that had the same

effect on spending patterns of the target and comparison groups, we compute the D-in-D estimates.

We find that the first difference gain in expenditure on housing is completely wiped out. In fact, the

D-in-D estimate is a statistically significant decline of $183. With the percentage method, the D-in-D

coefficient indicates a modest and statistically insignificant 1.8 percent decline. The increase in

expenditures on transportation, however, continues to be large (in percentage terms) even at the D-in-

D level, and suggests that the target group spent a statistically significant 20 percent more on

transportation after welfare reform. The only other statistically significant D-in-D increase in

expenditures is on clothing.9 The D-in-D estimate suggests that expenditures on clothing in low-

educated single-mother families increased by $57 or 11 percent. However, as the results in the first

    There was also a small but statistically significant increase in expenditures in the miscellaneous category.

    There is a statistically significant D-in-D decline in expenditures in the miscellaneous category.


                                                                                                                   15
difference analysis make clear, the D-in-D estimates of the effect on clothing are entirely due to the

decline in expenditures on clothing in high-educated single-mother families.

        The D-in-D estimates do not control for factors that may have a different effect on low- and

high-educated families. The D-in-D-in-D estimates that adjust for these factors suggest that welfare

reform increased the target group’s expenditures on transportation by $65 or 19 percent, with the

effect in percentage terms being statistically significant. The increase in expenditures on

transportation is consistent with the idea that increased employment among low-educated single

mothers that is associated with welfare reform is likely to have increased expenditures on work-

related expenses, of which transportation is a big component.

        The estimated effects of welfare reform on all other categories of expenditures are statistically

insignificant. Some of the statistically insignificant D-in-D-in-D results are large, but imprecisely

estimated due to large standard errors. For example, welfare reform was associated with a statistically

insignificant 3.6 percent decline in expenditures on housing, an 8.4 percent decline in expenditures on

alcohol and tobacco, a 10 percent decline in expenditures on health, and a 16.4 percent decline in

expenditures on education for the target group. Welfare reform was also associated with statistically

insignificant increases in spending on the following items: a 1.6 percent increase in expenditures on

food, a nine percent increase in spending on clothing, a 12.1 percent increase in spending on leisure-

related items, and a 2.4 percent increase in spending on personal expenses.

        Among the members of the target group, those with fewer resources were more likely to be on

welfare, and therefore more likely to be affected by the policy change. To see how the less privileged

among the target group were affected by the policy change, we repeat the analysis by restricting the

low-educated group to those with less than a high school degree. As before, the high-educated group

consists of those with more than a high school education. (Thus those with exactly 12 years of

schooling are not included in this particular analysis). The results are presented in Table 1b.

        Estimates in Table 1b are quite similar to those in Table 1a. Real equivalized expenditures in

households headed by single mothers without a high school degree increased by $529 or a statistically

significant 15.5 percent between 1990-1995 and 1998-2003, but most of the increase was accounted

for by increases in expenditures on transportation, housing, and, to a lesser extent, leisure. Relative to


                                                                                                         16
baseline spending, the largest increase was on transportation (an 80 percent increase), followed by

leisure (33 percent) and housing (12 percent). Changes in other expenditure categories were relatively

small and statistically insignificant.

        As in the earlier analysis (for families headed by single mothers with a high-school or lower

education in Table 1a), the D-in-D and D-in-D-in-D estimates of the association between welfare

reform and total spending are modest and statistically insignificant. Among major expenditure items,

the D-in-D estimates are positive and statistically significant for two items: expenditures on clothing

(significant increases in both levels and percentage) and transportation (a significant increase in

percentage terms only). Similarly, as in the earlier analysis, the D-in-D-in-D estimates indicate that

welfare reform did not lead to significantly increased spending on any item other than transportation.

The increase in expenditures on transportation for the very low educated (with less than a high school

degree) is much higher both in absolute (level) and relative (percentage) terms than the estimated

increase for the low educated (with a high school or lower education; see Table 1a). Results for the

very low educated (in Table 1b) show that welfare reform was associated with a $180 increase in

expenditure on transportation by the level method, and a statistically significant 59 percent increase

by the percentage method. The increase in expenditures on transportation for the very low-educated

single mothers was coupled with a cut in spending on housing of $203 (in money value) or eight

percent, with the percentage effect being statistically insignificant.

        To sum up, the results presented in Tables 1a-b suggest that welfare reform did not have any

statistically significant effect on total expenditures in households headed by low-educated single

mothers. The composition of household expenditures, however, changed, with households headed by

low-educated single mothers spending a larger proportion of their budget on transportation and a

somewhat smaller proportion on housing.



Detailed Expenditure Categories: Descriptive Analysis

        Next, we explore how welfare reform affected expenditures on specific items related to work,

learning, and enrichment. We begin this analysis by first studying the pattern of spending on these




                                                                                                         17
items by the target and comparison groups in the pre-welfare reform period, and then investigate

whether there were changes in expenditures that were associated with welfare reform.

        Figure 2 presents the proportion of expenditures on food away from home (for comparison we

also look at food at home), adult clothing and footwear (and children’s clothing and footwear, for

comparison), childcare and baby-sitting, and learning and enrichment activities incurred by the four

groups of families defined by family type and mother’s education during 1990-1995. In the pre-

reform period, low-educated single-mother families spent 19 percent of their budget (equivalized total

expenditure) on food at home and three percent on food away from home. The other three groups

spent a smaller proportion of their budget on food, which is expected since the overall size of their

budget is bigger. However, they allocated a higher proportion of the budget (between three to four

percent) on food away from home.

        In this pre-reform period, low-educated single-mother families spent two percent of their

budget (equivalized total expenditure) on children’s clothing and footwear and about the same

proportion on adult clothing and footwear. The comparison group of families headed by single

mothers with more than a high-school degree spent 1.5 percent of their budget on children’s clothing

and footwear, and 2.7 percent of their budget on adult clothing and footwear. Married-couple

families, in contrast, spent a relatively lower proportion of their budget on clothing and footwear: a

little over one percent on children’s clothing and footwear and between 1.5 to 1.7 percent on adult

clothing and footwear. Single-mother families also spent a larger proportion of their budgets on

childcare and baby-sitting than did married-couple families with similar education levels. Finally,

households with less educated mothers spent a smaller proportion of their budgets on items or

activities relating to learning and enrichment (e.g. books/magazines, tuition, books and school

supplies, games, toys, sports and other enrichment activities); and among these households those

headed by single mothers spent an even smaller proportion on these items. Given their smaller

budgets, the gap in spending on learning and enrichment activities between low- and high-educated

families is even larger in money terms.

        How did welfare reform affect expenditures on these work- and development-related items?

Did it lower the gap in spending on learning and enrichment activities between rich and poor


                                                                                                         18
households? To answer these questions, we turn to regression analysis, as outlined in equations (1)

and (4).



Detailed Expenditure Categories: Multivariate Analysis

           Table 2a presents a summary of the estimated associations between welfare reform and

expenditures on detailed items, based on models outlined in equations (1) and (4), for low-educated

(education     high-school) single-mother families. It has the same layout as Table 1a, and the

regression models have the same controls as the analysis on major expenditure categories.

           The top two rows in Table 2a present quarterly expenditures on food at home and food away

from home. Between 1990-1995 and 1998-2003, low-educated single-mother families lowered their

equivalized quarterly expenditures on food at home by a statistically significant $23 or three percent

and raised expenditures on food away from home (in restaurants, cafeterias, fast food places) by a

statistically significant $28 or 21 percent. During the same period, high-educated single-mother

families increased expenditures on food, both at home and away from home. The D-in-D estimates,

therefore, suggest that in the post reform period low-educated single-mother families lowered

expenditures on food at home and away from home by a statistically significant $82 and $109

respectively. In percentage terms, relative to the base level spending on food for the target and

comparison groups, the D-in-D estimates reflect a statistically insignificant two percent decrease in

expenditures on food at home and a statistically significant 17 percent increase in expenditures on

food away from home. The D-in-D may be biased if factors contemporaneous with welfare reform

affected food expenditures, at home and away from home, for the low- and high-educated single-

mother families differently. The D-in-D-in-D estimates that are assumed to control for these

unobserved factors suggest that welfare reform was associated with a statistically insignificant $8 or

1.1 percent decline in expenditure on food at home and an $11 or 16 percent increase in spending on

food away from home. The estimated coefficient on food away from home using the percentage

method is statistically significant.

           Equivalized expenditures on children’s clothing and footwear for the target group of low-

educated single-mother families remained almost unchanged between 1990-1995 and 1998-2003,


                                                                                                        19
while equivalized expenditures on adult’s clothing and footwear declined by a non-significant $ 7 or

seven percent. The D-in-D estimate, however, indicates a significant $36 or 15 percent increase in

expenditures on adult clothing and footwear for the target group and no change in spending on

children’s clothing and footwear. The D-in-D-in-D estimate suggests that welfare reform lowered

expenditures on children’s clothing and footwear by a statistically insignificant 1.8 percent and raised

expenditures on adult clothing by a statistically significant 13.8 percent.

        Next, we examine whether welfare reform was associated with changes in expenditures on

learning and enrichment activities defined as the sum of expenditures on: books/magazines;

tuition/school books/supplies; computers, typewriters and calculators; toys, games and sports and

other enrichment activities. We find that families headed by low-educated single mothers increased

their equivalized expenditures on this set of learning and enrichment items by a statistically

significant $20 or 15 percent after welfare reform. Families headed by high-educated single mothers

increased their spending on learning and enrichment items by an even higher amount, resulting in a D-

in-D estimate of a statistically significant decrease of $280 (using the level method) or 8.4 percent

(using the percentage method). The D-in-D-in-D estimate that adjusts for factors correlated with

welfare reform that may be affecting high- and low-educated families differently indicates that the

policy change increased overall equivalized spending on learning and enrichment by a statistically

insignificant $4. But using the percentage method, we find that relative to base level spending,

expenditure on learning and enrichment activities fell by a statistically insignificant 8.3 percent.

        Finally, as the last row in Table 2a shows, in the post-reform period low-educated single-

mothers increased spending on childcare and baby-sitting by a statistically insignificant $11 or 18

percent. The comparison group of high-educated single-mother families also increased spending on

childcare and baby-sitting in this period, resulting in D-in-D estimates of a decline of $97 (in money

terms), but an increase of 10.6 percent (by percentage method). The D-in-D-in-D estimates suggest

that welfare reform was associated with a modest and statistically insignificant $3 or 4.3 percent

increase in spending on childcare and baby-sitting by low-educated single-mother families.

        Table 2b provides a similar summary of the associations between welfare reform and detailed

expenditures with the group of very low-educated families restricted to mothers with less than a high


                                                                                                        20
school degree (the high-educated comparison group again consists of mothers with more than a high

school education). The results are somewhat similar to those in Table 2a. While welfare reform had

no statistically significant association with expenditures on food at home, expenditures on food away

from home increased by 33 percent in the very low-educated single-mother families. Similarly while

expenditures on children’s clothing in the target group of very low-educated single-mother families

fell by a statistically insignificant 9.7 percent, expenditures on adults’ clothing for this group

increased in the D-in-D-in-D estimates by an insignificant $21 in money terms or a statistically

significant 26 percent. The percent gains in expenditures on food away from home and adult clothing

appear to be larger than the gains when the target group included mothers with a high-school degree

(Table 2a). This may be because the least educated experienced a relatively higher increase in

employment due to welfare reform, resulting in a greater increase in work related expenses for this

group (Kaushal and Kaestner 2001).

        The target group consisting of families headed by single mothers without a high-school

degree did not experience any statistically significant change in spending on learning and enrichment

activities. The D-in-D-in-D estimates, however, suggest that welfare reform increased spending on

learning and enrichment activities by a statistically insignificant $14 or 1.8 percent. The D-in-D-in-D

estimates also suggest a statistically insignificant 47 percent decline in spending on childcare and

babysitting. The decline in childcare and babysitting expenditures is somewhat surprising, as we

might expect those costs to have increased along with increased employment. Notice that most of the

change in the D-in-D-in-D estimates is driven by increases in childcare expenditures in high-educated

families. It may be that increases in childcare subsidies were effectively targeted to the lowest-

income groups and may have slowed their growth in childcare costs as compared to other families. It

may also indicate that many single mothers who joined work increased reliance on family members

for free child care.

        To sum up, the above analysis suggests that welfare reform was associated with an increase in

spending on items that may be related to work expenses such as spending on food away from home

and adults’ clothing and footwear in families headed by low-educated single mothers. The increase,

both in absolute and percentage terms, was higher for the very low-educated group than the low-


                                                                                                       21
educated group. There was no corresponding increase in spending on children’s clothing or footwear.

If anything, the negative although statistically insignificant estimates for children’s clothing and

footwear provide some suggestion that expenditures on children’s clothing and footwear may have

declined after welfare reform, particularly for the very low-educated single-mother group. There was

no statistically significant rise in overall expenditures on learning and enrichment related activities,

however, the statistically insignificant results suggest some increase in spending on these items by the

target group of single-mother families with less than high-school education. Finally, the results for

childcare and babysitting suggest that for the very low-educated single-mother group, spending on

childcare fell (non-significantly) in money terms and percentage terms, relative to the changes in

spending for the comparison groups. This latter result suggests that the expansions in childcare

subsidies in the 1990s may have been well-targeted to the most needy families or that low-educated

single mother families increased reliance on kin for childcare.



Ownership of Consumer Durables

        Figure 3 presents ownership of seven consumer durables in the pre-reform period and depicts

differences across demographic groups. Low-educated single-mother families are the most deprived

group in terms of ownership of these items followed by low-educated married-couple families, who

closely precede high-educated, single-mother families, with high-educated married-couple families

being the most privileged group. Thirty seven percent of low-educated single mother families did not

own a microwave oven during 1990-1995; 42 percent did not own a washer/dryer; and 75 percent did

not have a dishwasher. Further, 41 percent of our target group did not possess a VCR, 45 percent did

not own a car, and 92 percent did not have a computer. About 12 percent did not pay for any phone

service in the previous quarter, an outcome we use to proxy for families lacking phone ownership.

        To study how welfare reform affected ownership of consumer durables, next we discuss the

results of the multivariate analysis presented in Tables 3a and 3b. The analysis in Table 3a shows that

in the post welfare reform period, low-educated single-mother families increased ownership of

microwave ovens and dishwashers, items that may reduce time on housework and thus facilitate work

outside the home, but there was no change in their ownership of washers/dryers. The D-in-D


                                                                                                           22
estimates suggest that the comparison group consisting of high-educated single-mother families also

increased ownership of these items, with the increase in ownership of washer/dryers and dishwashers

being relatively higher for this group as compared to the target group. The D-in-D estimates could be

driven by welfare reform or by differences in economic prosperity or tastes experienced by low-

versus high-educated single-mother families. The D-in-D-in-D, employed to control for unobserved

effects correlated with policy, suggests that welfare reform induced low-educated single-mother

families to increase their ownership of microwave ovens by a statistically significant 3.7 percentage

points, while reducing their ownership of washer/dryers by a statistically insignificant 3.8 percentage

points and their ownership of dishwashers by a statistically insignificant 3.1 percentage points.

        In the post-reform period, ownership of computers and VCRs, items that may be used for

learning and enrichment, increased in low-educated single-mother families by 20 to 21 percentage

points. The ownership of these items also increased for the comparison group of high-educated

single-mother families. The D-in-D-in-D estimates suggest that welfare reform was associated with a

statistically significant 15 percentage points decline in computer ownership in the low-educated

single-mother families, along with a statistically significant five percentage point increase in their

VCR ownership.

        Turning to the results for phone and car ownership, the first difference estimates show that in

the post-welfare reform period, phone ownership (i.e. the proportion of families that spent any amount

on phone services) and car ownership among low-educated single-mother families increased by

approximately nine percentage points. Phone ownership among high-educated single mother families

also increased resulting in a D-in-D estimate of a statistically insignificant 0.9 percentage point

increase. These families also increased their car ownership but by a relatively lower level, resulting in

a D-in-D estimate of a 5.9 percentage point increase. Finally, the D-in-D-in-D estimates suggest

welfare reform was associated with low-educated single-mother families increasing their ownership of

a car by a statistically significant 6.7 percentage points and their ownership of a phone by a

statistically significant 4.1 percentage points.

        Table 3b has the results of the analysis on ownership of durables in the very low-educated

(<high school) single-mother families. These results are quite similar to those in Table 3a with three


                                                                                                         23
differences. The estimated association between welfare reform and microwave ownership, although

positive, is relatively modest and statistically insignificant. The estimated D-in-D-in-D coefficients

for phone and car ownership are larger, but the estimated negative coefficient for computer ownership

is considerably smaller (in absolute terms).

        To sum up, our analysis suggests that in the post-reform period low-educated single-mother

families increased their ownership of several consumer durables. There also appears to be a secular

increase in ownership of these consumer durables among other groups that were unaffected by

welfare reform. After purging out these secular trends in ownership of durables, estimates suggest

that welfare reform was associated with increased ownership of microwave ovens, phones, and cars

among low-educated single-mother families, alongside a decline in ownership of computers.



Conclusion

        In this paper, we investigate the effect of welfare reform, broadly defined to include social

policy changes in the 1990s, on the material well-being and expenditure patterns of low-educated

single-mother families. We use the Consumer Expenditure Surveys for 1990-1995 and 1998-2003,

and apply a difference-in-difference-in-difference research design to control for factors correlated

with welfare reform that may have affected the material well-being of single-mother families.

        We find that welfare reform did not have any statistically significant effect on total

expenditures in households headed by low-educated single mothers. The composition of household

expenditures, however, changed somewhat, with households headed by low-educated single mothers

spending a larger proportion of their budget on work-related expenses, and a somewhat smaller

proportion on housing. We find strong evidence that welfare reform was associated with an increase

in spending on transportation and food away from home and some evidence of an increase in

spending on adult clothing and footwear among the target group of families headed by low-educated

single mothers, with the increase (both in absolute terms and relative to the base level expenditures)

being higher among households headed by the least-educated (education < high-school) single

mothers. This finding conforms with previous research that suggests that the increase in labor force

participation among single mothers with less than a high-school degree was higher than the increase


                                                                                                         24
experienced by single mothers with a high-school degree, suggesting that the least educated group

perhaps adapted the most in the new welfare and work regime (Kaushal and Kaestner 2001).

        We find that welfare reform was not associated with any statistically significant increase in

spending on children’s clothing or footwear. If anything, the negative although statistically

insignificant estimates for children’s clothing and footwear provide some evidence that expenditures

on children’s clothing and footwear may have declined after welfare reform, particularly for the very

low-educated single-mother group. Our analysis suggests that there was no statistically significant

rise in expenditures on learning and enrichment related activities, although the statistically

insignificant results suggest some increase in spending on these items by very low-educated single-

mother families with less than high-school education. These estimates suggest that social policy

changes in the 1990s did not trigger any overall reduction in inequality of expenditures on learning

and enrichment in low- versus high-income families. Finally, we find that for the very low-educated

single mother group, spending on childcare fell (non-significantly) in money terms and percentage

terms, relative to the changes in spending for the comparison groups. This result is somewhat

surprising and suggests that the expansions in childcare subsidies in the 1990s may have been well-

targeted to the most needy families or that low-educated single mother families increased reliance on

kin for childcare.

        We also study whether welfare reform was associated with increases in ownership of

consumer durables that can support employment or enhance learning and development. Our estimates

suggest that the policy change was associated with increased ownership of microwave ovens, phones,

and cars in low-educated single-mother families, but also a decline in ownership of computers. These

last results are quite similar to results from a recent study of the effects of welfare reforms on the

expenditures of low-income families with children in the UK (Gregg, Waldfogel and Washbrook, in

press). That study too found that families affected by welfare reform increased their ownership of

cars and telephones, but lost ground in spending on computers.

        However, in contrast to our study, the UK study found significant shifts in spending toward

children’s items, such as children’s clothing and footwear. We can only speculate as to why these

results differ across countries. It may be that the UK reforms led to more spending on children


                                                                                                         25
because they included benefit increases specifically tied to children. For example, the UK reforms

included increases in the value of universal child benefits, as well as child-related allowances

provided through welfare programs. The labeling of these benefits as child benefits may have

increased parents’ propensity to spend the additional money on children’s items such as clothing and

footwear. A second point of difference is that the UK reforms did not mandate employment for single

mothers, although as in the US the reforms were intended to increase incentives to work. As a result,

parents affected by the reforms in the UK may not have been as likely as parents in the US to increase

their spending on items related to employment such as food away from home and adult clothing and

footwear.

        Another point of difference is that the UK study found that the reforms there led to reduced

spending on alcohol and tobacco, while this study for the US does not. Here again we can only

speculate as to the reason for this difference. There is some evidence in the UK study that the reforms

increased families’ spending on leisure (as well as their social connections through phone and car

ownership) and it is perhaps this mechanism that led to the reduced spending on alcohol and tobacco.

However, it is not clear why this mechanism would not operate similarly in the US. Taken together,

the cross-country differences in results are intriguing and suggest that further analysis of these effects

within countries, and across countries, would be a good topic for further research.

Note: Figures in columns labeled I and II are mean equivalized expenditures, adjusted for mothers’ age, race and
ethnicity, education, whether she lives in an urban area, family size, number of children under 18 and number of
persons in the family aged 65 or above, and month effects. Expenditures are expressed in January 2003 dollars
using the Personal Consumption Expenditure index of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Heteroskodasticity
adjusted standard errors clustered at consumer unit are in parenthesis. The comparison group in the DD analysis
consists of households headed by high-educated (education > 12 years) single mothers. The DDD estimates are
derived by subtracting the DD estimates for low-educated married-couple families (with high educated married-
couple families as comparison) from the DD estimates for low-educated single-mother families presented in
columns labeled IV and VII. The sample of analysis consists of 8610 observations of low-educated single mothers,
7187 observations of high-educated single mothers, 32547 observations of low-educated married mothers and 43463
observations of high-educated married mothers. * 0.05<p=<0.1, ** 0.01<p=<0.05, ***p=<0.01.

Note: Figures in columns labeled I and II are mean equivalized expenditures, adjusted for mothers’ age, race and
ethnicity, education, whether she lives in an urban area, family size, number of children under 18 and number of
persons in the family aged 65 or above, and month effects. The figures are expressed in January 2003 dollars using
the Personal Consumption Expenditure index of the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Heteroskodasticity adjusted
standard errors clustered at consumer unit are in parenthesis. The comparison group in the DD analysis consists of
households headed by high-educated (education > 12 years) single mothers. The DDD estimates are derived by
subtracting the DD estimates for very low-educated married-couple families (with high-educated married-couple
families as comparison) from the DD estimates for very low-educated single-mother families presented in columns
labeled IV and VII. The sample of analysis consists of 3067 observations of unmarried very low-educated mothers,
7187 observations of unmarried, high-educated mothers, 8092 observations of married, very low-educated mothers
and 43463 observations of married, high-educated mothers. * 0.05<p=<0.1, ** 0.01<p=<0.05, ***p=<0.01.
