                                          ABSTRACT

       A great deal of empirical evidence shows that a country's production structure and
productivity growth depend on its own R&D capital formation. With the growing role of
international trade, foreign investment and international knowledge diffusion, domestic production
and productivity also depend on the R&D activities of other countries. The purpose of this paper
is to empirically investigate the bilateral link between the U.S. and Japanese economies in terms
of how R&D capital formation in one country affects the production structure, physical and R&D
capital accumulation, and productivity growth in the other country.
       We find that production processes become less labor intensive as international R&D
spillovers grow. In the short-run, R&D intensity is complementary to the international spillover.
This relationship persists in the long-run for the U.S., but the Japanese decrease their own R&D
intensity. U.S. R&D capital accounts for 60% of Japanese total factor productivity growth, while
Japanese R&D capital contributes 20% to U.S. productivity gains. International spillovers cause
social rates of return to be about four times the private returns.

     A wealth of evidence suggests that a country's production process and

productivity growth depend on its current and past investments in R&D

activities (see the surveys by Griliches (1988], and Nadiri (1993)).

Moreover, with the growing importance of international trade in products and

services, foreign direct investment, and international knowledge diffusion, a

country's production structure and productivity growth depend, not only on

the accumulation of its own R&D capital, but also on the R&D activities of

other economies.1 The purpose of this paper is to empirically investigate

how U.S. R&D capital accumulation affects the production structure, physical

and R&D capital formation, and productivity growth in the Japanese economy,

and simultaneously how Japanese R&D investment affects these same elements in

the U.S. economy.

     There is a public good aspect to R&D capital accumulation. The benefits

from R&D cannot be be completely appropriated by the R&D performers, and,

inevitably, there are spillovers or externalities. R&D spillovers spur the

diffusion of new knowledge, while they simultaneously create disincentives to

undertake R&D investment. A number of recent empirical papers have shown the

importance of domestic R&D spillovers in generating productivity gains and in

affecting R&D capital accumulation (see the surveys by Griliches (1988),

Cohen and Levin (1989], and Nadiri [19933)

       R&D spillovers are not necessarily contained within national boundaries.

International R&D spillovers are transmitted in a number of ways. Exports of

goods and services, international alliances between firms, such as licensing

agreements and joint ventures, foreign direct investment, international

labor markets for scientists and engineers, and international

communications, such as conferences, are some of the transmission mechanisms.

It is important to emphasize that international transactions do not have to

occur in order for spillovers to flow between nations. For example, Japanese

automobile producers operating in the U.S. can perform reverse engineering on

U.S. vehicles in the U.S. and transmit this information back to Japan. Thus

the potential magnitude and extent of international spillovers can be quite

pervasive.

       In this paper we develop a bilateral model of production between the

U.S. and Japanese economies (see Jorgenson and Nishintizu [1978], and

Jorgenson, Sakuramoto, Yoshioka, and Kuroda [1990]). The significance of

this approach is that production and R&D decisions for the U.S. and Japan are

modeled simultaneously. International spillovers do not influence only

productivity growth or production cost, but they simultaneously alter

production structures, including decisions on R&D capital. Thus we estimate

the   effects   of international R&D spillovers on production cost, traditional

factor   demands (such as the demand for labor), the demand for R&D capital,
and productivity growth rates in each country.
      We generalize the bilateral production model to account for adjustment

costs associated with physical and R&D capital formation. Empirical evidence
                                     —3—




3uggests that adjustment costs prevent producers from iwtnediately attaining

long—run equilibrium Csee Morrison and Berndt (1981), Epstein and Yatchew

(1985), Mobnen, Nadiri and Prucha (l986J, and Bernstein and Nadiri (1989)).

Producers adjust toward long—run equilibrium through    successive   short—run or

temporary equilibria. Thus we are able to determine the bilateral effects on

cost and production structure associated with international spillovers

between the U.S. and Japanese economies in both the short and long—runs.

Moreover, Berndt and Fuss [1986, Mohnen and Bernstein (1991], and Morrison

(1992) have shown that it is important to account for deviations from

long—run equilibrium in measuring productivity growth. Mistakenly assuming

that producers are at their long—run desired capital stock levels (both for

physical and R&D capital) can lead to significant biases in measured

productivity growth rates and biases in accounting for the various

determinants of productivity growth. In this paper we investigate the

contribution to productivity growth from international spiliovers within the

context of adjustment costs for physical and R&D capital accumulation.

     This paper is organized into a number of sections. The next section

contains the specification of the model. Section 3 presents the estimation

results, results from various hypothesis tests, and measures of adjustment

costs. The international spillover effects in both the short and long—runs

are described in section 4. The contribution of international spillovers to

productivity growth and to the social rates of return are presented in

section 5. In the last section we conclude the paper.

2. Modal    Specification


     The model that we specify enables us to investigate the effects of

Japanese R&D capital on the production structure in the U.S., and conversely

the effects of U.S. R&D capital on Japanese production. Specifically, we

want to determine the effects of one country's R&D capital on cost, factor

demands, capital accumulation, and productivity growth in the other country.

Production process in each country can be represented by,2



     Cl)                 F(v,K,4K,5)

where y is output, v is the n dimensional vector of variable factor demands,

K is the m dimensional vector of quasi—fixed or capital factor demands, S is

the o dimensional vector of R&D spillovers, which in a bilateral production

model is the R&D capital from the other country, F is the production

function,3 In the production function the presence of AX —       —


signifies   that there are adjustment costs associated with changes in the

capital inputs.

     The capital inputs accumulate according to,



     (2)          1< —
                   t     I
                         t
                             + CI —
                                In    t—l



where I is the vector of gross additions to the capital inputs, I is the m

dimensional identity matrix, (as there are in capital inputs), and 6 is the
                                          —5—




diagonal matrix of constant depreciation rates.

       Production decisions in each country are determined under

competitive     conditions and according to     the minimization of the expected

discounted     stream of costs. Thus,

                                                T          T
       (3)         man          E(EQ a(O,r)(wv +
                     t .r t—o
                   {v ,I




where E is the conditional expectations operator in the current period, a is

the discount factor, w     is   the vector of exogenous variable factor prices, and

q is the vector of exogenous capital acquisition prices. Now (3) is

minimized subject to the production function, (equation (1)), the capital

accumulation conditions, (equation (2)), and the expected stream of output,

variable factor prices and capital acquisition prices. This problem can be
solved in two stages. The first stage pertains to the determination of the
variable     factor demands, while the second stage relates to the demands for

the capital inputs. Suppose for the moment          that       the capital inputs are

given. In order to find the variable factor demands from (3), we minimize at

each point in time wtv subject to the production function and conditional on

the capital inputs. The variable factor demand functions which are obtained

as the solution to this problem are considered the short—run production

equilibrium conditions, because the capital inputs are fixed. Substituting

the   short—run equilibrium conditions into variable factor cost (that is wtv)
yields the variable cost function,

      (4)           c
                            CV(w,y,K1,AK,s1)


where cV is variable cost and          is the variable cost function, which is

twice continuously differentiable, nondecreasing in w, y, and X,

nonincreasing in K, concave and homogeneous of degree one in w, convex in K

and ax.

     We specify the following functional form for the variable cost function,



      (5)               —   (aw + .5w'ftwW1 + wØS1)y +

                                         1)

                            + .5K' 1Q( W/y + K' 1(S 1W + .SAKMAKW/y


where w — w        is an index of variable factor prices, where the coefficient

vector is known and defined by the particular index number.4 The parameters
are represented by the nfl vector a, the nxn matrix $, the nxo matrix 0, the
man matrix , the mxm matrix g, the mxo matrix t, the mxm matrix JS, and the
scalar ij.   The   parameter matrices are assumed to be symmetric. This
functional form is a simple extension of the one developed by Diewert and
Wales [1997). The extension involves the possibility of non—constant returns
to scale (7) is the inverse of the scale parameter) and adjustment costs (p is
the adjustment cost parameter matrix)) Adjustment costs are such that in
the long run when there is no net      investment,   marginal adjustment costs are
zero. The functional form incorporates the condition that the variable cost
                                                         —7—




function is homogeneous of degree one in variable factor prices. The

attractiveness of this functional form is that the concavity and convexity

properties of the variable cost function can be imposed without restricting

the flexibility of the function. In addition, under suitable expectations cf

the exogenous variables, closed form solutions can be obtained for the

quasi—fixed factors.

        The demands for the variable factors are retrieved from the variable

cost function by applying Shephard's Lemma (see Diewert (1982]). Thus with

v —                                         and using



        (6)         vt —     (a +              —
                                                     .swww2v    + 0T5    )yfl ..


                             + (
                                    .5K 1K 1/yfl + K1(S + .5AXTjthK/y)v.


The variable factor demands            depend on the variable       factor p;ices, output, the
capital       inputs, net investment in            the capital inputs and the R&D spillovers.

        In order to determine the demands for the capital inputs, substitute the

right    side of (5) into (3) for wv and maximize (3) subject to the capital
accumulation equations (given as equation set (2)) .                    Assuming   that relative
variable factor prices Cw/W), output, R&D spillovers and the real discount
rate (a(t,t+l)           (1+r)1) are not expected to change, then the demands for
the   capital inputs are given by,6

where H is the adjustment coefficient matrix, and the long—run demands for

the   capital    inputs are K       -   — 1A,   where A —      ('w/W + (S1 +
and w' — Cr1       +        is the vector of rental rates for the capital inputs.
       The matrix of adjustment coefficients must satisfy the following matrix

equation,



       (8)                 + C    + ri)M -     — 0.



In general, we cannot solve for H in terms of                  and p. However, as shown by

Epstein and Yatchew [19851, we are able to solve for                  in terms of i   and   H.

Define B —      —pM    and C — —M(t, where B and C are symmetric matrices. Thus,

using (8), C               + (1 + r) (B —    rw)1,     and the demands for the capital

inputs can be written as,



                      K     CA + (I +
       (9)
                       t      t         I'       t—1




The demands for the capital inputs are written in terms of the parameter

matrices B and p. Notice that the adjustment coefficient matrix can be

obtained      from these parameter matrices, as H —           —M'B.   The demands for the
capital inputs depend on the lagged values of these inputs, and through the A
matrix,      the demands also depend on variable factor prices, the rental rates,

output quantity, and the R&D spillovers.7

      The set of equations to be estimated consists of (6) and (9), which
                                    —9—




relate to the demands for the factors of production. Our emphasis in this

paper is on the effects that international R&D spillovers have on production

structure and productivity growth. We see that this framework enables us to

investigate the impact of international R&D spillovers on factor demands in

the short and long runs, as well on the decomposition of productivity growth.



3. Estination Rasults



     The data used to estimate the model relate to a common set of industries

and time period for the United States and Japan. There are eleven

industries. These are Food and and Kindred Products, Paper and Allied

Products, Chemicals and Allied Products, Petroleum and Coal Products, Stone

Clay and Glass, Primary Metals, Fabricated Metals, Non—electrical Machinery,

Electrical Products, Transportation Equipment, and Scientific Instruments.

The sample period is 1962—1988. the non—R&D data are described in detail in

Denny, Bernstein, Fuss, Waverman and Nakamura (19921.8 The industries for

each country are aggregated by Fisher indexes (see Diewert. (1989]) into a

single sector. We refer to this sector as the R&D intensive sector as 90% of

all manufacturing R&D investment is performed here.9 the industries are

aggregated into broad R&D sectors because we are interested in the effects

of international spillovers. We want to abstract from the spillovers that

exist between the industries within a country.10

     The data consist of prices and quantities for two variable factors,

labor and intermediate; two capital inputs, physical and R&D, output
                                         —10—




quantity,    and R&D spillover, which is the R&D capital of the foreign R&D

intensive sector. The data for the Japanese and U.S. R&D intensive sectors

are treated as separate sets of observations. These observations are assumed

to be generated by an econometric model with distinct first order parameters

(represented by the a vector), distinct R&D spillover parameters (represented

by the 0, and (     matrices),   distinct scale parameter (represented by the

inverse of ifl, and the remaining second order parameters are common. In this

model differences in the technology across countries at a point in time are

reflected in differences in the a and i         parameters.   Differences in the

technology over time between the countries are represented by differences in

the spillover parameters (that is by the 0 and (         matrices)
        Unobservable stochastic disturbances are added to equation sets (6), and

(9) .    These disturbances reflect random elements in the production process

not reflected in the variable cost function, and errors of implementation of

the production plans. The disturbances have zero expected value and

positive definite covariance matrix.'1

        Equation   sets (6) and (9) were jointly estimated using the nonlinear
Maximum Likelihood Estimator. The first set of estimates produced scale
estimates of 1.004 and 1.021 for the U.S.         and Japan respectively. In this

case the log of the likelihood function increased by only 1.329 over the

constant returns to scale model. Thus we could not reject constant returns

to scale for both the U.S. and Japanese R&D intensive sectors.'2 We then

proceeded to estimate the model under constant returns to scale. In

addition, we generalized the flexible accelerator in the following way,
                                             —11-




        (10)




where      is a two dimensional symmetric parameter matrix, and d is                 a duimny
variable that takes the value of 1 in short—run equilibrium and 0 in long—run
equilibrium.13 Recall that the M matrix is the adjustment matrix (see
equations (7)      and   (9)) .    If • is zero then the model is consistent          with the
flexible       accelerator. Equation sets (6) and (9) were estimated under the

hypotheses that 0 — 0 and O             0. Under the null hypothesis the log of the

likelihood function was 484.474 and under the alternative hypothesis the

value was 534.223. Therefore we reject the simple flexible accelerator model

and adopt the generalized form. These estimates are presented in table ,14

In table 1 we see from the squared correlation coefficients, that the model

fits the data quite well.'5 We also estimated the model with only first order

and spillover parameters. In other words we set                  —         —
                                                                                  — Mkj 0k —
0, i —    l,m,   k,j —   p,r.     In this situation the log of the likelihood function

was 483.219. Thus we reject the absence of second order parameters in the

estimation model. The model was also estimated when the spillover parameters

were set to zero. We set               —     — 0, 1 —   p,r.   In this case the log of

the likelihood function was 521.297, and so we reject the model without R&D

spillovers.

       In order to see if the U.S. and Japanese sectors are in long—run

equilibrium, the model was estimated under the condition that                       — 0   ,   i,j —
p,r.     With the three adjustment parameters (since                 —

log   of the likelihood was 409.073. Thus we reject long—run equilibrium for

the R&D intensive sectors of the Japanese and U.S. economies. Indeed, we

can calculate the speeds of adjustment towards long—run equilibrium from

the matrix M —   —jiB.   The speeds of adjustment are presented in table 2.

This table shows us that the own adjustment speed for physical capital is 45%

faster than for R&D capital in the U.S., while in Japan, physical capital

adjusts 58% faster than R&D capital. Ignoring the cross adjustment

coefficients for the moment, we find in the U.S. that around 21% of the

adjustment for physical capital occurs in the first year. In this same time

period only about 15% of the gap between long and short—run R&D capital stock

closes. For Japan the corresponding speeds are 22% and 14%.      The results on

the relative magnitudes of the own adjustment speeds are similar to Mohnen,

ladiri and prucha [19863, for U.S and Japanese manufacturing sectors,

Bernstein and Nadiri [1989] for U.S. firms, and Nadiri and Prucha [1990) for

U.S., and Japanese electrical products industries. However, we find that the

own adjustment speeds for the R&D intensive sectors of the two economies are

faster than for the manufacturing sector as a whole.

      The cross adjustment coefficients in table 2 are negative. This means

that physical and R&D capital are adjustment complements. Thus when the

long—run demand for physical capital exceeds the short—run demand the

adjustment of R&D capital decelerates. This same process occurs when the

roles of the two capital stocks are reversed. An excess demand for physical

capital slows the adjustment process of R&D capital by around 18% in a single

year in the U.S. and in Japan. In addition, an excess demand for R&D capital
                                          —15—




 slows the physical capital adjustment by 0% in one year in the U.S. and

 Japan. In general, we do not find adjustment speeds         too   dissimilar between
 the U.S. and Japanese R&D intensive sectors.




 4.-   Spiflover   Effects



        In this section we consider the effects of international R&D spillovers

 on the structure of production, We have seen that the estimation model

without international R&D spillovers can be rejected. Thus we want to

calculate the effects of the spillover on variable cost and factor demands.

In particular, we calculate both the short and long—run effects that Japanese

R&D    capital exerts on the labor—output, intermediate input—output, physical
capital—output, and R&D capital—output         ratios for the U.S. R&D    intensive
sector,       Similarly, we compute the effects for the Japanese R&D intensive

sector based on changes in the U.S. R&D capital.

       To determine the short—run spillover effects, differentiate the capital

input demand     equations   (equation set (9)) with respect to the      spillover
variable,


       (11)             O(K/y)/8S      — CC.



Since capital inputs affect the short—run demand for the variable factors

through the capital—output ratio and adjustment costs, differentiating

equation set (6) with respect to the spillover yields,
                                           —16—

 Equation (12) shows that there are three effects of R&D spiliover on

 the variable factor demands. There is the direct effect through         and

 the indirect effects associated with the capital inputs through ., and with

 net investments through 2.

         From the specification of the average variable cost function (which is

 equation (5)), we see that it is affected by R&D spillovers. Differentiating

equation (5) with respect to the R&D spillover leads to,



         (13) a(c/y)Ias    —
                               wT#   + (K1/y)TQq + (AK/y)Tg(8(K/y)/3s)w


There are three effects of the international R&D spillover on unit variable

cost. The first is the direct unit cost—reducing effect which arises from 0.

From table 1 we see that this effect is indeed negative (as
                                                                 0<0). The
remaining two effects operate through the capital intensities and adjustment
costs.


     The elasticity conversions of equations (11), (12), and      (13) are

presented in table 3. From this table we see that in the short      run a 1

percent increase in the U.S. R&D capital decreases Japanese average variable

cost by 0.53%. This is the direct effect on average variable cost holding

fixed the factor intensities. Since an increase in R&D spillovers represent

technological change, the direct effect on average variable cost defines a

measure of the rate of technological change. Thus there are technological

gains for Japan from international spillovers. The U.S. also benefits from

international spillovers. Japanese R&D capital directly reduces U.S.

average variable cost, but the effect is about twelve times smaller than the

spillover effect generated for the Japanese R&D intensive sector.

     From table 3 we see that international R&D spillovers reduce the

labor—output, and physical capital—output ratios for both the U.S. and

Japanese sectors. In the U.S., labor and physical capital output ratios

decline by 0.02%, but in Japan these ratios decrease by 3.5% and 0.13%

respectively. The effects from U.S. R&D capital are significantly greater

than the effects arising from the Japanese generated spillover. Moreover,

Japan's labor intensity dramatically declines as a result of U.S. R&D

investment. International spillovers alter Japan's production process such

that output is produced more intensively using intermediate inputs at the

expense of physical capital and especially labor.16

     It is interesting to note that the R&D intensities increase for both

countries a result of the spillovers. As we observe from table 3,

international spillovers cause the Japanese R&D intensive sector to increase

its R&D intensity by more than twice the effect found in the U.S.. In a

sense own R&D intensity is complementary to new knowledge obtained from

foreign sources. Cohen and Levinthal (1989) have emphasized the

complementarity between R&D activities and domestic spillovers. In this

paper we see that this relationship also exists between international

spillovers and R&D capital.

      The long—run spillover effects are are derived by noting that the

 long—run capital input demands are given by K: —                      and

 To obtain the long—run spillover effects on
                                             average variable cost and the

 variable input—output ratios, in equation set (5) and (6) set tic — 0, and

 substitute f   for   K1. Thus we get,



      (15) 8(Ve/Y)/3S          —       +       c3(K/y)/as     +

                                       +               + v(s_l)To(x:,y),asl,

     The long—run spillover effects are presented in elasticity form in table

4. We see that, as in the short run, the Japanese results are relatively

more elastic. Indeed for Japan in the long—run a 1% increase in U.S. R&D

capital leads to a 1% decrease in average variable cost. This is the direct

effect of the spillover on unit variable cost before Japan alters its

production process in light of the new knowledge it obtains via the

international spillover. An interesting feature of the long-run results is

that as new knowledge is transmitted from the U.S. to Japan the latter

reduces its own R&D intensity. The international spillover enables             Japan to

rely less on its own R&D capital per unit of output produced. This is not

  5. Productivity           Growth and Social     Returns



         Total   factor     productivity (TFP) growth is a measure of the dynamic

 efficiency of a producerj8 In this section of
                                                                   the paper we want to measure
 and   decompcse TFP growth for the U.S. and
                                                            Japanese R&D intensive sectors. In
 particular, we want to determine the
                                                     contribution of R&D SPillovers to TFP
 growth rates.

        By definition the traditional measure of
                                                               TFP growth is the difference
 between output and input growth rates.
                                                        In our context, inputs are defined by
 labor, physical capital, intermediate
                                                     inputs, and R&D capital. Hence TFP
 growth can be measured in discrete time as,

where the subscript t represents the

past period, the subscript in designates the mean value of a variable (for

the cost of the variable and quasi—fixed factors.19

       We are able to decompose TFP growth rates

second order quadratic forms whose second order parameters do not change

over time, then TFP can be decomposed into (see Denny and Fuss (1983)1,20

Equation (18) shows the difference in variable cost between two time                                                 periods.
The difference is attributable to the variable factor prices, output

quantity, capital stocks, net investment flows, and R&D spillovers. Variable

cost depends on these variables. In addition, by definition of variable

cost,   the change over two periods is given by, c —                                          — Z(w(v                 —

        The decomposition of Tfl growth, as shown by the right side of equation

(19), consists of four elements. The first element is the short—run scale
                                     —23—




 effect, where (OcV/Oy) (y/Y) can be defined as the short—run cost

 flexibility or the inverse of the short—run degree of returns to scale

 (evaluated at the means of the variables). The second element relates to the

 capital adjustment effects, which arise because the rental rate on each

 capital input does not equal the cost reduction from this factor of

production. The third element consists of the adjustment cost effects

associated with both physical and R&D capital. The last element is the R&D

spillover effect.

     The spillover effect can be further decomposed into two elements. These

two facets can be obtained from equation (13) where we observed that there is

both a direct and indirect effect of the spillover on variable cost. Noting

that Oc"/8S   yO(c"/y)/ÔS, we can substitute the right side of equation (13)

into the last term on the right side of equation (19). The direct effect,

which is defined as the effect on variable cost when all input—output ratios

are held fixed, can be considered the traditional technological change effect

on TFP growth. Notice that although the spillover effect is exogenous to the

spillover receiver, it is not exogenous in the bilateral model of production,

since it is the R&D capital of the spillover source. The indirect spillover

effect on productivity growth represents the impact on factor intensities

from the new knowledge obtained from the foreign country.

     Tfl growth and decomposition for the U.S. and Japanese R&D intensive

sectors are presented in table S. Japanese TFP growth generally exceeds the

rate obtained for the U.S. R&D intensive sector. Differences in TFP growth

are not that great until 1974. However, from the mid seventies until the mid
                                       —24—




eighties the Japanese R&D intensive sector significantly out performs the U.S.

sector. The main source of Tfl' gains for both countries arises from the

marginal profitability of capital accumulation (both physical and R&D

capital) .   Capital   accumulation is profitable because the marginal benefit of

physical and R&D capital (as represented by their respective variable cost

reductions) exceeds their rental rates. This differential creates the

incentive for capital expansion.

     The second major source of TFP improvement occurs as a result of the

direct international spillover effect, or in other words the technological

change effect. International R&D spillovers are a consistent source of TFP

gains for both countries over the sample period, as they generate direct

variable cost reductions. In addition, spillovers generally increase the

demands for the variable inputs. This, in turn, causes variable cost to

rise, and productivity growth to fall. Thus the indirect international

spillover effect reduces TFP growth.                           -




     From table 5, we observe that the gains from the direct spillover effect

are greater for Japan compared to the U.S.. Moreover, the losses associated

with the indirect spillover effect are relatively smaller for the Japanese

R&D intensive sector.      Abstracting from the indirect spillover effect, the

direct effect from Japanese R&D capital contributes about 20% to U.S.

productivity growth over the two decades from the mid sixties to the mid

eighties. The direct contribution of U.S. R&D capital to Japanese

productivity growth is substantially greater than the impact of Japanese R&D

capital on U.S. Tfl' growth. Over the same time period, the U.S. effect

accounts for around 60% of Japanese TFP growth in its R&D intensive sector.

       The social rates of return to R&D capital equal the private rates of

return plus the returns associated with the international spil1overs.2' These

latter returns can be calculated by considering a situation where the

international spillovers have been internalized.                In this regard we define
the   joint U.S.—Japan expected discounted flow of funds,

The superscript j refers to the country.

       Consider the right side of equation (20) to be evaluated at the                       -




equilibrium input—output ratios for each country. In equilibrium, expected
discounted cost for each country is at a minimum. However, joint expected
discounted cost is not minimized relative to the case where the
international spillovers are internalized, With                the   internalization   of the

R&D   spillovers, there is additional profit (through cost               reductions) to be

earned from    each of the R&D capital stocks. The additional profit is the
reduction     in joint cost. Using equation (5), the reduction in joint cost in

equilibrium in period t+1 from an increase in the ith country's R&D capital

Recall     that the spillover to country j is the ith Country's R&D capital.
Equation (21) shows the wedge between the social and private rates of
return evaluated in equilibrium.
        Next we need the private rate of return to R&D capital for each country.
This    return is obtained from the first order condition for R&D capital as

part of the problem defined by (3). The private return is the discount rate

(that   is the opportunity cost of funds) plus the marginal adjustment costs
per dollar of capital stock. Defining p to be the private rate of return
of   R&D capital in period t for            country j, we have,22


        (22)            —   r   +



Thus the social rate of return to R&D              capital   for country j is,



        (23)                     +



       Using equation (22), the sample mean private rates of return to R&D
capital    for the 13.5. and Japanese R&D intensive            sectors are respectively
0.169   and 0.176. The estimates for the private returns are quite similar and

are consistent with those obtained in other studies (see for example

Bernstein and Nadiri (1968) for the U.S. and Goto and Suzuki [1969] for

Japan) .       The sample mean      of   the wedge between the social and private returns

that accounts for the international apillovers between the U.S. and Japan

(this is the second term on the right aide of (23)) is 0.509 for the U.S.,
                                    —28—




and 0.395 for Japan. Therefore the social rate of return for U.S. R&D

capital is 0.678 or more than 300% greater than the private rate of return.

For the Japanese R&D intensive sector the social rate of return is 0.571 or

about 225% greater than the private return.

     The estimates of the social returns associated with the international

spillovers between the U.S. and Japan have not been previously calculated.

However, they are not out of line with the estimates associated with domestic

R&D spiflovers (see for example the survey by Nadiri (19931. It appears that

international spillovers are potentially as important as domestic spillovers.



6. Conclusion



     The empirical results in this paper show that for the 13.5. and Japanese

R&D intensive sectors domestic production cost, traditional factor

intensities, and R&D capital intensity are affected by international R&D

spillovers between the two countries. These findings exist in both the short

and long—runs. However, there are important differences in the results

across runs and across countries. Short—run domestic R&D intensity is

complementary to the international spillover. In the U.S. a 1% increase in

the international spillover causes R&D intensity to rise by 0.02%, while for

Japan the effect is twice the U.S. elasticity. The complementarity persists

and becomes stronger for the U.S., in the long—run Japan substitutes U.S. R&D

capital for its own and thereby reduces its R&D intensity.

     The most dramatic difference between the two countries has to do with
                                           —29—




labor    intensity. Japan reduces its labor intensity by 3.5% in response to a

1% increase in the international spillover from the U.S. .          The corresponding

elasticity for the U.S. is only 0.01%. The Japanese R&D intensive sector

substantially increases its knowledge intensity as the international

spillover from the U.S. grows. In this situation we find that empirically

it    is important to distinguish between short and long—run equilibrium
specifications, and to distinguish between the technologies in the U.S. and
Japan when investigating the effects of international spillovers.
        International   R&D spillovers   directly contribute to productivity growth
in    both countries. International spillovers from the U.S. account for about

60% of Japanese productivity growth. The contribution front Japan to the U.S.

is smaller, but nevertheless not inconsequential, as the magnitude is 20%.

The   existence of international spillovers imply that social rates of return
to    R&D capital exceed private returns. We      estimated that   the private rates

of return to R&D capital are around 17% in both countries,, while the social

returns are three and a half to four times greater than the private return.

   For a theoretical development of the international role of R&D capital
accumulation see Ethier (1982], and Grossman and Helpman (1991).

2
   For simplicity, we do not introduce country specific notation. See
Diewert (1992) for the properties relating to production functions.


   See Griliches [1979] for a discussion on the issues relating to R&D
spillovers in the production function. Bernstein and Nadiri (1999) have
applied the production approach to the analysis of domestic intraindustry and
interindustry spillovers.


   W is defined to be a Laspeyres price index of the variable factors of
production. Thus the y vector of coefficients consists of the variable
factor cost shares in the period of normalization, which is 1985.


   Although there is the possibility of non—constant returns to scale, the
degree of returns to scale is assumed to be exogenous.

6
   We can also solve the model when expectations are based on autoregressive
processes, or when there is perfect foresight. In addition, if the capital
inputs are imediately productive then we just need to form expectations on
real output (y/W)


   It should also be noted that the demand., for the variable factors are also
affected by the reparameterization of the solution to the capital inputs,
since the parameter matrices M and    appear in these demand equations.


   The base period for the data in this paper is 1985. Thus we adjusted all
U.S. price indexes to be one in 1985 and we adjusted the purchasing power
parities (PPP), obtained from Jorgenson and Kuroda (1990), to be indexed in
1985. We also avoided double counting by subtracting the R&D expenditure
components from costs of labor, physical capital, and intermediate inputs.
The R&D capital stock is developed by accumulating deflated R&D expenditures,
assuming a depreciation rate of 10% (see Nadiri and Prucha (1993)) .  Initial
stocks were calculated by grossing up initial deflated expenditures by the
depreciation rate plus the growth rate of physical capital.

   These industries also account for around 80% of manufacturing output and
employment in each country.

       See Bernstein and Nadir! ttgeej for results on U.S. interindustry
 spillovers,   and Goto and Suzuki (1989] for results on Japanese industries.

     In the estimation of equation sets (6), and (9), we can impose the
 conditions that the variable cost function must be concave in the variable
 factor prices and convex in the capital inputs and net investment.  These
 conditions result in the following parameter restrictions,    — — DD,    -
 EE and ji — GG , where
                        D,E and G are lower triangular matrices. We do not
 impose these conditions because the estimates turn out to satisfy them. In
 order to identify the parameters we impose the restriction that i — 0
                                                                             I'
 where i is the unity vector.

 12
     The definition of returns to scale is inclusive of the R&D capital input
 and adjustment costs in both physical and R&D capital inputs,  There are no
 previous estimates of returns to scale in these sectors, as a
                                                               whole, although
 Nadir! and Prucha [1990] found slightly increasing returns to scale in the
 U.S. and Japanese electrical products industries.

 13
    The dummy variable is associated with the parameter matrix 0, because
                                                                          the
test regarding the flexible accelerator can only be conducted in a short—run
equilibrium.

14
    Under constant returns to scale the model was estimated in ratio form. In
other words the endogenous variables are input—output ratios.
15
    The correlation coefficients are between observed and predicted endogenous
variables, where the predicted values are computed from the reduced form
estimated equations. In addition, we see from table 1 that without imposing
the curvature conditions that the variable cost function is concave in the
variable factor prices as fi11<0, the function is convex in the capital inputs
as b <0, i — p,r, and b b — b2 >0 (recall that the B matrix is negatively
    ii                  pprr    pr
related to the     matrix from equations (7) and C9)), and the function is
convex in net investments as $L>0, i —    p,r,   and MppMrr —

16
    The directional changes found for international spillovers are similar to
those obtained from domestic spillover studies in the U.S. and Japan (see
Bernstein and Nadiri (1988] and Gob and Suzuki (1989]).

different measures and interpretations of productivity growth.

quantities which are lagged one period.

    A unit variable cost function was estimated. However, this does not pose
a problem for the Tfl' decomposition, since ac"/az — ya(cV/y)/Oz +8,   —


c"/y   if z —   y,   and 0 otherwise.

21  The private rates of return relate to the R&D intensive sector in each
country. In addition, any intrasectoral spillovers have been internalized.
Since we are focusing on international spillovers, domestic spillovers
between the R&D intensive sector and other sectors of the economy of a
country are assumed to be inconsequential. This appears to be reasonable
since about 90% of R&D investment in both the U.S. and Japanese economies are
performed within the R&D intensive sector.

22
    The rate of return for R&D capital is found from the Euler equation by
equating the expected marginal benefit to the expected marginal cost. The
former is the expected future cost reductions (including adjustment cost
savings) net of depreciation per dollar of capital stock. The
expected marginal coat is the discount rate plus marginal adjustment costs
