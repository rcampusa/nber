IT"TRODUCTION


       The history of foreign lending in the 19th and 20th centuries offers a rich lode of

evidence on the operation of international capital markets. The last hundred years have

been punctuated by a series of crises -- in the 1870s, 1890s and 1930s to cite three

instances -- bearing a striking resemblanceto the debt crisis of the 1980s. For the

historian, that experience provides an exceptional opportunity to study the long-term

evolution   of international markets and their adaptation to repeated shocks. For the
economist, it provides an opportunity to reflect on how the current debt crisis may be

resolved. It is not possible to extrapolate directly from historical experience, since

institutionalaspects of the lending process, including the relative importance of bank and

bond finance, the rise of supranational agencies such as the World Bank and the

International Monetary Fund, and the role of creditor-country governments in

rescheduling, have changed fundamentally over the past century. But even though the

extent of institutionalvariation renders naive the hope that one might be able to draw

simple 'lessons from the past,'   it still offers the only evidence we have on the efficiency
and distributional effects of different approaches to organizing international
                                                                               lending and

readjusting existing debts.
    In a series   of papers we have examinedthe interwar debt crisis from this

perspectivejJ Our analysis has spanned the lending of the 1920s, the defaults of the

1930s, and the debt readjustments    of the 1940s and 1950s. This paper summarizesand
extends the main conclusions    i   that   research. The discussion will be organized around
nine major findings.
I. Interwar investors exhibited sophistication and foresight at the lending stage. Our

analysis suggests that the past repaymentrecord    of a country, its current political
circumstances and its economic policies all figured in the deteimination    of the risk

premia on foreign bonds floated in the 1920s. There is little evidence that capital
markets have grown more sophisticated over time,      or that banks have a comparative

advantage in processing the relevant information. To the contrary, the bond market's

response to borrower characteristicsduring the 1920s bears a remarkable resemblanceto

experience during the post-1970era of bank finance,

2. Neither monocausalexplanations, nor for that matter multivariate explanations limited

to economic variables, suffice to explain the incidence and extent of default. While

authors such as Diaz-Alejandro (1983) and Fishlow (1985) have pointed rightly to the

magnitude of the external shock, proxied typicallyby the extent of terms-of-trade

deterioration, as a leading indicator of default, our own work reveals the importance of
other economic variables, including the burden     of the debt and the nature of the domestic
policy response, as well as noneconomic variables, such as proximity to a major military

power and internationalpolitical links,

 3. The implications of different debt-management strategies    for subsequent

 macroeconomic performanceremain difficult to isolate. In the 1930s as in the 1980s,

 efforts to maintain debt service tended to be associated with fiscal austerity, import

 compression and export subsidies, while the decision to suspend payments was often

 accompanied by fiscal expansion, monetary reflation and policies of import-substituting

 industrialization.   This wholesale reorientation of a country's macroeconomic stance

 renders problematic any attempt to pick out the effects of external-debt management


                                               2
from   the entire constellation of policies. The accumulation of evidence points

nonetheless to the conclusion that countries which interrupted service on their external

debts recovered more quickly from the Great Depression than did countries which

resisted default. This contrasts with the experience of the 1980s, for which it is even

more difficult to discern a relationship between different debt-management strategies and

subsequent macroeconomic performance.

4. There is little evidence that countries which defaulted in the 1930s incurred a cost     in


terms of inferior capital market access after World War II. Following the conclusion of

negotiated settlements with the creditors, countries which previously had suspended

interest payments and amortization were offered virtually identical access to the capital

market as were countries which had maintaineddebt service without internlption This is

not to suggest that default was without costs us terms of market access, only that those
costs were not borne differentially by countries which interrupted service on their debts

once they reached settlement agreements with the creditors. Many of the costs were
external to the defaulting countries: neither defaulting nor nondefaulting debtors had

significant access to portfolio capital in the decades immediately following World War II.

5. The readjustment of defaulted debts entailed a protracted process   of negotiation. The
analogy with Chapter 11 corporate bankruptcy proceedings,in which default and

readjustment permit a clean break with the past, is no more applicable to the 1930s than
to the 1980s. In many cases, interruptions to debt service were only sporadic, and

uncertainty over the magnitude of transfers lingered for decades.


6. In contrast to the experience of the 1980s, interwar default in some cases led to   a
substantial reduction of transfers from debtor to creditor. What we might call selective


                                             3
debt relief' was, however, compatible with a reasonable overall rate of return to the

creditors. The risk premia charged ex ante sufficed to elevate the average realized rate

of return on sovereignloans above the yields on British and U.S. Treasury bonds.
Losses to creditors on provincial, municipal and corporate loans, although more

extensive, were still sufficient to yield positive ex post returns to British investors.

7. Notwithstandingthe contrast conventionally drawn between the extent of government
involvement in debt negotiationsin the 1930s and the 1980s, creditor-country govern-

ments often were intimately involved in the readjustment of interwar debts. The

difference between the 1930s and 1980s lies not in the extent of governmentintervention

but in its direction. In recent years creditor-country governments have exerted

conthuous pressure on the debtors to maintain service on their external debts. In the

 1930s and 1940s creditor-country governments pressured debtors and creditors alike.


8. Global schemes to short-circuitthe protracted process of bilateral negotiation proved
                                                              in the 1980s -- a special
unavailing. Nearly every element of the global plans proposed

 international lending facility, matched injections of private and public funds, conversion

 of existing assets into new ones featuringdifferent contingencies --    was first   suggested in

 the 1930s. Ultimately, those global schemes foundered on the issues of who should fund
 and control their administration. The failure of the global plans offered in the 1930s

 does not leave one optimistic about their prospects in the 1990s.


 9. Unlike global plans, market-baseddebt reduction made a useful contribution to

 resolving the debt crisis of the l930s by reducing the debt overhang and eliminating

 marginal creditors.    There is little systematic evidence that debt buybacks had a

 significant impact on secondary market prices, whose movement seems to have been

                                                4
influenced primarily by changes in the prospects for a negotiated settlement. In contrast

to their public statements of disapproval, creditor organizationswere willing in private to

entertain buybacks out of reserves as part of the readjustmentprocess.


1. The Lending Stage

    The international capital markets in the 1920s are accused of having engaged in all

manner of excesses. The issue houses pushed questionable obligations on hesitant

borrowers and questionable bonds on otherwisecautious investors./ New entrants into

the supply side of the market -- large New York banks which foresaw a series       of lean
years in wholesale and industrial banking, and jumped on the new bandwagon of retail

banking" -- were particularly guilty of such infractions.3j But they were not alone.

Private investors discriminatedinadequately between good and bad credit risks.4/

Governmentsfailed to monitor the industry adequately and to discourage dubious

activities, even erring in the other direction as when, for example, they encouraged the

flotation and purchase of German bonds.5/

       So it is alleged. Unfortunately, most of these assertions are difficult to test with

precision. It is tempting to cite, as successive authors have done, the poor cx post

performance of interwar loans as proof of the validity of the interpretation. There are
obvious dangers with drawing conclusions on the basis of 20-20 hindsight, however.

There was no reason for investors in the 1920s to anticipate an unprecedented

macroeconomic crisis on the scale   of the Great Depression. That their loans performed

poorly given the exceptionally poor state of the world does not suffice to impugn the

lending process.




                                             5
    It is more informativeto consider the market's ex ante assessment of the risks of

foreign lending. In Table   1   we report estimates of the determinants of spreads over risk

flee rates on foreign loans floated in New York and London in the 1920s. This analysis

utilizes ex ante yields to matutity on two samples of foreign bonds.d/ The regressions

relate the spread between those ex ante yields and contemporaneous Treasury bond rates

(consol rates for the U.K.) to counrty characteristics, current economic policies and

shifting capital-market conditions. The specification parallels that adopted by Edwards

(1986), who sought to address Guttentag and Herring's (1985) contention that rates

charged foreign borrowers on bank loans could not have incorporated adequate

countay-risk premia because they varied so little across loans. Edwards attempted to test

this hypothesis for both bank loans and bonds by regressing spreads on indicators for

countay risk such as the magnitude of the debt burden, the level       of investment, the policy
stance   of the debtor govemment,and other characteristicsof the borrower and the loan.
While he found for the bond market that the spread rose with the debVGNP ratio and

fell with the investment/ONE ratio, consistent with the hypothesis that lenders

distinguished among good and bad credit risks, his other coefficients were insignificant,

suggestingthat investorspald inadequate attention to other indicators of counuy risk.7J
    The regressions in Table     1   seek to replicate the essence of this analysis for the

l920s. The spread on each loan is related to the value of the debt (scaled by exports),

to the category of borrower (national governments versus others), to the year in which

the loan was issued, and to the geographical location of the borrower. We include also

two measures of current economic policies and conditions in the borrowing country: the

wade balance and the budget balance. For the 1920s         it is not possible to construct a
measure    of the investment share of ONE like that used by Edwards for the 1970s and

Instead, contemporary investment manuals urged investors to focus on the trade and

budget balances as the two most importantindicators of a country's capacity to generate
and mobilize the foreign exchange required to service external debts di!

    The spread on the dollar loans in column    1   varies considerably, with a mean of 2.6

percentage points and a standard deviationof   1,1    The omitted alternatives from the

vectors of dummy variables (which are picked up by the constant term) are 1920,

Germany and national governmentbonds, The coefficients on years indicate little

tendency of tile spread to widen or narrow over time, as one would have expected had

foreign lending tended to come into   or fall out of fashion.9/ Relative to the omitted
alternative (national govermnentloans), higher spreads were charged on loans to states,

municipalities,corporations and banks, which is consistent with the ex post evidence that
loans to national governments outperformed these other loans from the creditors' point of

view.IQI Only the coefficient on loans to corporationsdiffers significantly from that on
the omitted alternative, however, In the case of sterling loans, where the omitted.

alternative is U.K-guaranteed British Funds, again there is evidence of informed

behavior: higher risk premia were charged on loans to local governments than to central

governments,and on foreign than on Dominion issues. These results contrast with those
 of Edwards for the 1970s; he detected no discernible difference in spreads on loans to

 different categories of borrowers.

     In the equation for dollar bonds, the coefficients on regions suggest, not surprisingly,
 that the best bond-market reputations were enjoyed by Canada, the Central American

 republics and Western Europe. Both Canada and the countries of Western Europe had

 virtually unblemished records of servicing their foreign debts, while the small Central
American republics economically      or politically dependent on the United States had little
choice in the marterjjJ Conversely, the nations of Eastern Europe were charged the

largest risk premia. These geographical variations are suggestive of bondholder

sophistication, insofar as the pattern   of ex post returns indoates that loans to Eastern
Europe were relatively risky and that those to Western Europe and Centtal America were

relatively safe. With hindsight, only the risk premium attached to German loans is
anomalous. The spreads on loans to Germany, the leading borrower of American funds,

were smaller on average than those on loans not only to Eastern Europe and South

America but to Austtalia and Japan as well. This is consistent with the view of the U.S.

State and Commerce Departments, voiced as early as 1925, that American investors

tended to underestimatethe risks associated with investmentin German bonds,12/

    The results for sterling bonds are basically consistent. The average spread is smaller

(1.8 percentage points compared to 2.6 for the U.S.), perhaps reflecting the perception
that British loans were less risky given their rather different geographicaldestination; the

standard deviation of the spread is virtually identical (1.0 versus 1.1) to that for dollar

bonds. High risk premia were charged the Eastern European counthes, while Latin

America, Greece and Germany stood in the middle and the Domlnions and Japan enjoyed

the lowest costs of borrowing.

    The dummy variables for countries and regions capture a combination of political

factors influencing the likelihood   of default and, presumably, reputational factors related
to past repayment performance. In a well-functioning market, investors should also take

into account current economic policies. The coefficients on the trade and budget

balances speak to this question. In the equations for both steriing and dollar bonds, their

coefficients have the anticipated negative signs (larger trade and budget Surpluses tendcd

differs significantly from zero at standardconfidence levels.j31

    Absolute statements about the efficiency of a market are always problematic, but
                                                                                    that
comparative evaluations are more sutghfforward. In our case, there is no evidence
invastors were less discriminating in the l920s than in the 1970s. There is no evidence

that either banks or the bond market possessed a comparative advantage in the pricing of

foreign loans,

2, Causes of Default
    The debt crisis of the 1930s unfolded in three stepsd4I The first, spanning calendar

1931, was dominated by Latin American defaults. Interest and amortizationpayments

were at least partially suspended by virtually every South American county but
                                                                     middle of 1933,
Argentina. During the second phase, from the beginningof 1932 to the

default spread to Southern and Eastern Europe. The precise amount by which payments

were reduced varied across countries, but most couniries were affected to some extent.

The third phase. 'whose dawn coincided with the Monetary and Economic Conference of

 1933, was dominated by the default of Germany, the single largest foreign debtor.

     In the 1930s as in the 1980s, the debt crisis did not have a single cause. Liberal
                                                                                 to
 foreign borrowing in the l920s had increased the debtor counoles' vulnerability

 external shocks. In many Latin American countries, by 1928 central government

 debt/export ratios had risen to well in excess of 100 per cent, and interest and amorti
 zation on this component of the debt alone could require ten per cent of total export

 receiptsi5/ In certaln cases, debt/exportratios were considerably higher (Table 2).
 Germany, the largest single foreign borrower, had reparations as well as commercial

debts with which to contend; in 1928 reparations transfers plus commercial debt service

required more than 20 per cent of gross export receiptsid/

    Starting in 1928 the debtor countries were battered by a series of external shocks

which increased their transfer burden and reduced their debt-servicingcapacity. First

was the sudden decline in lending by the United States and other creditor nations. The

mounting boom on Wall Sweet diverted American funds from foreign to domestic uses
and like a powerful suction pump siphoned off liquidity from the rest of the world. At

the beginning of 1928 approximately $800 million was required to meet foreign        d&ot


service payments on dollar debtsdl! Net short- and long-term foreign lending by the

United States had exceeded $1 billion in l927 and reached nearly $700 million in 1928.

Thus, despite the collapse of new lending in the summer of 1928, the new money

provided between January and June nearly sufficed to finance that year's dollar debt
service costs. In 1929, net short- and long-term lending by the United States earned

negative, and the $800 million bill came due, As in the 1980s, part
                                                                    of the problem was

the suddenness of the shift

     There could have been no less opportune time for the collapse of global commodity

 markets. Primary commodity exporters had already come under strain. Their terms of

 trade had been deteriorating steadily over the course of the 1920s. These then dropped

 like a stone with the onset of the Depression. Lewis (1949) provides the sad litany.

 "From 1929 to 1930 the avenge price of wheat     fei by   19   per cent, cotton 27 per cent,

 wool 46 per cent, silk 30 per cent, rubber 42 per cent, sugar 20 per cent, coffee 43 per

 cent, copper 26 per cent, tin 29 per cent, the index of prices of commodities entering
 worid trade fell from 1929 to 1932 by 56 per cent for raw materials, 48 per cent for

 foodstuffs and 37 per cent for manufactures."iSI It is these developments that



                                             10
Diaz-Alejandro(1983) and Fishlow (1985) stress as determinants of default. They

emphasize first that the collapse of real export revenues was so severe that countries
could avoid default only through the most decisive, concerted action. They suggest that

the magnitude of the terms-of-tradedecline determined for whom the necessary steps

were still feasible. Argentina and Australia continued to service their debts, for example,

because as wheat exporters they suffered milder terms-of-tradedeclines than countries

like Brazil, which exported coffee, or Bolivia, which exported tin.

    The impact of the export-pricecollapse on foreign exchangereceipts was reinforced

by the contraction of export volumes. Between 1929 and 1932, world trade in foodstuffs

fell by 11 per cent, trade in raw materials by 19 per centj9/ These observations are

consonant with the explanation for default which emphasizes the magnitude of the

external shock.

    Empirical analysis of the incidence and extent of default suggests, however, that the
 commodity lottery' (Diaz-Alejandro'sphrase) was only one of several determinants of
the borrowing countries' response. In Eichengreenand Portes (1986) we reported

regressions relating the percentage of governmentand government-guaranteed debt in

default (for all levels of government) at various points in the 1930s to   a vector of

country characteristics. These results confirm the importance of the commodity-

composition of exports and the export price shock: more severe terms of uade declines

increased the incidence and extent of default. But in addition to the commodity lottery,

the extent of default was significantly related to a number   of other variables. Holding
constant the terms of trade decline, more heavily indebted countries were more likely to

default.

     Importantly,however, we found that, in additionto these measures of changes in the
debt burden and in debt-servicingcapacity,two other sets       of variables conditioned the
default decision, First, the domestic response to the external shock played an important

role. Countries which prevented large government budget dficits from emerging,

through either tax increases or expenditurereductions, were less likely to default than
their less spendthrift counterparts. To put the point another way, governments least

willing or able to retrench fiscally were least able to avoid default. Second, political

aspects   of the decision whether or not to suspend debt-service payments appear to retain
a role even after we control for economic characteristics    of the country. For example,
our equation significantly underpredicts the level of debt service maintained by Australia.

That Australia avoided default on even a portion of her external debt (nonwithstanding

attempts to suspend interest payments by a left-leaning state government in New South
Wales in 1931, which were countermandedby the national authorities) we attribute to

political ties to the country (Britain) to which the vast majority of the debt was owed.
    Overall, this analysis provides a nuanced picture of the debt-servicingdecisions of

borrowing countries. One cannot sustain the argument that the severity of the external
shock left each defaulting country with no other option. Neither does it appear that the

only factor differentiatingtheir situations was the extent of the terms-of-trade decline.
The seventy of the external shock, the vulnerability of the economy, the domestic policy

response, and a broader range of political factors combined to influence the decision.


3. Macroeconomic Repercussions of Default

    In the 1930s   as   in the 1980s, efforts to maintain external debt service entailed the

compression of imports to generate foreign exchange, and a surplus on the non-interest
current account of the public authorities to mobilize receipts for service of government

and government-guaranteed debt.         As tax   revenues declined with the deepening

Depression, governments were forced to impose draconian cuts on current expenditures in

order to avoid unmanageable public-sectordeficits, As export revenues declined and

international reserves were run down, the authorities were orced to adopt increasingly

stringent monetary stances in an effort to strengthen the balance         of payments. In
combination, these policies would be expected to have depressed domestic demand in

general and on investment demand        in particular.     Governments   willing to suspend   interest

payments had more scope on this account          for adopting monetary     and fiscal policies

conducive to recovery.

      There are obvious parallels with the 1980s, when the Latin American debtors, in a

desperate effort   to maintain   service on their debts, have been forced to adopt policies of

austerity which have resulted in nearly     a decade     of slow growth. But many observers
have cautioned the debtors that a moratorium or default, while           it may offer immediate
macroeconomicbenefits in terms of scope for the adoption of reflationary policies, may

also have macroeconomic costs in terms        of disruptions    to export- and capital-market

access. Exporters may encounter difficulties in obtaining trade finance or suffer

retaliatory trade sanctions.

        For the 1930s it is possible to compare economic performance across countries

adopting very different policies toward their external debts. Figures         1   and 2 compare the

rates   of growth of national income    and industrial production, respectively,     of the 'heavy'
and     'light' defaulters.W Both GNP and industrial production appear to have           expanded

more quickly in the "heavy defaulters after        1931.    The simple comparison suggests that

countries which opted for default recovered more successfully from the ravages of the

Great Depression.

     There are several reasons to treat the comparison with caution. For one, the

constellationof policies influencing growth may have differed across countries in ways
that are not directly attributable to their different debt-management strategies. Moreover,

there is the problem of sorting out the direction of causainy. As we explained in Secacn

2, countries suffering more severe declines in income were more likely to default; now

there is a suggestion that countries which defaulted enjoyed more rapid income growth.

There is nothing incompatible in the two arguments, but two-way causationposes

problems of identification. Even if the problems posed by the joinr endogeneityof
default and output growth can be solved, there is still the possibility that because

production declined more dramaticallybefore 1931 in countries which lapsed into default,
the emergence of higher levels of unemployment and excess capacity may have offered

more scope for output to snap back later. After suffering more serious terms-of-trade

declines before 1931, the serious defaulters may have benefited from more rapid

terms-of-tradeimprovementsas international commodity markets recovered thereafter.

In fact, however, Figure 3 while confirming the greater severity of the terms-of-trade

shock suffered by the heavy defaulters immediately after 1929 suggests that, with the

exception of 1934, the terms of trade of the two groups of countries subsequently evolved
more or less in parallel.2jJ

    Data limitations, along both the quantity and quality dimensions, preclude the

estimation of a simultaneous-equations model to sort out these effects definitively. Our

approach is to rely instead on   a sequence of simpler descriptive analyses. None
eliminates all of the problems acknowledged above, but all tend to point in the same

direction.
    Table 3 displays regressions in which we relate rates of growth       of industrial
production to both debt-management strategy (as measured by the share of government
and government-guaranteed debt, for all levels of government, in default) and the

severity of the external shock (as measured by the terms of trade).22/ To control for

cross-country differences in the secular rate   of growth, the dependentvariable is defined
as the deviation from the country mean for that variable for the sample period,

eliminating the need for a constant term./ To control for changes over time in the

global econorñic environment,we include a vector of dummy variables for years.
    When the terms of trade is included along with the measure of default, both

variables tend to be associated with variations in growth. Although the coefficient on the

terms of trade exhibits instability, in general it appears that countries sufferingmore

severe external shocks grew more slowly, as one would expect. And strikingly, countries

with a larger share of their external debts in default grew more quickly. This continues

to be the case when the vector of dummy variables for years is added and when the

terms of trade variable is dropped.

     One problem with basing inferences on these regressions is the likelihood that the

default variable   is endogenous. In defense of the ordinary least squares regressions in
Table 3 one might argue that only past output growth affects current default, while

current default influences future output, rendering the system recursive. In practice, it is

entirely possible for effects to run in both directions within a calendar year, however.
But the direction of any endogeneitybias should only reinforce conclusions drawn from

the ordinary least squares regressions in Table      3. Output   growth should have a negative

effect on default, while according to Table     3 default   had a positive impact' on growth.

If endogeneityis present, it is likely to bias the coefficient    on default toward zero,

rendering the estimates in the first three columnsof Table 3 lower bounds. The final

three columns therefore report two-stage least squares estimates, which utilize as

instuments for the percentage of debt in default the determinants of default identified in

Eichengreenand Portes (1986). These confirm that the coefficient on default tends to
increase in magnitude with this adjustment24l

    To test the rubber band effect" (that countries which suffered the largest declines in

output in the early stages of the Depression had the greatest scope for recovery

subsequently), we regressed the rate   of growth of production over the recovery period

(193 l36) on   our default variable, the percentage change in the terms of trade, and the

percentage change in production between 1929 and 1931. Table 4 confirms that the
effect is present but that its inclusion does not reverse the coefficient on default.

       The problem with such regressions is that they may fall to conirol adequately for
other respects in which the external environment and the stance of domestic economic

policy conditioned the pattern of growth.25/ On the side of pohcy, the decision whether
to continue external debt service was only one of a number of interrelated policy

responses to the macroeconomic shocks of the 'thirties. Lacking an articulated model of
fiscal policy, there was little conscious manipulation of budgetary instruments in the

1930s.2Q Monetary policy was more widely utilized, although monetary authorities were

constrained by inflationary fears, by the desire to defend the gold standard, and by

 doubts regarding the effectiveness   of monetary reflation. The most widely adopted

 measures were the complex of policies referred to under the rubric "import substitution."

 With the collapse of their export markets following   1929, governments   adopted policies

 designed, to varying degrees, to reduce their economies' dependence on exports and to
 shift resources to import-competing uses. Exchange rates were devalued, first in

Australasia and Latin America and subsequently in other parts of the world. Increasingly

comprehensivesystems of tariffs and quotas, often supplemented by exchange controls,
were used to limit imports.    In some counties credit was extended by the public sector
on favorable terms to import-competingindustries, and a variety of other measures were

adopted to promote theft growth. The use of such policies may well have been related
to the choice of debt management strategy. Countries like Argentina. for example, which

continued to service theft debts did so by retaining resources in the export sector and by

relying on imports for the provision of other goods. Other counties like Brazil, which
reduced or suspended debt-servicepayments, had neither as urgent a need to generate

foreign-exchangereceipts nor as favorable access to certain creditor-countrymarkets, and
had reason to shift resources into the import-competingsector.fl' The simple correlation

of -0.30 between the measure of default in Table 3 and the import share of GNP (pooled
time-series cross-section data, defined as the deviationof the import share from the

country avenge for the sample period) is consistent with this view.
         The consensus view of such policies as they operated in the last quarter century is

that they have proven inferior to the alternativeof export promotion.2I Experts indict

import substitution strategies for having insulated producers from the chill winds of

competition, for diverting resources into sectors far removed from comparative advantage,
for raising the cost of inputs into domestic production, and for discouraging industry

 from achieving minimum efficient scale. But it need not follow that import substitution

 was an inferior strategy in the l930s. Some country studies suggest that import

 substitution worked rather well in particular instances29/ It is conceivable, for example,

 that the effectiveness of import substitution relative to export promotion may depend on

 the   nte of expansion of international   trade. When trade is expanding rapidly, as in the

       In   an attempt   to capture the effects of this complex of policies, we added to the

Table 3 regressions the import share of GNP relative to the counny average for the

sample period. This measure captures not the different growth prospects of more- and

less-open economies but rather the implications of policies tending to increase or reduce
the rate   of import growth. The coefficient enters with a positive sign and differs from
zero at standard confidence levels, suggesting that counthes which raised their capacity

to import most rapidiy in the 1930s recovered most quickly from the Great Depression.

More significantly for our purposes. the coefficient on percentage of debt in default is

robust to the inclusion of this additional measure of economic policy       stance.

     if the data for the l930s suggest a positis e relationship between    default and

subsequent economic performance,the evidence for the 1980s is much more ambiguous.
Part of the problem is the difficulty of distinguishing different debt-management

sategies. Most authors' measure of interruptions to debt service, namely prevalenceof
rescheduling, is   an imperfect proxy. Figure 4 and Table 5, which compare growth rates
of GDP for defaulting and nondefaulting counthes, confirm that the growth of
reschedulers accelerated in 1984-85 relative to 1982-83, but shows that their performance

was still substantially worse than that of the non-reschedulers. Whereas only one of the

non-rescheduiers shows a deterioration in its fiscal position. six of the reschedulersdo

rescheduling promoted growth. Analyzing macroeconomic performance
                                                                         well (as
developing countries, Linden 0988) finds that reschedulersperformed less
measured by the rate of growth of GDP) than did other countries, This result comes
                                                                 to eliminate
through even when instrumental variables are used in the attempt

simultaneity bias.

    Two explanations for this difference between the 1930s and the 1980s suggest

themselves. First, compared to rescheduling in the 'eighties, default in the 'thirties

offered more scope for redirectingdomestic resources toward investment and other

domestic uses, Interruptions to debt service in the 1980s have been partial and
                                                                                    the
intermittent, and the net resource transfer to the creditors remains large. Second,

 macroeconomic repercussinnsof default may have been different when interruptions to

 debt service were widespread, as in the 1930s, rather than relatively isolated, as in the

 1980s, It may have been harder for creditors to impose sanctions against defaulting

 debtors precisely because default was so widespread.fl/ This brings us to the question

 of how foreign investors and their governments responded to the crisis.


 4. Default   and Capital Market Access
     The immediate way for creditors to retaliate against default was to exclude the

 debtor from the capital market. Starting in 1825, the London Stock Exchange refused

 quotation to new loans of governments in default on outstanding obligations and in
 extreme instances refused to quote all loans of the offending government. There existed

 no comparable arrangement in New York, althoughit was still possible for individual

 creditors to refuse accommodation to defaulting borrowers.

     But there is scant evidence that defaulting debtors were differentially affected. On

the basis of their study of six large Latin American debtors, Jorgensen and Sachs (1988)

 find no observable capital market penalty for 1930s default in the period 1950-64.

 Lindert and Morton (1987) conclude from their study of more than a century of inter-

 national lending experience that "defaulting governments have seldom been punished,

 either with direct sanctions or with discriminatory denial of later credit." Eichengreen

       This is not to deny that lenders were cognizant of default, But the reaction against

portfolio investment abroad was general rather than selective.      A general sigh of resolve
was to be heard over the United States, Herbert Feis wrote.        Never again should we
lend   or invest our money in foreign lands.'32J American investors, having been rudely
reminded of the special risks of foreign loans, revised their assessment of the desirability

of lending abroad, The British and others reacted similarly, and they were significantly
constrained by controls on capital movements until the end of the 1950s. Hence the

market for portfolio investmentsremained becalmed for more than a third of a century.

Sovereign default may have had costs in terms of disruptions to capital market access.

But many of these costs were external to the defaulting countries and affected the market

access   of defaulters and nondefaulters alike.
       Two caveats to this conclusion are in order. First, the generality of the capital

market's reaction may have been a function of the generalityof default. Default having

been so widespread, it led to a comprehensive reassessmentof the risks of international

lending which redounded unfavorably even on countries which had kept their debt

service up to date, In contrast, in periods like the 1920s, when the only countries in

serious default were Mexico and the Soviet Union, and the 1970s, when debt problems

were much more isolated than they became subsequently, the market may have been

more inclined to focus on the creditworthiness of particular countries and less inclined to

reassess the entire enterprise. Second, the market's tendency to discriminate among

countries according to their past debt-service records may differ during periods of

stagnation and buoyancy. Ozler (l988b) suggests that during the boom in bank finance

in the 1970s, larger spreads over the risk-free rate were demanded of countries with

records of having defaulted on loans in the past/ Still, there is little evidence that

defaulters were rationed out   of the market or that faithful rervcers were rationed

destabilizing shocks. Often a contrast is drawn with the era of bond finance,

debtors were able to make a clean break with past problems and divert scarce resources

to productive domestic uses and creditors were able to get on with their business.

     In fact, even in the era of bond finance the readjustment of defaulted debts often

entailed a protracted process of sporadic suspension and renegotiation. Service might be
                                                                               forth.
suspended in part or in full, restarted for some years, suspended again and so

Negotiations with the creditors often proceeded on a on-again, off-again basis, and
                                                                     first country to
required as much as a quarter of a century to complete. Bolivia, the
default in 1931, was also the last major debtor to settle in 1955.

     Brazil's experience is illustrative34i By 1931 the Depression had caused a
                                                                             to
precipitous fall in Brazilian exports, leading the governmentin October 1931 suspend
interest payments unilaterally on most of the nation's external debts. In March 1932 a

plan was announced to issue 20 and 40 year funding bonds to capitalize interest arrears,
and to resume normal interest payments no later than 1934. But in 1934, with the

advice of British financial experts, Brazil announceda plan to readjust the debt. The

 Aranha Plan, designed to run through 1937, limited debt service to roughly half of

 Brazil's net export receipts. Bonds were divided into seven grades. tth funding loans

 and other select obligations to receive full interest, other Federal, state and local loans
                                                                                      and
 partial interest (from 17.5 to 50 per cent of contractual levels), and certain state

 municipal loans no interest. At the end of 1937, with the external situation little


                                               22
improved, debt-servicepayments were suspended again. Following sporadic negotlations

with the creditors, in 1940 Brazil announced another temporary, four year settlement,

under which the seven categories     of bonds distinguished in 1934 were to receive interest
at somewhat modifiedrates. Finally, in 1943 Brazil and her creditors negotiated a

permanent readjusment, in which bondholders had the option of choosing between two

plans, one which reduced interest rates from 30 to 70 per cent of contractual levels, and
a second under which they would surrender 20 to 50 per cent of capital in exchange for
a cash payment of 6 to 60 per cent of par value and somewhat higher interest rates on
the remainder,

     Thus, while there may    be some truth to the notion that in the era of bond finance
debtors were better able to jettison their debt overhangs and redirect resources toward
domestic uses, the extent of the difference should not be exaggerated. Even when

payments were in suspension, there was often      a real possibility that they would be
restarted. In the 1930s as in the 1980s, investorshad reason to be wary about committinc

funds to domestic investment on the grounds that the authorities still might tax the

returns and devote them to debt service. The difference between periods lies not in the

uncertainty or in any difference in investment-debtservice links, but in the willingness

and ability of governments to reduce payments by a substantial fraction of contractual

rates,

     The central difficulty that negotiators had to surmount was the large-numbers

problem created by the existence of a multitude    of bondholders, it was even harder than
in the era   of syndicated bank lending to solicit the opinions of the creditors on a
settlement proposal. Yet the British and, after 1933, the Americans came up with a

remarkably efficient solution to the representation problem. Cornmitees were appointed

Readjustmentplans were signalled by the publicationof an offer or simply by an
announcementthat bond covenants were henceforth modified, If the plan was judged to

be fair or at least to be the best that could be expected, the committee would recommemi

its acceptance by the bondholders. The latter signified their approval by cashing a

coupon or, when requested, by exchanging the old certificate for a new one. The only

option available to dissident bondholders was to hold out for better terms.
     The recommendation of a reputable bondholders committee was the seal of approval

on an offer. In Britain, where the Corporationof Foreign Bondholders (CFBH) had been

in existence since 1868 and was universally acknowledged to represent the creditors, that

recommendationcarried considerable weight. When the CFBH recommended an offer,

any Stock Exchange sanctionscould be expected to be withdrawn, and thssiden

bondholders had little hope of obtaining better terms.       In the United     States, a comparable

organizationwas created only in 1934 when, with State Department prompting, the

Foreign Bondholders Protective Committee came into operation. Prior to that time,
bondholders relied on ad hoc committees created to deal with individual defaults. The

ad hoc nature of such committees tended to inflate administrative expenses, while the

existence of rival committees, as well as committees of dubious reputation, made it

difficult for both debtors and creditors to determine who best represented the interests of

the bondholders.


6.   Terms of Settlement
     In contrast to the experience of highly indebted countries in the 1980s, interwar

default led in some cases to a substantial reduction in net resource transfers from debtors

                                             24
to creditors. The estimates of Linden and Morton (1987). Jorgensen and Sachs (1988)

and   Eicheneen and Portes (1986,        1988b)   aee on this point.   Our own calculations,
based on two large samples      of foreign bonds issued in the 1920s, reveal in addition
considerable variation in debtor and creditor experience34l

      To summarize the performance of foreign loans issued between 1920 and 1929, we

calculated the nominal own-currency internal rate o. return on more than 300 issues.

These are summarizedin Table 8. For dollar bonds, at one extreme the realized return

marginally exceeded the contractual rate, as in the cases of Norway and Canada, due to

early debt retirement. At the other extreme, the realized internal rate of return might
reach substantial negative levels, such as -7.4 per cent for Brazil, -9,8 per cent for

Bolivia and -14.76 per cent for Hungary, indicating that not just interest but a substantial
fraction   of principal was written off by the creditors.
      On average, however, both British and American creditors recovered their nncipal.

Our calculationssuggest that, for creditors with diversified foreign bond portfolios who

were willing to hold out for final settlement, the defaults of the 1930s were not as

disastrous as typically portrayed. The average nominal internal rate of return (weighted

by issue value) was roughly 4     per   cent on dollar bonds and in the range of 5 per cent

for sterling issues. While dollar bondholders settled for approximately half of contractual

interest and sterling bondholderssettled for only slightly more, on balance the former did

only slightly worse than if they had held domestic Treasury bonds, and the latter did

slightly better. Ex ante risk premia were nearly sufficient to compensate American

bondholders for the risks of foreign lending, while for British bondholders they more

than sufficed. Although some debtor countries received what can         be interpreted as
substantial relief, overall the defaults   of the 1930s did not inflict unsupportable losses on
the creditors.

    Three factors contributed to the rather different experiences of investors in dollar and

sterling bonds. First, loans to different categories   of creditors fared very differently in
the 1930s and 1940s. For both sterling and dollar issues, loans to national governments

yielded higher realized returns than loans to states and municipalities; loans to states and

municipalities in turn yielded higher realized returns than loans to foreign corporations.

And American investors purchased a disproportionate share of the speculative bonds

issued on behalf of foreign municipalities and corporations. Second, London and New

York channelled funds in different geographical directions. London specialized in new

overseas issues on behalf of the Commonwealth and colonies, and devoted a smaller

share of capital than New York to riskier loans to Latin America and Central Europe. It

is difficult to assess the extent to which London's behavior is attributable to the

sophistication   of a more experiencedmarket, to long-standingpolitical and financial ties
with the Commonwealth, to preferentialBritish tax treatment on colonial issues, or to the
Bank of England's intermittent embargoes on foreign issues.3! But the combined result

of these factors was a significantly lower incidence of default on sterling than on dollar

issues.

    The differing prevalence of default does not by itself account, however, for

international differences in realized rates   of return. British creditors also recovered more

successfullyin the event of default. For the bonds in our sample, the average default on
a dollar issue cost the creditors more than four percentage points on realized rate of
return, while the average default on sterling issues cost them only about two percentage

points. Part     of the difference may be attributable to the greater effectiveness of the
British Corporation     of Foreign Bondholders than of its American counterpans.d/ Part

may also be attributable to the different stances    of the British and American

governments,to which we now turn.
7. Government Intervention

     A   recurrent theme in much of the recent literature on the debt crisis (viz. Sachs

1986)    is that creditor-country governments have continually pressured the debtors to
maintain service on their obligations. One might think that in the 1930s and 1940s,

when creditor-countrybanking systems held only a small share of their portfolios in

foreign bonds and hence were not at risk in the event of foreign default, creditor-country

governments might have     felt less compulsion to intervene.31/ This view is supported by
the tendency of British officials between the wars to cite the remarks of their well-known

19th-century predecessors to the effect that the British governmentwas not a debt

collector. American officials argued likewise that the higher returns on foreign loans

than on contemporaneous domestic investments represented implicit acknowledgement of,

and compensation for, the special risks of lending abroad, and that investors had no

justification for seeking assistance.
    In fact, governments were intimately involved in interwar debt readjusiments. There

is nothing unprecedentedabout the extent of government intervention in the 1980s, The

extent and nature of this involvement varied over time and across creditor countries.

Thus, British governments in the 1930s were more willing to intervene than the Roosevelt
Administration. The British used the Ottawa Agreements      of 1932, which provided

preferential British market access to the Commonwealth and Empire at the expense of

foreign exporters, to secure favorable treatment of sterling debts by Argentina, in return

for tariff preferences under the provisions of the 1933 Roca-Runcirnan    TreatyJ/     The

Americans were more hesitant to link trade and debt, especially once Roosevelt was

converted to the arguments of Cordell Hull and the U.S. began to move back toward

freer trade with the adoption of the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act in 1934. The



                                              27
links between U.S. Export-Import Bank loans and commercial debts varied over time,

On some occasions the U.S. extended Eximbank loans despite the existence of unsettled

defaults; on others officials made clear that Eximbank decisions had a political dimension

and might be torpedoed by Congress without progress on the debt front. Along with

several European governments,Britain threatened to impose clearing arrangements upon

Germany following her default in 1933, leading to the partial or full resumptionof
service on Germany's European bonds. No clearing was threatened by the United States,

and no significant interest payments were made to Germany's American creditors over

the remainder of the decade. But until the outbreak of World War II involved

governments directly in nearly every aspect of international trade and finance, their

interventionwas limited largely to instances where public officials had actively promoted

the original issues (as in the case of Germany's Dawes and Young Plan loans) or when
the debtor discriminated against one class of national creditors in favor of others.

    With the approach of the war, creditor-country pressure for settlement intensified.
But in contrast to the 1980s, on more than one occasion considerable pressure was

applied to the creditors as well as the debtors. In addition to providinginformation and
advice to the bondholders' representativecommittee and objecting to discriminatory

provisions included in settlement offers, governments sometimes intervened directly in

negotiationsif they felt that progress was inadequate. A favorable settlement for the
creditors was not often viewed     as a   high priority relative to international trade
concessions and international security agreements. Creditors were urged to settle, in no

uncertain terms,   if their obstinacy   stood in the way of these other goals.

     Essentially, the difference in government intervention in the l930s and 1980s lies

not in its extent but   its direction, Where U.S.    officials in the 'eighties have made clear
the priority they attach to maintaining debt service, in the 'thirties and 'forties, when

governments intervened, they might pressure both debtors and creditors to reach an early

agreement.


8. Global    Plans
       The debt difficulties that arose at the beginning of the 1980s for Poland, Turkey

and others were regarded as country-specific problems. This perception was transformed

by the Mexican and Brazilian crises in August-September       1982.   These countries not only

required emergency rescue packages, but their problems brought the international
fmancial community to recognize that it faced a generalizeddebt crisis.

       The policy reaction was guided partly by the objective of avoiding contagion

effects that might lead to a general financial crisis like that of the early 1930s (see

Eichengreenand Portes, 1987, for a comparison). The perception that serious debt-
servicing problems were already widespread prompted the elaboration        of several

proposals for global solutions. These plans have been surveyed and analyzed by Cline

(1987) and Fischer (1987), Most involved taking the debt off the books      of the
commercial banks at a discount and reducing the debtors' repayment obligations

correspondingly.     Typically, they required a new or existing international financial
institution to implement the scheme.

       Objections to these plans center on three points: the need for a grand political

agreement to authorize and initiate the scheme, for uniformity of procedure for all

debtors or at least for agreed criteria for discriminating among them, and for taxpayers in

creditor countries to defray the cost of debt relief. For all three reasons such ge-ieral

schemes seem unlikely to be adopted.



                                               29
         Most authors of global solutions to the debt crisis of the 1980s are unaware that

similar plans were widely discussed half a century earlier, Some, like current proposals

under which the World Bank or International Monetary Fund would play a central role,

suggested that the newly-established Bank for International Settlements be endowed with

the funds and authority needed to readjust defaulted debts on a global basis. Others

advocated instead an independentfacility under the control of private creditors, Some

advocated converting existing debts into new obligations, not unlike the debt-equity

swaps and seniority provisions so fashionable teday, while others emphasized the need to
index payments to export revenues (compare Fern under Oarcia) or to service the debt in

local currency (see Dornbusch, 1988).

       Four sets of global schemes can be distinguished39/ The first proposed to endow

the Bank for International Settlements with the resources needed to resolve the crisis.
The B.I.S, had been establishedin 1930 as part of the Young Plan rescheduling of

German reparations;    it was logical to propose that it might also take charge of other debt

problems. Hubert Henderson,      a highly-placed British governmenteconomic advisor,

suggested that the B.I.S, issue unbacked 'InternationalCertificates" to exporting countries

to finance debt service payments and other economic needs.

       The 1931 Kindersley-Norman Plan, named after Montagu Norman, Governor of the

Bank of England, and Robert Kindersley, one of its directors, proposed the establishment

of a new international facility to make loans to countries and corporationsunable to
obtain them through normal channels.      This new international entity was to be

capitalized by the leading creditor-country governments and further financed through the
sale   of bonds to private investors, The agency would extend new loans to indebted
countries unable to obtain them through the market, "reestablishing the credit of the

foreign Governments,corporations, etc., to whom the money is lent ... improving the
price of their securities ...   and the purchasing   power of their nationals.4Q/ Like a

mutual fund, .t would in effect resell packages       of these claims to private investors in the

creditor countries.

     The Beyen and Crena de Jongh Plans, offered by a pair of Dutch bankers to the

Standstill Conferencein the winter      of 193 1-32, addressed the problem of short-term
                                                                               into
debts. Beyen proposed to convert short-term debts frozen by debtor governments
                                                            as 20 years. Debtors that
long-term obligations repayablein installments over as long

did not possess enough foreign exchange to meet their current obligations might be
                                                                       treatment to
permitted to make payment in local currency and to extend preferential
creditor countries who were their best export customers. Crena de Jongh took the idea

of payments in domestic currency a step further. He proposed a central administrator to
issue                             bonds; the administratorwould accept repayment of
       foreign-currency-denominated
                                                                           and pay the
 short-term obligations in domestic currency, invest the currency at home,

 creditors out of the proceeds.
                                                                                  that
      Finally, a variety of proposals were mooted during the preparatory meetings
                                                                  of         with U.S.
 preceded the World Economic Conference of 1933. In a series meetings
                                                                  fund to channel capital
 officials, Britain proposed the establishment of a normalization

 toward countries requiring foreign funds for purposes including the resumption of debt

 service. British officials suggested up to $2 billion of capitalizationfor the fund, to be

 subscribed by creditor-country governments. Representatives          of the debtor countries

 endorsed variants of the plan.

      It is a pessimistic commentaryon the global plans currently under considerationthat
 none of their interwar predecessors bore fruit. Implementingthose schemes would have

 required a serious commitment on the part of the leading creditor-country governments.


                                                     31
But at each juncture, domestic problems divertedtheir attention from the international

debt crisis, In 1931 Britain was battling increasingly intense balance-of-payments

difficulties, which ultimately drove her from the gold standard in September of that year.

In 1933, the Roosevelt Administrationturned toward devaluation and away from

international policy coordinatioo precisely when the World Economic Conference was

poised to take up the debt problem. As a result that conference limited its efforts to the

increasingly turbulent exchange-ratesituation.

     Even when governments and banks were willing to entertain the possibility of an

international debt facility, there remained insoluble problems of finance and control.
Under the provisions of the Kindersiey-Nomian Plan, for example, the bulk of new

finance was supposed to come from private investors, But the large investors, such as

J.P. Morgan, expressed their unwillingness to contribute unless control over any new

organizationalso rested in private hands. For their part, governments insisted that
control be allocated according to the nationality of the finance. In 1931, for example,
the Bank of France insisted that control rest with it on the grounds that the largest single

share of the funds would be donated by Paris.

     Finally, there were debilitating disputes over what countries and what obligations to
include. At the 1933 World Economic Conference the United States declared all

discussion of war debts off limits, The realization that debt relief on inter-allied

obligations was unlikely to be forthcoming weakened the resolve of European countries
who would have preferred to take up the whole interlocking set     of debts.

9   Market Solutions

    In contrast to global plans, market-based debt reduction made a useful contribution
to the resolution   of the interwar debt crisis, We refer to repurchascs of bonds un the

                                              32
market, often at prices substantially below par. Similar practices have been discussed

recently by Portes (1987), USUNA (1988), and Williamson (1988), and been utilized

extensively by Mexico (for private sector debt) and by Bolivia. Their efficacy      has been
a subject   of controversy.4jJ The argument that buybacks out of reserves leave the debtor
worse off (since reserves are sacrificed without any reduction in the debt, the market

price of remaining obligations simply rising to reflect the country's unchanged

debt-servicingcapacity) is difficult to reconcile with the revealed preference of interwar

governments, many of which utilized the option extensively, as well     as   with the market

prices of the bonds repurchased at the time. In 1939 the Foreign Bondholders Protective
Committee estimated that    a dozen countries in default had repatriated between 15 and 50

per cent of their bonds since the beginning of the decade. Jorgensen and Sachs estimate
that Bolivia repurchased five per cent of its defaulted debt at an average price of 16, that

Chile retired 18 per cent at 59, Colombia 22 per cent at 22, and Peru 31 per cent at 21.

    Buybacks were controversial. Dorribusch (1988) points to opposition by some
creditors, while Skiles (1988) notes that because creditorsobjected so strenuously to the

practice, most of these bond repurchases were carried out through intermediaries."

Another interpretationof the use of intermediaries was that debtors wished to avoid

driving up bond prices by signaling their policy through first-person appearance in the

market. In fact, the time-series behavior   of bond prices suggests little systematic
reaction to repurchases of securities in default, There is little evidence that debtors

sought to depress prices immediately prior to repurchases, or that buybacks had a major

impact on price trends. Figure 5, for example, displays high and low market prices for a

sterling loan to the Chilean Governmentissued in the 1920s, along with estimates of the

volume of repurchases of bonds (valued at par).421 The data for a variety of other bonds


                                              33
tell a similar story. The Chilean case is particularly interesting since the country was

one of the first to engage in extensive buybacks and was the target of criticism by

creditors. Figure 5 shows that the buyhacks    of the second half of the i930s, second half
of the i940s and first half of the 1950s were not preceded by unusual declines in bond

prices, nor did they result in major price increases, although in the 'thirties and 'forties
some upward movement in prices is observed,

         The private attitude of the bondholders committees toward repurchases differed

significantly from theft public position on the question.43] 10 public the bondholders'

committeescomplalned that any available foreign exchangeshould be allocated to thc

resumptionof debt service and contractual amortization rather than to repurchases of
defaulted bonds at a discount. They objectedto the potential for debtors to manipulate

bond prices by declaring their inability to service their debts, and then to turn around and
retire the debt as soon as the prices fell. In private, the committees were much more

receptive to the practice, especially if it was accompanied by the resumption of at least

partial debt service payments, and when the creditors were unlikely to receive a better
offer.

     Numerous examplescould be cited. For example, in December 1936, following the

unilateralimposition of restrictedrepayments and interest by Chile, representativesof the

U.S. bondholders refused to accept the reduced interest payments that had been deposited

in New York. Chile then borrowed from Schroeders in London on this security in order

to purchase bonds in the market. The Council of Foreign Bondholders did not object; it

noted with satisfaction that "the Finance Minister so far has obtained and used $4 million

for purchases."J As part of the 1940 temporary settlement recommended by the

Council, the Brazilian authorities devoted 'at least $400,000 in each   of four years"   to

purchases in the English market.45J   In the 1941 Colombian negotiations, the Council of
Foreign Bondholders was asked to agree that all the sterling debt be repurchased in the
market. While it objected to the "disastrous precedent" that might be set, its members

admitted that "we have long become acclimatized to the idea of a debtor being allowed

to devote some sums to amortization,provided that he is paying                               on
the principal of his debt."45/ Typically, the bondholders argued that purchases below par

should take place only if at least partial service was being paid. Thus, in 1944 the

Council of Foreign Bondholders decided "to refuse to consider a settlement of the

Ecuadoreandebt by means of a purchase offer at below par" unless at the same time the

bondholders were offered an option of partial service on the debt.47/

    Perhaps the most revealing exchange surrounded the hearings of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission investigation into defaulted for bonds in 1937.4W The SEC
had recomnended that in order to curb the repatriation of bonds by defaulters measures

be introduced to restrain bankers and brokers from dealing on behalf of governments in

default, The Council of Foreign Bondholders noted that such restraints on repurchases

would be met with "strong and    ... effective criticism   on the ground that, by limiting thc

market in such bonds, it would act detrimentally to the bondholders, "49/

    Clearly, debt buybacks were controversial. But many British and American experts

regarded them favorably, especially when they were accompanied by other measures

designed to readjust the debt.
CONCLu,It,r'

    The inte:nion i debt crises    of the 1930s     and   ud i96usaiftr in undamenia

In the   1920s iendi. g   was mediatedby   the bond   tric     n   th'   .97Os by the COWIPC

banks. Since the tending mechanism differed, so thu me         met       sm   f   aegotian

readjustments of defaulted debts. In the 1930s      otit't dccault was common, aibeit
sporadic.   In the 1980s, in contrast, serial reschedulirigs and other expedients so far hivr

prevented a significant spread of formal default.

    Despite these differences, this earlier debt crisis sheds light on a number of aspects
of the current sirjation. It highlights the advantages, from the viewpoint of financial

stabthy, of dispersing foreign obligations across large iumbers of private investors rather
than concentrating them in the hands of financially vulnerable commercial banks. While

remmaing us of th ophistication of the bond market,          it shows that bondholders
hisor.sally have been no more adept than the banks it, avoiding loans to countries ith

regsahd tendency to default. It alerts us to the central role creditor-country governments
can piay in promoting or impeding a negotiated resolution of the crisis. Finally, it

reminds us of the serious obstacles to the implementation of any global plan for

resji    .g the debt crisis and underscores the useful contributionto resolution offered by

market-baseddebt-reductionschemes.

more agnostic than the second, see Skiles (1988) and Darity and Horn (1988).

6. The two samples of foreign bonds are described in Eichengreen and Portes (i988h.
For Britain we constructed estimates for all 125 overseas bonds offered for subscription
and listed by the                               while for the U.S. we drew a stratified
sample  of 250   foreign bonds from the list of more than 1400 such bonds published in
Young (1931). After adjusting for the actual price paid by the purchaser, we then tracked
interest and amortization payments until the bond issue was extinguished and calculated
the nominal own-currency internal rate of return. The number of bonds included in the
regression analysis was limited by the availability of explanatory variables. For a similar
analysis utilizing grouped data which yields results generally consistent with those
reported below, see Eiehengreen(1988).
7. Edwards's results for bank loans are basically consistent. In addition, see Ozier
(1988a), who suggests that spreads decline with the amount of time the borrower has
been in the market.

8. See for example Maddenand Nadler (1929). Other variables to which investment
advisors referred included the natural resource endowmentof the country and the position
of the central bank.
 9. For both sterling and dollar bonds, the coefficients have signs consistent with this
 hypothesis, but it is impossible to reject the hypothesis that each individual year effect is
 zero,, This contrasts with the analysis of grouped data for the U.S. in Eichengreen
 (1988), where there was some apparent tendency of the spread to rise over the course of
 the 1920s, suggesting that investors recognized the increasinglyrisky nature of foreign
 loans.

 10. We discuss this evidence on cx post returns in Section VI below.

 11.  Under the provisions of the Hay-Bunau Vaiilla Treaty of 1904, the U.S. was
 permitted to intervene in Panama to preserve order and to supervise the expenditure of
 governmentloars placed in the U.S. Under the Platt Amendment,the US. was entitled
 to object to improvidentor otherwise objectionable fiscal policy in Cuba. The
 Dominican Republic was under US. military administration until 1924, and thereafter the
 US, retained the right to object to changes in Dominican tariffs and public debt. Haiti
 was ruder US, martial, law from. 1916 to 1931 See Angell (1933), pp. 827.
12. For examplesof State and Commerce Department warnings of the risks of German
loans, see Eichengreen(1988),

13. Obviously, the greater precision of the estimate of the coefficient on budget balance
in the equation for dollar bonds compared to its sterling counterpart may reflect the
larger sample size.
14. This chronology follows Eichengreenand Portes (1987).

15. Central governmentdebt to export ratios are not representativeof the level of total
debt. They are, however, the only debt indicators available for a wide range of
countries, which is why we present them in Table 2. 'Where state and local government
debts were substantial, the total governmentdebt to export ratio could be much higher.
Germany's for 1931 rises from 34 to 212 per cent, for example. Schulker (1988), p. 65.
16, Calculated from statistics in Harris (1935).

17. Lary (1943), p. 6 and Table ifi after p. 216, estimates that debt service on dollar
loans amounted to $900 million in 1929. The stock of U.S. portfolio investmentsabroad
at the end of 1929 was on the order of $7.2 billion, Subtracting net short- and long-term
lending in 1928 and 1929, which totalled $576 million (Lewis, 1938, pp.628-629) and
multiplying the 1927/1929 ratio of debt stocks by $900 million yields $828 million.

20. Both figures are constructed from unweighted averages of country data. The heavy
defaulters are Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Germany, Greece,
Guatemala, Hungary, Poland and Yugoslavia. The light defaulters are Argentina,
Australia, Austria, Belgium. Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Japan,
New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway and Spain. Sources are described in the data appendix
to Eichengreenand Portes (1986).

21. It is tempting to ascribe the 1934 improvement in the commodity exporters' terms oT
trade to the 1933-34 devaluation of the dollar. Why the heavy defaulters should have
benefitted more is not clear, however.

22. We use industrial production indices rather thar GDP because their wider
availability permits the inclusion of more countries. (We also suspect that the indusu'ia
production indices are more reliable.) Table 4 below documents that the choice of
dependent variable is of little moment.
23. When the constant term is included, it differs from zero only because of rounding.
The first equation of Table 3 becomes:
               IP = -0.15 - 9.70 Terms of Trade 0.26 Default
                    (1.08) (6.47)                (0.04)
with standard errors in parentheses.

                                             38
24. Insmiments include the debt/income ratio, the 1928 export/GNP ratio, and dummy
variables for British Commonwealth and Latin American countries (which were shown to
be significant determinants of default in Eichengreen and Fortes, 1986).

25. Defining the dependentvariable for each country in Table 3 as the deviation from
that country's avenge gtwth rate during the sample period should, by picking up secular
differences in national growth rates, eliminate problems potentially caused by our
procedure of pooling together counthes at different stages of economic development.
26. There were, however, independentexpenditure progams which de facto had fiscal
effects, such as commodity price stabilization schemes and unemployment insurance
systems, although the magnitude of their effects is much debated.

27. Contrast Anglo-Argentinetrade relations as discussed in Section 7 and footnote 38
beiow.

28. To cite but one well-knownstatement of the view, see Kmeger (1978).

29. See for example Fishlow     (1972)   and a number of the studies contained in Thorp
(1984).

30. As will become clear momentarily, this is not a hypothesis toward which we are
inclined.
31. Cited in Eichengreen (1988).

32. Feis (1950), p. 1. Other obsewers were less pessimistic about the prospects for the
foreign bond market. As King (1950, p. ii) put it, "And so, economically speaking, i
would not call the prospects unfavorable, if you were to look for a foreign bond as a
safe investurentyou would have to use care and judgement, you would have to consider
the many different factors which I have mentioned or hinted at, the character of the
country and the people, their industriousness, their ingenuity, their good faith, and
policies of the governments,their reserves of strength, their vulnerability to economic
and technical changes and so forth, But I do not think you would be left high and dry
without a candidate for admission -- except for one thing, the political situation."

33. These results are consistent with those in Tabie 1, 'which suggest that in pricing
foreign bonds in the 1920s investors took the past debt-servicingrecords of counules into
account.

34. Three accounts of Brazilian experience are Abreu (1978), Cardoso and Dornbusch
(1988) and Eichengreenand Fortes (1988a).

35. In what follows 'we concentrate on the results reported in Eichengreen and Fortes
(1988b), utilizing samples of 207 dollar bonds and 125 sterling bonds issued between
 1920 and 1929. This analysis is an extension of the pilot study utilizing two
considerably smaller samples first reported in Eichengreen and Fortes (1986).
