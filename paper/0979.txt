             Are Unemployment and Out of the Labor Force
              Behaviorally Distinct Labor Force States?



                             ABSTRACT




      This paper formulates and tests the hypothesis that the categories
unemployed and out of the labor force are behaviorally distinct labor force
states. Our empirical results indicate that they are. In the empirically

relevant range the exit rate from unemployment to employment exceeds the

exit rate from out of the labor force to employment. This evidence is shown

to be consistent with a simple job search model of productive unemployment

with log concave wage offer distributions. We prove that if unemployed workers

receive job offers more frequently than workers out of the labor force, and

if wage offer distributions are log concave, the exit rate from unemployment

to employment exceeds the exit rate from out of the labor force to employment.

                            1. Introduction

       There is considerable controversy over the issue of whether or not the

categories unemployed and out of the labor force are behaviorally distinct labor

force states. This issue is particularly relevant in the study of the labor

market dynamics of youth.

       Given the range of nonmarket options available to many youths, and

given practices of many state unemployment compensation programs which effectively

limit the eligibility for unemployment compensation of most youths,.it seems

especially likely that there is no distinction between unemployment and out

of the labor force status for young people. Clac and Summers (1982) and

Ellwood (1982) have recently made this claim. They argue that the empirical

distinction between reported "unemployment" and reported "out of the labor

force" is so arbitrary that it is of little or no analytical value.

       This point would seem to have some merit after examining the official

Current Population Survey definition of unemployment which defines those

individuals as unemployed "who had no employment during the survey week, were

available for work, and (1) had engaged in any specific job seeking activity

within the past four weeks, or (2) were waiting to be called back to a job

from which they had been laid off, or (3) were waiting to report to a new

wage or salary job scheduled to start within the following 30 days." Because

there is no stipulation as to the quality or quantity of searches made within

the month, the unemployment—out of the labor force distinction may be of little

value in predicting employment probabilities for the nonemployed.
                                       2



        On the other hand, theoretical models suggest that being unemployed

as opposed being to out of the labor force describes different behavior. For

example, in search theory (e.g., Burdett and Mortensen (1978)) a key difference

between unemployed individuals and those out of the labor force is that the

former are at an interior point with respect to the amount of time they devote

to search while the latter are at a corner and spend no time searching. In

these models, separate behavioral equations characterize the reemployment

probabilities from these two states.

        In this paper we test the hypothesis that the classifications unemployed

 (u) and out of the labor force (o) are behaviorally meaningless distinctions.

We reject this hypothesis. Distinct behavioral equations govern transitions

from out of the labor force to employment (e) and from unemployment to

employment.

       The idea underlying our test is as follows: controlling for both

observed and unobserved individual differences in explanatory variables, if

the escape rate from unemployment to employment   (hue) is the same as the

escape rate from out of the labor force to employment (h), the origin state

(u or o) is irrelevant in determining the rate at which individuals leave

nonemployment to enter employment. In a simple three state Markov model, this

test is equivalent to testing the proposition that the two nonemployment states

can be aggregated into a single state resulting in a two state Markov model

for employment and nonemployrnent.

       We find that in the empirically relevant range the exit rate from

the state of unemployment to the employed state exceeds the exit rate from

the tate of out of the labor force to the employed state. This finding is

consistent with versions of a traditional job search model in which the rate
                                     3




of arrival of wage offers for the unemployed exceeds the rate of arrival of

wage offers for those out of the labor force. It is also consistent with versions

of a job search model with a positive interest rate in which the mean of the

wage offers for the unemployed exceeds the mean of the wage offers for those

out of the labor force. Thus the empirical evidence reported in this paper is

broadly consistent with versions of search theory in which unemployment is a

state that facilitates the job search process.

        The plan of the rest of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we

exposit our test in a simple setting. in section 3, we describe the more general

econometric specification used to perform our test. Section 4 presents empirical

results and our interpretation of them. Section 5 contains concluding rmarks.

In an Appendix, we present a new sufficient condition for the exit rate from

unemployment to be an increasing function of the rate of arrival of job offers.

       2. Testing the Behavioral Distinction Between Unemployment and Out
                              Of the Labor Force



       To motivate our test, we consider two cases)' In the first case, the

probability density function of employment spell durations in g(t) where

t    denotes the length of the employment spell. The probability that a person

terminating employment classifies himself as u or o is determined by

tossing a coin that comes up u fraction r of the time and comes up o

fraction 1—it of the time. Once acquired the person keeps these labels as

long as he is nonemployed so that there is no direct switching between u

and o states. The density function of duration times in nonemployment is

g(t). The exit rate, or hazard function, from nonemployment is defined

as


                             hn =            g(t)
                                        l—G(t)
                                           nn
where G(t) is the cumulative distribution function of nonemployment

durations. The joint probability of unemployment classification and

nonemployment duration t    is



                                 it   g(t)
with associated hazard function


    To simplify the exposition we assume that agents are homogeneous throughout
 this section. This assumption is not essential and is not used in performing
 the empirical work reported in Section 4.

   The hazard rate will be the same for the two nonemployment states o and u.

            In the second case considered here, individuals are allowed to switch

   their reported nonemployment status randomly. By this we mean that initial

   nonemployment classification is governed as before by a toss of a coin and

   that within a spell of nonetnployment individuals switch randomly between

  o and u. The continuous time analogue of discrete time independent Bernoulli

   trials is an exponential waiting time model (Cox (1962)). Write the hazard

  for durations from o to u as h            and the hazard from u to o as h
                                       ou                                       uo

                                                   6




while the density of time spent going from u to e (t )                          is
                                                                     tie




                       h
                        tie

Individuals may change between reported nonemployment states for any reason.

All   that   is required for the origin state (o or u) to be irrelevant for

characterizing transitions from nonemployment to employment is for hoe =                      h.
       Note that in both cases, conditioning on o or u eliminates the

classification probability parameter iT.               Thus the test advocated in this paper

is valid even if individuals systematically report themselves as o or u

and the reporting probabilities are functions of explanatory variables.

       The condition h          h         is also the requirement that must be satisfied
                      oe            ue
in a Markov model to aggregate o and u into a single state n, and for the

resulting two state model for e and n to be a properly defined Markov model.

To demonstrate this it is most convenient to work with the state probability

representation of the three state Markov model (see,                           Tuma et. al, (1978));

 Note that the rank of A is at most 2.

         In order to aggregate o and                u into a two state model defined in

where P(t) =       P(t)    + P(t). In matrix notation the two state model may be
written as P2(t) =          BP2(t).          The rank of B is 1. For this to be an
equivalent representation of the three
                                                     state model, a necessary condition is
that rank (A)          rank (B) = 1.
                                         A necessary and sufficient condition is that
hoe =   h
         ue   h    .
                       Sufficiency     may   be
              ne                                   checked by direct Substitution into A.
        This interpretation of our test is also informative in that it makes

precise the sense in which o and               u are irrelevant. Aggregating o and
u into a single state for the
                                       purpose of statistical analysis does not alter
the Markov property of the model.             The rate at which individuals leave non—

employment to enter employment does not depend on which nonemployment state
                                                         8



 individuals occupy.

        It is tempting to extend this type of reasoning to consider transitions

 from employment to the two           nonemployment states. Thus it might be argued that
 if u and o are irrelevant distinctions, the rate of transition from e
 to u (heu)     would be the same as the rate of transition from e to o

 eo This argument is correct only if the probability of exiting from

 employment to unemployment            (ri)
                                               equals the probability of exiting from employment
 to out of the labor force (1—ri)               so

But unless Ti = 1—ri =     1/2, h              h. We have no theory of      ri.   Even if

reporting oneself as unemployed is strictly a matter of tossing a coin,

nothing requires    ri =   1/2.       However, if information is available on the

fraction of employment spells that are immediately followed by unemployment,

it is possible to obtain a consistent estimate of                       and to test the

proportionality hypothesis that

  Assuming r is constant in the population. If      ri is a function of observed
and unobserved heterogeneity components, a more complicated but still straightforward
estimation scheme is required.

                   3. Econometric Implementation of the Test




        In order to test the hypothesis that unemployment and out of the labor

force are not behaviorally distinct labor market states we first specify a

parametric form for the hazard functions (h.k, j                    k; j,k =     e,o,u)   on which

the test is based. We have adopted a general functional form for the hazard

functions in order to minimize the possibility of spuriously rejecting the

two 3tat model because of model misspecification. For a detailed

consideration of the econometric issues which arise in the estimation of

duration data models, the reader is referred to Flinn and Hec1nan (1982a).

In this section we sketch the econometric specification employed in performing

our proposed test.

        Since a hazard function is a conditional probability density function,

a requirement of any econometric specification is that for all possible values

of the parameters and both observed and unobserved heterogeneity the hazard

be nonnegat±ve. The econometric specification adopted in this paper imposes

nonnegativity.
         A hazard function associated with a particular probability density'

is said to exhibit positive, no, or negative duration dependence according

to whether



                                       t<
                                     h(t) > 0


- A hazard function is uniquely determined by the probability density functiom
and vice versa.
                                      10




For example, if h(t)/it > 0     for t > 0, the instantaneous conditional

probability of exiting the state increases with the duration of the spell. Iii

a job search model in which the reservation wage declines with the length of an

unemployment spell, we expect to observe positive duration dependence in the

hazard associated with unemployment to employment transitions. On the other hand,

in a model that allows for specific human capital accumulation, we expect to

observe negative duration dependence in the hazard associated with employment

to unemployment transitions. The exponential distribution of duration times is

the only distribution consistent with a hazard function exhibiting no duration

dependence.

        It is possible to specify hazard functions that exhibit all three types

of duration dependence for different values of t. In labor economics it is

especially important to allow for nonmonoticity of the hazard since many

economic models have been developed that predict a nonmonotonic hazard

(see,         Jovanovic, 1979) Our econometric model allows for noninonotonicity
in the hazard in a simple and readily interpretable manner.

        In our previous work Flinn and Heckman (1982a) we have demonstrated

the importance of controlling for nonstationary in the environment. While most

theoretical models assume stationarity, our econometric specification does not

impose this frequently counterf actual assumption onto the data. We permit the

hazard function associated with any transition to depend on time varying

explanatory variables. Incorporating time—varying variables into our
                                                                 11




 econometric model is computationally burdensome but proves to be essential

 in obtaining consistent parameter estimates (see Flinn and Hec1ian (1982a),

Section IV).

         The specific functional form for the hazard function that we employ

in our empirical work is

parameter vector conformable with X, the linear and squared duration terms

( a scalar measure of) the effect of unobserved individual differences on the

the time index on X(T. + t. ) indicates that the instantaneous conditional

                 4. Empirical Results And Interpretation


        The sample used to perforni the empirical work reported here is selected

 from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men. We follow 122 young men

 for thirty consecutive months from the time they graduate from high school.

The small size of our sample is due to the stringent selection criteria imposed.

To be included in the sample an individual must (1) be white; (2). have

received a high school diploma in the spring or early suer of 1969; and

(3) not have returned to school in the period beginning in the fall of 1969

and ending in December of 1971.

       The sample was selected in this manner in an attempt to minimize the

initial conditions problem discussed in the literature on applied stochastic

processes (HecIian (1981), Flinn and Heckinan (1982a)).. By using individuals

who have recently completed schooling, we have selected individuals with

little or no previous labor market experience. The vast majority of individuals

in our sample have not worked in full time jobs during high school. Because

of this, we feel that the initial conditions problem can safely be ignored

in deriving the maximum   likelihood   estimates presented here.

       Unless duration times follow an exponential distribution, the

distribution of the first spell observed during a sampling period will not have

the same distribution as subsequent spells of the same type whose beginning

and ending dates are observed. By constructing our sample in the manner indicated

we claim that the first spell sampled follows the same distribution as

subsequent spells of the same type.

              Due to the small number of transitions between the nonemployrnent states

• (u +        o    and o —'-   u)    we were not able to obtain estimates of the hazard

functions associated with these transitions. In the three state model we

estimate the parameters of the four hazards associated with the e -- o, e -

u   -'-
          e, and o - e              transitions. In our test of the two versus three state

model, we estimate three hazard functions by constraining the u + e                   and

o -       e       hazards to be equal. Estimation is by maximum likelihood. The

reader is referred to Flinn and Heclanan (1982a) for details concerning the

specification of the likelihood function and estimation procedure.

              Table 1 presents estimates of the three state model estimated with

observed and unobserved heterogeneity in the transition rates. The observable

characteristics included are the duration of the spell, duration squared (to

allow for nonmonotonic duration dependence), and whether the individual is

married with spouse present (MSP) (1 if yes, 0 if no). The parameter                   c. is
the factor loading for the state i to state j transition. The unobserved

heterogeneity component                     is assumed to have a standard normal distribution.

              The signs of the parameters are generally consistent with prior

expectations. For example, currently married men have lower rates of transiting

from employment to unemployment than do nonmarried men. The fact that the

standard errors are so large relative to the magnitude of the parameters is to

be expected given that we are attempting to estimate twenty parameters with

so few degrees of freedom. Only the constant terms and the factor loading

associated with the employment to out of the labor force transition are greater

than twice their standard errors.

distributed x2(5). The critical value for a 5 percent significance level is

parameters governing the two nonemployment states. These empirical results

suggest that out of the labor force and unemployment are not artifical

distinctions for this sample of young men. Because the simpler hypothesis

(2.1) is rejected, it is unnecessary to test the more computationally demanding

proportionality hypothesis (2.2) in order to reject the hypothesis that

unemployment and out of the labor force are behaviorally distinct labor force

states.

       Within the framework of job search theory, the fact that over the

empirically relevant range the exit rate from unemployment to employment

exceeds the exit rate from out of the labor force to employment does not

necessarily imply that the rate of arrival of job offers is higher for the

unemployed. In the traditional infinite horizon stationary environment one

state search model, increases in the rate of arrival of job offers increase

the reservation wage and have an ambiguous effect on the exit rate from

unemployment (see equations (A.2)—(A.4) in the Appendix). However, we

demonstrate in the Appendix that if the wage offer distribution is log concave,

higher arrival rates of wage offers imply higher exit rates from unemployment.

The normal distribution is log concave. Other examples of log concave

distributions are given in the Appendix.

       Interpreting our findings within the framework of the traditional one

state search model, and assuming log concavity of the wage offer distribution,

our empirical evidence suggests that the rate of arrival of job offers is higher

in the unemployment state than in the out of labor force state. Thus our

evidence is consistent with the hypothesis of productive unemployment i.e. that

being unemployed raises the rate of arrival of job offers. However, the

fact that some individuals transit directly from out of the labor force to

employment without first becoming unemployed suggests that job search activity

occurs in both states, and that the difference between the two states is only

a matter of degree of search activity.

      An alternative interpretation of the evidence within the traditional

one state search model is that searchers face a positive discount rate and

that the unemployed face a wage offer distribution with a higher mean than do
                                      20




those individuals who are out of the labor force.-"'




   With a positive discount rate, unit translations of wage offer distribution
produce less than unit changes in the reservation wage. Ceteris paribus,
individuals searching from wage distributions with a higher mean will have
higher exit rates from unemployment than will individuals searching from wage
offer distributions with a lower mean.


   Note that this discussion is conducted within a traditional search model.
Within the context of a general three state model, such as the one developed
by Coleman and Hec1ian (1981), log concavity of the wage offer distribution is
not sufficient to ensure that a higher rate of arrivals of wage offers in
a state produces a higher exit rate from the state to employment. The conclusions
in the text hold in a two state model. See the Appendix.

                            5. ConclusiOn



         In this paper we have constructed a test of the proposition that the

nonemployment states "unemployment" and "out of the labor force" are

behaviorally indistinguishable. Our empirical results indicate that

unemployment and out of the labor force are behaviorally distinct, so that

in general it is not legitimate to aggregate the two states into a single

nonemploynent state when analyzing labor market dynamics. Our test is

conducted using a flexible econometric model. We are confident that rejection

of the two state (employment and nonemployment) model is not attributable to

arbitrary functional form assumptions..i'

         Rejecting the behavioral equivalence of unemployment and out of the

labor force suggests that the task of building economic models that predict

such a distinction is an empirically fruitful one. In. Plinn and Heclonan (l982b)

and Coleman and Heckman (1981) we present a three state model of search

unemployment that is consistent with the empirical evidence reported in this

paper.




-   Even after allowing for alternative distributions of the unobserved
heterogeneity component ô, we overwhelmingly reject the two state model.

        A SUFFICIENT CONDITION FOR THE EXIT PATE FROM UNMFLOYMENT TO

          BE AN INCREASING FUNCTION OF THE RATE OF ARRIVAL OF JOB OFFERS.



             Let wage offers arrive in accordance with a homogenous Poisson

process with parameter X. The discount rate is denoted by r, r         (0,1).

F(w) is the cdf of wage offers. The cost of search is c, c > 0.        Accepted

jobs last forever, the environment is stationary, and agents have infinite

lifetimes. It is well known that in this model, the optimal search strategy

has the reservation wage property if w has a finite absolute first moment

(see Flinn and Heclcnan, (1982a)). The reservation wage R is the solution

to the following equation



(A.1)                c + r =   X/r   I   (x—R)dF(x)   for R > 0.
                                     R

If the R that solves (A.1) is negative, the agent doesn't search.

         The exit rate from unemployment, h, is

                          h = X(1—F(R))


(see, e.g., Flinn and Hecknan, 1982a).

to produce an increase in the exit rate from unemployment is that the wage

offer distribution be log concave (i.e., that the hazard rate associated with

the wage offer distribution be increasing in wages).

Proof: Assume F(w) is absolutely continuous and nondefective                             F(w)    1).

The derivative of h with respect to A is


(A.2)                  = (1 — F(R)) — Xf(R)


Differentiating (A.l) with respect to A, assuming R >                   0,

                  --
                           hr IR      (l—F(x))dx
(A.3)                  =
                           i   + Air (1-F(r))

where we have used the well known fact (see, e.g., Ross, 1970) that



                 f     (x - R)dF(x)      =      I (1-F(x))dx
                 R                              R

            Using (A.3) in (A.2) and rearranging terms we reach



(A.4)                  =
                           i                        {i +     (l-F(R))   -
                                                                             lF(R)   1   (1-F(x))dx]}.

            A sufficient condition for (A.4) to be positive is that the term

in brackets inside the braces be non—negative.


                 [(1 -         F(R)) -
                                          f(R)       1(1 -   F(x))dx]        0
(A.5)


            It is convenient to characterize the wage offer distribution by

the hazard g(u) which exists by virtue of the absolute continuity of F.

We define


                 1 -       F(x)   =   exp(-fg(u)du)
(A.6)


            It is convenient to work with c(R) which is defined as
                                          A-3




                                                                                 x
                    (R)              (1   —   F(x))dx          =   1
                                f                                          exp(— f g(u)du)dx
                                R                                  R

Using this notation condition (A.5) may be rewritten as



(A.5)'                -   (R) + :: R)                      >


This condition is satisfied if in (R) is concave in R since concavity

requires




(A,7)                        "(R) (
                                    (R)
                                                      T()2
                                                      c(R))            —
                                                  \
and multiplication of (A. 7) by ((R))2/"(R) produces (A.5)' since '(R) < 0.

         By a theorem of Brascamp and Lieb (1976), as reported in Pratt (1981),

a sufficient condition for in (x) to be concave is that in "(x) be

concave, i.e., that



                           in       (x)       -
                                                  f   x
                                                          g(u)du

be concave in x. Assuming g(u) is differentiable, strict concavity

requires that g'(x) >     0, i.e., that the hazard is increasing. This
condition is satisfied if the iog of the density of w is concave (see Barlow

and Proschan, 1975). Examples of log concave densities include normal,

exponential, LaPlace, and for certain parameter values (see Barlow and Proschan,

1975, p.79) truncated normal, Weibull and Ganmia densities. A Cauchy distribution

is not log concave nor is a log normal distribution.

        Log concavity of the wage offer density is also a sufficient condition

for the exit rate from unemployment to be an increasing function of the rate

of arrival of job offers in a simple two state equilibrium model of labor

market dynamics. The setup is essentially the same as in the one spell search

model except that individuals are terminated from employment spells at an

exogenously determined rate a. This model is discussed at length and estimated

in Flinn and Hec1ian (1982b). The reservation wage R         in that model is given

by the implicit function



(A.8)                      R =   —c   + ra     (x—R)dF(x),


where R     r Vu and V      is the value of occupying the unemployment state.

We could repeat the proof given above for the one spell search model to verify

sufficiency of the log concavity condition for the two state model but the

similarity between A.l and A.8 is too obvious to warrant a detailed derivation.
