Current Account Balances, Financial Development and Institutions: Assaying the World
“Savings Glut”

                                            ABSTRACT

We investigate the medium-term determinants of the current account using a model that controls for
factors related to institutional development, with a goal of informing the recent debate over the
existence and relevance of the "savings glut." The economic environmental factors that we consider
are the degree of financial openness and the extent of legal development. We find that for industrial
countries, the government budget balance is an important determinant of the current account balance;
the budget balance coefficient is 0.21 in a specification controlling for institutional variables. More
interestingly, our empirical findings are not consistent with the argument that the more developed
financial markets are, the less saving a country undertakes. We find that this posited relationship is
applicable only for countries with highly developed legal systems and open financial markets. For
less developed countries and emerging market countries we usually find the reverse correlation;
greater financial development leads to higher savings. Furthermore, there is no evidence of "excess
domestic saving" in the Asian emerging market countries; rather they seem to have suffered from
depressed investment in the wake of the 1997 financial crises. We also find evidence that the more
developed equity markets are, the more likely countries are to run current account deficits.

1. Introduction
        The enormous and rapidly widening U.S. current account deficit has been the topic of
intense debate in academic and policy circles. As shown in Figure 1, the 2004 ratio of 5.7
percentage points of GDP is high by historical standards, and as documented by Edwards,
high in comparison to other developed economies. Mussa (2004) calculates that a sustained
current account deficit of 5% – about a percentage point less than the level projected for 2005
– will result in a net foreign liabilities position of 100% of GDP.
        A number of explanations have been forwarded for the recent widening of the U.S.
current account deficit. Roughly speaking, the arguments can be categorized as either
domestic or international in nature. Some argue that the main reason for the increase in U.S.
current account imbalances is the decline in U.S. savings, especially public sector savings,
since 2002. In this “twin deficit” argument, the current administration’s expansionary fiscal
policy bears the greatest blame. Greenspan (2005), Ferguson (2005) and others have, on the
other hand, argued that the impact of fiscal policy on the current account balance is small.
        The “global savings glut” explanation has been expounded by Bernanke (2005),
Clarida (2005a,b), and Hubbard (2005). This argument views excess saving from Asian
emerging market countries, driven by rising savings and collapsing investment in the
aftermath of the financial crisis (and to a lesser extent Europe), as the cause of the U.S.
current account deficit. From this perspective, the U.S. external imbalance is a problem made
overseas, and amenable to a solution only in the longer term, as better developed financial
systems mitigate this excess savings problem.
        Surprisingly, despite the popularity of the savings conjecture in (American) policy
circles, there has been surprisingly little empirical work that takes seriously the global savings
glut theses.1 In this paper, we remedy this deficiency by analyzing the determinants of current
account balances for industrial and developing countries, while empirically controlling for
differences in institutional environment across countries. The data set we employ covers a
large and heterogeneous group of countries (117 countries) over a relatively long time span

1
 One exception is Gruber and Kamin (2005). Roughly contemporaneously with us, they have written a paper
closely related to this one. They examine different aspects of the “savings glut” and “Bretton Woods II” (Dooley,
et al., 2005) hypotheses. General discussion of global savings and investment patterns is contained in IMF
(2005), CBO (2005), Higgins (2005) and the Economist (2005).

(1971-2003).
       Our empirical approach relies upon the approach of Chinn and Prasad (2003). Their
study provided a broad empirical characterization of the medium-term determinants of current
account balances for a sample of industrial and developing countries from the perspective of
longer-run saving-investment balances. This paper updates and extends their work by
incorporating a potentially important factor identified by Bernanke (2005), namely the effect
of legal and institutional development.2
       Whether one takes the twin deficits or global savings glut argument, the effect of legal
and institutional development cannot be dismissed a priori, although it clearly matters more in
the latter case In addition to macroeconomic attributes such as the stage of development,
demographic profile, and the government budget balance, the legal environment and the level
of institutional development should be important control variables. After all, the extent of
private saving and investment should depend upon how the returns from those activities are
protected by these factors.
       This paper also devotes special attention to the effect of financial development,
motivated by the argument that “financial deepening” is one of the important determinants of
saving (e.g., Edwards, 1996). While we implement our analysis using a model that controls
for financial deepening, part of the current account imbalances for the United States and other
countries including emerging market countries in East Asia cannot be explained. We will
investigate whether this discrepancy is explained by the development in equity markets. The
focus on equity market development is also motivated by the argument that “the U.S. current
account is …, in part, a reflection of a global excess of saving relative to profitable investment
opportunities in the post-bubble world.” (Clarida, 2005a).
       The main findings are as follows. The budget balance is an important determinant of
the current account balance for industrial countries; the coefficient for the budget balance
variable is 0.21 in a model controlling for institutional variables. We also find that
institutional development is an important determinant for the current account balance, but
mainly for higher income countries, although it is important for both saving and investment
determination. More importantly, our empirical findings are not consistent with the argument




                                                2
that the more developed financial markets are, the less saving a country undertakes. For most
of the less developed countries (LDCs) and emerging market group (EMG) countries, if there
is, the reverse is true; more financial development leads to higher savings. Furthermore, there
is no evidence of “excess domestic saving” in the Asian emerging market countries, though
they seem to have suffered from lower investment during the post-crisis period. For the
United States, our analysis suggests that it is a saving drought – not investment boom – that is
contributing to the enlargement of current account deficits. We also find that for industrialized
countries, the deterioration of the current account that is not predicted by our baseline model
is associated with the recent boom in equity markets.


2. Data and Estimation

2.1 Theoretical Issues and Variables of Interest
2.1.1 Macro Variables
           We base the choice of macroeconomic variables for this exercise on the discussion in
Chinn and Prasad (2003).


Net foreign assets to GDP ratio: From an intertemporal perspective, the stock of net foreign
assets (NFA) serves as an important initial condition, given that the current account is the sum
of the trade balance and the return on a country’s stock of NFA (or payment on its net foreign
liabilities position). Alternatively, from a buffer stock savings perspective, higher levels of
initial net foreign assets should be associated with subsequent lower current account balances.
Government budget surplus to GDP ratio: A variety of models predict a positive relationship
between government budget balances and current accounts over the medium term. In the
absence of a full Ricardian offset via private saving, an increase in the government budget
balance could lead to an increase in national saving. In developing economies, where a greater
proportion of agents may be liquidity constrained, this relationship might be expected to be
more pronounced.
Relative income: The “stages of development” hypothesis for the balance of payments


2
    See also Alfaro et al. (forthcoming) for an examination of capital flows and institutions.


                                                           3
suggests that countries, as they move from a low to an intermediate stage of development,
typically import capital and, therefore, run current account deficits. As they reach an
advanced stage of development, countries run current account surpluses in order to pay off
accumulated external liabilities and also to export capital to less advanced economies.
Demographics: The literature on the determinants of national saving has pointed to a number
of additional “structural” determinants such as demographics. Masson et al. (1998) show that
the dependency ratio is one of the key determinants of private saving.
Uncertainty: Terms of trade volatility is another potential determinant of medium-term
fluctuations in current accounts. Agents in economies that face more volatile terms of trade
might save more for precautionary reasons in order to smooth their consumption streams in
the face of volatile income flows.
Trade Openness: Country characteristics that reflect macroeconomic policies could also be
relevant for current account determination. The degree of openness to international trade
could reflect policy choices, including tariff regimes.
       These macro data are drawn primarily from the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators and supplemented by the IMF’s International Financial Statistics and the World
Economic Outlook database. Additional details are contained in the Data Appendix.


2.1.2 Institutional Factors
Financial Development/Deepening:
       Another determinant of saving [emphasized by Edwards (1995)] is “financial
deepening,” usually proxied by the ratio of a monetary aggregate such as M2 to GDP. The
traditional interpretation of this variable as a measure of the depth and sophistication of the
financial system suggests that financial deepening could induce more saving. However, there
is a contrasting view that more developed financial markets lessen the need for precautionary
saving, and thereby lower the savings rate. Bernanke (2005) argues that greater financial
development will remedy the global savings glut in the long run by inducing a decline in the
savings rate in the emerging Asia. Relatedly, Clarida (2005) argues that the sophisticated
equity markets in the U.S. absorb excess saving from all over the world, leading to higher
current account deficits. Given these arguments, we believe that financial market development


                                                4
must be taken seriously in any empirical examination.
         To measure financial development, we use private credit to GDP (PCGDP) – in
contrast to Chinn and Prasad’s (2003) use of M2 to GDP – primarily for data availability
reasons.3 The PCGDP data are drawn from Beck, Demirgüc-Kunt, and Levine (2001).


Financial Openness:
         How open a country is for cross-border financial transactions should also affect capital
flows across countries, and thereby the current account. One critique of the global saving glut
view focuses on the question of timing – why do excess saving is flow into U.S. financial
markets now, and not earlier? A frequent refrain is that, especially for the East Asian
economies, comprehensive financial liberalization policies have been implemented, and
thereby allowing excess savings to flow into the U.S, and other countries with developed
financial markets. Thus, the openness of financial markets should influence countries’ current
account balances via the impact on saving and investment decisions.
         Our metric of financial openness is the Chinn-Ito (2005) index. This index is the first
principle component of the binary variables pertaining to cross-border financial transactions
based upon the IMF’s categorical enumeration reported in Annual Report on Exchange
Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER). Higher values of this index indicate
greater financial openness. Greater detail about the construction of this index can be found in
Chinn and Ito (2005).4


Legal variables:
         A society’s legal foundations and institutions define the context wherein financial
transactions and economic decisions are made. This proposition can have implications along

3
  One may think of equity market development and its measures. In fact, the dataset of Beck, et al. also contains
data to measure the development in equity markets. They are, namely, stock market capitalization (SMKC), total
value of stocks traded (SMTV), and stock market turn over ratio (SMTO). However, it is extremely difficult to
rely upon these measures as measures of equity market development, because with these measures, one cannot
distinguish between market bubble behavior and real market development. Therefore, we do not include equity
market development measures in our estimation. However, we will still examine the effect of equity market
development using these measures in a later subsection in the way that the aforementioned distinction is less of
an issue. See subsection 4.3.




                                                        5
any number of dimensions. Whether the legal system clearly establishes law and order,
minimizes corruption, or whether the administrative branch of the government protects
property rights efficiently are all important determinants of the incentives to save and invest.
Decisions by foreign residents will also be affected.
       We incorporate the effect of legal and institutional development by inclusion of the
variable LEGAL, calculated as the first principal component of law and order (LAO),
corruption (CORRUPT), and bureaucracy quality (BQ).5 The data series are available for the
period of 1984 through 1997, but are included in the regression as the period-average.6
       Summary statistics of the legal variables are displayed in Table 1.7 Variable definitions
and data sources, along with the list of countries in the sample and country groupings, are
presented in the Data Appendix.

2.3 The Estimation Approach
         The sample for our analysis covers both industrial and developing countries. The
underlying database has annual data for 21 industrial and 97 developing countries covering
the period 1971-2003. We examine three variables – the current account balance, and its
constituents, national saving, and investment, all expressed as a ratio to GDP.
         One potential problem with developing country data is the possibility of significant
measurement error in annual data. To mitigate these concerns, and since our interest is
primarily in medium-term rather than short-term variations in current accounts, we construct a



4
  The data are updated to 2003 and cover more countries (163 countries) than what can be found in Chinn and
Ito. The updated data are available at http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/.
5
  All of these indexes are available from the ICRG dataset, and are monthly series. Annual series are calculated
as the annual average of the monthly series. Higher values indicate better conditions.
6
  In other words, the data on legal/institutional development are cross-sectional in nature, i.e., they are time-
invariant. This is primarily due to data availability. The relative shortness of the time series of the ICRG
variables makes it difficult to include these variables as panel data. As Wei (2000) discusses (in reference to the
corruption indices in his paper), these types of institutional variables may exhibit some bias. In order to
circumvent this issue, we use period averages. However, the inclusion of these variables as time-invariant factors
do not pose a substantial problem for our analysis, since these characteristics represented by the
legal/institutional variables are likely to change only very slowly.
7
  In the original series, KAOPEN and LEGAL series range between negative and positive values since they are
the first principal components. However, in order to avoid the complexity of interpreting the estimated
coefficients, these variables are adjusted such that the minimum value is zero, i.e., they range between zero and
some positive values. See Table 1.


                                                        6
panel that contains non-overlapping 5-year averages of the data for each country.8 This
procedure also has the advantage of abstracting from short-run variations in current accounts
and related variables, which are not of central interest.
        Because the economic environmental factors may affect the way in which financial
development might affect saving and investment we include interaction involving these
variables. Interactions between the financial development and legal variables (PCGDP times
LEGAL), interactions between the financial development and financial openness variables
(PCGDP times KAOPEN), and interactions between legal development and financial
openness (LEGAL times KAOPEN). The financial and legal interaction effect is motivated by
the conjecture that deepening financial markets might lead to higher saving rates, but the
effect might be magnified under conditions of better developed legal institutions.
Alternatively, if greater financial deepening leads to a lower saving rate or a lower investment
rate, that effect could be mitigated when financial markets are equipped with highly
developed legal systems. A similar argument can be applied to the effect of financial openness
on current account balances.


3. Empirical Results

3.1. The Basic Specification
      We begin our investigation with a basic specification that excludes institutional
variables [comparable to that used by Chinn and Prasad (2003)], thereby providing a point of
comparison.9 The estimation results are reported in Table 2. Since these results are sensitive
to the inclusion of the African countries, we also report separate sets of results with and
without the African countries included, both for the full sample and for the developing
country sample. We also report separate results for an emerging market group that differs

  The 2001-03 period has been compressed into one observation, and so represents only 3 years instead of the
standard 5.
9
  We include the financial development variable, PCGDP, in the estimation as Chinn and Wei did, though they
used M2 as a ratio to GDP. However, we omit the financial openness variable so as to heighten the distinction
between the basic macro variables and the environmental factors. In Chinn and Prasad (2003), IMF’s AREAER
dummies for current account and capital account restrictions (“k2” and “k3”) are used to capture effects of
restrictions on external transactions. However, these variables turned out to be statistically weak in many
regressions.


                                                      7
somewhat from the developing country sample.
       One interesting result shown in Table 2 is the significantly positive relationship between
current account and government budget balances found for the industrialized countries group.
This result differs from the results obtained in Chinn and Prasad (2003), who examined a
shorter sample from 1971 to 1995. A one percentage point increase in the budget balance
would lead to a 0.19 percentage point increase in the current account balance for
industrialized countries and 0.22 for less developed countries except for African countries.
While significant, this is substantially less than the estimate obtained by Chinn and Prasad.
We attribute this result partly to the differing sample (the estimate is also lower in the 1971-
1995 sample), but also to the difference in behavior of current account balances in recent
years.
         We regress national saving and investment on the same set of regressors, and report
the estimated budget balance coefficients in each of the regressions. The results show that the
saving channel does indeed appear to be important in the sense that national saving and public
saving are positively correlated, but only for countries with relatively higher income levels
such as industrialized countries and emerging market countries. The budget balance appears
to have opposite effects on investment between industrialized countries and less developed
countries. This issue will be examined in greater detail in a later section.

         One more noteworthy aspect of Table 2 relates to the financial deepening variable. In
all subsamples, it exhibits a negative coefficient, albeit only statistically significant for the
industrialized countries. Consequently, one can conclude that more developed financial
markets do indeed lead to decreased current account balances, but not for the developing
countries, as posited by the adherents of the global savings glut thesis.


                                                        8
3.2 Augmented Model with Institutional Variables
     We now augment the specification with variables aimed at capturing institutional factors,
namely the legal development variable (LEGAL) and associated interaction terms. Tables 3-1
through 3-3 display results from panel OLS regressions with institutional variables. Several
notable results are obtained.
       First, inclusion of the institutional variable and interaction terms improves the fit of the
model, which are observed with improved adjusted R-squared.10 We also re-estimate the same
regressions using each of the components of the LEGAL variables, namely, CORRUPT, BQ,
and LAO, in order to isolate which variable drives the results. The test results (not reported)
suggest that the corruption index is the most significant contributor among the three
institutions variables, followed by the law and order index and bureaucracy quality in the
order of significance.
         Table 3-1 also shows the regression results. Here again, the significantly positive
relationship between current account and government budget balances is detected in all
sample groups like in Table 2 where the regression was run without the legal variable and the
interaction terms. The estimated coefficient is slightly higher for the LDC and ex-Africa LDC
groups. The point estimate is a statistically significant 0.21 for the industrialized countries
group, higher than in the previous estimation (0.19), which implies that the coefficient on the
budget balance for the IDC group is robust to inclusion of institutional variables.
         The null hypothesis that the effect of budget balances on current account balances is
zero is rejected, although in this particular specification the economic magnitude of the effect
is not large (Note however that a ±2 standard error confidence interval encompasses values as
high as 0.38).11
         In their analysis, Gruber and Kamin (2005) obtain similar results. Using a smaller
sample of 71 countries over the 1982-2003 period, they find that the budget balance has a

10
   Between the models with and without institutional variables, the sample size changes. However, even when it
is compared on the exactly same samples, the adjusted R-sq. is found to increase in the models with institutional
variables compared to the ones without.




                                                        9
positive effect on the current account, albeit of a smaller magnitude (0.09-0.14). Trade
openness also exhibits a similar effect as in our estimates. Perhaps most importantly, they also
find that their governance indicators (the Kaufmann et al. measure) induces a reduction in the
current account balance.12 These findings suggest that several of the key effects we have
detected are robust.
         When the results across different country groups are compared, the model for the full
sample or ex-Africa full sample seems to exhibit more significant coefficients. But we can
also observe that the results are driven mainly by the group of industrialized countries. The
results for the industrial countries’ group indicate that the higher the level of legal
development or the more open financial markets are, the lower the current account balances
tend to be.13 This finding is consistent with an anecdotal view that economies with more
developed institutional infrastructure and more open financial markets tend to attract greater
foreign capital inflows and thus run current account deficits. However, we should note here
that only the group of industrialized countries yields results consistent with such a view.
Interestingly, while the same relationship is applicable to the less developed countries group,
the effect of legal development is not observed for the ex-Africa LDC group, and furthermore,
emerging market countries, to which this argument is often applied to, do not exhibit this
characteristic. When the F-test is conducted to test the hypothesis that the institutional
variable, the financial openness index, and their interaction terms are jointly zero, the null
hypothesis is rejected significantly only for the group of industrialized countries and
marginally for the emerging market countries group (with the p-value of 15%). The results
also indicate that institutional development is an important determinant of current account
balances only for higher income countries.
         Although Table 3-1 may not appear to provide promising results for the LDC, ex-

11
    This finding is very similar to the finding of Erceg et al. (2005) whose simulation results show the coefficient
of the budget balance is around 0.20. The estimated coefficient on the budget balance found in the regressions
with individual legal variables, i.e., CORRUPT, LAO, and BQ, ranges from 0.19 to 0.24.
12
   In their analysis, they include the change in growth rate, as well as dummy variables for financial crises. On
the other hand, they omit measures of capital account openness, financial development as well as terms of trade
variability. They also exclude interaction effects involving legal development, thus ruling out nonlinearities of
this type.
13
   The significantly positive coefficient on the interaction term between financial openness and legal
development may suggest that the effect of each factor is concave depending on the level of the other factor.


                                                         10
Africa LDC or EMG subsamples, it does not necessarily mean that the variables of our
interest are unimportant for macroeconomic activity. Inspecting the results from the saving
and investment regressions yields additional insights. Essentially, the insignificant results in
the current account regressions are a reflection of offsetting effects in the saving and
investment regressions, both of which in fact present more significant results (Tables 3-2 and
3-3). Also, for these sets of regressions, the joint hypothesis for the institutional variables and
their interaction terms is always rejected, suggesting that institutional development is
important for saving and investment determination.
        The saving regression with the institutional variables shows that a one percentage
point increase in the budget balance leads to a 0.29 percentage point increase in the national
saving rate for industrialized countries. While the coefficient is found to be a significantly
positive 0.13 for the LDC group, neither ex-Africa LDC or emerging market countries group
has a significant coefficient on the budget balance. With these results, we can surmise that for
the IDC group, the government budget balance has a non-Ricardian effect on the national
saving rate, whereas for the ex-Africa LDC or EMG group, that is not the case.14




14
  Other studies also find non-Ricardian effects of the government budget balance on national savings such as De
Mello, Kongstrud, and Price (2004) for 21 OECD countries, World Bank (2005) for 46 industrialized and
emerging market countries, and Gale and Orszag (2004) for the United States. In these studies, the effect of the
government budget balance on national savings ranges from 0.50 to 0.80 percent (i.e., the Ricardian offset in
private savings ranges from 0.50 to 0.20 percent). Kormendi and Protopapadakis (2005), on the other hand, do
not find evidence for the non-Ricardian offset on both the real interest rate and current accounts for the United
States.

         In the investment regression, the estimated coefficient on the budget balance is
significantly positive for the IDC group (0.22), and is significantly negative for the ex-Africa
LDC groups (–0.14). There is a contrast between IDC and non-IDC countries in terms of how
budget balances affect the level of investment. Given the estimated sign of the coefficient on
the budget balance variable, industrialized countries’ public financing seems to crowd out
investment.15 For less developed countries, improving budget balances worsens investment,
which means deficit spending usually crowd-in effects on investment among these countries.
This is probably because the level of capital formation is already close to the steady state level
among industrialized countries.
         The effect of financial development on saving and investment is noteworthy as well.
The saving regression results show that financial development alone does not seem to have
any significant effect on national savings for industrialized countries, but for non-IDC
countries, financial development may lead to higher saving rates – PCGDP’s coefficient is
significantly positive for the LDC and EMG groups.16 Since the financial development
variable (PCGDP) is interacted with other variables – the legal development measure
(LEGAL) and the financial openness variable (KAOPEN) – we need to be careful about
interpretation of the effect of financial development. Table 4 shows the total effect of a 10%
point increase in PCGDP conditional on the levels of LEGAL and KAOPEN (the latter as of

15
  This is consistent with the non-Ricardian effect on national savings found in the saving regression.
16
  Although the coefficient on PCGDP is not significant for the ex-Africa LDC group, when the insignificant
interaction terms between PCGDP and LEGAL and those between KAOPEN and PCGDP are removed from the
model, the coefficient on the level term of PCGDP becomes significant with a large magnitude. The coefficient
of the interaction term between PCGDP and LEGAL is significantly negative.

the 2001-03 period) – whether their levels are low 10 percentile, mean, or high 10 percentile
in each subsample, IDC, LDC, and EMG. Panels A, B, and C show the total effect of financial
development on current accounts, national savings, and investment, respectively. Although
the regression results for the financial development level or its interactions are not uniformly
significant, this exercise illustrates how the impact of financial development can vary with the
level of legal development and financial development.17 We focus our attention on the total
effects on national savings and investment (Panels B and C).18
         Panel B shows that, for less developed countries and emerging market countries, the
effect of higher levels of financial development on national savings is smaller for economies
with higher levels of legal development and more open financial markets. Interestingly,
Bernanke’s prediction that the more developed financial markets are, the less saving a country
undertakes seem to be validated only by industrialized countries with high levels of legal
development and relatively closed financial markets, or emerging market countries with high
levels of legal development regardless of the openness of financial markets. Especially among
emerging market countries with high levels of legal development, the negative effect of
financial development is particularly high (0.4 percentage points) if a country has open capital
accounts, which appears to bolster Bernanke’s argument that more financial opening and
financial development will solve the issue of the savings glut in emerging market countries,
especially those in East Asia. Now the next question is, is this finding applicable to emerging
market Asian countries?
         Panel A of Table 5 categorizes emerging market countries in East Asia depending on
the level of legal development and financial openness. The matrix shows that only Hong
Kong and Singapore are categorized as countries with highest tenth percentile legal
development and highest tenth percentile financial openness, while many Asian EMG
countries are categorized in the middle legal development groups. Panel B reports the total
effects of a 10 percentage point increase in PCGDP on national savings and investment for


17
   The regression results for the emerging market countries group are relatively more significant. Our discussions
will be focused on this group of countries.
18
   The total effects on savings and investment do not add up to the total effect on current accounts, because the
current account regressions account for the covariance of national savings and investment while simply adding
two coefficients does not.

Asian EMG and three industrialized countries, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom
using specific values for each country’s legal development and financial openness
measures.19,20 According to Panel B, Hong Kong and Singapore are the only countries for
which financial development will cause a negative impact on national savings. Other
countries will experience an increase in the ratio of national savings to GDP if financial
markets develop further. Interestingly, for all the countries except for Singapore, financial
development leads to expansion of investment, presumably because of improved credit
conditions and financial intermediation which is supported by Panel C where the effect of
financial development is generally higher among countries with low levels of legal
development and more closed financial markets. Furthermore, the effect on investment
exceeds that on national savings. Armed with these results, we conclude that financial
development reduces the level of current account balances, especially for non-U.S.
industrialized countries and Asian emerging market countries, but that effect is achieved, not
through a reduction in savings rates, but through increased levels of investment.
        Lastly, it is interesting to compare the effect of financial opening between
industrialized countries and emerging market countries. While more open financial markets
leads to lower saving rates among industrialized countries, for emerging market countries
financial opening can induce to higher rates of savings. Examination of the coefficient on
financial openness in the current account regression indicates that higher levels of financial
openness leads to greater capital inflows for industrialized countries, but not for less
developed countries.
        In sum, these results present evidence against part of the argument that emerging
market countries, especially those in East Asia, will experience lower rates of saving once
these countries achieve higher levels of financial development and better developed legal
infrastructure. Arguments based upon this thesis have inappropriately extended a
characterization applicable for industrialized countries to less developed countries.

4. Are the Current Account Imbalances of the Last Decade Atypical?

         We next ask whether the pattern of current account imbalances observed over the past
decade is atypical. One way to examine the alignment of current account balances is to see the
predicted values based on the estimation results. Figure 2 displays the implied current account
balances for various countries along with 95% prediction intervals that are calculated using
the estimation results shown in Table 3-1. Figure 2 indicates that the U.S. current account
deviating from the predicted path in the 2001-03 period. Given that the 2001-03 observation
is just outside the ±2 standard error band, this indicates that there is something omitted from
our model. Similarly, Gruber and Kamin (2005) also find an unexplainable component in the
most recent few years.


4.1 Out-of-Sample Prediction of Current Account Balances

         Another way to explore this question is to conduct out-of-sample predictions for the
1995-2000 and 2001-03 periods using the estimated coefficients from the regressions
implemented over the 1975-95 time periods.21 As in the previous section, we implement two
models, one with only the Chinn-Prasad macro variables and the other augmented with
institutional variables (legal development, financial openness, and the interaction terms). For
industrialized countries, we use more recent data that are available from the IMF’s World
Economic Outlook database.
         Figure 3 displays the predicted and actual values of current account balances,
expressed as a proportion of GDP. The predicted values are calculated using the specifications
with and without institutional variables. In Figure 3-1, we can see that actual U.S. current
account deficits are larger in 2001-04 than what could be predicted using the pre-1995
estimation results whether we use the model with or without institutional variables. The
magnitude of the under-prediction for the 2001-04 period is about 1.7 percentage points and

21
  Since the time fixed effects for the post-1995 time periods are not available, we use the average of the time
effects for the 1975-1995 period. This exercise allows us to observe how much the actual current account
balances in the post-1995 period differ from what could be predicted using the relationships that obtained up to
1995. Generally, when we examine a subsample, the predicted values will be based on the estimation for that
sample group. For example, the predicted values for the group of industrialized countries will be based on the
                                                                                                  (continued…)

2.5 percentage points based on the models with and without institutional variables,
respectively (see below). From the figure, we can surmise that the deterioration of U.S.
current accounts can be partly attributed to higher levels of U.S. budget deficits in the time
period given the estimated coefficient on the budget balance in Tables 2 and 3-1. However,
given the over-prediction of the current account balances (i.e., under-prediction of the current
account deficits) for the country, there seem to be other factors contributing to the
deterioration of the external balance.

         The other panels in Figure 3-1 exhibit an interesting contrast; Germany, Japan, and
industrialized countries ex-G3 experienced better current account balances than what is
predicted by the models, with the ex-G3 industrial countries under-prediction the most
marked.
         We repeated the same exercise for the group of less developed countries with
particular focus on Asian emerging market countries. Figure 3-2 shows the out-of-sample
predictions for these countries, namely, ex-Africa LDCs, Asian emerging market countries
excluding China, China, and Korea, based on the models with and without the institutional
variables. These figures make it clear that Asian emerging market countries, not just China,
are experiencing an unpredictably large amount of current account surplus. In the 2001-03
period, the actual current account balance of China is higher than what the model predicts by
more than 5 percentage point, while the Asian emerging market countries excluding China, on
average, experienced better current account balances than model predictions by stunning 7

4.2 U.S. Saving (Public) Drought vs. Asian Saving Glut?

         Today’s 700 billion dollar question is, where does the U.S. current account imbalance
come from? The framework we rely upon allows us to examine the determinants of current
account balances from the perspective of saving-investment balances. Now, we implement
out-of-sample predictions again, but for national saving and investment in the post-1995
period. Figure 4 shows the out-of-sample predictions for U.S. national saving and investment
using the estimation model with the institutional variables (whose results are shown in Tables
3-2 and 3-3). In these figures, we can see that the U.S. is experiencing “saving drought” rather
than “investment boom,” which is driving the current account balance down.
         What about the question of where the unpredictably large current account surpluses of
the emerging Asia come from? Figure 5 helps us figure out the answer to that question. From
these figures, we can see that the Asian emerging market countries’ level of national saving is
not as high as the model predicts in the post-1995 period. This result counters the global
saving glut argument. On the other hand, when we examine East Asian investment behavior
in the bottom of Figure 5, we observe that the investment rate has been considerably lower
than predicted, especially since the 1996-2000 period. The resulting conclusion that East Asia
is undergoing a investment drought is consistent with the findings of Higgins (2005).


4.3 The U.S. Current Account Imbalance and the Equity Market

         Our findings indicate that there is an unexplained component of the U.S. deficit. Is this
component attributable to excess savings flowing from East Asia? We believe that a domestic
factor is at work. Hence, we investigate whether the remarkable behavior of the U.S. equity
market has some explanatory power.

         Specifically, we examine the correlation between equity markets and the prediction


22
  Gruber and Kamin (2005) associate these current account surpluses with the after-effects of financial crises. In
this sense, there results are consistent with the precautionary motive for reserve accumulation identified by
Aizenman and Lee (2005).


                                                       17
errors from the previous subsection.

        We consider three measures of the behavior of equity markets: stock market
capitalization (SMKC), total value of stocks traded (SMTV), and stock market turn over ratio
(SMTO), all drawn from Beck, et al.(2001). We view SMKC as a measure of the size of equity
markets, SMTO as a measure of the activeness of equity markets, and SMTV as a variable
incorporating both aspects. Hence, SMKC and to a lesser extent SMTV will capture bubble
effects. Figure 6 shows that many countries, notably the United States and Asian EMG
countries, experienced the enlargement of equity markets.23 These variables are expressed as a
ratio to the world average to capture the investors’ focus on relative market performance.24

        In Figure 7, casual empiricism suggests a correlation between the stock market
development measures and the prediction errors for industrialized countries (left column) and
Asian emerging market countries (right) using two different stock market development
measures, relative SMTV and relative SMTO.25 In the figures for the IDC subsample, we
observe that U.S stock market booms in the 1996-00 and 2001-03 coincides with model over-
prediction of the current account balance, i.e., the country experienced larger current account
deficits than what the model predicted. For the group of Asian emerging market countries, the
association between the prediction errors and stock market measures, no such correlation is
obvious.

        Table 6 reports the results of regressing the prediction errors on the equity market
measures. The regression is performed with the weights based on the ratio of GDP to world
total (in current PPP). Regional dummies are included in the regression and since the
prediction errors are made using the estimated coefficients from the regressions implemented
over the 1975-95 time periods, the time fixed dummies for the 1996-2000 and 2001-03
periods are included. When we measure equity market development using stock market total


23
   This is also the reason why we decided not to include equity market development measures in our previous
regressions. Inclusion of these measures may also cause multicollinearity since the model also includes the
private credit creation variable.
24
   We also calculate five-year averages to make it consistent with prediction errors.
25
   Prediction errors are based on the estimation for the subsamples countries belong to. For example, the
prediction errors for Thailand are calculated using the estimates from the regression for the EMG subsample,
while those for Ireland are calculated using the IDC subsample’s estimates.


                                                      18
values or stock market capitalization, the association between the prediction errors and stock
market development is significantly negative, i.e., the higher the level of equity market
development is, the more likely it is for the regression model using the data up to 1995 to
over-predict the current account balances (under-predict the deficits) in the post-1995 periods.
In other words, countries with higher levels of equity market values (either measured as
capitalization or traded value) tend to experience worsened current account balances than is
predicted by the model. Figure 8 illustrates the out-of-sample prediction errors and their
portions that can be explained by the relative SMTV for the U.S., Germany, Japan, the U.K.,
ex-G3 IDC, China, Korea, and ex-China Asian EMG in the 1996-2000 and 2001-04 periods.
The prediction errors for the U.S. and the U.K. are well-explained by the stock market
behavior while it cannot be observed in other countries and groups, suggesting that the effect
of stock market performance was especially significant in these countries.

        We also regressed the prediction errors from the out-of-sample regressions for national
savings and investment on the (relative) stock market development measures (not reported).
The estimated coefficient on the stock market measures turned out to be significantly negative
only for the saving regression with stock market total values. This result is consistent with the
recent experience of the U.S. where the dot-com bubble encouraged consumption through
wealth effect and depressed measured saving, thus contributing to the deterioration of the
current account.26



4. Concluding remarks

        In this paper we have investigated the medium-term determinants of the current
account using a model that controls for institutional factors such as financial openness and
legal development, with an aim to inform the recent debate over the source of and solution to
the “global saving glut” that has thus far lacked empirical content. Our study addresses that
gap. Given our motivation, we focused our study on the behavior of current accounts for the

26
   See the discussion in Greenspan (2005b). The results are also consistent with Mann and Plück’s (forthcoming)
findings. Using disaggregate U.S. trade data, they under-estimated the trade deficit during the recent period
                                                                                                (continued…)

United States and emerging market countries in East Asia.
        We confirmed the results obtained by Chinn and Prasad (2003) that – for the
industrialized countries – budget balances play an important role in the determination of
current account balances. A one percentage point increase in the budget balance is found to
raise the current account balance by 0.21 percentage point. While smaller than the coefficient
implied by some macro models, the standard errors on the point estimate are sufficiently large
so that one cannot rule out a coefficient as high as 0.40 at conventional significance levels.
We also found evidence for such a correlation among non-IDC countries. This finding is
robust to inclusion of institutional variables, although incorporating financial factors seems to
matter more (in a statistical sense) for industrialized countries than less developed countries.
Furthermore, we found evidence that the oft-claimed argument about the effect of financial
and legal development as well as financial liberalization is only applicable to this group of
countries. This suggests that the policy recommendations made by the global saving glut
proponents have only a tenuous empirical basis insofar as they relate to East Asia.
        We also found that saving per se is not excessive among the East Asian emerging
market countries. Rather, these countries have experienced a shortfall in investment. The
United States, on the other hand, seems to be experiencing saving drought, including that in
the public sector. Furthermore, current account behavior seems be related with equity market
development, especially since the last few years of the 1990s. We conclude that the more a
country’s equity market boomed, the more likely that country was to experience a
deterioration of its current account. This last finding suggests that widening of the U.S. deficit
over the last ten years is at least in part attributable to the run-up in stock prices at the turn of
the millennium. It remains to be seen whether the real estate boom of the last several years
has had an analogous effect on the current account deficit.




mostly because of under-prediction of consumer good and auto imports, components that were driven by the
budget deficit (caused by the income tax cuts) and the equity market and housing booms.

NOTES: Data are extracted from the ICRG dataset. LEGAL is the first principal component of
BQ, LAO, and CORRUPT. The first eigenvector for LEGAL was found to be (BQ, LAO,
CORRUPT)’ = (0.579, 0.574, 0.578)’, indicating that the variability of KAOPEN is not driven by
any particular component variable. All of the original variables are extracted from the ICRG
dataset, and are monthly series. Annual series are calculated as the annual average of the monthly
series.
