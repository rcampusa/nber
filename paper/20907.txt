                                             ABSTRACT

Under the Affordable Care Act, individual states have discretion in how they define coverage regions,
within which insurers must charge the same premium to buyers of the same age, family structure, and
smoking status. We exploit variation in these definitions to investigate whether the size of the coverage
region affects outcomes in the ACA marketplaces. We find large consequences for small and rural
markets. When states combine small counties with neighboring urban areas into a single region, the
included rural markets see .6 to .8 more active insurers, on average, and savings in annual premiums
of between $200 and $300.

1    Introduction
Approximately 8 million U.S. residents currently obtain private health insurance cov-
erage through one of the marketplaces created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
Recent research has documented considerable variation across geographic areas in the
number of insurers participating in each market, the number of plans offered, and in
the distribution of health insurance premiums. This variation may be partially driven
by characteristics such as the population, income distribution, and fraction uninsured
in each market prior to the Affordable Care Act.
    Government regulations are also likely to affect market outcomes in the ACA health
insurance exchanges. While the Affordable Care Act was passed at the federal level,
state governments have been given considerable latitude to vary certain policies that
regulate these marketplaces. For example, each state is allowed to decide the number
of coverage regions within its marketplace and the geographic areas covered by each
region. Within each region, an insurer is required to make each offered plan available
to any eligible individual or family. Thus if N is the number of coverage regions within
a state, each insurer has exactly N entry decisions to make.
    The private marketplaces for public health insurance that existed before the Afford-
able Care Act have taken very different approaches to the definition of coverage regions.
For example, Medicare Advantage, through which more than 16 million Medicare re-
cipients obtain their coverage, defines each county to be a coverage region. Because
of this, a health insurer essentially has 3,100 distinct entry decisions to make. On the
opposite extreme, Medicare Part D defines just 34 coverage regions for its prescription
drug plans (PDPs) nationally, and many of these coverage regions are larger than an
entire state. An additional 25 million Medicare recipients obtain PDP coverage through
these Medicare Part D marketplaces.
    The size of a coverage region may be especially important for smaller markets — for
example in rural areas — which may attract relatively few private insurers. Perhaps
partly because of this, in 1998 the federal government set a payment floor for Medi-
care Advantage (MA) plans that substantially raised their reimbursement in counties
with low average fee-for-service expenditures (which were typically smaller counties).
Despite this policy change, the fraction of Medicare recipients enrolled in MA plans is
significantly lower in counties with fewer residents. For example, while 33 percent of
Medicare recipients in the most populous 20 percent of counties are enrolled in an MA
plan, just 13 percent in the least populous counties are. The opposite relationship holds


                                           1
for Medicare Part D enrollment (despite no payment floor for smaller counties), with
beneficiaries in the smallest counties much more likely to be enrolled in private PDP
plans than their counterparts in the largest counties (60 percent versus 42 percent).
One possible explanation for the very different pattern of enrollment in smaller coun-
ties between Medicare Advantage and Part D is that Part D has much larger coverage
regions, which attracts more firm entry and perhaps more intensive marketing.
    In this paper, we use data at both the county and coverage-region level to investigate
whether the size of the coverage region affects market outcomes in the ACA insurance
marketplaces. Theoretically, one would expect a larger market size to increase the
number of firms that enter the market. This could lead to improved outcomes in smaller
markets with respect to the amount of choice and lower prices through competition.
However, if a state defines its coverage regions to be too large, it may discourage some
insurers from entering given the need to charge a single price to a more heterogeneous
group of consumers.
    In our empirical analyses, we focus primarily on smaller counties given their vul-
nerability to insufficient plan entry. Our sample includes all counties in the 34 states
that used the federal government’s healthcare.gov site to sign up enrollees. Within this
group of states, there is significant variation in the size of the coverage region. On one
extreme, states such as Florida followed the Medicare Advantage example, setting each
county (regardless of how small) to be its own market. On the opposite extreme, Texas
and some other states had on average several counties in their coverage regions. While
not as expansive as the Part D coverage regions, these broader regions substantially
expanded the effective market size for small counties.
    In our first set of analyses, we investigate whether the number of insurers in smaller
counties varies with the size of the coverage regions. We control for state fixed effects
to account for the possibility that there are unobserved differences between states that
are correlated with their decisions on how to define rating regions, such as minimum
requirements for the breadth of provider networks. Our findings demonstrate that, con-
trolling for the population of a county, the number of health insurers increases and the
benchmark (second lowest cost silver plan) insurance premiums decrease with the size
of the coverage region. One concern with this first set of results is that counties bundled
with larger areas may differ in important ways, such as proximity to an urban area,
from counties that are not. However, our results for the effect of coverage region size
on both the number of firms and on average insurance premiums are very similar when
we restrict attention to only those counties that are located close to urban counties.

                                            2
    In our next set of analyses, we explore the effects on both the number of firms and
on health insurance premiums using data at the coverage region level. This examina-
tion complements related work examining the effect of concentration on health market
outcomes, including Dafny et al. (2014) and Dafny (2010). Our findings demonstrate
that, on average, the number of insurers increases and premiums decline with coverage
region size. However, there is substantial variation in this effect, with market outcomes
actually somewhat worse in coverage areas that are more heterogeneous (with respect
to urban versus rural population). This suggests that states do not necessarily want to
simply define their entire state as one coverage area.
    Taken together, our results reveal that a state can significantly affect market out-
comes when defining its coverage regions. Smaller and more rural counties appear to
benefit from being bundled with larger areas with respect to having both more insurers
from which to choose and having lower premiums. This is consistent with the difference
in the Medicare program between market outcomes, as measured by enrollment (which
we do not yet have for ACA exchanges) for MA and Part D plans. However, there is
a tradeoff, as market outcomes are on average less favorable in more diverse coverage
regions as the region expands.
    The outline of the paper is as follows. We begin by describing our data collection
and the features of the insurance marketplaces we study in Section 2. We then present
our county-level analysis in Section 3, a simple model of insurer entry and pricing in
Section 4, and our region-level analysis in Section 5. Section 6 concludes and highlights
directions for future research.


2       Data
We collected the premiums, financial characteristics, and associated insurance carrier
for every health insurance plan offered on the healthcare.gov website. The website
served as a platform for sales of marketplace plans in 36 states. Of these 36 states, 27
are states that chose not to operate their own exchange, yielding all oversight to the
federal government. Seven of the states are “partnership” states, which share regula-
tory oversight with the federal government and use the healthcare.gov platform.1 The

Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Okla-
homa, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin,
Wyoming. Partnership: Arkansas, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, New Hampshire, West Virginia.



                                               3
remaining two states, New Mexico and Idaho, operate their exchanges independently
but adopted the healthcare.gov platform for consumers to enroll in plans. Because we
merge the exchange data with county-level covariates from the census, we drop three
states—Alaska, Nebraska, and Idaho—that define coverage regions based on zip codes
rather than counties. This leaves 33 states and 2,388 counties, representing over 66%
of the 8,019,763 people who enrolled in the 2013-2014 open enrollment period.2 One
limitation of these data is the absence of information about the breadth of the provider
networks to which plans provide access.
    The premiums offered in the marketplaces for a particular plan differ depending
on the plan’s financial characteristics, summed up in its “tier” rating. Each tier is
characterized by an actuarial value, which describes the percentage of a representative
consumer’s medical expenditures that a plan in that tier would cover. Bronze plans
cover, on average, 60% of costs, silver plans cover 70%, gold plans cover 80%, and
platinum plans are the most generous, covering 90% of costs. Premiums may also
differ based on an enrollee’s age, family size, and smoking status. The ratio between
the premium of a particular product for any two ages is fixed by the ACA, so we
focus on premiums for consumers of a particular age, 51-year-olds, in our summary
statistics and analysis.3 Figure 1 contains an example of a typical menu of contracts
available to consumers in one of the federally-administered marketplaces we study. For
this example—Shelby County, Tennessee—we illustrate the average and the minimum
premiums and deductibles by plan tier in this market. We also list the names of the
insurers offering products in this county.
    Shelby County’s menu is typical. Roughly three to five insurers offer multiple prod-
ucts in each tier, which differ in financial characteristics. In the proceeding sections,
our analyses will focus on the premiums and characteristics of a particular product: the
second-lowest-priced silver plan. We focus on the premium of this plan for two reasons.
First, the premium for the second-lowest-priced silver plan, or “benchmark” plan, is
extremely policy relevant, because it is used to determine the level of income-based
subsidies provided to assist low and middle income consumers in paying for their cho-
sen insurance plan. The subsidy amount is determined so that a buyer within a given
income bracket pays a pre-set fraction of her income for the benchmark plan. Second,

     See Orsini and Tebaldi (2014) for an analysis of the role of age-based pricing in the market outcomes

we do not observe detailed demand data, and so choose to focus on the premium of a
product likely to capture a large share of consumer demand.
    In Table 1 we report summary statistics on the premiums and deductibles across all
plans in our data. Premiums are not allowed to vary across counties grouped into the
same geographic rating region. In the 33 states we study, the included 2,388 counties
are divided into 398 regions. While there are on average six counties per region, there is
considerable heterogeneity in this figure by state. We illustrate this variation in Figure
3, drawing the region boundaries for three states. At one extreme, Florida defines
rating regions uniquely by county—there are 67 regions to cover each of the 67 counties
in the state. Near the other extreme, Texas defines rating regions by using one region
per major city and then a complementary region that covers all other counties in the
state. Thus, Texas divides its 254 counties into only 26 regions. Tennessee, as pictured,
defines regions with slightly higher numbers of counties per region than the average,
but unlike the large region in Texas, the counties within each Tennessee region are
geographically close.
    Tennessee’s region boundaries represent the modal experience of the states we study.
Tennessee combines counties near metropolitan areas into a region. For those counties
bordering an urban area, the state chooses which of the counties to bundle in a region
with the nearby city or leave out, forming a distinct region with the left out, geographi-
cally contiguous counties. There appears heterogeneity within and across states in how
policymakers drew boundaries to include or exclude otherwise similar counties border-
ing major urban centers. We exploit this heterogeneity in our county-level analysis.
    Across regions, we observe 24,219 unique region-product combinations. The average
annual premium for a 51-year-old single buyer is just under $5500 with a deductible of
about $3000. On average, three insurers enter each rating region, though more than
10% of markets have a monopolist provider.
    In addition to the plan characteristics, we collect county-level data on health demand
characteristics from the Area Health Resources Files (AHRF) from the US Department
of Health and Human Services and County Business Patterns from the US Census Bu-
reau.4 We weight the county-level data by population to compute a region’s urbanity,
age distribution, income distribution, including the share of the population in house-
holds that meet the criteria for federal insurance subsidies, and the share of employees
who work in establishments with fewer than 10 employees. In this way, counties with

                                            5
larger population have more weight in the region-level averages. Using data from the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the ARHF, we also collect informa-
tion on health supply characteristics by county, including the number of hospitals and
Medicare’s Geographic Adjustment Factor, which we use as a measure of the cost of
supplying health care in a county.


3       County-level Analysis
To isolate the effect of the rating region definition on pricing and entry, we focus first on
counties that share many market characteristics but differ in whether they are bundled
with a more populous county in their region. We focus on “small” and “rural” counties,
as these markets are most similar and are of particular policy interest because of the
historical lack of access to insurance in these markets.5
    We define small and rural markets as those with population and urbanity below
the 75th percentile in population—around 37,000—and below the 50th percentile in
urbanity, about 40% urban. In Figure 2, we illustrate the distribution of these small
and rural counties across the regions in our data. As a robustness, we repeat this
empirical analysis using a broad range of combinations of cutoffs for both urbanity and
population size. The results appear in Table 7 in the Appendix. Our main qualitative
results on the effects of region size on the benchmark premia and the number of market
participants remain unchanged under different small and rural thresholds.
    Focusing on only the set of small and rural markets leaves 1,157 of the original
2,388 counties to study. Of these small and rural counties, we define treatment and
control counties based on quantiles of the rest of the region’s population and the rest
of the region’s urban share. Specifically, we calculate the rest of the region population
as the sum of the population in counties in the region other than the focal county. We
calculate the rest of the region’s urban share as the population-weighted urban share
amongst all counties in a region other than the focal county. We then label as treated
those counties that are bundled into regions in which the rest of the region population
is above the 75th percentile and the rest of the region urban share is also above the
75th percentile. Our control counties are those counties in regions in which the rest of
    5
    In this analysis, we telescope in on counties for which the policymaker’s market definition will have
the sharpest effect on market outcomes. This is similar in spirit to the exercise Cabral and Mahoney
(2014) conduct to study the effect of Medigap supplemental insurance on utilization in Medicare. They
exploit discontinuities within local medical markets that span state boundaries.



                                                   6
the region population and rest of the region urban share fall below the 50th percentile.
All other counties fall into an intermediate group. In Figure 4, we plot the counties
along the dimensions of population and urbanity in the rest of the region. The upper
right quadrant in the plot represents the treated observations; the lower left quadrant
represents the set of control counties.6 Overall, of the 1,157 small and rural counties,
66 fall into the treated category, 335 fall into the control category, and 756 fall into the
intermediate grouping.
    To make clear the variation underlying our main county-level analysis we return to
an example from Tennessee. In Figure 5, we highlight four counties within Tennessee:
two small and rural counties, Fayette and Cannon, and two large and urban counties,
Shelby and Rutherford. Fayette and Shelby counties share a border in the southwest
of the state; Tennessee officials drew the region boundaries in a way that bundled the
two counties into Region 6. Thus, in both counties the same four insurers operate and
consumers face the same benchmark silver plan premium of $3,396. In the center of
the state, Cannon and Rutherford counties share a boundary but officials bundled the
two into distinct regions. The larger Rutherford County, placed in Region 4, attracted
four insurers to serve the individual market, with a benchmark silver plan premium
of $3300. The smaller Cannon County in Region 7 attracted only one insurer entrant,
and consumers faced a benchmark silver premium of $3,528, an increase of 7% over
the premiums faced in the bordering urban county. Cannon County’s consumers face
a benchmark premium that is also 4% more than the otherwise comparable Fayette
County, which officials bundled with its urban neighbor. We conduct this within-state,
small county comparison in a regression framework, to add controls for county-level
demographics and health market characteristics.
    Before presenting the results of the regression analysis, we first provide some support
for our use of variation in county boundaries to study pricing and entry. We conduct two
tests. First, we examine whether observable measures of provider costs and expected
health utilization vary across counties we label as either treatment or control counties.
Our observable measures of provider cost include Medicare’s Geographic Adjustment
Factor and the number of hospitals in a region. We proxy for the profitability of the
patient population using the median income in the region, the share of the 18-64 year
old population in the 40-64 year old age bracket, the fraction of the population with
incomes that make them eligible for subsidies, and the proportion of employees working
  6
      We report the number of insurers in the county over each data point in the two-dimensional plot.



                                                   7
for small firms. The results appear in Appendix Table 6. We find few statistically
significant differences in the mean levels of the demographic and cost variables across
the treatment and control groups, with the exception of median income. Second, we
conduct a statistical test of the differences in these covariates by region by randomly
reshuffling the small counties within a state. We then test the null hypothesis that the
standard deviation of the cost and utilization measures within assigned regions is larger
than that observed in actual regions. We reject this null hypothesis in a large share of
states for the demographic and hospital variables.7
    The results of our county-level analysis appear in Tables 2 and 3. The dependent
variable in these regressions is either the number of unique entrants observed in the
region or the premium for the benchmark silver plan available in the region. We focus
on this particular plan premium, the second lowest silver plan, because the federal
subsidies for consumers are tied to this order statistic of the available silver plans. In
these regressions, we include a rich set of controls for observable measures of provider
costs and expected health utilization, including those mentioned above: Medicare’s
Geographic Adjustment Factor, the number of hospitals in a region, as well as patient
demographic variables.
    We focus our discussion on the estimated coefficient on the indicator for whether
a county observation is in the treated group—i.e. whether state officials bundled the
small county into a large, urban region. We find a significant increase in the number
of insurers entering these counties. Being grouped in a region with a large urban
county increases the expected number of entrants by between .6 and .8 insurers. The
bundling also leads to an average decrease in annual premiums of between $200 and
$300. Bundling rural counties in with neighboring regions appears to have a meaningful
impact on the supply of plans available to rural residents.
    As further robustness, we restrict our county-level sample to only those small and
rural counties that are within reasonable driving distance of an urban area. Specifically,
we compute the population-weighted centroid of a large, urban region within the state
and collect small and rural counties that are within 100 driving miles of this region. Our
   7
     In addition, we mapped health market definitions from the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care to the
rating regions that each of the 33 states in our sample define. We use the Dartmouth Atlas’ definition
of local markets for hospital care, known as hospital service areas (HSAs). We compare the region
definitions under the ACA with the HSA definitions and find at least 18% of the HSAs overlap with
more than region and, across all states, the median number of HSAs contained within a region is five.
That is, it does not appear that states have defined rating regions in ways tightly linked to a typical
measure of health markets.



                                                  8
goal in this analysis is to compare the effect of bundling only for those small and rural
counties that border a populous and urban county. The estimates from this robustness
appear in the final two columns of Tables 2 and 3. Comparing small counties in close
proximity to such large urban counties, those that are bundled into the same rating
region have roughly the same difference in premiums observed in the main specification.
In the restricted sample, the small markets that are bundled with larger markets see
roughly one additional insurer entrant relative to markets that are not grouped with a
larger, urban region. This is a slightly larger effect than seen in the main county-level
analysis, where we observed grouped counties with between .6 and .8 greater numbers
of predicted entrants, all else equal.8


4       Model of Entry
Finding some support for the relationship between region size and market outcomes
from our county-level analysis, we explore the possible drivers of these differences. In
this exercise, we follow a long empirical literature in industrial organization on the
decision of firms to enter a cross-section of markets, beginning with Bresnahan and
Reiss (1989). Berry and Reiss (2007) provide a survey of many related papers in this
literature. Measuring the effect of the region regulation under the ACA also relates
closely to previous work on community rating, including Pauly (1970) and Herring and
Pauly (2006). Here, we present a simple framework to describe the determinants of
the insurer’s decision to offer plans in a region in the health insurance marketplace and
to set prices for these plans. Firms decide whether to introduce a plan after forming
expectations of the joint distribution of costs, c, and consumers’ utility for the plan, u.
This distribution, labeled F (u, c), depends on the firm’s expectations of rivals’ entry
and on how consumers of different costs will choose amongst available plans.
    The decision to enter and set price for a plan depends not only on the characteristics
of enrollees, but also the costs of providers in the market, the fixed costs of serving
the market, and the market size. We assume the provider costs vary by region as a
multiplicative factor of patient utilization. Profits in the region are thus:
                                  Z
                        Π=M              (p − ψ(H) ∗ c)dF (u, c) − Ψ(H)
                                u(p)>0

    8
    As a robustness, we vary the threshold driving distance from 100 miles to 200 miles in 25 mile
increments. The qualitative results are similar using each of these mileage thresholds.

                                                 9
where M is the population in the region, p is the premium the insurer sets, and H
is a measure of heterogeneity in the region’s characteristics. H can be a measure
of population density, urbanity, or patient demographics, for example. In the profit
equation, both the provider costs, ψ(.), and the entry costs, Ψ(.), depend on H. For
example, with greater region density, it may be cheaper for an insurer to market a
new insurance plan and contract with a network of physicians and facilities to ensure
enrollees have access to care.
    From the profit equation, the optimal premium conditional on entry, p∗ , depends
on H. Thus, if greater H drives increases in insurers’ entry costs or provider costs,
the optimal premium will also increase. A larger population increases the incentive to
enter but may increase p∗ depending on the shape of F (.) – how well the firm attracts
the healthiest of this larger group of consumers. In our empirical implementation, we
condition on several empirical proxies of population, region heterogeneity, measures of
provider costs per procedure, and the profitability of the patient population.

Our simple model illustrates that region heterogeneity and provider costs creates a
tradeoff in an insurer’s entry and pricing decision: too much heterogeneity in region
size and composition may raise the fixed costs of entry and lead to fewer insurers and
possibly higher premiums. We measure this tradeoff empirically at the region level.
Conditioning on population, we use land area and urbanity as proxies for density in
a region. We control for the same measures of health utilization and cost as in the
county-level regressions.
    The results of this region-level analysis appear in Table 4. The dependent variable
in these regressions is either the log number of unique entrants observed in the region
or the premium for the benchmark silver plan available in the region. The coefficient
on log population suggests a positive and significant effect of increasing population on
the number of entrants and premiums. We convert the estimates to percentage changes
in entrants and premiums from a shift in both log population and land area in 100s of
square miles. We report these percentage changes in Table 5.
    Moving from the 25th to 75th percentile in log population, the log number of insurers
increases between 27.1 and 37.0 percent; the same change in population is associated
with a decrease in premiums of 3.3 to 5.4 percent. However, controlling for population,


                                           10
increasing land area from the 25th to 75th percentile leads to a decrease in the log
number of entrants of between 6.5 and 15 percent. Premiums increase 7.0 to 8.3%.
Thus, there appears a tradeoff in market outcomes, all else equal, from increasing the
size of regions. Greater population size may encourage entry, but more heterogeneous
regions appear to have lower degrees of competition and higher premiums.


6    Future Directions
Rural regions appear to attract fewer entrants. Insurers also charge higher premiums
to rural residents, controlling for observable measures of consumer and provider costs
in these markets. One way for policymakers to improve market outcomes for rural
residents is to consider alternative rating region definitions to increase the incentives
for insurers to serve rural residents.
    In our current analysis, we do not examine how market and firm characteristics like
insurer competition or multimarket contact may underlie the premium differentials ob-
served. Examining the specific firms that choose to enter differentially in the urban and
rural markets can provide insight into the nature of competition. Early investigation
suggests there may be heterogeneity in the entry and pricing decisions of incumbent
national firms and newly formed cooperatives.
    Furthermore, the pricing and entry decisions of these insurers appears to interact
with the federal government’s subsidy policy: in regions in which larger shares of the
population are eligible for subsidies, we observe slightly larger numbers of insurers
entering. Firms may be responding to inelastic demand for consumers in the subsidized
population; modeling this pricing and entry problem of the firm can provide insight into
how firms respond to the federal government’s subsidy program, with consequences for
the total cost of the ACA to the federal government.
