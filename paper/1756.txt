        The Return to Tax Sirrplification: An Econantric Analysis


                                ABSTRACT




     The purpose of this paper is to provide estimates of the probable

saving in the resource cost of complying with the tax law that would

result from simplifying the individual income tax law. These estimates

are based on an econometric analysis of the tax filing behavior in

1982 of a sample of Minnesota taxpayers.

     A simple model of tax compliance behavior based on utility

maximization is first presented in order to suggest the important

determinants of compliance behavior. The empirical model treats

the discrete choices of whether to itemize deductions and whether to

hire professional tax advice, and the choice of how much time and

money to spend, conditional on the discrete choices made.

     Simulations based on the econometric results suggest that

significant resource saving could be expected from eliminating the

system of itemized deductions, although no significant saving from

changing to a single-rate tax structure can be confidently predicted.

1.   Introduction

     ..-S-tudents of tax complexity and simplification have, in their writings,

highlighted the many dimensions of this subject. An important issue to the tax

lawyer is the certainty, or predictability, of the tax law. To the tax collec-

tion agency, complexity in large part relates to the administrative cost of

raising revenue, and in particular to the encouragement that some tax provisions

provide for the use of complicated tax devices designed to avoid tax payments.

For the taxpayer himself, a critical aspect of complexity is the time and

expense involved in completing the tax return, including not only complying with

the filing requirement, but also identifying and documenting the deductions,

credits, and reductions in taxable income to which he is entitled.

     The disadvantages of complexity in the tax system are suggested by these

various aspects of the concept. Unpredictability and the existence of copli—

cated ways to avoid taxes may erode confidence in the fairness of the tax system

and thereby affect voluntary compliance.1 It may also subsidize those taxpayers

who are not averse to interpreting the tax law to their advantage (legally or

illegally), an aspect which to many has an unacceptable distributional implica-

tion. The process of income tax collection under the current system also

involves substantial resource costs. A recent study (Slemrod and Sorurn (1984))

estimated the resäurce cost of income tax filing borne directly by taxpayers in

the United States to be on the order of five to seven percent of revenue

collected. A conservative estimate of total collection costs, which includes

the resources used by the collection agencies and third parties (primarily

employers which participate in the withholding system), is seven to eight per-

cent of total revenue, or about $30 billion annually.

     Clearly, complexity in a tax system has substantial resource costs and
                                      -2-



arguably adverse distributional consequences. This does not, though, imply that

the best tax system is necessarily the simplest one. As Surrey (1969) and

others have argued, a certain amount of complexity is the inevitable result of

the intent to maintain standards of horizontal and vertical equity in an

exceedingly complex economic environment. In addition, the present income tax

system is the vehicle for the subsidization of a vast array of behavior such as

charitable giving, installing energy saving equipment, and homeownership.2 Any

argument to eliminate these tax expenditure aspects on the grounds of simplifi-

cation must come to terms with the reasons, if any, for the subsidization. If

subsidization through the tax system is replaced by a more direct subsidy

program, then the operation of the government as a whole has been simplified

only if the direct method is more cost—efficient than the tax expenditure

method.                    -



     An analysis of any tax simplification proposal ought to consider its advan-

tages, including the savings in the resource cost of compliance, along with the

distributional and efficiency implications of the proposal. Brannori (1979) and

Slemrod (1983) have argued that, in principle at least, the resource costs

(called "complication costs" by Brannon) can be quantified and considered with

the more standardequity and efficiency effects. The principle obstacle to

implementing this framework for analysis has been the dearth of quantitative

information about the resource cost implications of simplification plans.

Although recent work has provided useful estimates of the total resource cost of

the current income tax system, what is more important for policy purposes is the

expected change in the resource cost due to a proposed tax reform. This is the

valuable input for the purpose of analysis, not the current level of resource
                                        -3-



costs.

       The purpose of this paper is to provide estimates of the probable resource

cost savings from some currently popular tax law simplification plans. These

estimates are based on an econometric analysis of the tax filing behavior in

1982 of a sample of Minnesota taxpayers. The study does not consider the likely

impact on the administrative or third—party costs of the simplification plans,

nor its distributional or standard efficiency effects, so it comprises only one

part of a complete analysis of any of the proposed reforms.

      The remainder of the paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2, a simple

theoretical model of tax compliance behavior based on utility maximization is

presented. The model is used to suggest the important determinants of

compliance behavior to be considered in an empirical study,, and what the likely

direction of influence is. Section 3 develops an empirical model that treats

the discrete choices of whether to itemize deductions arid whether to hire pro-

fessional tax advice, and the choice of how much time and money to spend, con-

ditional on the discrete choices made. Section 4 describes the data for the

analysis. In Section 5, the results of the econometric analyses are presented

and discussed. Section 6 utilizes these estimates to simulate the likely impact

of two proposed tax simplification plans, and Section 7 offers some concluding

colTinents.

2. A Simple Theoretical Model of Compliance Behavior

        The goal of this section is to construct a simple model of the taxpaying

household's choices concerning its tax filing behavior. The household must

choose how much of its own time to spend on tax matters and how much, if any,

professional tax advice to purchase.3 It is assumed that both of these activi-

ties uncover legitimate ways to reduce taxable income, and thereby reduce tax

liability. The model thus abstracts from the use of illegal reductions in or

deductions from taxable income. This assumption allows the consumer problem to

be posed as one of complete certainty.4 The decision problem for a represen-

tative household can be stated as


(la)           Maximize         U(C, L+YH)
            I, C, L, H, B

               subject to

(ib)        C = A + wL   -   T(A + wL   - E - R -   (1-I)S   -   I(D + P8B))   -
                                                                                   P8B


where the notation is defined as follows:


A   :    non-labor income
B   :    hours of professional tax assistance purchased
C   :    consumption of composite good
0   :    deductions from taxable income (not including payments for professional
         tax assistance)
E :      exemptions
H :      hours of own time spent on preparing tax return
I   :   dumy variable equal to.one for households that itemize deductions and
         equal to zero otherwise
P8:     price per hour of professional tax assistance
R :      reductions in taxable income
S :      standard deduction
I :      tax function
w :      wage rate
Y :      labor—equivalent of one hour spent on tax compliance


        According to (la), utility is a function of consumption of a composite
                                         -5-



good, labor supply, and hours spent on tax matters. Equation (ib) states that

consumption equals gross income, which consists of exogenously given non-labor

income and labor income, minus taxes paid and payments for professional tax

assistance. Taxable income is gross income minus exemptions, which require no

effort to uncover, reductions intaxable income, and deductions from taxable

income, which equal (1—I)S + I(D+PBB).      Note that if the household chooses not

to itemize deductions (1=0), allowable deductions are simply the standard

deduction amount. When the household itemizes deductions (1=1), it can deduct

D+PBB from taxable income.

     Consider a compliance technology which embodies the relationship between

the tax liability claimed and the, inputs to the processes. We represent this

technology by the R and D functions as follo&s


(2a) R =   (H,B,G,N,c2)

(2b) 0 =   (H,B,G,N,).

They state that both the amount of reductions in taxable income and the amount

of deductions from taxable income depend on the amount of own time spent on

uncovering either, the amount of professional assistance purchased, the type of

tax return the household files (indexed by C) some personal characteristics

(indexed by ) such as age, level of education completed, and attitude toward

tax matters, and the tax law itself (c2).      Time and money spent on uncovering and

documenting deductions are treated distinctly from resources spent on finding

reductions in taxable income because the former activities are worthwhile only

if the household chooses to itemize deductions, while the latter may be

worthwhile to any household whch has a nonzero marignal tax rate. This
                                      -6-




distinction will be Important later when we consider the impact of eliminating

the itemization option. Note that the deductions and reductions functions are

general enough to allow for the possibility that time and money devoted to one

pursuit may have an indirect effect on the other.

     One crucial assumption implicit in this formulation is that the elements of

the G vector are not subject to household choice. The impact of this assumption

is that the compliance technology and tax code do not affect the type of income

earned (employed versus self—employed, income from real estate, partnerships,

for example) nor do they affect the activities that cause potential deductions,

such as purchasing medical services, making charitable contributions, borrowing

money, and so on.

     The household is faced with a jotnt decision problem. It must make a

discrete choice between itemizing deductions or not. —   Conditional   on that

choice, it must decide how much labor to supply and how much to expend on

compliance, including its own time and payments for professional tax preparers.

     The household will choose whichever itemization status yields the higher

level of utility. Without considering compliance costs this decision involves a

comparison of S and D+P88, where D+PBB is to be interpreted as the amount of

available deducti6ns. If D+PBB exceeds the standard deduction, S, then the

household would itemize deductions. However, in the presence of compliance

costs the choice is more complicated because it is no longer costless to uncover

and document the deductions. The preferred choice will depend on the house-

hold's utility function, its endowment (including the level of tax exemptions),

and its individual and tax return characteristics which affect the compliance

technologies.

     The first—order conditions of the Kuhn-Tucker optimization problem for the

 conditional choice of H, B, assuming that the choice of L is interior, are



 (3a) t(RH+IDH) - Yw(1-t) < 0          0 if H > 0


 (3b) t(RB+IDB) — (1—It)P5 < 0       = 0 if B > 0




where t stands for the marginal tax rate and first partial derivatives are

denoted in the usual way. Note that the value of     I enters the first—order

conditions in two separate ways. First, the marginal benefit of uncovering

deductions can be positive only if    I   is one. In addition, the after—tax cost

of professional tax'advice depends on the itemization decision because these

expenses are deductible from taxable income.

     Differentiation of (3a)—(3b) allows us to investigate the effect on

compliance bePtavior of changes in the marginal tax rate, the net wage rate, and

the itemization status when both H and B are positive. Unfortunately, even in

this simple model, few unambiguous statements can be made about the sign of

these relationships. It is, though, worthwhile to briefly look at the implica-

tions of the theoretical model. The detailed calculations are presented in an

appendix to this paper.

     An increase in the marginal tax rate directly increases the payoff from

reducing taxable income by a dollar. For itemizers, it also decreases the cost

of professional tax assistance. The theory implies that both H and B will

necessarily increase only if H and B are complementary inputs in both

compliance technologies. Otherwise it is conceivable that an increase in        t

will induce a change in technique so that either H or B     ,   but   not both, will
                                           -8-




increase.

      An increase in the after—tax wage rate, holding t constant, increases the

opportunity cost of own time spent on tax matters. This leads to an unnbiguous

decline in H , but the effect on B is not determinate. For non-itemizers, B

will decline if it is complementary with H in the taxable income reduction

technology, and increase otherwise. For itemizers, the response of B depends

or' its complementarity with H in both the TMdeduction" and 0reduction" tech-

nologies.

      Itemization status is not a continuous variable and thus its impact is not

as accessible using the calculus. However, inspection of the partial effect of

a small increase in      I   is revealing. The effect is similar to that of an

increase in the marginal tax rate. First of all, the payoff to uncovering

deductions (but not_reductions) from taxable income increases in proportion to

the marignal tax rate. Second, the cost of professional tax assistance

declines, again in proportion to the marginal tax rate. The impact of a change

in   I on H and B depends, as in the case of the marginal tax rate, on

whether H and B are complementary inputs. If they are, then an increase in

I    will increase both H and B .        If   they are not, it is conceivable that

either H or B           but not both, could decline.

      As we will see later, for many observations, B equals zero and (3b) does not

hold as an equality. In this case differentiation of (3a) alone reveals that,

as long as own   time   spent is subject to locally diminishing returns, an increase

in the marginal tax rate will increase I-I, an increase in wO.t will decrease H,

and a small increase in I will cause H t increase,

3. Estimation Strategy

     For each household in the sample, we observe whether deductions were item-

ized (I), H, B,   and the values of several exogenous variables which, we

hypothesize, affect tax compliance behavior either by entering the tax

compliance technology or affecting tastes for tax related work. We observe

that, although virtually no households report that zero time was spent filing

tax returns, a significant fraction report no expenditures on tax assistance.

Our goal is to use these data to estimate the determinants of tax filing

behavior, including the discrete choices of whether to itemize deductions and

whether to purchase tax advice, and the determinants of the expenditure of time

and money, conditional on the outcome of the two discrete choices.

     We consider .two distinct estimation approaches. The first approach is to

estimate reduced form equations for H and B using ordinary least—squares.

We include all exogenous variables as regressors plus a dumy variable for

itemization status, and, in a alternative version, also an interactive dumy

variable. This model has the advantage of transparency and direct interpret-

ability. At the same time, it ignores the statistical problems that arise

because of the endogeneity of the itemization decision and the existence of a

significant fractfn of households that do not hire any professional tax assist-

ance. This first problem is especially significant because one of the goals of

this research is to investigate the effect of eliminating the option of

itemizing deductions.

     The second estimation approach is decidedly more ambitious. We proceed by

constructing a general linear model that can accomodate all of the important

aspects of the theoretical model and data structure. The model has three parts.
                                                -10-




In the first part, we introduce an unobservable variable 1* , which is a

measure (of arbitrary scale) of the difference between the maximum utility

attainable in the event the taxpayer itemizes deductions and the maximum utility

attainable if deductions are not itemized; that is,


(4)                 k[V1(11z1) — V1(11z0)J


where k        is an arbitrary constant. We posit that 11* is a linear function of

the exogenous variables of the system,            Zj ,      and append an additive error term,

        which encompasses both optimization error and unobservable variables which

affect              '   such as intelligence and unknown characteristics of the taxpayer's

tax situation, so that


(5) I= "Zi +
         Ij   = 1       iff I >0
              = 0 1ff          < 0.



We make the standard assumption that Cj                is   distributed as a standard normal

variable. Equation (5) indicates that, although 11* is unobserved, the

itemization decision is observed, so that we know whether 11* is positive or

no t.


        The second part of the system models the decision of whether to purchase

professional tax advice, conditional on the itemization status chosen. As with

the itemization decision, it is posited that there is a latent variable (called

either J*1j or J*Ni for itemizers and non—itemizers, respectively) which

represents the propensity to pay for professional advice (or, more formally, the

difference between attainable utility if advice is contracted for and attainable
                                                  —11—




utility if it is not hired). The unobserved variable is presumed to be a linear

function of the exogenous variables of the system, and also contains an error

term which encompasses both optimization error and the influence of unobservable.

variables.




(6a)     J*Ii =   6IZj   +
                                                           iiN(O,1)
        J1j = 1     f            > 0

        Jii = 0     if           < 0




(Bb)    J*Ni = N'Zi +                                           N(0,1)
             = 1 if J > 0
 *

        Ni =0 if J*i<O
The error terms j         ,         , and     VNI will, in general, be correlated.

       The third part of the system models the choice of H and B             ,   conditional
on the outcome of the two discrete choices. A linear representation of the

first—order conditions (3a) and (3b) is

Itemizing Regime (I = 1)


(7a) H = I0Bi +                      +


(7b)    B1 = j0H +                   + UBIj

Not Itemizing Regime          (I.j = 0)


                             + UHNj
(7c)    H1 = aNOBI + a1N1XHI


(7d) B = N0Hi + 'N1XB1               + UBNj
                                         -12-



Here XH and XB refer to the vectors of exogenous variables in the H and B

equations, respectively. The error terms in equations (7a)—(7d) may be corre-

lated with the error terms in (5), (6a), and (6b). Note that when J1j is zero

(no professional assistance hired), (7b) is irrelevant and (7a) collapses to


(7a') H 'I1XHi + UHIj

Similarly,   when J is zero, (7d) is irrelevant and (7c) reduces to


(7c') H = 'N1XHi +     UHNI


     It is worth noting that the system outlined here is more general than a

"Tobit" type system in which one structural equation determines both the proba-

bility that a household pays for professional assistance and the amount spent,

conditional on spending any positive amount. In this more general structure,

the two decisions are allowed to respond differently to exogenous variables.

This differentiation is appropriate if, for exam7le, there are fixed costs

involved in purchasing professional tax advice. The existence of fixed costs is

in fact reasonable, as the preparer must become familiar with the return before

the return can be completed. 'For complicated and idiosyncratic returns with

large fixed costs associated with preparation, it is plausible that a taxpayer

may be unlikely to hire professional advice but, if any assistance is purchased,

a substantial amount will be required.

     It is well known that direct estimation of (7a)—(7d) by ordinary least

squares will yield biased coefficient estimates because the expected value of

the error term, conditional on the household being observed in a particular

itemization and professional assistance regime, is generally nonzero and corre-
                                           —13—



lated with the explanatory variables. Our strategy in this event is to utilize

a two—stage estimation procedure. The first stage is to estimate the bivariate

discrete choice model outlined above of whether to itemize deductions and

whether to hire professional tax assistance, conditional on the itemization

decision. In the second stage, the estimates of the discrete choice model are

utilized to control for the self—selection biases in the estimation of the

simultaneous system of (7a)-(7d).

      The first stage of the estimation begins with our stated assumptions that

both cj and "Ii and also c and "Ni have a joint normal distribution, and that

each term has unit variance. Next we divide the observations into four regimes

as follows:


(8)           :
                  *
                  I > 0 ,     J*
                              *
                                   > 0       (itemize, hire assistance)

         R2   :   I.j > 0 ,   J11 < 0        (itemize, don't hire assistance)
                  *           *
         R3   :   I < 0 , N1 > 0             (don't itemize, hire assistance)
                  *           *
         R4   :   I.j < 0 ,   JNI < 0        (don't itemize, don't hire assistance)


If we denote the bivariate distribution function of c and         v   as fj(•, ,   j)   and

the joint density of c and "N as N(•, •,

        As mentioned above, the results of the first—stage estimation are to be

used in the estimation of the parameters of (7a)-(7d). To see how this works,

we first write the reduced forms of these equations as


Regime 1      (I = 1,      J1j =    1)


(lOa) H = kE(11 +          1011)X        +

         The problem with estimating (lOa)—(lOf) by ordinary least squares is that

the error terms are not necessarily uncorrelated with the explanatory variables,

given the self—selection rules. For example,


                                   =        Jij = 1)
(11)                    E(H1           1,               k(I1 +


but, rather,


(12)                    E(H1 (Ii = 1,       J1 = 1)     k(1j +         aIO8Ii)x   +   kE(uj Iii = 1, Jij = 1)
Fortunately, the estiitrtes obtained from the bivariate probit model allow us to

form     a consistent             estimator of E(uj1 J           I.   =   1, J11 = 1) and of the other error
terms in (lOb)—(lOf), conditional on regime. For example, it can be shown that


(13)                            I. =   1, J1. = 1) =
              E(u11

where           corr(cj, uIj), and       corr(v1j, uii). In (13),         is the

standard deviation of uIj, and f and F refer to the density and cumulative den-

sity functions, respectively, of standard normal distributions. When there is

one argument in the cumulative density function, it refers to a univari ate

distribution, and when there are three arguments, it refers to a bivariate

distribution. Similar expressions analogous to (13) that correspond to the

expected value of the error terms in equations (lOb)-(lOf) can be derived. Note

that the terms in the square brackets are E(c1      Ij = 1, J1 z 1) and

        I
            I   1, J11 = 1), respectively.

        The bivariate probit estimation procedure provides consistent estimates of

',   , s, , and         N• Thus, in order to estimate the parameters of (lOa), fqr

example, an ordinary least-squares procedure for the observations in regime 1

would include as explanatory variables not only the union of XH and X8, but in

addition would include the two terms in square brackets. Lee, Maddala, and

Trost (1980) have shown, in a similar model, that the estimates of the parame-

ters of (lOa) so obtained areconsistent, though the estimated standard errors

from the ordinary least-squares equations will underestimate the true standard

errors, as their calculation ignores the fact that y',    6j, and   i are themselves

estimated.5

4. Data

     The data for this study are drawn from a mail survey of Minnesota house-

holds' tax filing behavior. Inmediately after the deadline for filing 1982 tax

returns (April 15, 1983), a four-page questionnaire was mailed to a random

sample of 2,000 Minnesota residents. The response rate of the survey was 32.65

percent. Of the 653 questionnaires returned, 41 were from people not required

to file 1982 state or federal tax returns. Thirty—eight questionniares were

eliminated from the sample because of incompleteness, leaving a total of 574

usable responses. A detailed description of the data and survey procedures is

presented in Slemrod and Sorum (1984).

     The questionnaire's first section asks for some demographic information, in

particular the respondent's sex, age, level of education completed, income,

employment status, occupation, and wage rate or reservation wage. In assessing

this information, it is important to realize that the cover letter pointedly

asks that the addressee refer the questionnaire to the TMperson in [the] house-

hold most familiar with filing [theJ income tax returns." Thus the distribution

of demographic characteristics should not be expected to precisely replicate the

population distribution of cfraracteristics. In particular, answers to questions

about sex and educ-ation would be expected to be biased if, as the data indicate,

males tend to be more familiar with the returns or, as is likely, the more edu-

cated household member is more familiar with the filing process.

     The next section of the questionnaire solicits information about the house—

hold's income tax return itself. The taxpayer is asked which, if any, of the

three federal tax returns and which, if either, of the two Minnesota state tax

forms was filed. In addition, responses are sought concerning whether the
                                           -18-




return featured itemized deductions, whether it was a joint return, and which of

several sources of income were received.

        The remainder of the questionnaire is devoted to collecting information

about the household's cost of filing tax returns. This section asks how many

hours were spent during the year, and a breakdown of the hours into various

categories. In addition, any money spent on tax assistance or otherwise spent

in filing returns is solicited. A question on the individual's attitude toward

filing returns is included, as is a question designed to elicit a dollar figure

for hte value of all time, effort, and money spent on tax affairs. Finally, the

taxpayer was asked whether he or she had ever chosen not to undertake some busi-

ness activity because of the hassle or expense of complying with tax laws.

        A subset of the information collected in the survey is used in this study.

The precise definition of the variables considered is as follows:

Endogenous Van ables

H:          total hours spent on tax matters

B:          total dollar expenditure on professional tax assistance

Exogenous Variables

AGE:        age of respondent

AGESQ:      age squared

EDU:        years of education completed

MAR:        dumy variable equal to one if respondent is married; equal to
            zero otherwise
                                                                                 -




EASY:       dumy variable equal to one if tax return did not contain any
            dividends, interest, self-employed business income, capital gains,
            rental income, pension, annuity, or other income; equal to zero
            otherwise

INT:        dumy variable for presence of interest income
                                             -19-



DIV:        duimy variable for presence of dividend income
              N      N             "
SEBUS:                                  " self—employed business income
              U                    "

                                              rental income
                            "
PENANN:                                 " pension or annuity income
                                   II
OTHER:               SI     SI          IS
                                               "other"   income

TIMEVAL: value of time (per hour), measured as after-tax wage rate or
         reservation wage

TAX:       marginal tax rate applicable to deductible expenses, expresed as a
           fraction

        The interpretation of most of these variables is clear; some, though, merit

further conlnent. Responses to the age and education question were in ranges.

Each taxpayer was assigned the midpoint of the indicated range. Those indi-

cating "over 65" were assigned an age of 70 and those indicating_graduate—level

education were assigned eighteen years. The marginal tax rate was calculated

from information about income reported by the taxpayer. The calculation takes

into account both the federal and state income tax and the possible deduc-

tibility of one tax in the calculation of taxable income for the other level of

government. Because a usable wage rate was not supplied on 46 percent of the

returned questionnaires, a wage equation was estimated for those who did   supply
a usable answer and used to impute a wage rate for those who did not.6 The exo-

genous variables in this equation were the income level, employment status,

occupation, age, level of education completed, marital status, and sex. The

marginal tax rate applied to the gross wage is the same as that described above

plus the social security tax.

       All of the exogenous variables listed above are included in the vectors

z   and     H• The vector B includes all of the above except TIMEVAL.


5. Results

          The results of the ordinary least-squares estimations are presented in

Table 1.       Two separate reduced—form equations were estimated for both own time

spent and for professional assistance purchased. One version (denoted A) inclu-

des all the exogenous variables plus a dumy variable for itemization status

(ITEM).       The second version (denoted B) includes all these variables plus an

interactive durriny term which is equal to the product of TAX and ITEM, called

TAXITEM         This particular interactive term is included because of the fact

that, for itemizers only, the tax rate affects not only the return to reducing

taxable income be one dollar but also directly aff'ects the effective price of

professional assistance.

      The results shown in Table 1 indicate that age has a U—shaped relationship

with both time and money spent, reaching its minimum point at the age of thirty—

five for time spent and thirty-two for money spent. Thus for most of the range

of ages, compliance cost increases with age. More educated taxpayers tend,

ceteris paribus, to spend more of their own time on tax matters and less money

for assistance. This finding is consistent with the hypothesis that more edu-

cated taxpayers are also more productive at tax matters than less educated

taxpayers. The same pattern, applies to married households: they spend more

time and less money than households not headed by a married couple. For the

most part, the results indicate that households with more complicated returns

(as measured by the presence of various sources of income) spend more time and

money on tax matters.7 Particularly strong associations exist between

compliance cost and the presence of self-employed business income and capital

gains or losses. Households with both sources of income spend approximately

thrity-two more hours and sixty—five more dollars than households with neither

source of income. The value of time variable is estimated to have a significant

positive association with monetary expense and a positive but not significant

affect on own hours spent. The theory would suggest that a high value of time

should induce substitution away from own time toward professional advice. The

fact that time spent is positively correlated with the after-tax wage rate may

be due to the fact that it is a better measure of competency in tax matters than

educational attainment, so that higher wage rate people have both a higher opor-

tunity cost of time and a higher return to investing their time working on their

tax return.

     In both Version A and B of the model, the estimated effect of the marginal

tax rate on hours spent is rather small and not statistically significant. On

the other hand, the regression equations do pick up a strong positive rela-

tionship between the tax rate and the amount of professional assistance

purchased. This is apparent in Version A, where an increase in the tax rate of

0.1 is associated with $16 moi-e dollars spent. In Version B, this association

is shown to be present only for itemizers, but is very large ($21 more with an

increase of 0.1) and significant for that group.

     Finally, we note that, in Version A, the dumy variable for itemization is

positive and at least marginally significant. The magnitude of the implied

effect is large. Itemizers are estimated to spend 8.8 more hours on tax matters

and 24.3 more dollars. In Version B, the estimated impact of itemization

depends on the marginal tax rate. For a tax rate of 0.3, the estimated impact
is approximately the same as in Version A.

     Table 2 contains the results of estimating the more general model outlined

in detail in Section 3.   In the first three columns are the results of esti-

mating the bivariate probit model of the choices of whether to itemize and

whether to hire professional assistance. The results of within-regime, ordinary

least—squares estimates with sample selection bias correction terms are pre-

sented in the last six columns.

     Because of the multitude of coefficient estimates presented in Table 2, a

comprehensive discussion of all the results is infeasible. Instead we will

focus on the interesting relationships uncovered in the OLS estimations of Table

1, in order to compare the results obtained from the more TMcorrect" specifica-

tion of the empirical model.

     The OLS estimates revealed an association between more complicated returns

and higher compliance costs. This was manifested by the negative coefficients

on EASY and the positive, large in magnitude, and statistically significant co-

efficients on SEBUS and CAPGL. The estimates of Table 2 indicate that the pre-

sence of a very simple return (EASY1) has a significant negative association

with the probability of hirin professional help for itemizers and, for itemi-

zers who pay for help, a significant negative association with the amount of own

time spent on tax filing. The other relationships are not statistically signi-

ficant. Having self—employment income (SEBUS=1) is positively associated with

hiring professional help for itemizers and has a strong positive effect on own

time spent for itemizers who pay for help and on the amount of professional

assistance purchased for all who purchase any help at all. Having capital gains

or losses (CAPGL1) has a statistically significant relationship only with the

amount of professional assis...tance purchased by itemizers.

     The OLS regressions of Table 1 also suggested that the value of time had a

positive association with both H and B, though the estimated coefficients on H

were (just barely) statistically insignificant. The results in Table 2 indicate

that while TIMEVAL does not significantly affect the probability of purchasing

assistance, it is strongly positively associated with the amount purchased for

itemizers and positively, but not significantly, related to the amount purchased

for non—itemizers. The effect of TIMEVAL on own time spent is mixed. A higher

value of TIMEVAL increases the likelihood of being an itemizer, which is asso-

ciated with higher H. Given the regime, TIMEVAL has an insignificant positive

association with H, except for the non-itemizing, zero B, households for whom

there is a s.jgnificant negative relationship.

     According to the OLS analysis, the marginal tax rate had no significant

association on own time spent but had a large and significant positive asso-

ciation with the amount of professional assistance purchased, especially for

itemizing households. The more correct empirical model allows us to decompose

these effects.

     Evidently, the marginal tax rate has a clear association with the two

discrete decisions of whether to itemize and whether to purchase professional

assistance, but has a much less clear association wiht the choice of H and B for

given regimes. In particular, a higher marginal tax rate increases the likeli-

hood of itemizing, and increases the likelihood of purchasing professional

assistance, though for itemizers only. The other statistically significant

coefficient estimate is that, for itemizers, the amount of professional

assistance purchased is positively associated with the marginal tax rate.

    At the bottom of Table 2 we report the coefficients of the two selectivity

variables for each equation. In each case the first listed selectivity

variables is the expected value of the error term in the itemization probit

equation (tj), conditional on the regime chosen. The second listed selectivity

variable is the expected value of the error term in the professional assistance

probit equation (V1j for itemizers, and Nj for non—itemizers), conditional on

the regime chosen. The estimated coefficients on the selectivity variables are

significantly different from zero only in the H equation for households in

Regime 4 (non—itemizing, not paying for professional assistance). The negative

signs of the estimated coefficients indicate that there will be a tendency to

underestimate H when either the probability of itemization or the probability of

payirtg for professional assistance is overestimated.

     The interpretation of the coefficients of each of the two selectivity

variables is the estimated covariance between the error in the two relevant pro—

bit equations and the error in the OLS equation. The inner product of the two

coefficient estimates and the expected value of the error terms is the estimate

of the expected unobservable component. For each of the six equations, this

value is very large in absolute value compared to the observed mean of the

dependent variable. This implies that the unobservable component of tax filing

behavior, for both time and money spent, is very large compared to the component

explained by the independent variables. In several cases these coefficients

imply implausible predicted behavior of a taxpayer in a regime other than the

one in which he is actually observed.

     The large standard errors of the coefficients of the sample selection bias

correction terms suggest that these implausible predictions are due to the
                                      -29-




multicollinearity of the estimate of the unobserved component of the choice of

regime decision and the determinants of the conditional continuous choice of H

and B. Remember that the same set of exogenous variables explain both the

choice of regime and the compliance behavior conditional on regime. That the

two relationships may be identified is entirely due to the non-linear rela-

tionship of the sample selection bias correction terms with the explanatory

variables. The essence of this phenomenom is that the estimation technique is

unable to precisely distinguish between the effect of the unobservable influen-

ces that determine the choice of regime and the effect of the explanatory

variables that affect behavior within a regime.

     In order to further investigate this issue, several alternative estimation

strategies were pursued. First, observations with extreme outlying dependent

variables were omitted. Because the technique depends critically on the nor-

mality assumptions made about the error terms, extreme observations whose pre-

sence strains the plausibility of this distributional assumption might unduly

influence the results. Experimentation with deletion of outliers revealed that,

as expected, many of the results were quite sensitive to this procedure.

However, even with the deletion of five percent of the observations, the

existence of some implausible predicted behavior upon change of regime did not

disappear.

     Another strategy we pursued was to impose certain restrictions on the very

general structure outlined in Section 3. The first one we considered was to

constrain the error covariances to be equal for all four H equations and to be

equal for both B equations. The reasoning underlying this constraint is that

the unobservable factor represents a taxpayer characteristic which will have the
                                      -30-



same effect on how much assistance is purchased regardless of itemization status

and will also have the same effect on time spent regardless of itemization

status or whether professional assistance is purchased. The second set of

restrictions we considered served to constrain the coefficients on the explana-

tory variables, or a subset of the coefficients, to be identical across regimes.

     None of these constraints altered our finding that the estimate unobervable

component dominates the observable component in a seeming1y capricious way.

This failure leads us back to the presence of multicollinearity and forces us

to conclude that there are insufficient obervations to enable us to distinguish

the unobservable determinants of choice of regime and the conditional effect of

the explanatory variables. Of course, this problem could undoubtedly be alle-

viated by arbitrarily altering the set of explanatory variables in the probit

and OLS equations. This procedure was, however, not accepted because of the

lack of any theoretical justification for differentiating between the two sets

of explanatory variables.

     One simple way to further investigate the effect of including the sample

selection bias terms is to estimate the six OLS equations without these terms.

These estimates are presented in Table 3. Comparing the results to those of

Table 2, one notes that the pattern of coefficient estimates is broadly similar.

The demographic variables do not exhibit a strong or consistent effect on tax

compliance behavior. The presence of self—employment income has, for the most

part, a statistically significant positive effect on hours spent and especially

on the amount of professional assistance purchased. As in Table 2, the value of

time has a significant positive effect on professional assistance purchased for

itemizers, and an insignificant effect otherwise. The tax rate has a signifi-

cant positive association with professional assistance purchased, for itemizers,

and with time spent, for non-itemizers. Remember that in the results with

sample selection bias correction terms, the estimated effect of the tax rate on

time spent in Regime 4 was negative and insignificant.

     There are two major areas of divergence between the results of Table 2 and

3. The first area is the constant terms, which are very different. This

reflects the phenomenon discussed above that the estimation technique of Table 2

indicates that there are very large unobservable effects on behavior, which are

offset by the effects of the observed independent variables, including the fixed

effect, or constant term. The second major area of divergence is the regression

explaining time spent by non—itemizers, non—payers for professional assistance

(Regime 4). When the sample selection bias correction terms are included,

several of the coefficients have an unexpected sign, such as EASY, SEBUS,

CAPGL, RENT, and TAX. In addition, some of the point estimates are implausibly

large in absolute value (RENT and PENANN). For the most part, these problems do

not arise in Table 3 when the sample selection bias correction terms are

deleted. (On the other hand the estimates of Table 3 are, of course, subject to

sample selection bias.) Our interpretation of this change is that the colli—

nearity of the correction terms with the set of other exogenous variables made

distinguishing the impact of the individual variables impossible on the basis of

the small sample size that is available.

     What conclusions can be drawn from the regression results presented in

Tables 1, 2, and 3? Although the results from the different estimation

approaches are not in all cases consistent, some clear findings do emerge.

First, the presence of certain sources of income causes greater expenditure of
                                       -33-




time and money on tax compliance. This is especially true for self-employment

income, and is also observed for capital gains income. A higher value of time,

which we expect to be associated with a substitution away from own time to the

use of professional assistance, is positively associated with the use of pro-

fessional assistance in the simple OLS equations of Table 1, but when the regi-

mes are separated, this effect is found to be significant and large only for

itemizers. The estimated effect of the marginal tax rate on compliance behavior

is somewhat mixed. None of the techniques indicate a significant positive asso-

ciation between the tax rate and the amount of one's own time spent on tax

matters.8    The regressions do reveal, though, a positive association between

the marginal tax rate and the expenditure on professional tax assistance. The

probit estimates imply that, at least for itemizers, a higher tax rate

increases the likelihood of purchasing assistance. Furthermore, for itemizers

who do purchase assistance, the amount of assistance purchased does have a

significant and large association with the marginal tax rate.


6. Simulation of the Effect of Tax Simplification Proposals

     In this section we use he results of the previous section to simulate the

likely impact on compliance costs of changes in the tax law aimed at simplifying

the filing process. In particular, we consider two law changes that have

recently attracted some policy interest. The first policy eliminates the system

of itemized deductions, to be replaced by a standard deduction for all tax-

payers.9    The second policy is a "flat-rate" income tax system which combines

the elimination of itemized deductions, as in the first policy, with the further

institution of a constant marginal tax rate for all taxpayers.'°

    Before discussing the simulation results, one important caveat must be men—
                                      -34-




tioned. The sample population does not precisely represent the U.S. taxpaying

population in a number of dimensions. For example, the sample population has a

greater concentration of higher income households than the population as a whole

and the proportion of households who itemize their deductions is substantially

higher in the sample than in the U.S. If the rule that governs whether a given

household makes it into our sample (which undoubtedly depends on the household's

propensity to reply to a written questionnaire not unlike a tax form) is corre-

lated with the dependent variable, then the parameter estimates may be biased.

For the purpose of simulation, the fact that the sample population overrepre-

sents itemizers implies that the impact of eliminating the itemization option is

likely to be overestimated. Thus, in the computation of the figures that

follow, the sample was weighted so that proportion of itemizers is equal to the

U.S. proportion in 1982, 35.1 percent, and_so that the distribution of income

represents the income distribution of the U.S. taxpaying population.

     For each of two policy changes, simulations using three different sets of

estimates will be calculated. The first two simulations are based on Versions A

and B of the OLS regressions of Table 1. The third simulation for each policy

change is based on the bivariate probit estimates presented in Table 2 (The

probit estimates are used to predict whether current itemizers will buy pro-

fessional assistance when itemizing is not an option and to predict how changes

in the tax rate and the after—tax wage rate will affect the likelihood of buying

professional assistance.), and the OLS estimates by regime presented in Table 3.

     The OLS estimates have the disadvantage of not being corrected for sample

selection bias, and have the advantage of avoiding the implausible predictions

of behavior of taxpayers who change regimes.
                                        -35-




     The simulated impact of eliminating itemized deductions is presented in the

top half of Table 4. For the OLS models of Table 1, this simulation simply

entails setting ITEM (and, in Version B, TAXITEM) to zero for all taxpayers.

For the third model, it entails predicting the behavior of current itemizers as

a weighted average of their predicted behavior according to the estimated struc-

ture of Regimes 3 and 4, the weights being the probability of paying for pro-

fessional help, conditional on being a non—itemizer.

     All three empirical models predict that eliminating the system of itemized

deductions will be accompanied by a substantial reduction in expenditures on

professional assistance, ranging from 39 percent according to model 18 to as low

as 28 percent according to model B. Note also that the percentage of taxpayers

that use professional assistance is predicted to decline by 12.6 percentage

points. The models have different predictions about the impact on taxpayer time

spent. While the OLS models of Table 1 predict a decline of per taxpayer hours

of slightly more than three, the regime by regime estimates with endogenous

regime selection predict a slight increase of 0.5 hours per taxpayer. All three

models predict that the total resource cost of compliance, which is calculated

by valuing time at the after-tax wage rate, declines, although the decline is

between fifteen and twenty percent for models 1A and B, but only slightly more

than one percent for model 3.   Not itemizing deductions would apparently save

some hours of record—keeping and also eliminate the primary reason that many

people seek professional help. A more important effect, though, is that it

increases the net price of professional tax assistance from (1—t)P8 to P8 for

former itemizers. For taxpayers in the 50 percent bracket, this amounts to a

doubling of the price per unit of professional tax assistance. Because current

itemizers account for 64 percent of payments for assistance in the weighted

sample, the substantial increase in price that accompanies the elimination of

itemization apparently would have a large aggregate impact.

     The second policy that we investigate changes the rate structure of income

taxes from the present graduated one to one with a constant marginal tax rate of

0.20. The state tax system is assumed to be unchanged. A change in the tax

rate has direct effects on the probability of purchasing professional

assistance, and on the time and money spent on tax compliance, conditional on

the regime chosen. A change in the tax rate also has indirect effects on these

decisions because it changes the after-tax wage rate, the value of time. Note

also that the switch to this flat rate tax schedule d1oes not reduce everyone's

marginal tax rate. On the contrary, many low—income individuals.would

experience an increase in their marginal tax rate.              -              -

     The simulations indicate that, although the flat—rate, no itemizing, tax

system would entail less resource cost than the current system, the flat—rate

tax schedule does not by iteseif reduce the aggregate cost of compliance by very

much, if at all. Models la and lb predict a small increase in both aggregate

hours spent and professional assistance purchased if the tax schedule is flat-

tened. Model 3 predicts a small decline in both time and money spent when the

rate schedule is changed. Compared to the policy of only eliminating itemiza-

tion, the change in the resource cost of compliance is estimated at between a 2%

saving and a 6% additional cost.

     There is one potentially significant reason that these results may under-

estimate the resource savings to be derived from a change to a flat-tax rate

schedule. It is that the analysis assumes that the taxpayer's sources of income
                                     -38-




do not change when the marginal tax rate changes. To the extent that the

current rate structure induces individuals to engage in income earning activi-

ties which require a relatively high cost of compliance, the estimates presented

here will underestimate the resource savings.


7. Conclusions

    Microeconornic data of the kind analyzed in this paper are potentially a

rich source of information about tax compliance behavior. Our analysis of tax

simplification suggests that significant resource savings can be expected from

eliminating the system of itemized deductions, although no saving from changing

to a single-rate tax structure can be confidently predicted.

     As our introductory remarks emphasized, Information about the likely

resource savings of a particular tax simplification scheme is properly seen as

one input of many that should be considered by policy-rnakes. The allocational

and distributional impact of the changes must be weighed as well. It is hoped

that this research can begin the task of enriching the debate about tax

simplification by bringing to bear quantitative evidence on its benefits and

costs.

of the first-order conditions, (3a) and (3b) of the text. To do so we form

the total differentials of (3a) and (3b), allowing H, B, t, w1 (the after-tax

wage rate), and I to change. This procedure yields



(A-i) t[RHHdH+RHBdB+I(DHHdH+DHBdB) +                      + (RH+IDH)dt     -
                                                                               dwN   = o



(A-2) tCRBHdH+RBBdB+I(DBHdH+DBBdB)+oBdIJ +                             +                   0
                                                          (RB+IDB)dt       (Idt+tdl)PB

        Manipulation of (A-i) and (A-2) yields


(A-3)         = _(RBB+IDBB)(RH+IDH) +


(A-4)         =                        -
                  (RHB+IDHB)(RH+IDH)           (RHH+IDHH)(RB+IDB+IPB)/

where , = t[(RHH+IDHH)(RBB+IDBB)           -
                                                (RBH+IDBH)2]

Both (A-3) and (A—4) are positive as long as all the own second derivatives are

negative and all the cross second derivatives are positive.

     The response to a chancie in               is



(A-5)        =
                  Y(RBB+IDBB)/L

(A-6) .5. =



Clearly   dH/dwN is negative as long as RBB and DBB <            0, but dB/dwN depends on
the sign and, for itemizers, perhaps the relative macnitude of the cross

derivatives.
        The comparative statics with respect to a small change in I are



(A-7)            =                     +
                     t[_(RBB+IDBB)DH        (RBH+IDBH)(P8+DB)J/


(A-8) .- = t[(RHB+IDHB)DH                  (RHH+IDHH)(PB+oB)]/

        Equations (A-l)-(A-8) are based on the assumption that both (3a) and

(3b) of the text hold as equalities. In many cases, though, B is zero and

(3b) does not hold as an equality. In these cases, the effect of changes in

exogenous variables on H simplify to

     1.   In defense of unpredictability, it is sometimes argued that it ensures

conservative decision—making on tax matters by risk-averse agents. This may be

preferable to the alternative of having explicit rules for every possible

situation (see Roberts, 1979). Stiglitz (1982) and Weiss (1976) have also

argued, on different grounds, that randomness in the tax law may be desirable

under certain circumstances.

     2. The subsidization of homeownership due to the tax—exempt status of the

rental value of owner-occupied dwellings provides an example where the presence

of a tax expenditure is compatible with tax simplicity. Elimination of the sub-

sidy by requirng taxpayers to estimate the imputed rental value would clearly

add to the administrative and compliance costs of the income tax system.

Disallowing the deductibility of mortgage interest payments would not eliminate

the subsidy to homeownership, only the subsidy to debt-financed homeownership.

     3. The model therefore ignores expenses incurred in the process of tax

filing other than hiring professional advice, such as the cost of buying tax

guides or subscribing to news'letters that provide tax—related information.

     4.   In orderto treat illegal tax evasion, the consumer problem would have

to be modelled as a choice under uncertainty, where the marginal expected uti-

lity from unpunished evasion is balanced against the (negative) marginal

expected utility of detection and the subsequent punishment for evasion. The

seminal paper on this issue is Allingham and Sandmo (1972). Cross and Shaw

(1981, 1982) argue that the problems of legal tax avoidance and illecal tax

evasion ought, from both a theoretical and policy perspective, to be treated

simultaneously
     5. Although estimates of the coefficients of the reduced-form equations

(lOa)—(lOf) are sufficient for the purpose of making predictions about the

effect of various policy changes, it is interesting to inquire whether the coef-

ficients of the equations (7a)—(7d) can be identified. (Equations (7a)-(7d) are

not truly structural because they contain elements of both the utility function

and the compliance technologies.) In fact, this structure of the model is such

that they in fact can all be identified (Sickles and Schmidt, 1978).

     To see this, we first consider equations (lOa)-(lOc). Note that the ordi-

nary least-squares estimation of (lOc) yields a consistent estimate of the vec-

vector a3. Note further that, for any element of




      1:         k(     +
                            all   :   +
                                          k(a11
                                                  +
                                                      ii)
But the bracketed terms in the above expression are equal to the coefficients of

X,   in (lOb) and (lOa), respectively. Thus, the estimate of an element of a11

in addition to the reduced-form estimates of (lOa) and (lOb) enable us to iden-

tify aj. So in this model the parameters of the H equations, (7a) and (7c),

are identified without the usual exclusion restrictions. In fact, a is over-

identified, since each of the elements of a and        provides an estimate of

aj

      Identification of the parameters of the B equations does, however, require

the usual restrictions. Fortunately, there is a natural exclusion restriction

because the after-tax wage rate does not affect B, given H; it does, though,

affect H, given B.
     6. There is a substantial literature, based on the theory of labor supply,

concerned with imputing wage rates to nonworking women based on their charac-

teristics and the wage rate and characteristics of working women. However,

direct application of that methodology to the problem at hand seems

inappropriate because there is no clear distinction between those for whom a

wage rate is available and those for whom it is not available. (Examples of

unusable replies to the wage rate question are "time—and—a—half," "retired," or

"variab1e. Others left the answer space blank.) Thus it is invalid to claim

that the reservation wage of those with no wage rate available (because they

are not working) must be greater than the wage rate that could be earned.

     7. In interpreting the coefficients on the sources of income variables, it

is important to bear in mind that EASY takes on a value of one only when none of

the sources of income is present. Thus, for example, the estimated irTact of

having dividends, compared to having no non—wage income, is found by subtracting

the coefficient on EASY from the coefficient on DIV.

     8. The notable exception is the significantly positive estimated

coefficient n TAX in Regime 4 of Table 3.

     9. The standard deductibn may, as it does now, vary depending on certain

taxpayer characteristics. What is important is that the appropriate deduction

is trivially easy to calculate.

    10. The corrrnon federal marginal income tax rate is assumed to be 0.20. The

total marginal tax rate includes the appropriate Minnesota tax, which is assumed

to be unchanged.
