                                          ABSTRACT

Lack of evidence has been the major obstacle to understanding trends and differences in human

welfare over the millennia. This paper explains and applies methods that are obscure to most

academics and essentially unknown to the general public. A millennial perspective is best obtained

from skeletal remains, which depict not only childhood health conditions but also processes of

degeneration that accompany aging and strenuous physical effort. Compiled into an index of health,

data from 23 localities as part of a large collaborative project on the Western Hemisphere reveal

diverse health conditions for the pre-Columbian population. For reasons not yet understood, native

populations moved over time into less healthy ecological environments. The analysis has

implications for understanding environmental determinants of health, the pattern of European

conquest, pre-contact population size, investigating human adaptation to climate change, and

discovering prime movers of very long-term economic growth.

        In his presidential address to the American Historical Association, John

Coatsworth argued that study of change over time in physical or spiritual well-being is

the central unifying concern of history.1 While one may quibble with the generalization,

any reasonable time and motion study would find that historians devote most of their

research efforts to gathering, organizing, interpreting and disseminating information on

human welfare or the quality of life broadly defined.

        Human welfare is conceptually complex and difficult to measure, even in the

present. Accurate measurement of inflation is a case in point. If the consumer price

index overstates the increase in the true cost of living by as little as one percentage point

per year (as many economists have argued), then the cumulative addition to the national

debt from overindexing the federal budget is more than $1 trillion in just 12 years.2 The

error also substantially affects the measurement of poverty and of real median income in

the quarter century after 1973. If this issue about a modest slice of physical well being

cannot be resolved without argument, it is little wonder that debates are intense about the

distant past, when written evidence is thin and surveys collected by government and

private efforts are simply unavailable.

        Under these conditions the less venturesome may throw up their hands and avoid

research areas lacking familiar types of written information, but this approach is

unsatisfactory as a general rule. Sometimes we should face the risks and make the effort

to cross traditional disciplinary boundaries in search of new evidence, especially if it

enlightens opinion on intriguing topics that are meager in customary sources.

        This paper makes such a journey, bringing substantial new evidence to bear on a

literature characterized by an unusually high ratio of debate to factual information:

from the skeletal remains of over 4,000 individuals who lived in North, Central or South

America in the millennia before 1492. Because skeletons are an unfamiliar source to

most social scientists, a methodology section allows the paper to be moderately self

sufficient. A novel procedure for condensing diverse skeletal data into a single measure

of health is also described. The results have implications for understanding of the

environmental determinants of health, the pre-Columbian disease environment, plausible

ranges of pre-contact population size, and the pattern of European conquest.



Background

        Economists have contributed, but archaeologists, physical anthropologists and

historians have published the bulk of the academic research on pre-Columbian America.

Archaeological information such as material artifacts or the number and character of

Native American settlements is often cited by historians, but bioarchaeological evidence

(skeletons that indicate kinds and degrees of biological stress) are essentially unknown in

the historical literature.3

        A thorough explanation for this pattern is beyond the scope of this essay, but

some observations are relevant. Paleopathology, or the study of human health and

disease from skeletal remains is a relatively new field, emerging among specialists only

in the 1950s and 1960s, and has yet to spread more widely in the social sciences. The

technical nature and specific focus of the subject are obstacles to diffusion; as graduate

students, physical anthropologists usually take anatomy and other medical courses, which

are typically beyond the interests or reach of other social scientists. Moreover, physical

anthropologists often think like medical professionals, wanting to discover purely

biological processes that create pathological lesions or to diagnosis ailments of

individuals long dead. They usually lack the training that offers the broad perspective of

social scientists interested in larger environmental processes that shape community

health, much less long-term historical forces that affect the rise or fall of civilizations and

so forth.

        Typically physical anthropologists are poorly equipped or otherwise constrained

to convince historians of the importance and relevance of their evidence. Their research

projects are very labor intensive, involving travel, difficult lodging (sometimes in tents);

many hours of excavation to recover a single burial; plus cleaning, coding and analysis of

skeletons and other artifacts such that study of one, or at most a few, small geographic

sites often occupy an entire career. In short, they not only have little training but also

little time and data with which to think in broad comparative perspective.

        The field is also burdened by its distant past.4 If social scientists are mildly

acquainted with physical anthropology, they often connect it with racism, phrenology or

other forms of discredited pseudo-scientific research. This mental association is decaying

over time as new generations are trained, but memories linger and most social scientists

must be persuaded that the subject is useful. In this regard, there are some parallels with

the challenges faced by anthropometric history in the 1970s, which prospered only after

this new field explained its methodology in intelligible terms and successfully addressed

several historical questions in which there was already an established interest.5

        This essay vastly extends the reach of anthropometric history by expanding the

information base to skeletons, which depict important aspects of well being over the

millennia and embrace human activities from hunter gathers onward to settled

agriculture, the rise of cities, global exploration and colonization, and eventual

industrialization. Skeletons are widely available for study in many parts of the globe, and

unlike heights, they depict health over the life cycle. As a package the skeletal measures

provide age and source-specific detail on biological stress from early childhood through

old age. The remains also exist for women and for children, two groups often excluded

from more familiar historical sources such as tax documents, muster rolls, and wage

records. Skeletons provide a more extensive and complete picture of community health

than available from historical records on stature and is most useful when combined with

data from archaeology, historical documents, climate history, Geographic Information

Systems (GIS) and other sources.

         The results discussed here extend a large collaborative project involving

economists, historians and physical anthropologists, who assembled numerous measures

of skeletal health for individuals who once lived in the Western Hemisphere.6 Sampling

issues inevitably arise in the comparative study of skeletons and there are ambiguities in

interpreting this biological evidence. Confidence in the approach is bolstered, however,

by comparing results with patterns of health that are well established from other sources.



Measures of Biological Stress

         It is useful to begin with a general discussion of skeletal manifestations of stress.7

Unlike dental enamel, bones are living tissues that receive blood and adapt to mechanical

and physiological stress. Habitual physical activity that requires exertion leads to a

readily visible expansion of the related muscle attachments on the skeleton. If the action

is repetitive in a particular direction, the bones adapt to the load by thickening in the

direction of the plane of motion . Hunter-gatherers who walked long distances, for

example, had oval-shaped femurs but these bones were nearly circular among settled

agriculturalists who typically had diverse activity patterns. Similarly, professional

athletes such as tennis players and baseball pitchers develop extensive muscles, tendons

and bones in the shoulders and arms on the side they habitually use.

        Net nutrition has been an effective concept for understanding the environmental

factors that influence human growth. The body is a biological machine that requires fuel

for basal metabolism, to perform work and to combat infection, all of which claim dietary

intake.8 If net nutrition is insufficient, growth slows or ceases, and linear growth of the

skeleton is stunted if the deprivation is chronic and severe. More generally the skeleton

is an incomplete but very useful repository of an individual’s history of biological stress,

as explained in more detail below.

        In principle, anthropologists could use any bone to estimate stature but the femur

is often well preserved and easily measured, and therefore is widely used. Among the

skeletal elements the femur also has the greatest correlation with stature, in part because

it comprises about one quarter of standing height. The classic study estimated the

relationship between the two variables using femur lengths of the deceased whose living

height was known from muster rolls or other sources.9 The equations vary somewhat by

sex (females are a few centimeters shorter than males for a given femur length), and

accurate height estimates require anthropologists to draw upon sexually dimorphic

characteristics of the pelvis and the skull that appear in adolescence. Growth plates

obfuscate the bone lengths of juveniles, and height estimates are correspondingly

problematic until the bony components of the femur fuse late in the teenage years.

        As a group, physical anthropologists collect hundreds of skeletal measures, many

of which are very specialized in nature and some of which reflect rare or unusual forms

of physiological stress.10 In designing a study of community health with a large number

of collaborators, it is important to select general health indicators that are understood and

reported by virtually all physical anthropologists, regardless of specialty. In a large

collaborative study that investigated skeletal health over the past several thousand years,

these included three indictors of health during childhood (stature, linear enamel defects,

and skeletal signs of anemia), two measures of decline among adults (dental decay and

degenerative joint disease), and two that could affect any age group, but which are more

prevalent among older children and adults (skeletal infections and trauma). Stature has

already been discussed as a child health indicator, and the others are briefly explained

below.11

        Enamel hypoplasias (linear enamel defects). Hypoplasias are lines or pits of

enamel deficiency commonly found in the teeth (especially incisors and canines) of

people whose early childhood was biologically stressful. They are caused by disruption

to the cells (ameloblasts) that form the enamel. The disruption is usually environmental,

commonly due to either poor nutrition or infectious disease or a combination of both.

Although nonspecific, hypoplasias are informative about physiological stress in

childhood in archaeological settings.

        Indicators of iron deficiency anemia (porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia).

Iron is essential for many body functions, such as oxygen transport to the body’s tissues.

In circumstances where iron is deficient—owing to nutritional deprivation, low body

weight, chronic diarrhea, parasite infection, and other factors—the body attempts to

compensate by increasing red blood cell production. The manifestations are most readily

visible in the skeletons of young children in areas where red blood cell production occurs,

such as in the flat bones of the cranium. The associated pathological conditions are

sieve-like lesions called porotic hyperostosis and cribra orbitalia for the cranial vault and

eye orbits, respectively. The lesions can also be caused by other factors, but iron

deficiency is among the most common causes. In infancy and childhood, iron deficiency

anemia is associated with impaired growth and delays in behavioral and cognitive

development. In adulthood, the condition is associated with limited work capacity.

       Dental health. Dental health is an important indicator both of oral and general

health, which is assessed in archaeological skeletons from dental caries, antemortem

tooth loss, and abscesses. Dental caries is a disease process characterized by the focal

demineralization of dental hard tissues by organic acids produced by bacterial

fermentation of dietary carbohydrates, especially sugars. In the modern era, the

introduction and general availability of refined sugar caused a huge increase in dental

decay. In the more distant past, the adoption of agriculture led to a general increase in

tooth decay, especially from the introduction of maize. The agricultural shift and the

later use of increasingly refined foods have resulted in an increase in periodontal disease,

caries, tooth loss, and abscesses.

       Degenerative joint disease. Degenerative joint disease (DJD) is commonly

caused by the mechanical wear and tear on the joints of the skeleton due to physical

activity. Generally speaking, populations engaged in habitual activities that are

physically demanding have more DJD (especially buildup of bone along joint margins

and deterioration of bone on articular joint surfaces) than populations that are relatively




                                            7
sedentary. Studies of DJD have been valuable in documenting levels and patterns of

activity in past populations.

       Skeletal infections (osteoperiostitis). Skeletal lesions of infectious origin, which

commonly appear on the major long bones (especially the tibia), have been documented

worldwide. Most of these lesions are found as plaque-like deposits from periosteal

inflammation, swollen shafts, and irregular elevations on bone surfaces. Most lesions are

nonspecific but they often originate with Staphylococcus or Streptococcus organisms.

These lesions have proven very informative about patterns and levels of community

health in the human past.

       Trauma. Fractures, weapon wounds, and other skeletal injuries provide a record

of accidents or violence. Accidental injuries, such as ankle and wrist fractures, reflect

difficulty of terrain and the hazards of specific occupations. Injuries caused by violence,

such as weapon wounds or parry fractures of the forearm, provide a barometer of

domestic strife, social unrest, and warfare.



Two Dimensions of Health

       Demographers and medical professionals agree that length of life and morbidity

are central elements of health. The methodology for measuring life expectancy at birth

was refined during the nineteenth century, but much less agreement exists on principles

for the second. While death is usually well defined, morbidity is much less precise. The

incidence of various chronic diseases, days lost from school or work, and assessments of

physical capacity are used, but all have conceptual limitations. Moreover, gathering

reasonably comprehensive morbidity information that is accurate is often time-

consuming and expensive. Significant progress on the problem may be made eventually

by using devices that transmit information from receptors implanted in or on the body.



                                               8
        How well do skeletons capture the elements of health? At most localities or

burial sites, a useful but incomplete picture is available for morbidity. New techniques of

aging will improve estimates of life expectancy, but remains hazardous without good

contextual information from archaeology and other sources. Lack of information on life

expectancy is less damaging than it might appear for the study of health, however. To the

extent that morbidity and mortality are positively correlated, health can still be indexed or

ranked across sites by using morbidity indicators from skeletons.12

        Skeletons are good at summarizing several types of chronic morbidity, with the

exception of various soft-tissue conditions such as hernias or torn ligaments.

Degenerative joint disease and dental decay often develop over many years, and both

have adverse functional consequences. DJD is painful and limits mobility, whereas

dental decay limits the ability to chew and digest a coarse diet, which impairs net

nutrition, weakens the immune system, and increases vulnerability to illness. Skeletal

signs of anemia (cribra orbitalia and porotic hyperostosis) usually appear early in

childhood and the adverse environmental conditions that created these bony

malformations tend to persist thereafter. Skeletal infections are often painful and signal a

weakened immune system that can lead to illness and functional loss. Broken bones and

weapon wounds are painful and require time to heal, and the loss of mobility or dexterity

associated with them can be permanent if they heal in a misaligned fashion.

        Stunting and linear enamel hypoplasias (LEH) are not direct measures of

morbidity, but they signal a loss of functional capacity. Hunger is painful and limits

physical activity in the fashion of anemia, and hypoplasias are usually the direct result of

severe bouts of disease or malnutrition in early childhood. These skeletal lesions

therefore index various types of morbidity.

12
  This conclusion is bolstered by morbidity and mortality data analyzed in Suchit Arora, "The Relation
of sickness to deaths: evidence from the U.S. Army, 1905-39," (Columbus, OH: 2002).


                                                  9
Sampling Issues

         Physical anthropologists may have little control over the location and extent of

excavations that result from a development project that clears a small plot of ground.

With the exception of the removal of entire cemeteries containing reasonably closed

populations, one can seldom argue that skeletons represent an entire society. Many

collections in Europe, for example, are disproportionately from cities and towns, where

much construction has occurred relative to rural areas.

         These constraints are a hindrance but far from disabling. In formulating a large

comparative project involving numerous sites, one may stratify for representation from

rural and urban areas. Post-weighting samples is a second option. As discussed below,

one may sidestep age bias by converting information to age specific rates if the age

distribution of deaths has been skewed by fertility, migration, or excavation.



Community Health

         Numerous simplifying assumptions and approximations are required to distill

diverse skeletal data into a single number for comparative ranking and study of

populations.13 Ideally both life expectancy and morbidity would be available, so that one

might roughly approximate a measure such as quality-adjusted life years. For various

reasons, such as incomplete excavation of burials, migration, or unmeasured differences

in fertility rates, however, many sites in the collaborative project lack reliable estimates

of life expectancy. Therefore the health index discussed here incorporates only morbidity

as expressed in the frequency and severity of skeletal lesions, but the index could easily

13
  A short paper necessarily conveys only a flavor of the methodology; for additional details and
justification see Richard H. Steckel, Paul W. Sciulli, and Jerome C. Rose, "A health index from skeletal
remains," in The backbone of history: health and nutrition in the Western Hemisphere, ed. Richard H.
Steckel and Jerome C. Rose (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2002), 61-93. Presumably
future research will improve the health index using more appropriate assumptions.


                                                  10
be adapted to incorporate length of life. A positive correlation between morbidity and

mortality is likely, however, which mitigates the lack of data on life expectancy in

ranking health. This formulation of the index underestimates the true variation in health

(as measured by quality adjusted life years) across sites.

        The index was estimated using the following sequence of steps:

        (1) For each individual, the seven skeletal measures of morbidity discussed above

were graded on a scale of 0 (most severe expression) to 100 (no lesion or deficiency).

Thus, a higher score indicates better health.

        (2) Age-specific rates of morbidity pertaining to the health indicators during

childhood (stature, LEH and anemia) were assumed to have persisted from birth to death,

which is justified by knowledge that childhood deprivation negatively affects adult

health.14 The duration of morbidity prior to death is in fact unknown for the remaining

four components (infections, trauma, DJD, and dental decay) but it is clear these skeletal

lesions reflect chronic conditions that typically persisted for several years. While the

durations are the subject of ongoing research, on a provisional basis they were assumed

to have existed for 10 years prior to death.

        (3) The age-specific rates for each of the seven attributes of the index were

calculated as ratios in which the numerator equals the average grade or score at a

particular age and the denominator equals the number of person years of morbidity

observed at that age. Results were grouped into age categories of 0-4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-24,

25-34, 35-44 and 45+.

        (4) The age-specific rates for each attribute were weighted by the relative number

of person-years lived in a reference population (Model West level 4) that is believed to

  The effect of fetal and early childhood health on adult health is sometimes called the Barker
hypothesis, which is discussed in D. J. P. Barker, Mothers, babies, and health in later life, 2nd ed.
(Edinburgh ; New York: Churchill Livingstone, 1998).. For a additional discussion see Robert W.
Fogel and Dora L. Costa, "A theory of technophysio evolution, with some implications for forecasting
population, health care costs, and pension costs," Demography 34, no. 1 (1997): 49-66.


                                                 11
roughly agree with pre-Columbian mortality conditions in the Western Hemisphere. The

results were multiplied by life expectancy in this reference population and expressed as a

percent of the maximum attainable, which corresponds to a complete lack of skeletal

defects or lesions.15 This procedure effectively denudes the health index of differences or

variations in mortality rates because all populations are assumed to have had the same life

expectancy.16

        (5) The seven components of the index were then weighted equally to obtain the

overall index.

        Numerous assumptions underlying the index can be challenged, modified and

refined, which cannot be pursued in a brief paper. It would be appropriate to weight the

elements of the index, such as dental decay and trauma, by their functional consequences

but this is complicated by the nature of the social safety net, medical technology and

other factors that vary in unknown ways across societies. Thus, equal weighting is

questionable but it is also difficult to justify an alternative scheme given the present state

of knowledge. In addition, the index is an additive measure that ignores interactions, but

having both a skeletal infection and trauma, for example, could have been worse than the

sum of their independent effects on health. The present state of knowledge does not

permit the imposition of justifiable interaction effects.17




15
   The Model West level 4 population has a life expectancy at birth of 26.4 years. For a discussion of
model life tables see Ansley J. Coale and Paul George Demeny, Regional model life tables and stable
populations (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1966).
16
   Known differences in life expectancy could be incorporated easily into a modified index. Changing
the life expectancy modifies the weights but not the age-specific rates.

                                                 12
A Test of the Index Methodology

         Comparing results with patterns well established in historical studies is a useful

technique for assessing the health index as a work in progress.18 Settlement size is a

suitable category because a great deal is known about it from historical records. Prior to

effective public health measures near the end of the nineteenth century, urban areas were

notoriously unhealthy. Large, permanent concentrations of people led to the

accumulation of waste that harbored parasites detrimental to health. Close contact, often

in crowded places of living or work, readily spread many diseases. In addition, cities

usually had substantially unequal distributions of wealth and power—and therefore large

differences in access to resources and in work effort, which were important for health.

These same processes affecting health likely existed in the pre-Columbian world. Other

things being equal, one would expect the more mobile, less densely settled populations to

have been healthier than those living in paramount towns or urban areas.

         Because European expansion distorted Native American mortality patterns in

ways that could have obscured the effects of settlement size, comparisons are limited to

pre-Columbian sites, which include skeletons of 4,078 individuals who lived at 23

localities in North, Central and South America.19 Steckel and Rose used archaeological

evidence to arrange the settlements into three types: mobile (essentially hunter

gatherers); village or settled but dispersed populations; and town or paramount urban

center.20 The estimated regression of the health index on settlement type is:




18
   Various types of sensitivity analysis and formulation of standard errors are also planned, following
public reaction to the methodology of the health index.

remains."

the dependent variable are 70.5 and 8.0, respectively. The coefficients are both

statistically and practically significant: the health index was nearly two standard

deviations lower in the largest population setting as opposed to mobile groups.

         That the health index systematically declined with increasing settlement size is

welcome news for the methodology. The index has passed an important preliminary test,

suggesting it is credible even in its crude form. Presumably refinements in the

methodology will sharpen the quantification of important aspects of health.



Long-Term Trend

         An interesting pattern emerges from arranging the evidence by average age of the

sites. Figure 1 shows a scatter diagram of the health index at 23 pre-Columbian (pre-

1492) sites where all seven attributes were reported by the different research teams. The

downward trajectory is statistically significant in a simple linear regression:



                      HI = 65.41 + 0.0025 YBP, N = 23, R2 = 0.28                           (2)

                              (2.26)    (0.00087)



Standard errors are shown in parentheses. Regrettably, few sites were located in the early

pre-Columbian period.21 There are only three data points before approximately 1000 BC,

which complicates the interpretation of the time trend. This particular scattering of sites

imparts a high standard deviation to the independent variable (time), which one could

argue, artificially shrinks the standard error of the coefficient, i.e., a few chronological

outliers may heavily affect the estimated relationship. This chronological concentration

makes it important to consider factors that may have contributed to variability in the

index, regardless of time period. The goal is to determine whether measurable

environmental effects can explain the downward trajectory in the health index.

        Additional measurable variables collected for each site include food sources,

vegetation, topography, elevation, and settlement pattern. While it is impossible to

specify in detail the pathway of causation for each of these variables, we have a general

sense of their possible mechanisms of operation. Food sources were obvious variables to

consider because diet affects human growth and other aspects of health such as resistance

to infections. What may appear to be a simple relation between diet and the health index,

however, is made complex by interactions with other ecological variables such as

topography, climate, settlement size, and trade. While settled agriculture provided a

greater supply of foods such as maize, beans, and squash, systematic food production also

involved repetitive patterns of work compared with the varied physical efforts of hunter-

gatherers, which may have had implications for the onset and severity of degenerative

joint disease. It is also thought that dietary diversity and quality may have suffered in the

transition to settled agriculture.22 In addition, there is evidence that maize consumption

led to dental decay. Thus, it is difficult to specify in advance the general magnitude and

even the direction of effect that subsistence patterns may have had on the health index.

In any event, all pre-Columbian sites lacked the dietary diversity that was later provided

by the addition of European plants and animals. Based on earlier studies, however, one

might expect that health was lower after the transition to settled agriculture .

          Vegetation surrounding the site may have affected health via the type and

availability of resources for food and shelter. Forests provided materials for the diet, fuel

and housing and also sheltered animals that could have been used for food. Semi-deserts

posed challenges for the food supply relative to more lush forests or grasslands, but the

dry climate might have inhibited the transmission of some diseases.

          Flood plain or coastal living provided easy access to aquatic sources of food;

enabled trade compared with more remote, interior areas; and facilitated the disposal of

waste. Trade, however, may have promoted the spread of disease. Uneven terrain found

in hilly or mountainous areas may have provided advantages for defense, but could have

led to more accidents and fractures.

          Elevation affects or is correlated with temperature, insect vectors, and vegetation,

and often is associated with terrain, opportunities for trade, and settlement patterns. Low

elevations, particularly coastal or flood plain areas, probably provided food and

opportunities for trade, which were beneficial for health. A most low elevations in the

sample, the climate was tropical or subtropical, which could have increased exposure to

disease. It is therefore difficult to predict the effect that elevation may have had on

health.

          The connection between ecological variables and the health index was studied

using a sequence of simple regressions, one for each ecological variable, which are given

in Table 1. Although the resulting coefficients may suffer from omitted variable bias,

which is discussed below, the procedure is nevertheless useful for assessing determinants

of health. As expected, settlement size had a substantial and systematic negative impact,

with the health index of the largest settlements falling nearly two standard deviations

below that of mobile groups (hunter gathers). The index was also substantially and




                                             16
systematically affected by use of domestic plants, living at higher elevations, in open

forest or grassland, or away from coastal areas.

         The last regression in the table sheds light on the issue of multicollinearity. The

R2 is much higher (0.68) in the multivariate case but only one of the independent

variables (elevation) was statistically significant, whereas each variable was significant in

the simple regressions. The most effective solution is to obtain more diverse data, i.e.

sites where environmental change did not occur as a package. Thus, despite having the

largest data set of its kind ever assembled, the desired effects are not measurable with

precision. Even though the individual coefficients are imprecisely estimated, however, it

is safe to conclude that some combination of changing environmental conditions led to

deteriorating health within the sample.23 In the multiple regression, the coefficient on the

time trend (age BP) is much smaller (0.0013 versus 0.0025) than in the simple regression

and it is statistically insignificant when controlling for ecological factors.

         Additional work is required to learn more about which environmental changes

may have been important in explaining the pre-Columbian decline in health. For this

purpose the sample was divided into two roughly equal parts: early (pre 1500 BP) and

late (post 1500 BP). Table 2 gives the sample means of the health index and of the

important ecological variables in these two time periods. Between the early and the late

period, the health index declined from 74.20 to 66.46, a difference of 7.74 points.

Importantly, all ecological variables changed in a direction adverse to health: People

moved to higher elevations, out of mobile groups, into open forest-grassland habitats,


23
  One would like to know the average values of the ecological variables in the Western Hemisphere
over time, but even rough estimates of these numbers might be unattainable. Nevertheless summaries
of the archaeological evidence makes clear that the general direction of change mirrored that in the
sample. Cities and socially-stratified societies, for example, were tiny in numerical importance at late
as 2000 years ago, and large urban centers appeared only in the millennium before Columbus. See

Colo.: Westview Press, 1997). and Stuart J. Fiedel, Prehistory of the Americas, 2nd ed. (Cambridge
[England] ; New York: Cambridge University Press, 1992).


                                                   17
used more domestic plants, and left coastal areas. Column 4 of Table 2 shows that the

largest move (a shift of 0.485) was into open forest-grassland areas, and by multiplying

this shift by the coefficient in the simple regression (-8.39), we obtain a measure of the

impact of this change on the health index (-4.07 points). Column 6 of Table 2 presents

similar calculations for other ecological variables. The calculations show that the rise of

towns and urban areas (-2.25), the change in vegetation patterns (-4.07), and the use of

domestic plants (-2.89) were also important factors in the decline of the health index in

the pre-Columbian era, if each variable is taken in isolation.

       The sum of all the ecological changes is –12.25, which is 4.51 points more (in

absolute terms) than the decline in the health index (-7.74). Therefore the simple

accounting procedure over-explains the deterioration in health. This is not surprising

because many of the important environmental changes occurred together, e.g. domestic

plants were more commonly used in urban areas and urban areas were more typically

located in open forest-grassland habitats, etc. To the extent that change occurred as a

package, the individual regression coefficients overstate the pure effect of an ecological

category.

       If the transition to settled agriculture and urban, upland living led to a decline in

health, why did it occur? There are several possible explanations, but unfortunately we

cannot adequately test them with the data at hand. First, the shift could have been a

second choice forced on hunter-gathers by resource depletion. They might have farmed

in response to exhaustion of natural sources of subsistence. If correct, one would expect

to observe a decline in health prior to the rise of settled agriculture. Our data are

insufficiently rich and abundant to explore adequately this possibility.

       Second, large-scale collective efforts may have given rise to redistribution that

benefited some (dominant) groups at the expense of others. Leaders may have urged



                                            18
settled agriculture and urban living upon their followers as a way to gain political power

and control over more resources. This objective might have been intertwined with

strategies for military protection, whereby fortifications, warriors, and stores of weapons

were important for survival. Unlike hunter-gatherer subsistence, where few stores of

food existed, settled agriculture created inventories of food that could be taxed and

distributed by the politically powerful. Similarly, the powerful expended less energy on

work and were able to compel work, such as building monuments, which adversely

affected health. Thus, some people gained while many lost in the transition. If

redistribution was the primary motive, one might observe greater inequality in health in

more complex relative to less complex societies. Consistent with this line of thought,

inequality in wealth or income has been greater in urban versus rural areas in the historic

period.

          Third, the transition might have been largely voluntary if settled agriculture, trade,

and urban living created material goods and ways of life that were preferable to those

available in hunter-gatherer societies. This hypothesis recognizes that improved health

may not have been the only important goal within early societies. Hunter-gatherers may

have been tempted to switch by availability of articles such as shells, cloth, tools, metals

and other accoutrements of large, organized societies. In other words, settled

agriculturalists may have been willing to trade consumer goods and the excitement of

urban living for poorer health. By the eighteenth century urban living had a well-

established reputation for poor health, yet populations of these areas continued to grow

by in-migration. Many newcomers were apparently willing to risk their health for job

and amenities of the city, and it is plausible to think that these priorities may have existed

in earlier millennia.




                                             19
         Whatever the explanation for the transition to settled agriculture, the health

consequences of the change are largely unrecognized, in contrast to costs well known for

the transition from agriculture to urban-industrial society. Urban death rates fell close to

those in rural areas in the early twentieth century, only after people made significant

investments in waste removal, clean water supplies and other aspects of public health and

personal hygiene. Scholars must now recognize that significant health penalties have

accompanied civilization and densely settled populations for the past several thousand

years.



Components of the Health Index

         The health index is an additive measure, which makes it easy to decompose and

analyze its components, an effort facilitated by knowledge that many of its components

are age or cause-specific. Hypoplasisas of the permanent incisor and canine teeth (the

ones most commonly affected) are formed in early childhood (typically from ages 1.5 to

4.5), for example, and their presence indicates a poor diet and/or substantial exposure to

disease . To the extent that young children did not work, these lesions are insulated from

its effects on systemic physiological stress. Signs of anemia (porotic hyperostosis and

cribra orbitalia) also reflect nutritional stress in early childhood (birth to age 5), but the

causes are usually quite specific: lack of iron in the diet or the presence of parasites that

absorb iron . These environmental causes often persist into adulthood. The third

childhood indicator (stature) is sensitive to dietary and disease conditions in early

childhood but also incorporates the negative consequences of work (other things being

equal) throughout the growing years.

         Several factors may affect the prevalence of dental disease, consisting of caries,

tooth loss and abscesses. Although archaeological research has implicated tooth shapes



                                             20
and minerals in the local water (presence or absence of fluoride), as well as coarse foods

and grit that erode teeth, the phenomenon has been consistently linked to diet across

diverse environmental settings.24 Specifically, diets high in starch (and especially maize

in the pre-Columbian Western Hemisphere) have led to dental decay. 25 Even among

hunter-gatherers, however, the disease prevalence is sometimes greater among women

compared with men because the former often consume more plant foods relative to meat.

        Researchers have identified numerous factors associated with degenerative joint

disease, including trauma, sex, bone density and nutrition, but the primary contributor is

mechanical stress.26 Industrial laborers, for example, display patterns of joint

deterioration in relation to habitual physical activity at work, which eventually leads to

bony growth on joint margins. With progression, pitting occurs where the cartilaginous

tissue covering the joint has failed, and erosion of bone on joint surfaces accompanies

advanced stages of the disease.

        Skeletal infections (periostitis) are inflammatory responses to bacterial invasion

that produce loosely organized woven bone in its unhealed form and smooth but

undulating or inflated bone tissue after healing.27 These inflections are seldom fatal when

confined to small patches of bone but can lead to death if the infection progresses to vital

organs. The infections are painful and usually limit mobility, dexterity, and strength.

Because the Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacteria commonly involved are nearly

ubiquitous and easily invade small wounds, the infections suggest a compromised

immune system that results from poor net nutrition. Hence they are a good index of

morbidity more generally. Unlike stature, which reflects net nutrition during the growing

years, skeletal infections occur at virtually all ages and therefore provide a more complete

picture of morbidity over the life cycle.

        Age related bone loss underlies much skeletal injury in modern industrial

societies. In archaeological settings bone loss is also a risk factor for older individuals

(above age 45) but fractures or shattered bones are usually concentrated among older

children and young adults who travel over hazardous terrain, work in dangerous

occupations, or engage in warfare or otherwise become victims of interpersonal violence.

A review of numerous case studies shows enormous diversity in patterns of trauma .

Injuries in hazardous terrain are usually expressed in trauma on the lower limbs, as for

example when a fracture of the wrist or lower radius follows from an attempt to break a

forward fall. Parry fractures of the middle radius or ulna often result from efforts to ward

off a blow to the head, and their frequency is correlated with cranial injuries under

patterns of intentional as opposed to accidental trauma.

        Table 3 shows the regression coefficients of index components on ecological

variables taken in categories. These coefficients are similar to those in the middle

columns of Table 2 except that the dependent variables are components rather than the

health index. The column under stature shows, for example, the coefficients estimated in

6 different simple regressions, one for each category of independent variable.28 The

coefficients and their statistical significance are guides to influences on health, but results

should be interpreted with caution because omitted variables could bias the coefficients.

In my view, it is preferable to consider specifications involving somewhat biased but

precisely estimated coefficients than unbiased coefficients with large standard errors.

With this approach it can be hazardous to attribute specific environmental mechanisms of

Although settlement pattern is represented by two variables, it is treated as one category.

causation to the variables, but the scope for interpretation is narrowed by knowledge of

biological processes that affect health.

        The summary statistics at the bottom of Table 3 show that with the exception of

trauma, the attributes of the health index displayed considerable variability across sites or

localities. The range was particularly large for the childhood indicators of hypoplasias

and stature. Low variability for trauma was not an artifact of the scale of measurement;

in the entire sample (65 localities) this mean score ranged from 10.8 to 100.0 and had a

standard deviation of 16.1. Therefore trauma was relatively infrequent in the pre-

Columbian period.

        Unlike the other components of the health index, measured environmental

variables had little effect on trauma, a result that holds in the larger sample of 65

localities or sites. Therefore its determinants should be studied as a process separate

from other aspects of health. As suggested above, trauma did rise substantially after the

arrival of Europeans, especially cranial injuries among men.29 At this point it is unknown

whether the post-Columbian growth of trauma involved direct conflict between

Europeans and natives or resulted from tribal warfare precipitated by European presence.

        Coastal living was advantageous for several aspects of health, particularly

infections, dental health and DJD. With the possible exception of hypoplasias, however,

coastal living did not protect the children, which indicates that adults were the primary

beneficiaries. Diverse patterns of work and subsistence, combined with lower intensity

of physical effort, were likely to have eased degenerative joint disease in coastal areas.

        All childhood indicators as well as infections and possibly DJD suffered at high

elevations, but this environment had no systematic consequence for dental decay. As a

tendency, subsistence was more challenging at higher elevations, but it is unknown why

this was not expressed in dental decay. It is worth investigating whether the water at

these sites contained minerals that protected teeth.



Urbanization and Health

       The large and systematic negative impact of urban living merits additional

discussion. The urban populations occupied 6 of the 10 lowest slots in the health index

rankings across the 23 pre-Columbian sites, averaging 64.1 compared with an overall

mean of 70.5, and a mean of 80.2 among the sites having the 6 highest scores. What kind

of story can be told about the pathways by which urban living adversely affected health

in this era? Unfortunately opportunities for statistical analysis are severely constrained

by lack of surviving evidence. In general one cannot reliably calculate population

densities, for example, because excavations are incomplete, making it difficult to

determine total population size from counts of the number and distribution of dwellings.

Moreover, the number of residents may have fluctuated over time in ways that are hard to

estimate from archaeological remains. Connecting any possible fluctuations in

population size with precise burial dates is also a considerable challenge.

       None of the urban centers prospered early in the pre-Columbian era, but they span

a reasonably wide range of time, from approximately 100 to 1160 AD. All were located

in Mesoamerica, 3 in the basin of Mexico and 3 along or near the coast of the Yucatan

peninsula or Honduras, the condition of latter group contradicting any simple connection

between coastal living and good health. As noted, estimation of population size is

hazardous, but it is thought that these cities ranged from just under 10,000 to roughly

100,000 to 150,000 residents. By way of comparison, northern Europe had few urban

areas, with Paris and Mainz no larger than 25,000 people in 1000 AD . As late as the end

of the 13th century, significant urbanization was confined mainly to southern Europe, in



                                           24
northern Italian towns such as Milan, Florence, Venice and Genoa, each of which

probably exceeded 100,000 in population (for a discussion of urban growth see . At this

time, Paris was the only city in northern Europe that may have fallen into this category.

The southern Low Countries were moderately urbanized by the late Middle Ages (the

14th century), but the largest city, Ghent, probably had no more than 50,000 inhabitants,

while London and Cologne held fewer than 40,000 people at this time.

       Living in a paramount town or urban area was devastating for infections, and hard

on the childhood indicators (hypoplasias, stature, and anemia) and on DJD, where the

regression coefficients of Table 3 were statistically significant and large relative to the

standard deviations of the independent variables. Although it is difficult to allocate the

effect of urban living between the pure effects of population size versus its association

with other measured variables, large statistically significant effects are unlikely to have

been primarily the result of specification bias. Use of domesticates was bad for

degenerative joint disease, dental health, hypoplasias and infections, but unlike urban

living, had no systematic consequences for stature, which suggests that older children

living in cities and towns had avenues of nutritional protection that were unavailable to

young children.

       Three features of urban areas have been associated with poor health in studies of

the historical period prior to the late nineteenth century: heavy exposure to

communicable diseases created by congested living and poor sanitation; inequality of

wealth, power and work effort; and relatively high cost of food. How do these

explanations fare in the pre-Columbian world? Because the skeletal infections usually

stem from Staphylococcus or Streptococcus bacteria, which were also abundant in rural

areas, the high infection rates in cities cannot be blamed on elevated exposure to

pathogens. Instead, the infections signify a weak immune system connected with poor



                                            25
net nutrition. The latter might follow from food prices that were high relative to rural

areas, but this argument is deflated by the fact that 3 out of 6 cities were on or near the

coast, with easy access to marine sources of food and to low-cost transportation of food

imports.

        Instead, high rates of degenerative joint disease in the cities points to work effort,

which drains net nutrition, as a significant culprit. The pre-Columbian cities of Mexico

and the Yucatan region were noted for their monumental architecture. These and the

rituals associated with their use were emblems of a highly stratified society. The

monuments were built with simple tools, without draft animals and therefore with much

human physical effort undertaken by masses of people. Inequality in access to food and

housing likely compounded the biological stress created by their hard work.

        The available package of evidence does not eliminate high food prices and heavy

exposure to some pathogens as factors adverse to health in pre-Columbian cities. The

state of research is far removed from possibilities for assigning plausible numeric weights

to causal elements. Nevertheless, one can say that inequality and draining physical effort

are the leading contenders.



Implications

        Some historians have noted the absence of many prominent European diseases

such as smallpox, measles and typhoid in arguing that native populations were generally

healthy, perhaps living in an epidemiological Garden of Eden.30 Some have speculated

that these conditions allowed an enormous population to flourish. Instead, the skeletons

reveal enormous diversity, with pre-Columbian Native Americans occupying the highest

and the lowest slots in the rankings of the health index at 65 localities, which also include

post-Columbians natives plus 14 groups of European-Americans and African

Americans.31 The absence of several major European diseases does not prove there was a

benign disease environment or good health. Numerous native populations, particularly

ones that lived late in the pre-Columbian period, were riddled with pathological lesions.

The natives encountered by Columbus either brought or evolved with pathogens, which

interacted with their subsistence patterns and other life ways, to cause substantial

morbidity and shorten life.

        The spread of European diseases has been noted as a major factor in the rapid

Spanish conquest of Central and South America. This essay and other work in

anthropometric history suggest that poor nutrition of many native populations, including

those rapidly conquered, has been overlooked. One cannot deny the relevance of

European diseases or the advantages conveyed by surprise, guns and steel, but the sharp

contrast with the Plains tribes of the nineteenth century is undeniable. With similar

technology (guns and horses) and good nutrition (measured by tall stature and by a

diverse, high protein diet) and despite the heavy burden of European diseases such as

smallpox and measles, the natives were more than a match in many wars or conflicts.32

Indeed, destruction of their major food source--bison--was a key ingredient in their

eventual demise.

        There are plausible mechanisms by which good nutrition conveys benefits in

times of conflict. The first is physical energy to organize and resist. Even without stores

of food at hand, well nourished people have large reservoirs of tissue (fat and muscle)

that can be metabolized over a period of days or weeks. It is also likely that well-

nourished populations have food stores, which could provide additional energy to prolong

the duration of conflict and impose higher costs on the invaders whose supply lines were

stretched by expeditions to the interior. Second, poor nutrition weakens the immune

system, and when combined with the physical demands of mobilization and the burden of

disease, would have sapped vigor. Although the topic is under study, it is also reasonable

to think that poor nutrition for the masses was associated with inequality in material

resources and access to power. Perhaps the relatively disadvantaged were not only less

able by reason of poor diets, but also less enthusiastic in their resistance.

        Many scholars have argued explicitly or implicitly that the European advance

would have been far different without the disease weapon; perhaps the invasion would

have failed or conquest greatly delayed, substantially altering world history. It is

constructive to speculate on a different counterfactual: other things unchanged, good

nutrition alone would have tipped the balance, enabling natives to repel the invaders.

What might have happened, for example, if a high protein food source (e.g., cattle or

bison) had been readily available in cities of central Mexico and in other poorly

nourished areas? While it is premature to claim validity, the idea is hardly farfetched

because military history repeatedly demonstrates the value of food.

        Geographic determinism was vastly over-sold in the early twentieth century, but

scholars have recently resurrected useful elements of the idea. Economists have

investigated the consequences of the physical environment on persistent differences in

economic performance.33 Based on cross-country comparisons they have measured the

disadvantages of tropical location, for example, on GDP per capita. The most interesting

questions now on this agenda involve the likely pathways or mechanisms underlying the

relationship. The skeletons suggest that the physical environment has long been relevant

for human success or failure. While the matter deserves far more study, the long

association suggests that the connection observed in recent times may not be simply the

bi-product of modern forces such as colonialism, institutions or government policy.

       Demographic data available for the past couple of centuries repeatedly show that

cities had relatively high death rates prior to the twentieth century, and thus a decline in

health often accompanied industrialization, particularly in its urban locations. The

skeletal evidence suggests that health costs of human aggregation long pre-dated

industrialization, however, quite possibly extending back to the earliest urban centers.

Numerous social scientists have celebrated the early rise of civilization as an enormous

human achievement that gave rise to government, laws, urbanization, interregional trade,

new architecture, and so forth. While it was undeniably an accomplishment, scholars

have considered mainly the asset side of the ledger, implicitly viewing the transition as an

ancient free lunch. We now know that significant health penalties also accompanied

early, large-scale human organization, and these costs should be recognized and

incorporated into historical research.



Agenda

       Although incomplete as a measure of health, skeletons are valuable as a gauge of

social performance over the millennia. Far more informative than stature alone, skeletal

measures are not only available across vast stretches of time and space, they are

comparable over this expanse in ways that dwarf anything available for traditional

measures of human welfare.

       Skeletal health will be useful in debates over the prime movers of very long-term

economic growth, harnessed to test explanations flowing from efforts to model

technological progress as arising from endogenous choices of profit-maximizing

innovators. According to the Hansen-Prescott and the Galor-Weil theories, per capita



                                            29
consumption should have been essentially constant before the era of modern growth,

whereas the Jones explanation allows for periods during which human welfare improved

measurably because of bursts in innovative activity or unusually favorable institutional

changes.34 Jones’ model can therefore be regarded as proposing the alternative to the null

hypothesis proposed by the Hansen/Prescott and Galor/Weil models.

        Skeletons have promising applications in studying human adaptation to climate

change, a topic inspired by growing concerns over global warming. From tree rings, ice

cores and other sources, climate historians have made considerable progress in measuring

important aspects of climate over many thousands of years.35 Climate historians such as

deMenocal have used the new evidence to link climate change to the fall of the Maya.36

While the fall of civilizations is interesting, it is a crude measure of social performance.

By linking skeletal health with new climate data, it will be possible to measure the

connection between climate and human welfare with greater precision.

        The National Science Founded recently funded a project that will gather and study

substantial amounts of skeletal data from European populations that lived from the

Paleolithic era to the late nineteenth century.37 This research laboratory is enriched by

enormous diversity in conditions that were likely important for social performance over

the millennia, including technology, climate, social organization, political structure,

degree of urbanization and opportunities for trade. When combined with evidence from

archaeology, historical documents, climate history, GIS and other sources, the skeletal

data can be used to investigate a wide range of topics such as the health of women and
