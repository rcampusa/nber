The Welfare State and Migration: A Dynamic Analysis of Political Coalitions

                                              ABSTRACT

We develop a dynamic political-economic theory of welfare state and immigration policies, featuring
three distinct voting groups: skilled workers, unskilled workers, and old retirees. The essence of inter-
and intra-generational redistribution of a typical welfare system is captured with a proportional tax
on labor income to finance a transfer in a balanced-budget manner. We characterize political-economic
equilibrium policy rules consisting of the tax rate, the skill composition of migrants, and the total number
of migrants. When none of these groups enjoy a majority (50 percent of the voters or more), political
coalitions will form. With overlapping generations and policy-determined influx of immigrants, the
formation of the political coalitions changes over time. These future changes are taken into account
when policies are shaped. The paper characterizes the evolution of the political coalitions that implement
welfare state and migration policies.

1      Introduction
Milton Friedman reminded us that one cannot have free immigration and a
generous welfare state at the same time. Indeed, public opinion in the developed
economies with a fairly generous welfare system, favors putting in some way or
another restrictions on immigration (see, for example, Hanson, Scheve, and
Slaughter (2007, 2009)). A skilled and young immigrant may help the finances
of the welfare state; whereas an unskilled and old migrant may inflict a burden
on the welfare state. A welfare state with a heterogeneous population, by both
age and skills, does not evidently have a commonly accepted attitude towards
migration. Hence, this paper develops a framework to study how these inter- and
intra-generational conflicts, among different age and skill groups, is resolved in
a politico-economic setup. Of a particular interest is how an economy with more
than just two groups of voters resolve the conflicts between more demand for
welfare state redistribution and and the skill composition of immigration policy.
The basic trade-off presented in the paper is as follows: skilled immigrants are
helpful in contributing to paying for the welfare state, but their influx could
upset the future coalition between unskilled and old individuals that supports
redistribution.
    To emphasize this trade-offs, our model features two skill levels for labor,
skilled and unskilled. People live for two periods in an overlapping-generations
manner, which provides another dimension of heterogeneity, between young and
old individuals, in addition to the skill levels. The voting on the current migra-
tion policies and the generosity of the welfare state takes place in each period.
We model a typical welfare state that is characterized by both inter -generational
redistribution and intra-generational redistribution1 Accordingly, our overlap-
ping generations model is further based on key demographic characteristics:
that migrants are younger and have higher birth rates than the native born
population.
    Our paper is directly related to two fields of the existing political economy
literature: the political economy of the pay-as-you-go (PAYG) social security
systems (Cooley and Soares (1999), Bohn (2005), Boldrin and Rustichini (2000),
Galasso (1999)) and the political economy of migration (such as Benhabib (1996)
and Ortega (2005)). The view that increased migration may come to the res-
cue of PAYG social security systems reflects the fact that the flow of migrants
can alleviate the current demographic imbalance as well, by influencing the age
    1 Many  features of the welfare state, such as national health insurance, involve both inter-
and intra-generational redistributions, while some features of the welfare state are also either
inter - or intra-generational, such as old-age social security and income maintenance program.

structure of the host economy. A few empirical studies address this point by
calibrating the equilibrium impact of a less restrictive policy towards migra-
tion according to U.S. data. Storesletten (2000) found in a general equilibrium
model that selective migration policies, involving increased inflow of working-
age high and medium-skilled migrants, can remove the need for a future fiscal
reform. Auerbach and Oreopoulos (1999) performed a similar exercise using
partial equilibrium generational accounting and arrived at a similar conclusion.
By emphasizing the demographic side and abstracting from the migrants’ factor
prices effects, Lee and Miller (2000) concluded in a similar analysis that a higher
number of migrants admitted into the economy can ease temporarily the pro-
jected fiscal burden of retiring babyboomers. There are also a few studies which
deal with the effect of migrants on the PAYG social security system (Razin
and Sadka (1999) and Scholten and Thum (1996)). However, this literature
abstracted from political-economic considerations.
    There have been previous works on the political economy of immigration
and redistribution policies, albeit focussed solely on either inter-generational
or intra-generational alone. Razin, Sadka, and Swagel (2002b), and Casarico
and Devillanova (2003) focussed on the impact of immigration the political
economy of inter-generational redistribution. Sand and Razin (2007) took an
additional step to provide a synthesis on the political economy model jointly
determining the inter-generational redistribution and immigration. Dolmas and
Huffman (2004) analyzed similarly the joint determination of intra-generational
redistribution and immigration policy in a dynamic political economy model.
    Following a line literature of dynamic political-economic models, we employ
the Markov-perfect equilibrium concept, as in Krusell and Rios-Rull (1996),
and Hassler et al. (2003). The forward-looking equilibrium concept means that
each young voter takes into account the effect of her vote on the evolution of
the economy into the next period; which, in turn, affects the voting outcome in
the next period, particularly with respect to the social security benefit that she
receives in the next period, when she grows old and retires Next period voting,
in turn, is influenced by the outcome of the voting outcome in the following
period, and so on. Since a welfare state will necessarily affect more than two
groups of voters, of particular interest is the characterization of possible coali-
tions which emerge as decisive in the political-economic equilibria, for different
demographic and skill-distribution parameters. In this regard, we depart from
the typical literature markedly whose focus was mainly on the conflict between
only two groups: either young versus old voters (for example, Boldrin and Rus-
tichini (2000), Sand and Razin (2007)), or skilled versus unskilled voters (see


                                        3
for example Hassler et al. (2003), Dolmas and Huffman (2004), and Armenter
and Ortega (2011)).
    The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the analytical frame-
work. Section 3 characterizes the political process and defines the concept of
equilibrium. Section 4 provides a preliminary analysis of the political equilib-
rium. Section 5 provides a full analysis of the political-economic equilibrium.
Lastly, section 6 concludes.


2      The Model
Consider a standard two-period, overlapping-generations model. Each cohort
works in the first-period in his life and retires in the second. There are two
skill types: skilled and unskilled. The welfare-state2 is modeled simply by a
proportional tax on labor income to finance a lump-sum benefit (demogrant)
period-by-period in a balanced-budget manner.3 With this setting, the simple
welfare-state system is quite redistributive.


2.1         Preferences and Technology
The utility of each individual in period t, for young and old, is given, respectively,
by
                                                               1+ε
                                                        ε(li ) ε
                U   y
                        (cy,i  i o
                          t , lt , ct+1 )   =   cy,i
                                                 t     − t       + βcot+1 , i = s, u   (1)
                                                         1+ε
                                U o (cot ) = cot .                                     (2)

where, s and u denote skilled and unskilled labor. Superscripts y and o stand
for “young” and “old”, li is labor of type i = s, u, ε is the elasticity of the labor
supply, and β ∈ (0, 1) is the discount factor. Note that cot is the consumption
of an old individual at period t (who was born in period t − 1). Young and
old agents in the economy maximize the above utility functions subject to their
respective budget constraints as follows:

                                cy,i  i
                                 t + dt          ≤      (1 − τt )wti lti + bt
                                         cot     ≤      (1 + rt )dit−1 + bt

    3 Thelump-sum benefit is perfectly substitutable to private consumption. One can also
extend the analysis in a straightforward manner to have public services (e.g. education,
health) which are not perfectly substitutable to private consumption.

where dit , τt , wti , and bt denote, respectively, saving of the young workers of
type i, the linear income tax rate, wage for labors of type i, and the lump-sum
transfer in the period t.
    Given the linearity of U in ct and ct+1 , the only interior equilibrium interest
rate r equals to β1 − 1 and individuals have no incentive to either save or dissave.
For simplicity, we set saving at zero.4 This essentially reduces the two groups
of old retirees (skilled and unskilled), potentially distinguishable by their levels
of saving, to just one group with identical preference irrespective of their skill
type. Individual’s labor supplies of the young are given by
                                                  ε
                               lti = wti (1 − τt ) , i = s, u.                              (3)

    There is just one good, which is produced by using the two types of labor as
perfect substitute with constant marginal products.5 The production function
is given by
                              Yt = ws Lst + wu Lut                           (4)
where Lit is the aggregate labor supply of skill i = s, u. Labor markets are
competitive, ensuring the wages going to the skilled and unskilled workers are
indeed equal to their marginal products, ws and wu , respectively. We naturally
assume that ws > wu .
    Because the old retirees have no labor income and saving, their only source
of income comes from the demogrant. Putting all the pieces together, the model
yields the following indirect utility functions:
                                           1+ε
                         y,i   (1 − τt )wi
                       V     =                   + bt + βbt+1
                                     1+ε
                        V o = bt ,

for i = s, u. For brevity, we will use V i to denote V y,i because only the young
workers need to be distinguished by their skill level.
    In addition to the parameters of the welfare state (τt and, consequently, bt ),
the political process also determines migration policy which consists of the vol-
ume of migration, and the other determines its skill composition. We denote
   4 Infact, any saving level is an optimal choice. Assuming no saving is for simplicity. With
saving, since old individuals do not work the last period of their life, they will consume their
savings plus any transfer. Through both these channels, the old individuals benefit from
migration. See Forni (2005), and Sand and Razin (2007) for models with saving and capital
accumulation.
   5 This simplification allows us to focus solely on the linkages between the welfare state

and migration, leaving aside any effect of migration on wages. For an analysis to the other
extreme, in which there are only wage effect, see Ortega (2005).

by µt the ratio of allowed immigrants to the native-born young population and
denote by σt the fraction of skilled migrants in the the total number of migrant
entering the country in period t. Migrants are assumed to have identical prefer-
ences to the native-born. Furthermore, we assume all migrants come young and
they are naturalized one period after their entrance. Hence, they gain voting
rights when they are old.


2.2     Demographic Equations and Dynamics
Let st denote the fraction of native-born skilled workers in the labor force in
period t (where s0 > 0). The aggregate labor supply in the economy of each
type of labor is given by
                             Lst = [st + σt µt ] Nt lts                     (5)
and
                             Lut = [1 − st + (1 − σt )µt ] Nt ltu ,                          (6)
where Nt is the number of native-born young individuals in period t.
   The dynamics of the economy is given by two equations: one governs the
aggregate population, while the other governs the skill composition. We as-
sume here that, for both native-born population and migrants, their offsprings
replicate exactly the skill level of their parents.6 That is,

                            Nt+1 = [1 + n + (1 + m)µt ] Nt                                   (7)
                       st+1 Nt+1 = [(1 + n)st + (1 + m)σt µt ] Nt ,

where n and m are the population growth rates of the native-born population
and of the migrants, respectively. We assume that n < m ≤ 1. The plausible
assumption of differential birth rates provides a room for a sharper analysis on
possible future demographic shifts from admitting too many migrants today.
We also allow the population growth rates to be negative, to plausibly reflect
the current situations faced by many European and Asian countries. Combining
the two equations above together, we get the dynamics of the labor supply of
skilled native-born as follows:
                                     (1 + n)st + (1 + m)σt µt
                            st+1 =                            .                              (8)
                                        1 + n + (1 + m)µt
Equation (8) implies that the fraction of the native-born skilled in the native-
born labor force will be higher in period t + 1 than in period t if the proportion
   6 Razin, Sadka, and Swagel (2002b), and Casarico and Devillanova (2003) provide a syn-
thesis with endogenous skill analysis. The first work focussed on the shift in skill distribution
of current population, while the latter studied skill-upgrading of future population.


                                               6
of skilled migrants in period t is higher than that of the native-born, that is, if
σt > st . Naturally, when there is no migration the share of skilled workers out
of (native-born) young population does not change over time. The evolution of
the model thus reduces to a single equation, equation (8), with a single state
variable st .


2.3         The Welfare State
Being balanced period-by-period, the welfare-state system is a pay-as-you-go
system. Therefore, the equation for the demogrant, bt , is given by
                     τt ((st + σt µt )ws Nt lts + (1 − st + (1 − σt )µt ) wu Nt ltu )
              bt =                                                                    ,        (9)
                                   (1 + µt ) Nt + (1 + µt−1 ) Nt−1
which upon some re-arrangements reduces to
                        τt ((st + σt µt )ws lts + (1 − st + (1 − σt )µt ) wu ltu )
                bt =                                 1+µt−1                          .       (10)
                                      1 + µt +    1+n+µt−1 (1+m)

It is straightforward to see that a larger σt increases the demogrant (recall that
ws lts > wu ltu ). That is, a higher skill composition of migrants brings about
higher tax revenues, and, consequently, enables a more generous welfare state,
other things being equal. Similarly, we can conclude that a higher volume of
migration enables a more generous welfare system if the share of the skilled
among the migrants exceeds the share of the skilled among the native-born
workers (σt > st ).


3      Political Process and Equilibrium
In a simple plurality electoral system, Duverger’s Law postulates that the elec-
tion will tend to be dominated by two main political parties (Duverger, 1954).
To Duverger, this is due to “psychological effect” of voters who know that only
the winning candidate gets to influence policies, so voters are careful to not
waste their votes on candidates unlikely to win election. Equipped with this
insight, we adopt the following definition of strategic voting from Fisher (2005).
Voters are voting strategically if they vote “... for a party they believe is more
likely to win than their preferred party, to best influence who wins in the con-
stituency” (Fisher, 2005).7 To allow for strategic voting in the model, we will
borrow heavily from the literature of citizen candidates by Besley and Coate
    7 The literature does not seem to distinguish between strategic voting, as referred to by
political studies in the U.S., and tactical voting, as referred to by political studies in the U.K.


                                                  7
[1997]. 8 However, we assume no endogenous candidacy decision by the citi-
zens, both for simplicity in reducing the number of equilibria and to focus more
on our question at hands on policy selection.


3.1     The Political Process
The political process in each period has three stages. At stage 1, three candi-
dates, one from each respective group, are randomly chosen. We assume that
the size of the population is large enough such that the probability of the ran-
domized selection is infinitesimal, hence not taken into the account by each
citizen when voting or implementing the policies. At stage 2, the citizens cast
their votes for one of the three candidates. In the final stage, the candidate that
wins by plurality choose and implement the policy. We will now analyze these
stages in reverse order.
    Policies of Candidates. In the final stage, the winning candidate will always
implement his preferred policies. Due to the lack of commitment mechanism
such as reputation loss or reelection motive, any promise to deviate from this
ideal point will be viewed as cheap talk in equilibrium. For period t, the winning
candidate preferred policies are given by a tiplet (τt∗ , σt∗ , µ∗t ) = Φt denoting the
three policy choices, namely, the tax rate, the share of skilled immigrant to
total immigrants, and the ratio of allowed immigrants to the native-born young
population respectively, such that

                       Φdt = arg max V d (st , , τt , σt , µt , Φt+1 )                  (11)
                               τt ,σt ,µt
                                            (1 + n)st + (1 + m)σt µt
                          s.t. st+1 =                                ,
                                               1 + n + µt (1 + m)

where d ∈ {s, u, o} is the identity of the the winning candidate. Note that
the winning candidate must taken into the account how his policy choices will
affect the population dynamics and policy choices of the future that will affect
the candidate himself in t + 1 (through Φt+1 ).
    Voting Decisions. In the second stage, the set of three candidates for elec-
tion is {s, u, o}, denoting their identity. Note that there are only three distinct
voting groups: the skilled native-born workers, the unskilled native-born work-
ers, and the old retirees. Within each group, the preference of the voters are
Also, we trade for tractability against new advancements in the theory of strategic voting in
the literature, which attempt to model strategic voting situation as a global game (Myatt and
Fisher, 2002; Myatt, 2007).
   8 For citizen-candidate model with sincere voting, see Osborne and Slivinski (1996).




                                                8
identical by structure, and hence voters in each group will have identical vot-
ing preference. Because identical voters vote identically, we thus focus on the
decision of a representative voter from each group. To ensure continuity of pref-
erences over voting decisions, we let eit ∈ △2 be the vote casted by an individual
of type i ∈ {s, u, o} where each coordinate represents the probabilistic weight
the voter places on each candidate, the skilled, unskilled, and old candidate
respectively, such that sum of all the weight equals 1. In line withe strategic
voting, while making the voting decision, the voters will take into the account
the probability of winning of the candidate. Given the assumption that identical
voter vote identically, the probability of winning of each candidate will be equal
to the sum of the share of the group of population voting for the candidate,
denoted by P j (et ) as the probability of winning of candidate j ∈ {s, u, o}, given

Thus we require that each vote cast by each group is a best-response to the
votes by the other groups, as well as be forward looking not only in terms of
future policy, but also in terms of future voting decisions. In addition, the rep-
resentative voter of each group must take into the account the pivotal power of
their vote, because the entire group will also vote identically. Ruling out weakly
dominated strategies ensure a simple majority voting in a two-candidate case,
as well as making sure that the largest group in the demographic always vote
for its representative candidate for consistencies with ideal policies of its respec-
tive candidate (this assumption is in line with the literature on strategic voting
which focusses primarily on the votes for the challengers, not for the leading
candidate, see Cox (1997), Fisher (2001, 2004), Myatt and Fisher (2002), and
Myatt (2007)). In case of a tie, we assume the candidate with votes from the

    The voting decision of the old voters is simple special case, because they
have no concern for the future,

After the election, the votes for each candidate are tallied by adding up the
size of votes that each group that has chosen to vote for the candidate. The
candidate with the most votes wins the election and gets to implement his ideal
set of policies as described above.


3.2        Markov-perfect Property of Political Equilibria
The main problem with ranking the utility streams of the voters is due to the
multiplicity of future equilibria once we allow for strategic voting. This makes
it impossible for the voters to get a precise prediction of what will happen as a
result of their action today. Even if we could pin down all the relative sizes of
all possible payoffs in the next period, multiple voting equilibria do not allow a
prediction of which equilibrium will be selected in the future. To deal with the
problem, we restrict the voting equilibrium to satisfy the stationary Markov-
perfect property, similarly to the policy choices in previous section. Therefore,
we are looking for the a triplet policy function (τt , σt , µt ) = Φ(st , e∗t ) with the
voting decisions e∗t that solve the following two problems:
                                                                                

while the other candidate need support from both groups of voters via strategic voting to tie,
then the winning will go to the old candidate.

    The stationary Markov-perfect equilibrium defined above introduces two
functional equation exercise. The first exercise is to find a policy profile that
satisfies the Markov-perfect property. This equation states that the decisive
(largest) group in period t chooses, given the state of the economy st , the most
preferred policy variables τt , σt , and µt . In doing so, this group realizes that
her utility is affected not only by these (current) variables, but also the policy
variables of the next period (τt+1 , σt+1 , µt+1 ). This group further realizes that
the future policy variables are affected by the current variables according to the
policy function Φ(st+1 , τt , σt , µt ). Furthermore, this inter-temporal functional
relationship between the policy variables in periods t + 1 and t is the same as
the one existed between period t and t − 1. Put differently, what the decisive
group in period t chooses is related to st , τt−1 , σt−1 , and µt−1 in exactly the
same way (through Φ(·)) as what the decisive group in period t + 1 is expected
to be related to st+1 , τt , σt , and µt . The second exercise restricts the voting de-
cision to be cast on the belief that individuals in the same situation next period
will vote in exactly the same way. With this property, the voters in this period
know exactly how future generations will vote in exactly the same manner and
can evaluate the stream of payoffs accordingly.
    Combining all the analyses of all the three stages, the Markov-perfect polit-
ical equilibrium is the triplet of policy decisions Φd (st , e∗t ) for all d ∈ {s, u, o}
and the vector of voting decisions ei (st ) by for all i ∈ {s, u, o}, such that (i)
given the stationary Markov-perfect policy decisions, ei (st ) is the stationary
Markov-perfect optimal voting decisions for all i ∈ {s, u, o} and (ii) given the
stationary Markov-perfect voting decisions, Φd (st , e∗t ) is the stationary Markov-
perfect optimal policy decisions for all d ∈ {s, u, o}.


4     Political Equilibria: Preliminary Analysis with
      Full Discounting of the Future
To flash out best the complexity of coalition formation and its impact in shaping
the welfare state and the immigration policy, we assume for the moment that
the young native-born voters are fully discounting the future (β = 0). This
assumption will break the dynamic political-economy linkages from one period
to another, allowing us to focus primarily on just the preferences of candidates,
the voting decisions, and the coalition formation without the complication of


                                          11
the dynamic framework. We will complete the analysis in the next section by
introducing back the forward looking behavior.


4.1    Sizes of Electorates
We start by looking at which level of the state variable st each will group
constitute the “largest” group in the population (which may or may not be the
majority at ≥ 50 percent).

   • The group of the skilled native-born workers is the largest group (“the
     skilled group”) under two conditions. First, its size must dominates the
     unskilled young, and, second, it must also dominate the old cohort. Alge-
     braically, these are
                                            1
                                       st >                               (15)
                                            2
           and
                                        1 + µt−1
                             st >                      ,                  (16)
                                  1 + n + µt−1 (1 + m)
      respectively. It can be shown that, because n < m ≤ 1, only the second
      of the two conditions is sufficient.

   • The group of unskilled native-born workers is the largest group (”the un-
     skilled group”) under two similar conditions; that are reduced to just one:
                                             1 + µt−1
                            1 − st >                        .                  (17)
                                       1 + n + µt−1 (1 + m)

   • The group of old retirees is the largest group (”the old group”), when its
     size is larger than each one of the former groups, that is,
                              1 + µt−1
                                             ≥ max{st , 1 − st }.              (18)
                        1 + n + µt−1 (1 + m)

   One can demonstrate that this partitions the state space (0, 1) into three
                    n+µt−1 m
parts: when st < 1+n+µ  t−1 (1+m)
                                  (the unskilled workers are the largest group),
           h                                i
                n+µt−1 m          1+µt−1
when st ∈ 1+n+µt−1 (1+m) , 1+n+µt−1 (1+m) (the old retirees are the largest
                           1+µt−1
group, and when st > 1+n+µ    t−1 (1+m)
                                        (the skilled workers are the largest group).
     Figure 1 summarizes the ranking of the sizes of each group of voters for all
st . There are considerable shifts in sizes of voters as st moves from 0 to 1. Note
also that the old retirees will never form the smallest group in the economy.
Because our political-economic equilibrium allows for strategic voting, sizes of

these groups at different level of st will matter in determining the equilibrium
outcomes.
   The economy can go through different equilibrium paths depending on n,
m, and s0 , as follows:

    1. If n + m ≤ 0, the old group is always the majority. The tax rate is set at
       the Laffer point and the economy is fully open to skilled migration.

    2. If n+m > 0, then the dynamics depend on the initial state of the economy,
                    1+ n
       s0 . If s0 ≥ 1+n2 , then the skilled workers are the majority (controlling 50
       percent of the population), and zero tax rate with limited skilled migration
                                 n
       will be observed. If 2(1+n)    ≥ s0 , the unskilled workers are the majority,
       and there will be a positive tax rate (less than at the Laffer point) and some
       skilled migration. If n < 0, then initially the old cohort is the majority;
       the tax rate will be set at the Laffer point and the skilled migration will
       be maximal. When n ≥ 0, the policies implemented are analyzed in the
       next subsection.


4.2       Preferred Policies of the Winning Candidate
We now consider the most interesting case of n ≥ 0 and m > n > 0. It
is best to break the analysis of political equilibrium down into pieces before
reassembling them in the next subsection. In this subsection, we analyze the
preferred candidate of each type, which will be taken into account by voters when
making the voting decisions. Without future policy consideration, the policy
choice of the winning candidate is a straightforward solution to the following:

                                     Φd (st ) = arg maxV d {st , τt , σt , µt }
                                                   τt ,σt ,µt

where d ∈ {s, u, o} is the identity of the the winning candidate.
   Winning Old Candidate. If the old cohort has the winning candidate, then
the policies are straightforward as follows:
                                                                         
                                                         1
                          Φ (st ) = τto =
                             o                                o      o
                                                           , σ = 1, µt = 1 .                (19)
                                                        1+ε t
    The candidate wants maximal welfare state benefits, which means taxing to
                    1
the Laffer point ( 1+ε ). They also allow the maximal number of skilled migrants
in to the economy because of the tax contribution this generates to the welfare
system.
    Winning Unskilled Candidate. If the winning candidate belongs to the un-
skilled young-native cohort, the triplet of ideal policies can be described as
follows:
                                                                                      
                         u                       1 − J1
                        Φ (st ) =       τtu   =                     u
                                                               1 , σt   =   1, µut   =1 .   (20)

where

                                                  wts
                             (st + σt µt )        wtu          + 1 − st + (1 − σt )µt
                       J=                                    1+µt−1                         (21)

    It is interesting to note that, although the unskilled young are net benefi-
ciaries in this welfare state, they are, nevertheless, still paying taxes. Hence
the preferred tax policy of the unskilled voters is smaller than the Laffer point
with a wedge J1 . Clearly, the unskilled workers also prefer to let in more skilled
immigrants due to their contribution to the welfare state.
    The preferred tax choice of the unskilled candidate is interpreted as follows.
Letting τtu denote the tax rate preferred by the unskilled group, one can verify
                           ∂τ u
from equation (21) that ∂σtt > 0, and there exists σ such that, for any σt < σ,

we have       ∂µt    < 0. Conversely, for any σt > σ, we would get an expansion of
                                    ∂τ u
the welfare state, because ∂µtt > 0.11 Therefore, the higher number of skilled
migrants will prompt a higher demand for intra-generational redistribution.
The fiscal leakage channel shows that unskilled migration creates more fiscal
burden, such that the decisive ”unskilled” voters would rather have the welfare

                                                                                          1
that is preferred by the old retirees. The tax rate preferred by the old retirees, τto = 1+ε is
the Laffer point that attains the maximum welfare size, given immigration policies. Therefore
                                                                         1
the size of the welfare state is monotonic in the tax rate when τ ∈ [0, 1+ε ]. Thus, our use of
”shrink” and ”expand” is justified.

    Winning Skilled Candidate. If the winning candidate represents the skilled
young-native cohort, then the ideal policy to be implemented by the candidate
will be as follows:

                      Φs (st ) = (τts = 0, σts ∈ [0, 1] , µst ∈ [0, 1]) .               (22)

In this policy triplet, the skilled candidate prefer no tax as the skill young
workers are the net contributor to the welfare state. Without the tax, there will
be no transfer and hence no cost or benefits from having immigrants. Therefore,
the skilled candidate preferred immigration policy will be indeterminate.13


4.3     Three Types of Political Equilibria
Each individual naturally prefers the ideal policies of their representative can-
didate. However, strategic voting opens up the possibility of voting for someone
else that is not the most preferred candidate in order to avoid the least favorable
candidate. For the skilled workers, they prefer the least amount of taxes and
some migration. Thus, they will prefer the policy choice of the unskilled over
the old candidate because the tax rate will be lower. As for the old retirees, the
higher the transfer benefit, the better. Clearly, the unskilled candidate promises
some benefits whereas the skilled promises none, so old voters would prefer the
policies of the unskilled over the skilled candidates. In sum, since the skilled
and the old voters want to defeat the policies of one another, only two coalitions
are possible: either unskilled collude with skilled voters to upset the old voters,
or the unskilled collude with the old voters to upset the skilled voters.
     For the unskilled workers, both rankings are possible: they could either
prefer the policy choice of the skilled over the old, or vice versa. The parameters
of the model will dictate the direction of their votes. The cut-off tax policy,
τe, is the break-even point for the unskilled between getting taxed but receiving
transfer (policies of the old candidate) or pay no tax at all (policies of the skilled
  12 This resembles the results of Razin, Sadka, and Swagel (2002a, 2002b).
  13 Such an indeterminacy is easily resolved by introducing other costs or benefits of immi-
gration, or under a flexible wages scheme in which we provide a full detail in Razin, Sadka,
Suwankiri (2010).

We know that such a tax policy exists, because, taking next period’s policies
as given, the payoff in this period to the unskilled is maximized at its preferred
policy and zero at τ = 1. Therefore, at some τe, the equality will hold. This cut-
off tax rate will play an important role for the unskilled young’ voting decision.
    The first equilibrium we look at is dubbed “Intermediate” because it captures
the essence that the preferred policies of the unskilled workers are a compromise
from the extremity of the other two groups. We can show that the following
strategy profile forms a Markov-perfect equilibrium with strategic voting

where J = J(µt , σt , st , µt−1 ) is as in equation (21).
    The equilibrium features the unskilled voters always voting for their repre-
sentative, whereas the other two groups vote for their respective candidate only
if they are the largest group, or for the unskilled candidate otherwise. With
these voting strategy, if no group captures 50 percent of the voting populations,
the policy choice preferred by the unskilled candidate will prevail no matter
who are the largest group in the constituency. One notable difference is the
policy related to the immigration volume. In period t + 1, as long as the skilled
workers do not form 50 percent of the voting population, the policies preferred
by the unskilled workers will be implemented. To make sure that this is the
case, skilled migration is restricted to just the threshold that would have put
the skilled voters as the majority in period t + 1.

                                                 16
   In the preceding equilibrium, we let the preference of the skilled workers
and the old retirees decide the fate of the policies. In the following analysis, the
unskilled workers consider who they want to vote for. This will depend on how
extractive the tax policy preferred by the old is. We call the next equilibrium
”Left-winged”, because it features a welfare state of the size greater-or-equal to
that of the intermediate policy equilibrium. This may arise when the tax rate
preferred by the old voters is not excessively redistributive.

    When the tax rate preferred by the old voters is not excessively redistributive
in the eyes of the unskilled, we could have an equilibrium where the unskilled
voters strategically vote for the old candidate to avoid the policies preferred
by the skilled voters, resulting in the implementation of the preferred policy of
the old candidate even when the skilled voters form the largest group in the
constituency. This will be an equilibrium when the size of the skilled is not “too
large.” Recall that voting to implement the policies selected by the old candidate
leads to opening the economy fully to the skilled immigrants. If the size of the
skilled group is currently too large, there is a risk of making the skilled voters
the decisive majority in the next period and will result in zero social benefit
in the retirement of this period’s workers. The demographic cutoff level (st )
                                     1− m−n
before this happens is given by 1+n2 . Therefore, voting for the old will only
be compatible with the interest of the unskilled voters when the tax rate is not
excessively high and when the size of the skilled is not too large.

(23).
    When the Laffer point is higher than τe, the tax rate is considered as excessive
by the unskilled voters.14 In this case, the unskilled voters will instead choose
to vote for the skilled over the old candidate, resulting in the implementation of
the preferred policy of the skilled candidate even when the old retirees form the
largest group in the constituency. The resulting equilibrium has the size of the
welfare state less-than-or-equal to that in the intermediate policy equilibrium,
hence we refer to it as ”Right-winged.” When the tax preferred by the old is
excessive from the perspective of the unskilled, the political process could im-
plement the policies preferred by the skilled in order to avoid the worst possible
outcome. This happens when the old voters constitute the largest group, and
the unskilled voters vote strategically for the skilled candidate. In other cases,
however, the policies preferred by the unskilled will be implemented, irrespective
of the identity of the largest group in the economy.15
  14 This extreme equilibrium in fact the Laffer point is so high beyond the intertemporal
benenfit may not in fact be realistic in actual elections due to incomplete information of
supports and switching supports, see Myatt and Fisher (2001) and Myatt (2007).
  15 For our results with multidimensional policies, it is important to note here that the ranking

of candidates by individual voters allows us to escape the well-known agenda-setting cycle (the
”Condorcet paradox”). Such a cycle, which arises when any candidate could be defeated in
a pairwise majority voting competition, leads to massive indeterminacy and non-existence
of a political equilibrium. The agenda-setting cycle will have a bite if the rankings of the
candidates for all groups are unique: no group occupies the same ranked position more than
once. However, this does not arise here, because, in all equilibria, some political groups have
a common enemy. That is, because they will never vote for the least-preferred candidate

5     Political Equilibria under Forward Looking Be-
      havior
In this section, we introduce back the discount factor β ∈ [0, 1] so that the young
native-born will take into the account how their policy choices today will affect
the future political-economic dynamics.


5.1     Preferred Policies of the Winning Candidate
We first summarize what are the variables relevant for each of the three types
of voters when casting the vote in period t. First, recall that st is the variable
which describes the state of the economy. Also, each voter takes into account
how his choice of the policy variables in period t will affect the chosen policy
variables in period t + 1 which depends on st+1 (recall that the benefit he will
get in period t + 1, bt+1 , depends on τt+1 , σt+1 , and µt+1 ). Therefore each voter
will cast his vote on the set of policy variables τt , σt , and µt which maximizes
his utility given the level of st , taking also into account how this will affect st+1 .
Thus, there is a link between the policy chosen in period t to the one chosen in
period t + 1.
    The mechanism (policy rule or function) that characterizes the choice of the
policy variables (τt , σt , and µt ) relates the choice in any period to the choice
of the preceding period (τt−1 , σt−1 , and µt−1 ). This choice depend also on
the current state of the economy, st . Thus, we are looking for a triplet policy

where V d is the indirect utility function of the decisive voter d.
(the ”common” enemy), the agenda-setting cycle breaks down to determinate policies above,
albeit their multiplicity. This occurs when voters agree on who is the least-preferred candidate
and act together to block her from winning the election. The literature typically avoids the
Condorcet paradox by restricting political preferences with some ad hoc assumptions. For our
case, the preferences induced from economic assumption lead to an automatic reduction of
dimensions, hence providing an escape from the Condorcet paradox. For further discussions
on agenda-setting cycle, see Drazen (2000, page 71-72), and Persson and Tabellini (2000, page
29-31).

the more interesting case in which Ψ > 0 (we will provide detailed interpreta-
tions below). In that case, the unskilled young is the most numerous and forward
looking. According to the policy rules, the policy should lean towards admitting
more skilled immigrants, albeit restricting the size of immigration to ensure that
the unskilled will control the voting power when old. Thus st would increase,
but not at the fastest rate. The fastest increase in st will come when the old
agents control the voting power and maximally admit skilled immigrants into
the country. The rate of increase in sth will be the fastest when the old                i retirees

fore, due to the increase in welfare benefit from admitting skilled immigrants,
st will continue to increase to the point where the largest group in the economy
                                                                                1+µt−1

5.2     Interpreting the Results: Migration and Tax Policies
The intuition for the aforementioned results is as follows. The skilled is the net
contributor to the welfare state, while the other two groups are net beneficiaries.
We refer to Figure 1 for illustration. Preferences of the old retirees are simple.
If the old cohort is the largest, it wants maximal welfare state benefits, which
                                       1
means taxing to the Laffer point ( 1+ε   ). They also allow the maximal number of
skilled migrants in to the economy because of the tax contribution this generates
to the welfare system.
    It is interesting to note that, although the unskilled young are net beneficia-
ries in this welfare state, they are, nevertheless, still paying taxes. Hence the
preferred tax policy of the unskilled voters is smaller than the Laffer point with

a wedge J1 , as previously described. Clearly, the unskilled workers also prefer
to let in more skilled immigrants due to their contribution to the welfare state.
How many will they let in depends on the function Ψ, which weighs the future
benefits against the cost at the present. Basically, if the unskilled workers are
not forward-looking, it is in their best interest to let in as many skilled migrants
as possible. However, this will lead to no redistribution in the next period
because the skilled workers will be the largest. Hence, the function Ψ is the
difference between the benefits they get by being, as they are, forward-looking
and being myopic.
    The skilled native-born young prefer more skilled migrants for a different
reason than the earlier two groups. They prefer to let in skilled migrants in
this case because this will provide a higher number of skilled native workers in
the next period. Thus, because the skilled are forward-looking, they too will
prefer to have more skilled workers in their retirement period. However, they
cannot let in too many of them because their high birth rate may render the
skilled young in the next period as the largest group who will vote to abolish
the welfare state altogether.
    A common feature among models with Markov-perfect equilibrium is the
idea that today’s voters have the power to influence the identity of future policy
makers. Such feature is also prominent in our analysis here. As previously
pointed out in Dolmas and Huffman (2004), Ortega (2005), and Sand and Razin
(2007), future political influence of migrants will matter for the decision on
immigration policy today. The migration policy of either young group reflects
this fact that they may want to put themselves as the largest group in the
next period. Thus, instead of letting in too many migrants, who will give
birth to a large new skilled generation, they will want to let in as much as
possible before the threshold is crossed. This threshold is 1−(1+n)s
                                                                   m

st = 1 gets the same result as Sand and Razin (2007). There are two differences
nonetheless. First, the equilibrium here has a bite even if the population growth
rate is positive, which cannot be done when there are only young and old cohort,
unless there is a negative population growth rate as in their work. Another
fundamental difference is that, in order to have some transfer in the economy,
the young decisive largest group has a choice of placing the next period’s decisive
power either in the hand of next period’s unskilled or the old. So we need to
verify an additional condition that it is better for this period’s decisive young
to choose the old generation next period, which is the case.

    When st ≥ 1+n   , we have a unique situation (which is only possible when
n > 0). In this range of values, the number of skilled is growing too fast to be
curbed by reducing migration volume alone. To ensure that the decisive power
of the next period lands in the right hand, that is, the old, the skilled voters
(who are the largest in this period) must make the unskilled cohort grow to
weigh down the growth rate of the skilled workers. This is done by restricting
both the skill composition as well as the size of total migration.17
    In the Appendix we analyze the dynamics of the political equilibrium. That
is, how the migration and fiscal policies are implemented by various coalitions,
depending on the evolution of the state variable, st .


6     Concluding Remarks
We develop and analyze a Pay-as-you-go (PAYG) welfare system and migra-
tion policies in a political economy model that provides a resolution to tensions
across generations and income groups. We built a dynamic political-economic
model featuring three distinct voting groups: skilled workers, unskilled workers,
and retirees, with both inter- and intra-generational redistribution, resembling
a welfare state. The skilled workers are net contributors to the welfare state
whereas the unskilled workers and old retirees are net beneficiaries. We char-
acterize the political-economic equilibria of the tax rate, skill composition, and
the total number of immigrants.
    We adopt the electoral system as studied by Osborne and Slivinski (1996)
and Besley and Coate (1997), known as the citizen-candidates model. Each
of the three distinct voting groups presents a candidate who will implement
the most preferred policy of his group, if elected. When one of these groups
enjoy a majority (that is, it constitutes more than 50 percent of the voters),
then its candidate automatically wins the election and implements his most
preferred policy. We note that the current preferred policy (especially with
respect to immigration) takes in to account how immigration may change the
composition of the voters in each group and, consequently, the policy that will
be implemented in the future.18
   17 Empirically, with the population growth rate of the major host countries for migration

like the U.S. and Europe going below 1%, it is unlikely that this case should ever be of much
concern. Barro and Lee (2000) provides an approximation of the size of the skilled. While
Barro and Lee statistics capture those 25 years and above, they also cite OECD statistics
which capture age group between 25 and 64. The percentage of this group who received
tertiary education or higher in developed countries falls in the range of 15% to 47%.
   18 For instance, the current political debate in the U.S. about the path to citizenship of the




                                               24
    When no group enjoys the majority, there is effectively a (“second round”)
run-off between two candidates representing the two largest group of voters.
The third group, the smallest, will vote for the candidate of that one of the two
largest groups whose most preferred policy is better for the third group, even
though this policy is not the most preferred policy by the third group.
    The model is designed to make a three dimensional policy choice in such
a way that there are a clear “left” group, a “center” group, and a “right”
group. The left group consists of the old native-born and the old first-generation
immigrants (both skilled and unskilled) who earn no income and wish to extend
as much as possible the generosity of the welfare state. They prefer to admit as
much as possible skilled immigrants to help finance the generosity of the welfare
state. The right group consists of the native-born skilled workers who bear
the lion share of financing the welfare state and wish therefore to downscale
its generosity as much as possible. The attitude of this group toward skilled
immigrants is subject to two conflicting considerations. On the one hand, they
benefit from the contribution of the skilled immigrants to the financing of the
welfare state which alleviate the burden on them. On the other hand, they are
aware that the offspring of the skilled immigrants will vote to downscale the
generosity of the welfare state in the next period, when the members of this
right group turn older and benefit from the generosity of the welfare state. This
consideration is amplified by the fact that the fertility rate of immigrants is
higher than that of the native-born.
    The center group consists of the native-born unskilled young. They do like
the generous welfare state but not as much as the old because they also pay for
it. They like it more than the native-born skilled young because they pay less for
it making them still a net beneficiary. With respect to immigration, they (like
the native-born skilled young) face two conflicting effects. On the one hand,
they would like to admit skilled immigrants who contribute positively towards
the finances of the welfare state at the current period. But, on the other hand,
they are concerned that the skilled offsprings of these skilled migrants will tilt
the political balance of power in favor of the skilled in the next period; and,
consequently, against the generosity of the welfare state. The center group is
pro skilled immigrant than the left group, but similar in attitude to the right
group.
    The evolution of the fiscal and immigration policy of the economy over time
depends naturally on the state at which it starts. The state of this stylized
existing illegal immigrants is affected by current expectations about how these new citizens
may affect the composition of the future voters.

economy depends exclusively on the share st of the native-born skilled young in
the total native-born young population.
    We find that there are several decisive ranges for this share which determine
which of the three groups most preferred policies will be implemented. These
ranges are arranged from the lowest values of st (starting from 0) to the largest
values of st (ending at 1). We note also that these ranges depend on the fertility
rates of the native-born and the first-generation immigrants.
    When st falls in the lowest range, the most preferred policy that will be
implemented is that of the center group (the native-born unskilled young). In
this case, this group forms a majority and its candidate is able to implement
his most preferred policy: moderate welfare-state generosity with large, but no
extreme, influx of skilled immigrants only. Therefore, the share of the native-
born skilled grows over time. Eventually st enters the next range.
    When st falls in the next range, the center group is still the largest group,
but does not constitute majority. The native-born skilled is the smallest group
in this case. This latter group, being on the right, always prefers the most
preferred policy of the center group than the most preferred policy of the left
group (the old). Therefore, the most preferred policy of the center will still be a
winning one, though by a coalition (with the right) in this case, rather than by
a sheer majority of the center group. Note that this policy increases over time
the share st of the native-born skilled, and eventually st enters the next range.
    When st moves into the next range, then the left group (the old) is the largest
group, but does not constitute a majority. The right group (the native-born
skilled) is the smallest group. In this case, the center group (the native-born
unskilled) will join a coalition led by the left, provided that the preferred tax
rate of the left group is not excessive. The candidate representing the left group
wins and the most preferred policy of the left will be implemented: an extreme
generosity of the welfare state and an extreme influx of skilled immigrants.
Consequently, st continues to rise, and so on. Eventually, when st becomes
sufficiently large, the right group (the native-born skilled) becomes the largest
group and its candidate will get to implement the group’s most preferred policy:
the generosity of the welfare state will be severely downscaled. All will be
concerned that admitting more skilled immigrants will render the skilled in the
next period an unbeatable majority. This will cut severely their benefit when
they grow old, in the next period. This future threat on the welfare state
balances the dynamics forces to change st and it stops rising. Only limited
skilled immigrants will be allowed, and st will enter the steady-state.
    Naturally, a lower rate of population growth (that is, an aging population)


                                        26
increases the political clout of the old (the left group). But it also increases
the burden on the young (particularly, the skilled). Ageing therefore has two
conflicting effects on the coalition formation, similarly to Razin , Sadka, and
Swagel (2002a). The implications of aging for the political-economy evolution
is left for further research.

A     Skill Dynamics
In this appendix, we turn our attention to the dynamics of the economy. With
multiple equilibria and no equilibrium selection mechanism, it is almost im-
possible to precisely trace out the dynamics of economy. Fortunately, we can
impose one additional assumption about strategic voting to narrow immensely
down the dimensions spanned by all equilibrium paths. Theoretical studies into
Duvergerian outcome such as Cox (1997) led to a conclusion that supporters
of lower-ranked challengers may choose to abandon their preferred candidate
to vote instead for one of the two most popular leading candidates. As Myatt
and Fisher (2001) put it, “[s]ometimes voters would rather abandon their pre-
ferred candidate to vote for another with a better chance of winning so as best
to influence the outcome of the election.” Such a switch may further trigger a
bandwagon effect of more switching from lower-ranked to the top-two runners.
In the extreme case, the process continues until we reach a Duvergerian equi-
librium, only two candidates receive votes, while the rest receive none. In light
of this literature, we further assume that in most of the time only the smallest
group of the time t can vote strategically at that time t unless not supported by
the voting equilibrium, in which case, we will apply the voting equilibrium which
appears to most resemble a Schelling’s focal point (Schelling, 1980). Equipped
with this new assumption, we can partition the state space into different seg-
ments according voting h strategy as follows. 
                               n+mµt−1
    First, when st ∈ 0, 2(1+n+µ    t−1 (1+m))
                                               , the unskilled workers from the de-
cisive majority, and elect their candidate to implement their most preferred
policies: intermediate welfare state with some skilled immigrants, but not the
maximal admission (recall that they must be careful with skilled immigration
policy not to place the skilled offsprings as the decisive majority in the next pe-
riod hwhen they are old). In this region,strategic voting does not matter. When
            n+mµt−1           n+mµt−1
st ∈ 2(1+n+µ             ,
               t−1 (1+m)) 1+n+µt−1 (1+m)
                                           , the unskilled group is the largest, but
not majority, the skilled group is the smallest. However, there is no strategic
voting from the skilled voters to the old candidate as they stand on the opposite
end of political spectrum. To the skilled, policies of the unskilled candidate are
already more hattractive than the policies of the old candidate. The next region
                     n+mµt−1
is when st ∈ 1+n+µ              , 1 , in which the old forms the largest group in
                       t−1 (1+m) 2
the economy with the skilled being the smallest group. In this case, the skilled
voters will strategically vote for the unskilled candidate to avoid Laffer point


                                        32
tax rate and maximal skilled migration. The collusion will be enough to over-
come the size of old voters and push for implementation of the policies
                                                                      h       preferred
                                                                                  
                                                                          1− m−n
by the unskilled candidate (given that n + m > 0). As st ∈ 21 , 1+n2 , the
largest group is still the old voters, while the smallest group switches to be the
                                                                      1
unskilled voters. If the Laffer tax rate is not too extractive ( 1+ε     ≤ τe), the un-
skilled will not vote strategically for the skilled candidate. But if the tax rate is
                  1
too extractive ( 1+ε  > τe), the unskilled will strategically vote for the skilled can-
didate to defeat the old candidate, hence implementing     h the  preferred policies of
                                                                                      i
                                                             1− m−n        1+µt−1
the skilled candidate. A special case arises when st ∈        1+n
                                                                 2
                                                                    ,  1+n+µt−1 (1+m) ,
the region in which the size of skilled is currently too large for the unskilled
voters to risk putting the skilled voters as the decisive majority in the next
period, killing the chance of having any welfare state in retirement. Hence both
voting strategically or sincerely by the unskilled voters are no longer supported
as an equilibrium unless the skilled voters choose to vote strategically for the
unskilled candidate (the candidate  with the smallest support) in order   to defeat
                    19                    1+µt−1        2+n+µt−1 (2+m)
the old candidate. When st ∈ 1+n+µt−1 (1+m) , 2(1+n+µt−1 (1+m)) , the skilled
is now the largest group while the unskilled is the smallest group. However,
since the size of skilled group is already so large, the unskilled voters will not
vote strategically for the old candidate who will maximal open the economy to
skilled migrants. Here, we again appeal the Schelling point’s argument. While
after observing the state variable, the old voters realize that their old candi-
date will not receive the strategic support from the unskilled voters and has no
chance of defeating the skilled candidate. However, since the old voters prefer
the policies of the unskilled over the skilled candidate, the unskilled voters know
that the old voters are willing to support the unskilled candidate and its policy.
Hence, the coalition with the old voters voting strategically for the unskilled
candidate will be enough to defeat thehstatus quo, the preferred i       policies of the
                                             2+n+µt−1 (2+m)
skilled candidate. Lastly, when st ∈ 2(1+n+µt−1 (1+m)) , 1 , the skilled voters
form the decisive majority and implement their preferred policies irrespective
of strategic voters.20
  19 Alternatively, the unskilled may choose to take a bitter pill by voting strategically for the

skilled candidate in order to defeat the old candidate under the condition that the forgone
welfare benefit today must be less than the discounted benefit in retirement. Otherwise,
we revert back to what we think as more sensible collusion of skilled and unskilled for the
intermediate policies preferred by unskilled candidate (Schelling point). This after all is an
improvement for both the skilled and unskilled voters over the status quo (policies of the old).
  20 You may notice that the old voters are never the smallest group. This can be proven

formally as follows. Suppose to the contrary that the old voters are the smallest group, that
              1+µ                             1+µ
is st > 1+n+µ t−1   (1+m)
                           and 1 − st > 1+n+µ t−1   (1+m)
                                                          . Adding the two inequalities yield
               t−1                               t−1




                                               33
    Below we explicitly write out the voting equilibrium associated with each
partition of the state space. Voting vectors are in rows, so the first, second,
and last row correspond to votes cast by the skilled, unskilled, and old voters
respectively. The columns denote to whom the votes were casted for with the
first, second, and last column correspond to voting for skilled, unskilled, and old
candidate, respectively. Therefore, any off-diagonal vote imply strategic voting.

    The dynamics of the economy are given as follows for the case of 1+ε                ≤ τe:
1        1+µ                                                          1+µ

   > 1+n+µ t−1         . However, some algebra will reveal that 1+n+µ t−1        ∈ [ 21 , 1] which
             t−1 (1+m)                                                t−1 (1+m)
produces a contradiction. Intuitively, for the old voters to be the smallest group, population
growth rates must be 100% or higher! Otherwise, which ever way we slice the young generation
into skilled and unskilled, one group will always be smaller than the old group.

It is worthwhile to note that, although the dynamics appear similar to the sincere
voting case, the voting game is much more complex than the above equations
appear.

     For the case 1+ε > τe, the Laffer tax rate to too extractive for the unskilled
workers, so the skilled and unskilled have incentives to try to block the old
candidate from coming into power. In this case, there is no strategic voting
from the unskilled voters h to the old candidate,
                                                     only for the skilled candidate.
                            1      1+µt−1
In this case, when st ∈ 2 , 1+n+µt−1 (1+m) , the strategic coalition would suc-
cessfully push for to implement of policies of the skilled candidate (unskilled
voters vote strategically under the assumption that the smallest group will do
                      (1+m)(2+n)−(1+n)(2+m)st
so), hence st+1 = (1+m)(2+n)−(1+n)(2+m(2−s     t ))
                                                    . As the skilled voters form the
                             1+µt−1
largest group, or st ≥ 1+n+µ   t−1 (1+m)
                                         , two possible coalitions could form in
equilibrium. First, as in the ”Right-winged” voting equilibrium above, the old
voters could strategically vote for the unskilled candidate on top of votes by
the unskilled voters to ensure the survival of the welfare state. However, if
       1− m−n
st ≥ 1+n2 , the size of skilled voters is already too large for fully opening
the economy to skilled migration, so a coalition between skilled and unskilled
voters comes into effect (which fits the above assumption that only the small-
est group vote strategically). The second h type of coalition continues
                                                                  i     until the
                                             2+n+µt−1 (2+m)
skilled voters form the majority or st ∈ 2(1+n+µ   t−1 (1+m))
