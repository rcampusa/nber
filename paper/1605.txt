           Paying the Piper Calling the Tune:
                 Implications of Changes
                    in Reimbursement

     The United States is in the midst of a revolution in health

care finance, the third since the end of World War II. Medicare's

prospective payment system (PPS) based on diagnosis—related

groups (DRGs), the State of California's hospital—specific con-

tracts for Medi—Cal patients, deductibles and coinsurance, health

maintenance organizations (HMOs), and preferred provider organi-

zations (PPOs) are among the best known symbols of the new era in

health care finance. This paper analyzes the economic factors

responsible for innovations in reimbursement, discusses the dis-

tinguishing characteristics of the new methods, and examines

their potential impact on hospitals, physicians, nurses, and

patients. The paper concludes by considering some fundamental

problems of public policy with respect to health care.

        The financing of health care in the United States has

undergone three revolutions since the end of World War II. First

there was the extraordinarily rapid diffusion of private health

insurance between 1945 and 1960. In only 15 years the number of

persons with hospital insurance jumped from 32 million to 122

million, and the number with physician expense protection soared

from less than 5 million to more than 83 million. Second, there

was the 1965 legislation that created Medicare and Medicaid. This

stroke of the pen provided substantial health insurance coverage

to many additional millions of Americans among the elderly and

poor.

        The third major change began tentatively in the 1970s when a

few states began experimenting with regulation of hospital

reimbursement. This movement accelerated in the early 1980s as

both the private and public sectors embraced large—scale, radical

alterations in the reimbursement of hospitals and physicians.

Medicare's prospective payment system (PPS) based on diagnosis—

related groups (DRGs), the State of California's hospital—

specific contracts for Medi—Cal patients, deductibles and
coinsurance, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and

preferred provider organizations (PPOs) are among the best known

symbols of a new era in health care finance.

    This third transformation is more difficult to define than

the previous two, and it is far from completed. It may, however,

prove to be the most revolutionary of the three. Certainly from

the point of view of health care providers, the new methods of

reimbursement have implications far greater than those stemming

from the spread of private insurance or the introduction of

Medicare and Medicaid. The latter two movements increased demand

for medical care, regularized payment and made it more secure,

and increased equality of access. Neither movement, however,

threatened the traditional system of organization and delivery of

care. Private insurance companies were extremely loathe to

challenge the behavior of physicians or hospitals, and the

Medicare and Medicaid legislation stated specifically that there

was to be no interference with traditional practice.

     The current revolution in reimbursement starts from a

different premise. The "third parties" (government and business)

who have been "paying the piper" have decided to "call the tune."

Far from promising not to change the system, they frequently have

change as a major objective. The primary purpose of this paper is

to consider the economic and ethical implications of these

changes. It will look at possible effects on patients as well as

providers and on medical education and research as well as on

patient care. Implications for efficiency in the allocation of

resources, for distributional equity, and for other ethical



                                  2
problems will also be discussed. The paper begins with an

analysis of why these changes have been introduced, followed by a

brief discussion of their distinguishing characteristics. The

next section examines their potential impact, and the final

section highlights the fundamental policy issues that must be

addressed by any system of health care finance.

                       I. Recent Changes


Economic Background

     Health policy traditionally encompasses three major areas:

access to care, the health of the population, and the

cost of care. In the 1950s and 1960s the first two concerns were

dominant, Numerous health policy initiatives ranging from

expansion of medical education and research to the introduction

of Medicare and Medicaid were undertaken with the goals of

eliminating barriers to access and improving the health of the

population. Costs were secondary, and frequently were not

considered at all.

     In these two primary areas of concern, considerable progress

was achieved. Disparities in access to care across income groups

and between whites and nonwhites were sharply reduced. Delays in

admission to hospitals were virtually eliminated; indeed, most

hospitals now report excess capacity. As surpluses of medical and

surgical specialists in the larger cities developed, more

physicians began to locate in smaller cities and towns. Many of

these changes are directly attributable to specific health policy

initiatives.

     The past twenty years have also witnessed extraordinary

improvements in the health of the population, including a 60

percent reduction in infant mortality (to 10 per 1,000 live

births) and very large declines in age—adjusted death rates from

influenza and pneumonia, heart disease, and stroke. Unlike the

gains in access, it is more difficult to tie these advances in



                                  14
health to specific policies or programs, but it is likely that

thenumerous public policy initiatives played some positive role.

        As these gains were unfolding in the 1970s, the nation

became increasingly aware of the high and rapidly rising cost of

medical care. The health sector, which in 1950 had used only -L4

percent of the nation's output, had grown to 6.1 percent by 1965,

to 9.4   percent   by 1980, and to 10.8 percent by 1983. The cost

problem, which had been building throughout the period, became

critical in the late 1970s and the early 1980s because the

economy as a whole grew very slowly while health expenditures

kept increasing at an extremely rapid pace. Figure 1 shows that

the annual percentage changes in gross national product and

health expenditures tend to follow the same pattern. (Both series

have been adjusted for inflation and population growth and

smoothed with a five—year moving average.) In the late 197Os and

early 1980s, however, the rate of growth of the GNP fell to less

than one percent per annum while real health expenditures per

capita continued to increase at more than four percent. The

health care system is like an 80,000 ton ocean liner going full

speed ahead; it can't be turned around on a dime. But sooner or

later health spending must reflect the country's underlying

economic capacity.

    The problem can be seen even more clearly in Figure 2, which

shows the difference between changes in health spending and

changes in the GNP. This "gap" is a measure of the rate at which

labor   and capital flow to the heJth sector away frcn the rest of
the economy. When this gap reached 4 percent per annum in the
late 1970s and early 1980s, the health sector's share of GNF grew

from 9 percent to 10 percent in less than three years.

     If the overall economy resumes and maintains a more rapid

rate of growth, as it did in 1983 and 1984, the gap should

decrease. But there is a second problem with respect to cost: the

size of the gap in the long run. Over the past 30 years the gap

has averaged 2.7 percent per annum. If a gap of this magnitude

were to continue for another 30 years, health spending would grow

to over 20 percent of the gross national product. It seems highly

likely that the other sectors of the economy will make strenuous

efforts to prevent that from happening.

     Resistance to the expansion of the health sector mounts

because the larger that sector is, the more it takes away from

other sectors when its rate of growth exceeds that of the economy

as a whole. When the health sector was only 5 percent of the

Gross National Product, the large gap increased its share to 10

percent, thus taking away five percentage points from the rest of

the economy. But now that the share is 10 percent of GNP, the

same gap over the same number of years would raise the share to

almost 20 percent, thus taking away 10 percentage points from the

rest of the economy. The larger any sector is relative to the

total economy, the more difficult it is for it to grow faster

than the total. Even a two percent gap for 30 years would put

health at 17 percent of the GNP. But a smaller gap means a slower

rate of growth for the health sector unless the GNP grows very

rapidly.

     These overall macroeconomic considerations have had special

force within the federal government and have contributed to a



                                  8
sense of panic, as shown in Table 1. We see in the fifth row the

familiar increase in health spending as a percentage of GNP. We

also can note the federal government's increased share of health

spending (row 6) and perhaps most important of all, the rise in

federal health spending as a share of total federal spending

(row 7). The federal government faces a tremendous deficit, now,

and for several years ahead. It must hold down spending, or raise

taxes appreciably. One result is a strenuous effort to curb

federal spending for health.

     The private sector also feels the squeeze, as may be seen in

Table 2, which highlights the growth of private health insurance

premiums. Increases in these premiums in the short run are paid

mostly by business corporations as employee benefits. In that

sense, in the short run they come out of profits. We can see that

in 1950 these premiums were less than six percent of profits, but

by 1980 they were 4O percent. In the long run, these payments

come out of the real compensation of employees (in the form of

lower wages or higher prices). It is also relevant, therefore, to

note how rapidly these premiums have risen as a share of

disposable personal income. In short, there is widespread

interest and concern about health spending because it looms so

large in both public and private budgets.

     To be sure, an increase in a sector's share of GNP need not

automatically be cause for alarm. There is nothing sacred about

five percent of GNP, or 10 percent. Why   not   20 percent? In a

dynamic market economy some sectors will grow and some will

shrink as a resuat of changes in demand and supply, and if the

health sector grows——so what? In general, economic theory

supports this view——but there is something peculiar about health

spending, namely the importance of third—party payment. Both

theory   and empirical research suggest that private and public

insurance programs bias the system toward "over—utilization."

     When consumers pay for goods and services directly, they

tend to balance the costs of what they buy against the benefits

they expect to receive. When insurance is present, however, the

patient will want, and the responsive physician will choose, an

amount of care where the cost to society of the additional care

exceeds the benefit to the patient. Deductibles and coinsurance

can alleviate this problem a little, but most Americans want to

be insured against large health care expenditures. Thus a

fundamental problem of health care policy is how to provide

insurance without pushing utilization far beyond the point where

the additional benefit is equal to the additional cost.

     To summarize: recent changes in reimbursement primarily

reflect a desire to curb spending——a desire that arises for three

principal reasons. First, the slow growth of the economy in the

late 1970s and early 1980s was not accompanied by an equivalent

slowing in health spending. Thus the gap between the two growth

rates became alarmingly large. Second, health spending now takes

such a large fraction of public and private budgets, it is

questionable whether even the average gap of the past three

decades (about 2.7 percent per annum) can be sustained. Third,

the large role played by third—party payment has raised doubts

whether the benefits to patients from additional spending are

equal to the cost to society of providing the additional care.



                                  12
       A fourth reason, probably less important from a long—run

perspective, is that the country is currently in a pause or even

a retreat from the thrust toward more equal access to care. Some,

but not all, of the cutbacks in funding and changes in methods of

reimbursement can be interpreted as a weakening of the commitment

to provide high quality care to the poor. This aspect will be

discussed further in sections II and III.



General Characteristics

       Significant changes in health care finance have occurred in

almost every sector of the economy. The federal government has

radically altered hospital reimbursement for Medicare patients;

several state governments regulate hospital rates for all types

of patients; other states have installed special cost containment

programs for Medicaid patients; participation in health

maintenance organizations has been growing at an unprecedentedly

rapid rate; health care providers and health insurance companies

are experimenting with a variety of new types of coverage which

channel patients to "preferred providers" in exchange for
discounts in fees and charges; and many conventional insurance

policies are being changed to include larger deductibles and

coinsurance.

      With such a diverse set of changes   under way, it   is not easy

to provide a brief summary of their characteristics. Indeed,

apart from a desire to contain costs, there is probably no

characteristic that is common to jj new programs. There are,

however, a few features that are sufficiently general to warrant

a   brief discussion.

                                   13
      1. Much of the recent emphasis is on changes that lower

costs for specific payers. Many previous policy proposals were

aimed at containing costs for the health care system as a whole,

e.g., Main Enthoven's Consumer Choice Health Plan, or President

Carter's proposal to cap hospital expenditures. With the

exception of the all—payer hospital regulations in a few states,

this is not true of recent cost containment initiatives. For

example, Medicare's Prospective Payment System is designed to

lower costs for Medicare. The State of California's hospital

specific contracts for Medi—Cal (Medicaid) patients is designed

to save money for the government of California. The insurer

initiated preferred provider organizations and prudent buyer

plans are explicitly intended to lower costs for the initiators

of these plans.

      There may be nothing wrong with this competitive,

individualistic approach. Indeed, it may be the only way to

obtain rapid change in a system that previously seemed rooted in

"business as usual." Ever since Adam Smith, economists have been

intrigued by the observation that an individual "by pursuing his

own   interest   .   . . frequently   promotes that of the society more

effectually than when he really intends to promote it" (Smith,

1776). Economists have also discovered, however, that the

individualistic approach does not always lead to socially optimal

results. Later in this paper we will consider some possible

adverse consequences of a free market solution to problems of

health insurance and health care.

     2. Payment for individual tests, visits, days in hospital,

and the like are being replaced by global payments for an illness

episode, a hospital admission, or for a year of care regardless

of services used (capitation).

     3.    Reimbursement rates are set prospectively rather than

retrospectively. This change is often described as the end of

"cost based reimbursement," but that is not the most accurate

description. Costs of production will continue to play a major

role in the determination of health care prices, just as they do

in virtually all markets, including the most competitive. What is

disappearing is the willingness of payers to pay retrospectively

based on cost rather than knowing in advance what the price will

be. Buyers are now negotiating in advance for a particular

package of services.

     )4•   Consumers must make more choices and accept more

financial responsibility for their choices. In the past, many

employers offered a single health plan to their workers. Now it

is not unusual for employees to choose among conventional

reimbursement insurance, a closed panel prepaid group practice, a

preferred provider plan, and still other forms of payment and

organization. Moreover, within the conventional reimbursement

mode there are frequently choices to be made about the size of

the deductible and the percentage of coinsurance. Those consumers

who choose a preferred provider plan frequently have the option

to obtain care outside the plan if they are willing to pay a

larger coinsurance percentage.




                                  15
               II. Implications of Recent Changes


     Just as it is difficult to generalize about the

characteristics of recent changes in reimbursement, it is also

difficult to generalize about their likely effects. Each

innovation in organization and finance has its own special thrust

and its own special economic and ethical implications.

Furthermore, most of' the changes are very recent; not enough time

has elapsed to collect and analyze reliable measures of their

impact. This section, therefore, is primarily speculative. I draw

on economic theory to infer the likely effects of changes from

retrospective to prospective payment and from reimbursement for

individual services to global reimbursement. I also consider the

implications of increased competition in insurance and medical

care markets, and of greater use of deductibles and coinsurance

on efficiency and equity. Inferences from theory are supplemented

by the results of demonstrations and experiments in health care

reform.



Economic Implications

     The primary purpose of recent changes in organization and

finance is to slow the rate of increase in health care spending.

It seems likely that they will have this effect, at least in the

short run. This will come about primarily because the incentives

and constraints facing the key decision makers——physicians,

hospital administrators, insurance buyers, and patients——will be

different from those they faced in the past.



                                 16
     Physicin. The most important     impact   on physicians will

probably come from the shift to global forms of reimbursement. As

long as physicians are reimbursed for each service individually,

there is less reason for them to question the incremental value

of each additional visit, test, X—ray, and the like. Global

reimbursement for an episode of illness, however, or for a year

of care regardless of services provided (as in capitation

payment) will give physicians great incentive to consider the

incremental value of what they do. Furthermore, as more

physicians assume some financial responsibility for the hospital

care, prescriptions, and other dimensions of care that they

order, they will have greater incentive to question the value of

that care.

     The best example of this phenomenon is the lower hospital

utilization in prepaid group practice plans [Luft, 1981]. In the

past some skeptics argued that lower hospital utilization in

Kaiser, the Group Health Cooperative, and other prepaid group

practices was the result of patient differences. They claimed

that patients who needed or wanted less hospitalization sought

out the prepaid plans. However, a prospective, controlled

experiment that randomly assigned patients to a prepaid plan or

conventional insurance demonstrated the same difference in

hospital utilization that was observed in less adequately

controlled studies [Manning et al., 19814].

     Hospita' administrators. While there is no completely

satisfactory model of a nonprofit hospital or of the behavior of

hospital administrators, there are a few generalizations that

conrnand wide agreement. The primary job of a hospital


                                 17
administrator is to keep other people happy, or, if not happy, at

least not QQ. unhappy. The "other people" are the physicians who

bring patients to the hospital, the patients themselves, the

employees who work in the hospital, and the trustees who can hire

and fire the administrator. Each of these constituencies has

different and sometimes conflicting goals. The physician wants

the hospital to have the most modern technical facilities, a

large high—quality staff of nurses, technicians, and other

personnel, and considerable excess capacity to reduce the

possibility of delays in admission or services for the patient

once admitted. The patients typically want high quality care and

amenities; price is rarely of concern because hospital insurance

is widespread and usually comprehensive. The nurses, technicians,

and other employees want good wages and working conditions, and

the opportunity to provide high quality care. The trustees

typically want to be associated with a high quality hospital that

delivers excellent care and that enjoys a good reputation in the

community. The latter may entail providing care for those in need

regardless of ability to pay. All groups want the hospital to

remain solvent, but in the past that was usually taken for granted.

     Under the traditional system of retrospective reimbursement

based on incurred costs, most of the pressures on the

administrator were in the direction of improving quality

regardless of the effect on cost. A reimbursement system such as

Medicare's Prospective Payment System dramatically changes the

balance of pressure. Under the new system there is a real

prospect that the hospital will not have enough revenue to cover



                                 10
                                  U
its costs. The need to stay solvent was always one of the

implicit pressures on the administrator, but now it has become

explicit. Physicians begin to realize that the increased cost of

new equipment and additional personnel won't necessarily be

matched by increased revenue; if the hospital is forced out of

business it will not be there to receive their patients. The

employees begin to realize that higher wages or greater fringe

benefits cannot automatically be covered by higher charges. Faced

with the prospect of deficits and even bankruptcy, the trustees

start changing the questions they ask and the pressures they put

on the administrator. There is nothing that can match red ink for

attracting the attention of trustees of hospitals or other

organizations.

     Health insurance companies. Increased competition in health

insurance markets will also tend to restrain the growth of

expenditures for health care. Both public and private insurers

are abandoning their laissez—faire attitude toward physicians and

hospitals in two important ways: they are bargaining about

price, and they are insisting on controls over utilization.

Individual insurance companies now have little choice in the

matter because if they do not move in a cost restraining

direction they will lose out to those companies that do.

     Patients. Those patients who continue to have "wall—to—

wall" coverage under conventional insurance will continue to want

"everything possible." An increasing proportion of patients,

however, will be paying for some of their care directly, through

deductibles and coinsurance. The basic law of demand says that an

increase in the price of a commodity results in a decrease in the


                                 19
quantity demanded. The Rand heaJt.h insurance experiment ENewhouse

et al., 1981] demonstrated conclusively that medical care is nc

an exception. Families with complete insurance coverage (no

deductibles or coinsurance) used substantially more physicians'

services and had more hospital admissions than did families who

had to pay for a portion of the bill at the time of utilization.

     The growing use of deductibles and coinsurance in private

insurance and government programs is likely to decrease the

demand for medical care. How this will affect the quantity and

price of care will depend on the sensitivity of supply to price

change. In the short run, when supply is likely to be quite

inelastic, the decrease in demand will result in a small decrease

in quantity and large downward pressure on price. In the long

run, when supply is more elastic, the primary effect of a

decrease in demand will be on quantity, with a smaller effect on

price. All of the above assumes no shifting of demand. If

suppliers, faced with decreasing demand, can in part offset the

decrease by recommending more care, the declines in quantity and

price will be smaller than otherwise. Global forms of

reimbursement and direct controls on utilization, however, will

tend to restrain the ability of suppliers to shift demand.

     Differential impacts. While the general effect of

reimbursement changes is to restrain the growth of expenditures,

the impact will vary for hospitals, physicians, and nurses. Most

of the belt—tightening is likely to be felt by hospitals, for

several reasons. First, it is tempting to try to control hospital

costs because they are such a large part of the total (over 4O



                                 20
percent) and have been rising especially rapidly. Second, it is

easier to control payments to a few thousand hospitals than to

hundreds of thousands of physicians. Third, most of the demand

for hospital services is generated by physician decisions. As

physicians begin to realize that money spent for hospital care is

money that could be spent for their services, they are likely to

hospitalize patients less. At first, it will be possible to do

this without seriously jeopardizing patients' health, as has been

demonstrated with shorter lengths of stay and ambulatory surgery.

Hospitals are likely to try to adapt to cost controls and the

decreased demand for in—patient care by diversifying into other

activities, including "captive" physicians' groups, home health

care services, and coninunity—based health promotion activities.

     Although physicians collectively have the opportunity to

protect their incomes by directing most of the restraint on

spending toward hospitals, equipment manufacturers, and drug

companies, they too will have to adapt in ways that many will

find unpleasant. In particular, in order to cope with the new

financial constraints physicians will probably have to give up

some of their independence and autonomy. Increasingly they will

feel the need to join group practices or other forms of

organizations in order to be able to bargain with insurance

companies and other purchasers of care. Also, they will

increasingly feel the need for professional managers to help them

function in a more competitive environment. In the process, some

of their power and decision—making authority will be lost.

     Changes in methods of hospital reimbursement. are also likely

to affect the goals of the nursing profession. For instance, in


                                 21
the past many hospital nurses were working toward a goal of

separate billing for their professional services. They believed

that this approach would increase the prestige and status of

nurses and result in greater economic return. Given the trend

toward global reimbursement, however, either on a capitation or

admission basis, there is no scope for separate billing by

nurses. Indeed, separate billing by physicians may well be on its

way out.
       rr1-hv   gr ryf' hr-if1 iir in fh cd trq Fr frnc.f.r
to   other personnel responsibilities that were considered

peripheral to nursing, or were considered to be below their skill

level. With a shrinkage in the demand for hospital care resulting

from new reimbursement methods, however, nurses will become more

concerned about protecting their jobs and may reverse these

goals. In the future, more nurses are likely to argue that it is

better to have most patient services provided by the same

person——the professional nurse.

       Longer run effects. While many of the changes in ways of

thinking and behavior induced by the changes in incentives may be

short—run or one—time, some effects will emerge only over a

longer period of time and are likely to be cumulative. For

instance, even in the short run physicians will have an incentive

to consider the incremental value of services in relation to

their incremental cost, but they may not know what the

incremental value is. Over the longer run there is likely to be

more research on these questions, both informally within health

care institutions and more formally at medical schools and
research organizations. Similarly, in the long run the education

and training of physicians is likely to change to make them

better able to evaluate and assimilate this type of research. To

cite another example, in the short run hospital administrators

may want to take account of marginal costs in their

decisionmaking, but the relevant information may not be

available. In the longer run these data will be developed and

utilized.

       Another likely long—run consequence is a shift in the

character of innovative activity. Innovations in medical care, as

in other fields, typically take one of two forms. There is

"product" innovation that consists of the introduction of new

services that increase the quality of care, e.g., organ

transplants, neonatal intensive care. These innovations usually

increase the cost of care but they allow physicians and other

health professionals to deliver a superior product. The other

kind   of innovation is "process" innovation, e.g., automated
testing. It enables health professionals to do what they have
been doing but to do so at lower cost. There have always been
both   kinds of innovations, but in the past the retrospective

cost—based reimbursement system tended to encourage product

innovation that increases cost. In the future, with prospective,

closed—end reimbursement methods, the emphasis is likely to

switch to process innovation that lowers cost.

       Distributional effects. One of the likely effects of the

Medicare PPS is to redistribute resources among institutions and

among regions of the country. The implications for efficiency and

equity of this redistribution vary, depending upon the reasons


                                   23
for the original disparity in costs. Suppose Hospital A treats

patients in DRG X at an average cost of $5,000 per admission,

while Hospital B has an average cost of $3,000 for patients in

the same DRG. Under the old system each hospital would be paid

its cost. Under the new system each will get $14,000, thus

redistributing resources from A to B. The evaluation of this

redistribution depends critically on the reason for the

difference in cost.

     One possibility is that B is simply more efficient than A,

i.e., the patients are identical, input prices are identical, and

patient outcomes are identical, but B does a better job of

producing care. In this case it is both efficient and equitable

to redistribute resources, i.e., to reward the efficient and

punish the inefficient.

     A second possibility is that there is no difference in

output, patient mix, or efficiency, but that Hospital A pays

higher prices for its inputs. It may be, for example, that there

is a strong union in A that has negotiated higher wages or that

the administrators in A are paid higher salaries than the

administrators in B. In that case there are no great efficiency

gains in transferring resources, since there are no efficiency

differences. The redistribution does seem to be equitable,

however, unless the wage differential simply offsets a difference

in the cost of living.

    A third possibility is that the differences in costs are due

to differences in output. Although the patient mix is the same,

Hospital A uses more inputs to produce higher quality care, more



                                 214
amenities, and the like. In this case the redistribution may be

judged equitable (there is nothing in the Medicare legislation to

suggest that patients in Hospital A ought to get a higher

standard of care than patients in Hospital B). The implications

for efficiency are not as obvious, but the value of the marginal

output of the additional resources is probably greater in B than

in A.

     Still another possibility is that the difference in cost is

the result of differences in patient mix within the DRG. To the

extent that this is the source of the cost differential, there

may be no gains to efficiency or equity in redistributing

resources; there may even be losses. Teaching hospitals, for

instance, claim that differences in patient mix contribute to

their higher costs. Some studies suggest that education and

research also raise costs in hospitals that carry on these

activities.

     Education and research. One special area of concern is the

future of support for education and research. In the past some of

the funding for these efforts probably came from reimbursement

for patient care. The new methods of reimbursement are designed

in part to do away with this type of cross—subsidization. The

buyers of care are saying "We want to pay for only the care we

use; if we want to support education and/or research, we will do

that separately."                                       It's

always nice to know what you are paying for and not have to buy

into "package" deals or "tie in" sales.

     it is also desirable to distinguish betjeen the funding of

medical education (undergraduate and postgraduate) and the


                                 25
funding of research. In too many discussions these two activities

are treated as if they were inextricably related. This may well

be true with respect to the production of education and research,

but it certainly need not be true of the funding. Indeed,

economic theory suggests that they should be treated differently.

Medical research often has large positive externalities, i.e.,

confers benefits on society as a whole that are far greater than

the return to those carrying on the research. Because of these

externalities the private market will do less research than is

socially optimal. The case for government subsidy is very strong.

With respect to medical education, the case for government

subsidy is much weaker. Most of the benefits of this education

are realized by those who receive the training. There is no

obvious case for subsidization to achieve the socially optimal

amount. As a matter of equity, society may want to help poor

students obtain access to medical education but this can be

accomplished through sharply focused loans and scholarships

rather than general subsidies.

     Hospital specialization. The new systems of reimbursement

are likely to lead to hospitals specializing in the diagnosis and

treatment of particular health problems. Such specialization

would raise the quality of care and increase efficiency.

Specialization, however, poses a problem for academic medical

centers with traditional teaching programs. It would be more

difficult to provide a complete educational experience for medical

students in a specialized hospital; some changes in educational

programs would be necessary.



                                 26
        Specialization may also bring one type of payment system

into conflict with another. For instance, the Medicare system

based on DRGs clearly favors the growth of specialization, but

the FF0 systems would tend to lose bargaining power as a result

of hospital specialization. Suppose the XYZ Corporation enters

into a FF0 arrangement with a local hospital to send all their

employees to that hospital in exchange for a price discount and

utilization controls. If the hospital becomes specialized in

certain types of care, those employees who need other types of

care will not be well served by the FF0 system. The XYZ

Corporation could presumably adapt by making arrangements with

all the local hospitals, but then the FF0 system loses some of

its cutting edge.

        Although many patients might benefit from the higher quality

and lower costs resulting from hospital specialization, there

will be disadvantages to patients as well. There are

disadvantages to being hospitalized in an unfamiliar institution

or in one that is inconveniently located. In a system of

specialized hospitals patients will have to weigh these dis—

advantages against the advantages of receiving more specialized

care.

     Decrease in number of soecialists. While hospitals are

likely to become more specialized, the proportion of physicians

who are specialists or subspecialists is likely to fall. Surgery

is a good example. Under the traditional system of fee—for—

service reimbursement with surgeons practicing alone or in small

groups, the typical comunity has a large number of surgeons

relative to the demand for operations. The average surgeon has a


                                   27
low workload, but high fees per procedure yield a good income.

     The new reimbursement systems will shift medical practice

toward large groups or other large—scale organized systems of

care. As demonstrated by the Mayo Clinic and Kaiser, these groups

and systems take on only as many surgeons as are needed at a full

workload for each surgeon. The ones so employed continue to earn

a good income, but their implicit fee per procedure is much less

than in traditional practice. The low workload—high fee pattern

will cease to be economically viable for most surgeons, and young

physicians will be less likely to enter surgery.

     Surgeons are not the only ones who will be affected. Much

the same story could be told about many internal medicine

subspecialties, and much the same pattern of change will emerge.

This decrease in the number of specialists who have small

workloads in their specialty could simultaneously lower costs and

raise the quality of care.



Ethical Concerns

     The financing and delivery of health care has always posed

ethical problems for health professionals and for society as a

whole. Some of these problems will be exacerbated by the changes

in reimbursement that are now under way, and new problems are

likely to arise. They will be encountered at the level of the

individual physician, among groups of physicians and hospitals,

and at the coninunity and national levels.

     Physician—patient relations. The pressure to make

physicians more cost conscious, to practice more "cost effective"



                                 28
medicine, will force them to make decisions that are contrary to

the imediate interests of individual patients even though these

decisions may be optimal for society as a whole. The conflict can

be seen in Figure 3, which shows the marginal (additional)

benefits and marginal costs associated with varying amounts of

care. The vertical axis is scaled in dollars while the horizontal

axis may be thought of as measuring additional tests,

prescriptions, days in the hospital, physician visits, and the

like for any given medical condition. The downward slope of the

marginal benefit curve simply assumes that the additional benefit

of additional care gets smaller as the quantity of care

increases. Beyond some point (where the curve crosses the

horizontal axis), additional care does the patient more harm than

good. The marginal cost curve is horizontal under the simplifying

assumption that each additional unit of care increases total cost

by about the same amount as the preceding unit. To be sure, for

any given patient there will always be great uncertainty about

the benefit of any particular intervention, and there may be

uncertainty about marginal costs as well: these curves should be

regarded as average or expected or "best guess" results.

       Given the situation portrayed in Figure 3, what is the

optimal amount of care? From a social point of view, the optimum

is clearly Q., where the marginal benefit is equal to the

marginal cost (under the assumption that the marginal cost

reflects the value of the resources in some alternative use). If

more care than Q1 is provided, the additional   cost is greater
than   the additional benefit. If less than Q1 is provided, the

benefit of additional care is greater than its cost.

                               30
     From the patient's point of view, Q1 is best if there is no

insurance (i.e., the patient must pay the full marginal cost),

but Q2 is best if the patient is fully insured. Any pressure on

the physician to move from Q2 to Q1 creates a dilemma: to choose

between what is good for society as a whole (and what competitive

pressures may require for the survival of his or her group or

hospital) and what is best for the individual patient. For

instance, the physician may believe that an extra day in the

hospital reduces slightly the probability of a complication but

that the value of that reduction is far less than the cost of the

extra day. Under the old system of reimbursement, the physician

had little incentive to discharge the patient a day earlier; the

cost of' the extra day was widely diffused among all health

insurance buyers or all taxpayers. If, however, the hospital is

receiving global reimbursement for each admission, or if it is on

a prospective global budget, or if the physician belongs to an

HMO with capitation reimbursement or to a PPO with utilization

controls, there will be considerable pressure on the physician to

avoid that extra day of hospitalization.

    Assuming the physician chooses Qi' what does he or she tell

the patient? That Q1 is "best"? Or that Q2 is better but that Q1

is recommended because it is more cost—effective? Most patients

follow their physicians' suggestions with regard to tests,

hospitalizations, and the like, under the assumption that the

physician has a professional commitment to putting the patients'

interests first. Confidence in the integrity and intention of the

physician frequently makes a positive contribution to the

patient's health. If insured patients begin to believe that their


                                 31
physician is recommending Q1 rather than Q2, they may become less

honest in describing their symptoms and condition. This loss of

candor will make the physician's task more difficult.

     To be sure, under the old system there was frequently an

economic incentive for the physician to recommend Q3, especially

for services that produced income for the physician. According to

some observers, widespread insurance coverage led some (many?)

physicians to recommend Q3, which is clearly neither in the best

interests of the patient (even if fully insured) or of society.

These observers see the current cost containment effort as

pushing physicians back from Q3 to Q2. If that is the case, there

is no conflict for the ethical physician.

     Relations among physicians and hospital3. Compared to most

industries relations among physicians and hospitals in the same

community have been marked by an unusual degree of cooperation

and openness. Although they were ostensibly competing with one

another, physicians have freely exchanged information, helped one

another, and covered for one another; hospitals, especially the

nonprofit community hospitals, have behaved in much the same way.

Indeed, one of the complaints of outside observers was that

physicians and hospitals did not compete enough. Whatever rivalry

existed was largely expressed in efforts to raise the quality of

care, leaving the community to pick up the check.

     One of the objectives of the new reimbursement methods is to

increase competition among physicians and among hospitals, to

transform health care into a competitive industry. There are

unquestionable advantages to competition, but what will happen to



                                 32
the free exchange of information, the cooperation, and the mutual

assistance that characterized health care in the past? Will

physicians in one group be reluctant to share information with

physicians in a competing group? How will physicians reconcile

profession—wide obligations with obligations to their group and

hospital? Wil]. hospitals be willing to make data freely available

when this information may give a competitive advantage to another

hospital? The virtues of competitive markets are considerable,

but it is questionable whether the transformation of the health

care industry into an approximation of the used car industry

represents social progress. Even if more competition is, on

balance, good for society, the health professionals caught in the

competitive maelstrom are likely to feel great conflict as to

what constitutes appropriate behavior.

     Collective responsibility for health care. The citizens of

most countries feel a responsibility for meeting the medical care

needs of their fellow citizens. In developed countries this is

typically done through some form of national health insurance.

Altruism is only one motive, to be sure. National health

insurance may be desired to eliminate free riders (but the

concept of' free rider already presupposes an unwillingness to let

sick people go without care) or to gain more control over

physicians and hospitals, or for other motives.

     The United States has never had national health insurance

for several reasons. We are more heterogeneous than most nations;

we are less sanguine about the beneficence of government; and we

have a more comprehensive network of private institutions to pay

for health care for those in need. Cornnunity rated insurance


                                 33
premiums, for instance, keep insurance affordable for those who

use a great deal of care. The heavy users are, in effect, cross—

subsidized by those who use less care. Nonprofit hospitals also

have typically been an instrument of cross—subsidization. They

charge less than full cost to some patients (sometimes charging

or collecting nothing at all) while making up the difference

through charges to other patients. The pattern of coverage that

emerged in the United States in the late 1960s and 1970s was

n1thv in mnv rsn-'i-s hii1    it. rm   i-'1sr t.r' nrcvi1ir

universal coverage for a single standard of care than anything

previously experienced in this country.

     The new methods of reimbursement are designed to change this

pattern. Competitive purchase of health insurance on a selective

basis will erode community rating as groups with low utilization

demand and obtain lower premiums. Cross—subsidization by

hospitals will be eliminated as competitive buyers refuse to pay

more than their true costs.

     The normative inferences to be drawn from these changes vary

with circumstances and values. For instance, many people believe

that if cigarette smokers use more medical care than nonsmokers,

it is appropriate that they pay a higher premium for health

insurance. But what if old people use more care than the young,

women more than men, blacks more than whites, or persons with

congenital abnormalities more than those without such

limitations? Legislation that prohibits insurance companies from

explicitly considering specific characteristics in sett.ing

individual premiums do not have much effect. Most insurance is
bought by groups, and is mostly experience—rated or self—insured.

The current trend is for each group to try to get the lowest

possible premium for itself regardless of what happens to the

rest of the community.

    The ethical dilemma is clear. On the one hand it is socially

desirable to reward healthy behaviors and efficiency and to

punish excessive use of care. On the other hand the fragmentation

of insurance markets raises the possibility of very high premiuns

for some groups. Society could deal with this problem by

explicitly subsidizing those groups with high utilization.

However, this may be more difficult to accomplish (for political

and administrative reasons) than the previous method of implicit

subsidies through community—wide or nation—wide premiums.
                      III. _tp Done?
       For decades various politicians, academicians, health

professionals, and policy experts have been offering "solutions"

to the problems of health care. Competition, regulation, more

government subsidy, less government subsidy, increasing the

supply of hospitals and physicians, decreasing the supply——most

of these strategies have been adopted at one time or another;

nn hv hcn cr            1ik1v to h "th" solijtAon Why no1? Ar

they flawed in theory? In execution? Not necessarily. The time

has   come to candidly acknowledge that some problems defy

solution, that the most one can hope for is alleviation and

amelioration.

       Health policy, like so many other major areas of public

concern, requires trade—offs between such highly valued goals as

efficiency and justice, and between freedom and security. Even

the best solution must fall short in one direction or another,

and the more effective the solution is for one goal the greater

the shortfall is likely to be for another. That is the principal

reason why there is so much controversy over policy: people

differ in the values they place on the various goals. Some are

prepared to see society give up a good deal of efficiency to get

more justice or more security while others feel that freedom is a

paramount value.

       The financing of health care is a classic example of an

insoluble dilemma, the need to choose between the Scylla of risk

aversion and the Charybdis of moral hazard. Most people do not



                                   36
want to run the risk of having to pay very large bills for

medical care. They seek health insurance, but once they have the

insurance they consume more medical care than they would without

insurance, and more than is socially optimal. The cost of this

additional care makes health insurance more expensive than it

would otherwise be. All of this is true regardless of whether

insurance is obtained privately or provided collectively through

government.

     A theoretical solution is for individuals, when well, to

make an arrangement with the insurance company and/or the

providers of care that when sick, only the socially optimal

amount of care will be provided, even though the insurance

nominally covers all necessary care. Prepaid group practices

(such as Kaiser) and the British National Health Service can be

regarded as being organized on that principle. It works, and

sometimes it works very well, but it requires either some

deception or a great deal of restraint. It is rational for a

person who is well to want to be part of such a system, but once

sick it is equally rational to want all the care that might

provide some benefit. The challenge to the system is to keep

the patient from getting that additional care.

     In the past it may not have been too difficult to meet that

challenge because much of the additional care delivered in other

systems was of questionable value. But as competitive pressures

drive all systems toward more stringent evaluation of the cost—

effectiveness of care, it will become more difficult to convince

patients that they are getting the best possible care. "Low

yield" medicine is not "no—yield" medicine.


                                 37
        One partial solution lies in changing perceptions of what

constitutes "appropriate" care. Once the leading medical centers

change their approach, and the leading medical schools change

what they teach their students, most physicians will adapt to

prevailing practice, just as they have in the past. Patients will

then adapt to their physicians' recommendations.

         As discussed in the section on ethical concerns, competitive

pressures among physicians and hospitals may inhibit the flow of

can be found in the approach of other industries. The public

utility companies, for instance, sponsor and generously fund the

Electric Power Research Institute to conduct long—run economic,

social, and technical research that benefits the individual

companies and society as a whole. Several highly competitive

electronics companies have created a consortium to carry on

research on a scale greater than would be possible for the

individual firms. The key to such industry undertakings is

widespread agreement that all companies will contribute funds,

data, personnel, and the like. Such agreement is necessary to

keep each company from thinking that cooperation on their part

will put them at a competitive disadvantage.

         The problem of insuring medical care for all, regardless of

their income or other circumstances, is primarily a matter of'

will, rather than of method of reimbursement. When government

agencies simultaneously change their method of paying for care

for the elderly or the poor or any other group and reduce the

amount they are prepared to pay, there is a high probability that



                                                    38
there will be some reduction in the quantity or quality of care

received. It is usually incorrect, however, to blame the new

method for the denial of care; it is the reduction in the amount

of money available for reimbursement that is probably the cause.

If society wants to provide care for the poor, virtually any

system of reimbursement can be used. It is not the change in

reimbursement method        that   is denying care to the poor; the

change is simply the instrument whereby a weakening of commitment

to the poor is given expression.

     The situation is, of course, more complicated than that.

Much of the pressure for change in reimbursement is not motivated

by a desire to see the poor get less care; it is an effort to

make the system more cost—effective. If that is the dominant

motive, however, there is an urgent need to find ways to halt and

reverse the erosion of support for the least fortunate in our

society. It seems highly unlikely that this can be accomplished

without substantial intervention of government through taxes and

subsidies. This need not involve a take—over of medicine by

government, or an abandonment of the movement toward more cost—

effective medicine. If not done in a timely fashion, however, a

backlash may develop.

     Every revolution carries within it the seeds of its own

destruction through excessive preoccupation with one goal. The

present revolution in health care finance is no exception. The

problems it addresses are palpable: over—utilization of medical

services, inadequate evaluation of new technologies, inefficient

and inequitable cross—subsidization, excess supplies of

specialists and hospital beds. But the problems it may create are


                                   39
also significant: inadequate insurance coverage for millions,

erosion of professional ethics as an instrument of control, loss

of trust between physicians and patients, decrease in activities

with large positive externalities. The new challenge is to

capture and preserve the benefits of the revolution while

minimizing its costs. Now that society has decided it can "call

the tune," we must think deeply and carefully about what tune we

want the "piper" to play.
