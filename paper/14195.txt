Which CEO Characteristics and Abilities Matter?

                                                ABSTRACT

We study the characteristics and abilities of CEO candidates for companies involved in buyout (LBO)
and venture capital (VC) transactions and relate them to hiring decisions, investment decisions, and
company performance. Candidates are assessed on more than thirty individual abilities. The abilities
are highly correlated; a factor analysis suggests there are two primary factors with intuitive characterizations
– one for general ability and one that contrasts team-related, interpersonal skills with execution skills.
 Both LBO and VC firms are more likely to hire and invest in CEOs with greater general abilities,
both execution- and team-related. Success, however, is more strongly related to execution skills than
to team-related skills. Success is, at best, only marginally related to incumbency, holding observable
talent and ability constant.

I.      Introduction

        Given their leadership positions and compensation, CEOs likely have a significant impact on the

their companies’ success. And, of course, there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence about what CEOs do

and how they matter, particularly in the popular press. Surprisingly, economic theorists provide little

guidance, and there is very little systematic, large sample, empirical work in the economics, finance and

management literatures on how and why CEOs matter.

        There are many economic theories that model CEOs or agents running firms. Some theorists, like

Holmstrom (1979) treat all agents or CEOs as being the same and focus on effort provision. In these

theories, however, the individual CEO does not matter. Some theorists do model CEOs with different

talents and abilities, and assume those abilities map into firm performance. For example, Rosen (1981)

models talent or ability with an index, q. The talent distribution is assumed fixed and costlessly

observable. Murphy and Zabojnik (2004) assume that CEOs have ability, ai. And Gabaix and Landier

(2007) assume that managers and CEOs have talent, T(m). While these theorists assume CEOs have

different ability or talent, and assume the ability is observable, they provide no guidance whatsoever

concerning what those abilities or talents are.

        A recent exception is a paper by Bolton et al. (2008) who model CEOs as trading off the ability to

coordinate employees’ actions with the ability to react to new information. CEOs vary in being more or

less resolute which the authors define as a type of overconfidence. In their model, more resolute CEOs

are more successful because the increased coordination benefits from being resolute outweigh the costs of

not fully reacting to new information. Also, see Van den Steen (2005) for a closely related paper.

         Similarly to the theoretical literature, empirical work in economics and finance suggests that

CEOs matter, but that work is just beginning to consider what particular abilities or skills are important.

For example, Bertrand and Schoar (2003) study managers who move from one firm to another, and find

evidence consistent with different managers having different styles, different behavior, and different

performance. Bloom and Van Reenen (2006) use survey data to find that different management practices




                                                      1
are related to firm performance. Bennedsen et al. (2007) find that firm performance is negatively related

to CEO focus. These papers are silent, however, on what defines the different styles and characteristics.

        More recently, several papers have begun to consider what characteristics might be important.

Schoar (2008) finds that CEO actions are related to whether they join the labor market in a downturn or a

boom. Graham and Narasimhan (2004) find specific effects on leverage for managers going through the

great depression. One might interpret both papers as using measures of conservatism. Malmendier and

Tate (2004, 2007), Ben-David et al. (2007) and Graham et al. (2008) find that CEO decisions and

outcomes are related to measures of CEO overconfidence, optimism and risk aversion.

        The empirical management literature, like the most of the economics and finance literature,

focuses on directly observable characteristics, such as CEOs’ “education,” “functional background,” and

“age.” Hambrick and Mason (1984) stress that these observable characteristics are, at best, proxies for

underlying psychological factors, but they also recognize the difficulties of gathering data with these

underlying factors for CEOs.

        This paper adds to the empirical literature by providing new evidence on CEO characteristics and

abilities, and their relation to hiring, investment decisions, and firm performance. We rely on detailed

assessments of 316 CEO candidates for positions in firms funded by private equity (PE) investors – both

buyout (LBO) and venture capital (VC) investors. The assessments are based on four-hour structured

interviews performed from 2000 to 2006 by ghSmart, a firm that assesses CEO candidates. The data

include quantitative and qualitative information about the candidate’s education and employment history

as well as assessments of a wide range of personal skills and attributes. We complement the assessment

data with data on hiring, investment and success from the PE firms and from public sources.

        With these data, we make three contributions. First, we extend the set of measured CEO

characteristics and abilities.

        Second, existing empirical work is primarily concerned with the relation between CEO identity

(i.e., fixed effects) and investment policy, financial policy, and performance (see Bertrand, Schoar, 2003

and Bennedsen et al., 2007). This paper takes a first step towards understanding why a particular CEO


                                                     2
might have those effects by studying the relation of particular CEO candidate characteristics and abilities

to CEO hiring decisions, to investor investment decisions, and, conditional on hiring, to firm

performance. The data also allow us to consider whether different abilities matter for different companies

or investments (i.e., companies funded by VC versus LBO firms).

        Finally, we consider the related question of the importance of firm-specific knowledge or ability

versus general ability by comparing inside and outside CEO candidates. Several theories about the trade-

off between firm-specific ability and general ability predict that outside candidates have higher abilities,

on average, but there is very limited evidence about whether this is true in practice, nor is there any

evidence on the particular dimensions where this trade-off is more relevant (see Frydman (2006) and

Murphy and Zabonjik (2004)). In the management literature, Khurana (2002) takes the opposite side and

argues that firms should shy away from outsiders, particularly charismatic outsiders.

        In this paper, we focus on the 30 specific characteristics or abilities that ghSMART assessed for

the candidates in our sample. Because many of the individual characteristics are correlated, we also use a

factor analysis to extract the main patterns of variation in the characteristics. We find two factors that are

particularly important and have intuitive interpretations: the first loads positively on all abilities and,

thus, appears to measure overall talent; the other loads positively on team-related abilities (“teamwork,”

“listening skills,” “open to criticism,” and “treats people with respect”), and negatively on execution-

related capabilities (“aggressive,” “fast mover,” “persistent,” and “proactive”). We also separate the

second factor into its team-related and execution-related components to investigate the absolute effects of

these types of abilities rather than their relative effects that are picked up in the initial factor analysis.

        Ratings for outsider CEOs are generally higher than ratings for incumbent CEOs although the

differences are largely driven by candidates from LBO-funded firms. This is consistent with investors and

firms trading off general skills and ability against firm-specific skills and knowledge.

        We then consider determinants of hiring and investment decisions. PE firms – both LBO and VC

firms – are more likely to hire and invest in more highly rated / talented CEOs, particularly for outsider

hires. We also find that insider CEOs are significantly more likely to remain in their positions or be


                                                         3
hired, holding their skill constant. Firms appear to trade off general or observable abilities against firm-

specific skills and knowledge.

        Next, we consider the relation between a CEO’s ratings and subsequent success. We measure

success using evaluations from the PE firms (when we can obtain them) and our own assessments of

success from publicly available data.

        For LBO firms, success is significantly positively related to a number of individual abilities.

They tend to be the execution-related measures (“efficient,” “organized,” “detailed,” “follows through,”

“persistent,” “proactive,” “sets high standards,” and “holds people accountable”), rather than the

interpersonal, team-related ones. Consistent with this, we find that success is significantly positively

related to the general talent factor and to the execution-related factor in regressions that include the

separated factors. We find no relation between incumbency and success controlling for ability.

        For VCs, success is negatively (not positively) related to some of the individual measures of

talent, including execution-, neutral and team-related measures. The relations become positive (although

not significant) when we control for time, likely reflecting the fact that many of the VC-funded

companies in the sample were funded during the tech boom in the late 1990s and early 2000s when many

of those businesses were not viable. When we move to a regression framework, we find a significantly

negative relation between success and the team-related factor and a positive (but not significant) relation

between success and the execution-related factor. We find mixed evidence for a positive relation between

incumbency and success (controlling for ability).

        Together, the results for LBOs and VCs suggest that execution-related abilities are positively

related to success while team-related abilities are negatively related to success. Holding ability constant,

incumbency is only marginally related to success.

        Finally, we explore whether the success results are sensitive to observables or to sample selection

issues. We do not find that the results are sensitive to the inclusion of observables like age, education,

and industry. We also attempt to address the problem of endogenous matching of candidates and

companies that arises when unobservable characteristics affect which candidates particular firms hire.


                                                       4
While we cannot completely reject a sample selection bias, we report two analyses that are not consistent

with one. We find no systematic correlation between outcomes and the qualities of candidates who are

not hired for a particular job. If selection were a problem, we would expect candidates who are not hired

as the CEO of a particular company to have similar characteristics to the hired candidates. We also

consider a Heckman selection model in which the first stage is the hiring decision and the second stage is

the performance relation. We include the insider dummy or an overall recommendation in the hiring

decision, but exclude it in the performance regressions. We obtain similar results to our basic

specifications.

        Overall, we believe the analysis and results are novel and suggestive. The results on success are

generally consistent with the predictions of Bolton et al. that “resolute” CEOs are more successful than

“good listeners.”

        The results also are related to studies of the five factor model (of personality) in the psychology

literature. According to the model, personalities consist of five factors: extraversion, emotional stability,

agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness to experience. Studies that relate personality to

performance tend to find conscientiousness has the most explanatory power. This is consistent with our

findings that execution-related skills of CEOs are related to performance. To our knowledge, there are no

such personality studies for individuals at the CEO level. See Barrick, Mount and Judge (2001) for a

summary of this literature (and Morgeson et al. (2007) for a skeptical view).

        This research is also closely related to Collins (2001) who studies a sample of eleven CEOs of

companies with outstanding performance. He identifies them as “Level 5” leaders who build “enduring

greatness” and share the traits of: compelling modesty; giving credit to others and taking blame on

themselves; showing unwavering resolve and workmanlike diligence; and building strong teams. The

primary concerns with his study are the small sample size and the potential for ex-post selection bias,

because he chooses his sample of CEOs based on superior past performance. Our analysis uses a larger

sample of CEO candidates chosen ex-ante. Our results for LBO CEOs are consistent with important roles




                                                      5
for unwavering resolve and workmanlike diligence. They are not consistent, however, with important

roles for the other traits Collins identifies.

        Interestingly, our results, particularly those for buyout CEOs, seem most consistent with those

described in Drucker (1967). According to Drucker, effective executives “differ widely in their

personalities, strengths, weaknesses, values and beliefs. All they have in common is they get the right

things done.” To get things done, effective executives: “utilize time efficiently”; “focus on

contribution”; “make strengths productive”; “do first things first”; and “make effective decisions.” These

appear to be the execution-related skills we find are most correlated with success.

        We add one last caveat to interpreting the results. The people we study are CEOs of buyout and

VC-funded companies that may have special needs. As a result, it is not possible to know whether the

results generalize to CEOs of other firms, particularly public companies. However, we believe the

similarity of our results to those of Drucker (1967) is suggestive in that Drucker’s work was based on

personal observations of many executives in many different types of firms.



II.     Data

        A.       Assessments

        We rely on detailed assessments of 316 CEO candidates for positions in firms funded by private

equity (PE) investors, consisting of both VC and LBO investors. The assessments are performed from

2000 to 2006 by ghSMART, a firm that specializes in assessing top management candidates. The

assessments are requested by the PE investors, typically at the time the PE firm is considering an

investment or considering hiring a new CEO.

        The assessments are typically 20 to 40 page documents that include detailed information on the

candidates’ life, from childhood through current job experiences. They are based on structured interviews

with the candidates that are of roughly four hours in duration and are performed by professional

interviewers. The data include quantitative and qualitative information about the managers’ education

and employment histories as well as assessments of a wide range of personal skills and characteristics.


                                                     6
        The typical assessment classifies the CEO candidate on 30 dimensions in five general areas:

“leadership,” “personal,” “intellectual,” “motivational,” and “interpersonal.” Table 1 presents

ghSMART’s descriptions as well as guides for high and low scores for the assessed characteristics. The

characteristics are organized in the general areas used by ghSMART.

        The candidates are also typically assessed on abilities specific to the particular deal. Because

these abilities are not consistent across candidates, we do not include them in our analyses. The results

are qualitatively similar when we include them although the number of observations is reduced.

        In the discussion, we informally refer to characteristics as interpersonal / team-related, neutral,

and execution-related. Based largely on the factor analysis we describe below, we refer to “Develops

People,” “Treats People with Respect,” “Calm,” “Flexibility,” “Listening,” “Open to Criticism,” and

“Teamwork” as interpersonal or team-related skills. We view “Removes Underperformers,”

“Efficiency,” “Aggressive,” “Moves Fast,” “Persistence,” “Sets High Standards,” “Proactive,” “Work

Ethic,” “Holds People Accountable” as execution-related skills. We classify “Network,” “Hires A

Players,” “Follows through on Commitments,” “Organization,” “Brainpower,” “Analytical,” “Strategic,”

“Creative,” “Attention to Details,” “Integrity,” “Enthusiasm,” “Writing,” “Oral Communication,” and

“Persuasion” as neutral or mixed.

        For each of the characteristics ghSMART assigns a letter grade to the CEO candidate, ranging

from D (lowest) to A+ (highest). We rescale these grades into four categories. We classify grades of B

or below as 1. ghSMART reports that such grades are quite negative. We combine these grades because

there are relatively few below B. We classify grades of A and A+ as 4. ghSMART reports that such

grades are very positive. We combine them because there are relatively few A+’s. We classify grades of

B+ as 2 and grades of A- as 3. We obtain qualitatively similar results when we do not combine grades.

        ghSMART structures the interviews in a systematic way to generate as much consistency as

possible across interviews. All interviews follow the same specified structure, and are conducted by

trained, professional interviewers. The interviewers generally either hold doctoral degrees or have

degrees from top MBA programs and have worked at strategy consulting firms (such as McKinsey & Co.,


                                                      7
Bain, and Boston Consulting Group). According to ghSMART, internal testing has found a high degree

of consistency across assessments performed by different interviewers. Our results are qualitatively

identical when we use interviewer fixed effects in some of our analyses (not reported).

        When asked whether it is possible for executives to “game” the interview by providing answers

that the candidates believes are “right,” ghSMART provided two main reasons why this is difficult. First,

VC and LBO investors almost always conduct detailed reference checks on the CEO candidates of their

portfolio companies to verify the information in the assessments. A candidate who gives misleading

answers in the assessments risks exposure through comparison with the information from the reference

checks. Candidates are aware that reference checks are conducted, and this provides some motivation to

be truthful. Second, ghSMART has found that it is difficult to “game” the questions consistently in the

course of a four-hour interview with an experienced interviewer.

        Personality assessments have been used and studied in the management psychology literature.

That literature finds that the assessments generally provide reliable information. For example, industrial

organization psychologists find that self-reported questionnaires are robust to gaming and are

substantially consistent (John and Srivastava, 1999). And external assessments (by supervisors, co-

workers and customers) are typically found to be more reliable than self-assessments (Mount, Barrick and

Strauss, 1994). We believe that four-hour interviews by professional interviewers are likely to be at least

as informative as the self-reported questionnaires and external assessments in those psychology studies.

        There are two other reasons we believe that these assessments are informative. First (and

anecdotally), at least two PE firms told us they do not make an investment without a CEO assessment of

the type ghSMART provides. Second, the assessments are costly for the PE firms. They require at least

four hours of a CEO’s time and a payment to ghSMART.

        While we believe the assessments are informative, it is worth stressing that if the assessments are

subject to gaming, this would make the assessments noisy and create a bias against finding any relation of

characteristics to outcomes. In fact, characteristics are systematically related to outcomes in ways that are

difficult to reconcile with gaming. We discuss this in more detail below.


                                                      8
        We also record track information in the assessments in addition to ratings. When provided, we

record observables about the CEO including age, college and graduate degrees, industry, and test scores.

We note if the candidate is the incumbent CEO or is an outsider. In a few cases, the candidate works for

the company but not as CEO. We include these candidates with outsiders. Our results are identical if we

include these candidates as incumbents. We note if the PE firm has already invested in the company at

the time of the assessment. We collect information on the PE firms, particularly assets under

management (a measure of size and prominence) at the time of the assessment. Because young

companies may require executives with different skills than more mature companies, we distinguish

between assessments made by VC and by buyout investors.



        B.       Corporate Decisions and Performance

        In addition to information about the candidates, we coded three outcome measures, whether: (1)

the CEO candidate is hired; (2) the PE firm invests in the firm; and (3) the CEO who is hired succeeds.

We collected this post-assessment information in two ways. First, either ghSMART or we approached

the PE firms. We asked each PE firm whether it invested; if the firm invested, whether the candidate was

hired; and if the PE firm invested and one of the candidates was hired, whether the CEO was successful.

We also asked if the investment itself had been successful or unsuccessful, as well as for any available

quantitative success measures. We obtained responses from PE firms for 146 of the 316 CEO candidates

in our sample.

        We complemented the PE firms’ information by using public sources to assess whether the

investment was made, the CEO was hired, and the hired CEO was successful. These sources included

CapitalIQ, Zoominfo.com, VentureOne, Lexis-Nexis, company websites and the PE firms’ websites.

        Using the public sources, we created two additional measures of success. The first we call the

public measure and the second we call the broad public measure. For both measures, we used PE firm

responses if they were available. For the first measure, we studied the hired CEOs for whom we did not

get PE firm responses. We classified a CEO as successful, if the CEO led the company or another


                                                     9
company to a clearly favorable exit such as an IPO or sale to another company. We classified the CEO as

unsuccessful if the company went bankrupt, the company was sold to another firm under distress or at a

substantial loss, or the CEO was removed as CEO before any exit occurred. In a few cases, we classified

the CEO as having mixed success. For example, we did this if the investors exited, but earned only a

modest return.

        For the broad public measure, we began with the first public measure. We then classified

additional CEOs as successful if the company received positive press regarding its operations or received

additional financing at higher valuations. Similarly, we classified CEOs as unsuccessful, if the company

had unfavorable press regarding its operations or subsequent financing. We also classified the CEO as

mixed if the company that the CEO ran had not exited in any form (IPO, sale, liquidation, etc.) and the

company had not received any informative press.

        While we recognize that the two public success measures are somewhat coarse, they are similar to

(and perhaps less coarse than) the success measures of IPO or IPO and sale used in many studies of

venture capital. (E.g., see Gompers et al. (2006) or Hochberg et al. (2007).) When we compare the three

measures of success, we view the PE measure as the most precise and the broad public measure as the

least precise. While the results are generally consistent using all three measures, the explanatory power of

the regressions declines as we move from the most precise to least precise measure.



        C.       Summary sample descriptive statistics.

        Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the sample. Panel A presents information on

incumbency and hiring, and the relation of the two. In our sample of 316 candidates, 224 are hired.

There is a large difference in hiring rates for incumbents and outsiders. Of 171 incumbents, 159 (or 93%)

are hired; of 145 outsiders, only 65 (or 45%) are hired. The reason for this discrepancy is that in many

cases, the CEO candidate was a founder and was extremely likely to remain with the company whether or

not the PE firm invested.




                                                    10
        Panel B presents information on hiring, PE firm investment, LBO and VC representation,

incumbency, and the relation of those three variables. Of the 316 candidates, 148 are assessed for LBO

firms and 168 are assessed for VC firms, a roughly equal representation.

        Panel C presents information by firm. The 316 CEO candidates are assessed for 258 different

companies. The PE firms invested in 181 of these 258 firms. The panel shows that the PE firms tended

to assess fewer outsiders in the firms in which they eventually did not invest. It also shows that a larger

fraction of incumbents remained CEO in firms in which the PE investors did not invest. Again, this is

consistent with the incumbents in a number of firms being founders and wishing to remain as CEOs.

        Panels D and E summarize our success variables for the 224 CEO candidates who are hired. The

PE firms provided performance assessments for 81. Of these, 37 (46%) were considered successful; (30)

37%, not successful; and 14 (17%), either of mixed or uncertain success. Using the first, more certain

public measure, we can rate 126 candidates and estimate that 54 (43%) are successful, 67 (53%) are

unsuccessful, and 5 (4%) are mixed. Finally, using the broad public measure, we can rate 208 candidates

and estimate that 92 (44%) are successful, 84 (40%) are unsuccessful, and 32 (16%) are mixed.

        Panel F describes the number of CEO candidates assessed per company. Only one candidate was

assessed in 219 of 258 companies; multiple candidates were assessed in the other 39 firms.



III.    Distribution and Aggregation of Managerial Characteristics

        Panel A of table 3 presents the average ratings of the characteristics for all 316 CEO candidates.

Panel A indicates that there is a fair amount of variation in the ratings of the different CEO candidates.

The standard deviations for most of the characteristics exceed 1 suggesting a wide spread in

measurements for those characteristics. Interestingly, the variables with the highest means and lowest

standard deviations are “work ethic” and “integrity,” suggesting most individuals who reach the CEO

candidate phase are perceived to have high integrity and a strong work ethic.

        Panel B presents the average ratings separately for LBO and VC candidates and for incumbents

and outsiders. The LBO candidates are rated more highly than the VC candidates on 20 of 30


                                                     11
characteristics, significantly so on seven. Those seven are a mix of team-related, interpersonal, and

neutral skills – “Attention to Details,” “Open to Criticism,” “Respect,” “Listening Skills,” and

“Persistence,” “Flexibility,” and “Follow Through on Commitments.” The VC candidates are rated more

highly on only two characteristics at the 10% level – “brainpower” and “strategic vision”.

        Because of the large number of included characteristics, one should be cautious in interpreting a

few of those as being statistically significant. Even if the data were random, some characteristics would

be significant by chance. Nevertheless, the patterns are suggestive. Buyout CEOs score higher on

characteristics related to a broader range of managerial and executive functions while VC CEOs appear to

score higher only on characteristics related to intelligence and vision. To the extent that entrepreneurs are

over represented relative to professional managers in the VC-funded firms, these results suggest that

entrepreneurs require less general management ability, but more knowledge-related skills than the

professional managers.

        The second half of panel B of table 3 compares insider and outsider CEO candidates. There are

large ratings differences. Outside candidates score higher than insiders on 19 of 30 characteristics. In 8

cases – “hires A players,” “develops people,” “efficiency,” “network,” “organization,” “analytical skills,”

“oral communication,” and “holds people accountable” – the differences are significant. In only one case,

“creativity,” do insiders outscore outsiders at the 10% significance level.

        Panel C compares insiders and outsiders for LBO and VC firms separately. This panel shows that

the outsider / insider differences are strongly driven by the LBO candidates. Outsider LBO candidates

outscore insiders in 21 of 30 abilities, significantly so in 7. Insiders outscore outsiders at the 10% level

on only one ability. For VC candidates, outsiders and insiders are rated more highly on 15 characteristics

each. Insiders’ scores are significantly higher on brainpower and creativity while outsiders’ are

significantly higher on the management-related skills of “efficiency” and “hiring A players.”

        These results, particularly those for the LBO candidates, are consistent with a number of

explanations. First, it is possible, that outside candidates are considered when internal candidates are not

performing well. Second, the results support the view that an important function of PE firms is to


                                                      12
upgrade the managerial talent in the firms in which they invest. (See Hellmann and Puri (2002) and

Kaplan and Stromberg (2004).) Third, in some cases the incumbent manager may have control over who

can invest in the company. As a result, a private equity investor must maintain the incumbent

management, even if this management is not ideal, or not invest at all. Finally, concerns about employee

moral and political turmoil may prompt investors to keep the incumbent management. All of these

explanations are consistent with outsiders being more talented than insiders / incumbents.



        B.       Correlations and Aggregation

        The individual ratings are highly correlated. On average, when a candidate scores well on one

characteristic, the candidate tends to score well on all the others. Over 85% of the pair-wise correlations

of the individual characteristics are significant at the 10% level. To conserve space, we do not report

these correlations. The strong correlations suggest that talent, ability, or skill have some kind of general

characteristic or quality that is spread across many dimensions.

        The large number of highly correlated characteristics relative to the number of candidates is

potentially problematic. The resulting multicollinearity means that including all the individual

characteristics as explanatory variables in a regression model leads to results that are difficult to interpret.

To address this problem, we perform a factor analysis (see Fabrigar, Wegener, MacCallum, and Strahan

(1999) and Jolliffe (2004)). This analysis extracts the main variation in the candidates’ characteristics and

calculates the loadings on these characteristics.

        Table 4 reports the results of this analysis. The first four factors have eigenvalues greater than one

and explain cumulative 93% of the variation. The first two factors turn out to be more important and have

natural interpretations. The first and most important factor is a general factor, explaining 53% of the

variation in the ratings. All individual characteristics load positively on this factor, ranging from a

loading for “integrity” of 0.33 to a loading for “efficiency” of 0.68. It is natural, therefore, to interpret

this factor as capturing general talent or ability. This pattern in the first factor is common in factor

analysis, and reflects the fact that all the characteristics tend to move together.


                                                       13
           The second factor is perhaps more interesting. Candidates who score higher on this factor have

higher ratings on interpersonal and team-related skills like “treats people with respect,” “open to

criticism,” “listening skills,” and “team work.” Candidates with a lower (negative) score on this factor

have higher ratings on execution-related skills like “moves fast,” “aggressive,” “proactive,” and

“persistent.” Interpreting these characteristics, the factor appears to sort the candidates such that a larger

positive loading corresponds to a candidate with stronger “interpersonal / team player” abilities whereas a

negative loading corresponds to a candidate who is best characterized as “fast, aggressive, and persistent.”

This second factor, therefore, also can be interpreted as measuring agreeableness versus conscientiousness

in the context of the five factor model of the psychology literature. One might expect Jack Welch – the

General Electric’ former CEO who was often referred to as “Neutron Jack” – to have a negative score on

this factor while his successor, Jeff Immelt, cited in Fast Company (2005) for “holding ‘dreaming

sessions’ with customers and developing ‘imagination breakthrough’ teams,” would likely have a positive

score.1 This second factor explains 20% of the variation in the ratings.

           The third factor is more difficult to interpret. It explains only 11% of the variation, and it plays a

smaller role below. Candidates with higher loadings on this factor score higher on “analytical skills,”

“organization,” “attention to detail,” and “written communication.” A candidate with a negative loading

on this factor scores higher on “enthusiasm” and “persuasion.” The first set of characteristics evokes a

sense of deliberate analytic ability and organizational talent; whereas the second set of characteristics

evokes a sense of being emotional and inspirational.

           Given the difficulty of interpreting increasingly marginal factors, we limit the analysis to the

initial three factors and primarily the first two. In factor analysis, each factor’s eigenvalue is often taken

as a measure of the amount of aggregate information captured by the factor, and it is usually argued that

factors must have eigenvalues greater than one to capture meaningful patterns in the data. Consistent

with this, the initial three factors have eigenvalues of 7.7, 3.0, and 1.7.

        We also perform a second factor analysis to isolate the distinction captured by the second factor.

We estimate an alternative factor specification using only the characteristics “fast,” “aggressive,”

“persistent,” “efficiency,” “proactive,” and “high standards” to capture the negative loadings and

“respect,” “open to criticism,” “listening skills” and “team work” to capture the positive loadings. By

design, this analysis finds two strong factors, with the first factor loading positively on the first set of

characteristics and the second factor loading positively on the second set. Although it does not affect the

loadings dramatically, we also use an oblique quartimin transformation to emphasize the differences. The

resulting loadings on the two alternative factors are presented in Panel B of Table 4. Again, in the context

of the five factor personality model, the first factor appears to capture conscientiousness; the second

factor, agreeableness.

        Cronbach’s alpha is used to measure the degree to which a set of characteristics are internally

consistent. The characteristics we have included in the two factors in the second factor analysis maximize

this measure and largely coincide with the characteristics with the largest absolute factor loadings on the

second factor in the first factor analysis. The six characteristics in the first alternative factor have a

Cronbach’s alpha of 0.85, and the four characteristics in the second alternative factor have an alpha of

0.84, strongly suggesting that the two sets of characteristics capture internally consistent underlying traits.



IV.     Managerial Characteristics and Hiring Decisions

        In this section, we study the relation between the characteristics and the decision to hire the

candidate.



        A.       Average ratings

        We compare the average ratings of hired candidates to those of non-hired candidates. We

distinguish between candidates assessed for LBO and VC firms and between incumbent and outside

candidates. Distinguishing between incumbent and outside CEOs is important because in some

investments, the PE firm does not have the ability to choose an outside CEO.


                                                       15
        Panel A compares hired versus non-hired candidates overall. The hired candidates are more

highly rated on 27 of 30 characteristics; in 12 cases, the differences are significant. The three

characteristics for which non-hired candidates score higher, the difference are small and insignificant.

        Panel B looks at VC and LBO candidates separately. For LBO candidates, the hired candidates

are rated more highly on 24 of 30 characteristics; 10 of those differences are statistically significant. The

significant differences include execution-related, neutral, and team-related characteristics. Non-hired

candidates are significantly higher on only once characteristic, “analysis,” and only at the 10% level.

        For VC candidates, the hired candidates are rated more highly on all but three characteristics.

“Brainpower,” “creativity,” “written communication” and “integrity” are statistically significant.

        Panel C looks at incumbents and outsiders separately. Hired outsiders are more highly rated on

every characteristic and significantly so on 20 of 30. While hired incumbents are rated more highly on

20 of 30 characteristics, only two differences are statistically significant. This partially reflects the fact

that most of the incumbents assessed are hired or remain CEOs of their companies. Again, this suggests

that for some companies, the CEO and the company are inseparable or, in other words, the PE firm must

keep the incumbent CEO if it wants to make the investment.

        Panel D restricts the sample to only those companies that assessed more than one candidate. For

these companies, the PE firm presumably had some choice in the hiring decision. The hired candidates

are rated more highly on 28 of 30 characteristics; 14 are significant. Again, the significant differences

include all types of characteristics.

        Overall, these patterns strongly suggest that abilities can be measured and that hiring decisions

are based on those perceived abilities.



        B.       Factor regressions

        Table 6 presents linear regressions that estimate the relation of the likelihood of being hired to the

CEO candidate’s ratings on each the three primary factors and, also, on the two alternative factors. Most




                                                       16
of the regressions also include a dummy variable for whether the candidate is the incumbent CEO. All of

the regressions include year dummies to control for any time variation.

        The first two regressions use the full sample of 316 candidates. The first regression uses the three

factors from the factor analysis where the first factor appears to measure general talent and the second

factor, “team player versus fast and aggressive.” The regression indicates that the likelihood of being

hired is strongly related to the first, general talent factor. The likelihood of being hired also is much

greater if the candidate is already the CEO, holding talent or skill constant.

        The second regression uses the alternative factors in which the first factor loads on execution-

related abilities and the second factor on interpersonal and team-related abilities. Hiring is positively

related to both of these factors, but only the first is statistically significant. Again, incumbents are

significantly more likely to be hired.

        The next set of regressions restricts the observations to companies in which the PE firms actually

invested. We do this to increase the focus on companies in which the PE firms had a choice in the hiring

decision. We first estimate three regressions using the first three factors. In regression 3, we consider

only outsider hires. The PE firms undoubtedly chose to hire these candidates. The results are similar to

those for all candidates. The likelihood of being hired is strongly related to the first, general talent factor.

The likelihood of being hired is marginally negatively related to the third factor.

        Regressions 4 and 5 consider LBO and VC candidates separately. The results, however, are

similar. The general talent factor is strongly significant in both regressions. And, again, incumbents are

significantly more likely to be hired, holding talent constant.

        In the last three regressions, we use the two alternative factors as independent variables. The

coefficients on the execution-related factor are positive and significant in all three regressions. The

coefficients on the interpersonal and team-related factor are positive in all three, significantly so for the

LBO candidates. As in the previous regressions, incumbents are significantly more likely to be hired.

        Overall, then, the regressions strongly suggest that hiring is strongly related to greater general

talent. Hiring is not significantly related to the second, “team player” versus “fast aggressive” factor,


                                                       17
although the “fast aggressive” factor comes in more strongly for VC candidates. The regressions also

indicate that incumbents are more likely to be hired by both LBO and VC-funded companies, holding

talent equal. This is consistent with companies placing substantial value on firm- and position-specific

skills relative to general talent or skills.



V.       Managerial Characteristics and Investment Decisions

         We next look at the relation of investment decisions to CEO candidate characteristics. Again, we

distinguish between buyout and VC candidates, incumbent and outside CEO candidates. We also

distinguish whether or not the CEOs were hired.



         A.       Average ratings

         Panel A of table 7 presents the average ratings of CEO candidates in companies in which the PE

firms chose to invest compared to the ratings of CEO candidates in companies in which the PE firms did

not invest. The first part of the panel looks at all candidates; the second part at incumbents only. In the

full sample, invested candidates score higher than non-invested candidates on 28 of 30 characteristics; 9

are significant. The significant variables are of all three types, with “efficiency” and “teamwork” having

the greatest differences. The results are qualitatively similar, albeit not so strong for incumbents only.

         Panel B considers LBO and VC candidates separately. Invested candidates score higher than

non-invested candidates for both LBO and VC; 25 of 30 differences are positive for LBO while 26 of 30

differences are positive for VC. Both “efficiency” and “teamwork” are significantly higher for both LBO

and VC.

         These results suggest that buyout and VC investors condition their investment decision on

management quality.



         B.       Factor regressions




                                                      18
        In table 8, we present regressions that estimate the likelihood of investment as a function of the

CEO candidate’s ratings on the three factors and, then, the two alternative factors. Again, the regressions

include a dummy variable for whether the candidate is the incumbent CEO and year dummies.

        For the full sample, investment is positively and significantly related to the first general talent

factor. This relation is positive both for LBO and VC candidates, but significant only for VC candidates.

The other two factors are not significant. For the entire sample, investment is marginally less likely for

incumbents, although this, too, is driven by the VC candidates.

        The three regressions using the two alternative factors yield positive coefficients on all six

coefficients. The “team player” factor is significant for the full sample while the “fast aggressive” factor

is significant only for the VC candidates. The pattern for incumbents is the same as in the regression

using the three basic factors.

        Overall, then, investment decisions are conditioned on management quality, but not so strongly as

the hiring decisions.



VI.     Managerial Characteristics and Performance

        In this section, we compare the CEO characteristics to CEO and investment success. We restrict

the analysis to CEOs who were actually hired. As described earlier, we use three measures of success.

        First, we rely on direct appraisals of CEO success by the PE firms that invest and hire the CEOs.

We code a successful CEO at a rating of 1; a mediocre or mixed CEO at 0.5; and an unsuccessful CEO at

0. We obtained PE firm appraisals for 81 of the 234 CEOs hired.

        Second, we supplement the PE appraisals with information from public sources. We classify a

CEO as successful, if the CEO led the company or another company to a clearly favorable exit such as an

IPO or sale to another company. We classify the CEO as unsuccessful if the company went bankrupt, the

company was sold to another firm under distress or at a substantial loss, or the CEO was removed as CEO

before any exit occurred. In a very few cases, we classify the CEO as having mixed success.




                                                      19
        Third, we create a broad public measure. This measure begins with the previous measure and

then classifies additional CEOs as successful if their company has experienced positive press regarding its

operations or has received additional financing at higher valuations. Similarly, we classify CEOs as

unsuccessful, if the company has unfavorable press regarding its operations or subsequent financing. We

also classify the CEO as mixed if the company that the CEO ran has not had an exit in any form (IPO,

sale, liquidation, etc.) and there is no company informative about its success.

        We also considered, but do not report, two measures of financial success. Again, we first used

direct appraisals of financial success of 68 investments by the PE firms. The PE firms classify the deals

as not successful (the firm lost money), unclear, successful (the investment returned up to two times its

costs) and very successful (the investment returned more than two times its cost). Second, we

supplemented the PE firm answers with information we could obtain from publicly available sources. We

only included financial returns if the CEO remained CEO through the exit. The financial success

measures are highly correlated with the CEO success measures and generate qualitatively similar results.

Accordingly, we do not report these results in the tables.



        A.      Average ratings

        Panel A of table 9 compares the ratings of successful CEOs to unsuccessful CEOs using the PE

measure and the first public measure of success. We do not report ratings for mixed CEOs in the average

ratings tables. (We do include the observations for mixed CEOs in the factor regressions.) The

successful CEOs tend to be more highly rated, but few of the differences are significant. It is more

informative to look at the LBO and VC candidates separately.

        Panel B presents ratings for LBO and VC candidates using the PE success measure. For LBOs,

successful CEOs are rated more highly on 24 of 30 characteristics; 9 are statistically significant. The

significant variables are entirely execution-related or neutral. Not one of the significant variables is team-

related. The magnitudes of the significant variables are economically meaningful. For example, the

success rate of CEOs with a rating of 4 (the top rating) on “efficiency” are 93% and 88% using the PE


                                                      20
and public success measures; the analogous success rates for CEOs rated below 4 on “efficiency” are only

50% and 33%.

        Surprisingly, for VC candidates, successful CEOs are rated higher on only 6 of 30 characteristics.

Five of the characteristics are significantly negative with “teamwork” and “flexibility” being the most

negative. This negative result appears to be strongly related to the technology bust. When we estimate

the differences between successful and unsuccessful candidates in a regression framework that includes

year dummies, successful CEOs are rated more highly on 20 of 30 characteristics. The coefficients on

“efficiency” and “attention to details” switch from being negative to positive while the coefficients on

“teamwork,” “respect,” and “flexibility” remain negatively related to success. These results are

confirmed in the factor regressions that include year dummies in the section that follows. (The results for

LBO CEOs in panel B are not affected by including year dummies.)

        Panel C of table 9 uses the first public success variable. For LBOs, again, successful CEOs are

more highly rated on 27 of 30 characteristics. Again, none of the interpersonal or team-related variables

is statistically significant. Instead, the execution-related and neutral abilities, particularly “efficiency,”

“organization,” “commitments,” “persistence,” and “proactive” are highly statistically significant.

        For VC CEOs, the results are qualitatively similar to those using the PE success measure. The

results also are similarly affected by controlling for year. When year dummies are included, 24 of the 30

coefficients become positive. Again, it is the team-related coefficients that remain negative.

        Panel D of table 9 uses the broad public success measure. The results are qualitatively similar to

those for the first public success measure.

        Overall, then, table 9 strongly suggests that more talented CEOs are more successful in LBO

transactions. The results for CEOs of VC firms are more difficult to interpret as they appear to be

affected by the technology bust of the early 2000s. Both the results for LBOs and VCs suggest, however,

that execution-related skills are more strongly related to success than team-related skills.



        B.       Factor regressions


                                                       21
        In table 10, we present regressions that estimate the likelihood of success as a function of the

CEO candidate’s ratings on the three factors and the two alternative factors. In these regressions, we

include observations in which CEO success is mixed as 0.5. (The results are qualitatively identical if we

exclude the mixed observations and estimate probit regressions.) Again, the regressions include year

dummies and, in most cases a dummy variable for whether the candidate is the incumbent CEO.2

        The regressions in panel A of table 10 combine the entire sample, both LBO and VC CEOs.

Using the PE measure and the more precise public measure, success is significantly positively related to

the first “general talent” factor and negatively related to the second, “team player versus execution”

factor. Both relations are significant. When we use the broader public success measure, “team player

versus execution” factor remains significantly negative while the “general talent” factor does not.

        The coefficients in these regressions are economically meaningful. A one standard deviation

increase (0.97) in general talent increases the likelihood of both the PE and public success measures by

almost 10%. A one standard deviation increase (0.93) in the “team player versus execution” factor

reduces the likelihood of PE and public success by almost 19% and 10%, respectively.

        When we estimate the regressions using the alternative factors that separate the “fast aggressive,”

execution-related and “interpersonal and team-related” factors, we find that the execution-related

(alternative 1) factor is strongly and significantly positively related to success for all three measures of

success. The team-related factor is negatively related to success, although the coefficient is significant

only using the PE success measure. The coefficients for the execution-related factor are also

economically meaningful. A one standard deviation increase (0.93) in the execution-related factor

increases the likelihood of PE and public success by almost 18% and 14%, respectively

        Overall, then the results in panel A suggest that success is related to execution-related talent

rather than team-related talent. Given that the first factor is significantly related to hiring decisions while


2
 The results also are qualitatively unchanged when we include other observables such as CEO age, CEO test scores,
gender, and industry. We do not include them in the regressions that we report because we do not have data on all
observables for all CEOs. Including all of the observables in the regressions would substantially reduce the number
of observations.


                                                        22
the second factor is not, this result also suggests that firms and investors may overweight team-related

attributes in hiring and investment decisions.

        The incumbent variable is not significantly related to success in any of the specifications. One

interpretation of the insignificant relation of incumbency to performance is that the firm-specific skills did

not have any impact on ultimate success controlling for CEO talent.

        Panel B of table 10 estimates the success regressions separately for LBO and VC CEOs. For

LBO CEOs, all three success measures are significantly positively related to the general talent factor. All

three success measures are negatively related to the “team player versus execution” factor with the

coefficient on PE success being statistically significant. All three success measures are significantly

positively related to the “execution-related” alternative factor and unrelated to the “team-related”

alternative factor. As with the regressions in panel A, the coefficients are economically meaningful. A

one standard deviation increase (0.93) in the execution-related factor increases the likelihood of PE and

public success, respectively, by more than 30% and 25%.

        The patterns are somewhat different for the VC CEOs. The “general talent” factor is not

significantly related to any of the success variables. The “team player versus execution” factor is

negatively related to all three success measures, significantly so for the PE and public success measures.

In the alternative factor regressions, success is positively related to the “execution-related” factor and

negatively related to the “team-related” factor. The coefficients for the “team-related” factor are

significant for the two public measures. The positive coefficients on the “execution-related” factors

contrast with the negative results in the univariate analysis in table 9. This confirms the importance of

controlling for years in the VC analysis. The regressions also indicate a marginally positive role for

incumbents holding abilities constant. The incumbent variable is positive in all of the regressions and is

marginally significant using the two public measures.

        The results in panel B are broadly consistent with the results in panel A. Success tends to be

positively related to execution-related skills, particularly for LBO CEOs, and tends to be unrelated or

negatively related to team-related skills, particularly for the VC CEOs.


                                                      23
         Panel C of table 10 estimates success regressions separately for incumbent and outsider CEOs.

The patterns are qualitatively similar for both types of CEOs and consistent with the conclusions from

panels A and B. The PE and public success measures are positively related to the general talent factor

and negatively related to the “team player versus execution” factor. The relations with general talent are

stronger for outsiders. Similarly, the PE and public success measures are positively significantly related

to the execution-related alternative factor for both incumbents and outsiders. The PE success measure is

negatively significantly related to the team-related alternative factor.

         Again, success tends to be positively related to execution-related skills and negatively to team-

related skills.



VII.     Selection Issues

         It is important to acknowledge the potential selection issues with our analysis. The candidates in

our sample have been selected as CEO candidates by the firms in our sample. As a result, it is possible

the certain types of companies look for certain types of people or certain characteristics for their CEOs.

This is the problem of endogenous matching of candidates and companies that arises when unobservable

characteristics affect which CEOs are hired by particular firms. For example, if the most promising

companies hire fast and aggressive CEOs, then we will find that fast and aggressive CEOs perform better.

         We think this type of selection is unlikely to drive our results for several reasons. First, we think

it is implausible economically that the most promising firms hire execution oriented CEOs while

struggling firms hire team and interpersonally oriented candidates. One might, in fact, expect the

opposite, in which case our results reasonably could be expected to underestimate the true effect.

         Second, we consider a Heckman selection model in which the first stage is the hiring decision and

the second stage is the performance relation. In one specification, we include the incumbent dummy in

the hiring decision, but exclude it in the performance regressions. To the extent that the incumbent

dummy is unrelated to performance (which is plausible for the sample overall and for LBOs), this

provides exogenous variation in the hiring decision. When we do this, the results in the performance


                                                      24
regressions are qualitatively unchanged. If selection were a problem, we would expect to see a

diminution in the performance-characteristic relation.

        In another specification, we use the aggregate ghSMART hiring recommendation in the hiring

regression. This helps explain the hiring decision, and, to the extent that it does not contain any more

information than is in the individual ratings, this also provides exogenous variation in the hiring decision

not related to performance. Again, the results in the performance regressions are qualitatively unchanged.

        Third, for companies for which we have more than one CEO assessment, we consider the relation

of the non-hired CEO candidate(s) characteristics to company performance. If selection were a problem,

we would expect the characteristics of candidates who are not hired as the CEO of a particular company

to be similar to those of the hired candidates and, therefore, to help explain performance. However, we

find no systematic relation between the qualities of candidates who are not hired for a particular job and

subsequent outcomes.

        The sample also is selected in that the sample firms are LBO- and VC-funded firms. These may

differ in some ways from public, family owned, and other companies. While we do not have the data to

address this issue, we discuss the likelihood that our results generalize in the summary and conclusions.



VIII.   Summary and Conclusion

        Using a novel dataset of assessments of CEO candidates of companies involved in private equity

transactions (PE), we study how CEO characteristics and abilities relate to hiring decisions, PE firms’

investment decisions, and subsequent performance. The candidates are assessed on more than 30

individual characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study with this level of detail on

CEOs’ specific characteristics, skills and abilities.

        First, when studying the characteristics and abilities, we find that CEO ratings are strongly

positively correlated across characteristics and abilities. A factor analysis of these characteristics

generates two strong factors that can be characterized as a general talent factor and a factor that contrasts




                                                        25
interpersonal and team-related skills with execution-related skills. We also find that outsiders are rated

more highly than incumbents, particularly for buyout firms.

        Next, we relate the abilities and characteristics to hiring and investment decisions. CEOs appear

to be hired based on general ratings or talent. Many individual abilities are significant, particularly for

outsider hires. Those abilities can be characterized as interpersonal / team-related, execution-related, and

neutral. There is a strong tendency to hire incumbent CEOs, holding ratings or talent constant. We also

find that both LBO and VC investors tend to invest in more highly rated CEOs.

        Finally, we relate the characteristics and abilities to subsequent performance or success. Success

tends to be positively related to execution-related skills, particularly for LBO CEOs, and tends to be

unrelated or negatively related to team-related skills, particularly for the VC CEOs. Success is not related

to incumbency for LBO CEOs and, at best, only marginally for VC CEOs.

        We believe our results have several implications. First, it is possible to measure individual CEO

talents and skills over and above the usual observable variables like age, industry and college SAT scores.

        Second, the CEO talents and skills appear to matter in that they are consistently correlated with

hiring, investment, and performance.

        Third, success and performance are more strongly correlated with execution-related skills than

with interpersonal and team-related skills, conditional on hiring a CEO. In other words, CEOs with the

execution-related skills of a Jack Welch appear more successful than CEOs with the more team-related

skills of Jeff Immelt. This is consistent with the prediction in Bolton et al. (2008) that more “resolute,

steadfast CEOs who stick to their guns tend to be better leaders than ‘good listeners’.” It also is

consistent with results in the psychology literature that tend to find “conscientiousness” is the best

predictor of performance. Our results are consistent with Collins’ (2001) findings that “Level 5” CEOs

have unwavering resolve, are fanatically driven, and exhibit workmanlike diligence. At the same time,

our results do not support Collins’ findings that successful CEOs exhibit compelling modesty, build

strong teams, and give credit to others / take blame on themselves.




                                                      26
        Fourth, while team-related skills are significantly related to hiring and investment decisions, they

are not related to success and performance. This suggests that, on the margin, team-related skills may be

overweighted in hiring decisions. It is worth addressing the fact that this suggests that firms do not

always make optimal hiring decisions. This may occur because an ideal candidate is not available or

because private benefits (e.g., of a founder) affect the decision. It also may occur because investors and

companies do not have the right information or decision rules to compare candidates and need to learn.

        Fifth, incumbent or insider CEOs are no more successful than outside candidates, holding talent

constant, particularly for LBOs. This is consistent with the predictions of Murphy and Zabonjik (2004)

and others, and less consistent with the admonition in Khurana (2002) to focus on insiders and avoid

outsiders. Our results suggest that investors should hire the CEO candidate with the most talent.

        Finally, we recognize that the data and analysis have limitations. First, the results reflect buyout

and VC-funded companies. While these are two quite different groups, these types of companies may

have specific needs and, therefore, the results may not generalize to all companies. Second, the

performance data are coarse and potentially noisy.

        That said, the correlation of our results with the description of the “Effective Executive” in

Drucker (1967) is suggestive. Drucker based his work on personal observation of all types of executives,

but, particularly, public company executives. According to Drucker, effective executives “differ widely

in their personalities, strengths, weaknesses, values and beliefs. All they have in common is they get the

right things done.” Those “right things,” detailed in separate chapters, include utilizing time efficiently,

focusing on contribution, making strengths productive, doing first things first, and making effective or

rational decisions. The attributes are largely execution-related and appear to correspond well to the

“efficient,” “persistent,” “proactive,” “commitment,” and “analytical” skills in our study.

TABLE 10 Coefficients from OLS regressions for success of 316 CEO candidates assessed by ghSMART. The endogenous variable is the outcome of the deal.
PE success measure is based on responses from PE firms. Public success measure supplements PE measure with public information on CEO and company
outcomes. Broad public success measure supplements public measure with public information on CEO and company progress. Independent variables include
three main factors from factor analysis and two alternative factors from concentrated factor analysis described in table 4. P-values are reported in parentheses,
and statistical significance at the 1, 5, and 10% levels are indicated by ***, **, and *, respectively. All standard errors are robust.
