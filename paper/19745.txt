A World of Cities: The Causes and Consequences of Urbanization in Poorer Countries

                                              ABSTRACT

Historically, urban growth required enough development to grow and transport significant agricultural
surpluses or a government effective enough to build an empire. But there has been an explosion of
poor mega-cities over the last thirty years. A simple urban model illustrates that in closed economies,
agricultural prosperity leads to more urbanization but that in an open economy, urbanization increases
with agricultural desperation. The challenge of developing world mega-cities is that poverty and
weak governance reduce the ability to address the negative externalities that come with density. This
paper models the connection between urban size and institutional failure, and shows that urban anonymity
causes institutions to break down. For large cities with weak governments, draconian policies may
be the only way to curb negative externalities, suggesting a painful tradeoff between dictatorship and
disorder. A simple model suggests that private provision of infrastructure to reduce negative externalities
is less costly when city populations are low or institutions are strong, but that public provision can
cost less in bigger cities.

   I.       Introduction


Between 1950 and 2010, the world’s urbanization rate increased from under thirty percent to
over fifty percent (United Nations, 2012). In countries such as China and Korea, urbanization
accompanied income growth, following a familiar historic pattern. But the more surprising fact
is that there are many countries, including Pakistan, Haiti and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo, in which significant urbanization occurred despite persistent poverty and problematic
politics. Why did poor mega-cities, like Karachi and Kinshasa emerge, and how do their policy
challenges differ from those faced by the world’s wealthier cities?

In Section II, I document the rise of poor country urbanization. In 1960 the urbanization rate
was under ten percent in the majority of nations where per capita annual incomes were below
$1,000 in current dollars, but no similarly poor country is that rural today. The U.S. only became
one-third urbanized in 1890, when per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was over $5000,
but the poorest urbanizing countries today have hit that threshold with per capita GDPs under
$1200. There have been million person cities at such low levels of income historically, such as
classical Rome, Baghdad and Kaifeng, but typically these were capitals of capably governed
empires. Despite the increasing urbanization of poor countries, the cross-country link between
urbanization and income remains as strong, because richer countries have also urbanized
dramatically.

After documenting these facts, Section III proposes a simple explanation of these phenomena
that draws heavily on Matsuyama (1992) and Gollin, Jedwab and Vollrath (2013). Like those
previous papers, I argue that globalization radically changes the process of urbanization. In an
age of autarky, nations needed to develop agricultural surpluses and strong domestic transport
networks in order to feed their cities. Today, globalization means that Port-Au-Prince can be fed
with imported American rice. The model shows that in closed economies, urbanization typically
increases with agricultural productivity or transport improvements, but in open economies, these
comparative statics reverse themselves. In an open economy, rural deprivation can mean
increased urban growth, as in Kinshasa today.

To test the globalization hypothesis, I examine the link between agricultural productivity,
country size and urbanization in 1961 and 2010. I take small country size to be a proxy for

                                                2
openness, and do indeed find that in both years, agricultural productivity is far more strongly
correlated with urbanization in large countries than in small countries. I also find a sharp decline
in the connection between local agricultural productivity and urbanization between 1961 and
2010, which is compatible with the hypothesis that global food supply has reduced the need to
develop a domestic agricultural surplus before building cities.

Despite their low levels of economic development, the new, poor mega-cities still grapple with
the same adverse urban externalities that have troubled western cities for centuries, such as
contagious disease, traffic congestion and crime. They also exhibit the high costs of housing that
come from density. Yet they must face these problems with neither economic wealth nor
capable government. Section IV and V of this paper address the challenges of governing the
world’s poor mega-cities.

Section IV focuses on controlling the externalities that emerge when people live close to one
another, through use of ex ante prevention or ex post punishment. In the model, individuals take
externality-creating actions, such as careless disposing of human waste or driving on crowded
roads, which have a larger social cost when the size of the city population is larger. A critical
assumption is that the probability of catching a perpetrator declines with city size, which is an
empirical regularity noted by Glaeser and Sacerdote (1999). I also assume that institutional
quality acts as a limit on the ability to punish public officials who misbehave.

Together these assumptions create an institutional possibilities frontier, as in Djankov, Glaeser,
LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes and Shleifer (2003), but unlike that previous paper, city size is an
important determinant of the shape of that frontier. When city sizes are smaller, it is easier to
maintain the rule of law with small penalties, because the probability of detection is larger. As a
result, the large cities that have the most to gain by controlling their externalities also have the
least ability to enforce good behavior through effective punishment.

The first sub-section allows the government to respond to harmful behavior either by ignoring it,
or assessing large penalties or assessing light penalties. Strong penalties are always preferable to
light penalties in the model, because they eliminate the bad behavior entirely, but they may not
be feasible either if institutions are too weak or if city sizes are too large. When only ex ante
punishment is available, the model predicts that smaller cities will always prefer non-regulation,


                                                   3
no matter how good their institutions may be, because the costs of establishing a system are
lower than the benefits. In the largest cities, as institutional quality improves, cities march
through a progression of no penalties, weak penalties and then strong penalties. Medium sized
cities leap immediately from no penalties to strong penalties.

Yet historically, there have been some examples of cities that respond to chaos with draconian
means, even at relatively low levels of institutional development. The early stages of communist
China and Russia may provide one example, and Julius Caesar’s banning of wheeled vehicles
from Rome’s streets may be another. As in Glaeser and Shleifer (2003), I assume that the state
can respond to an externality either by imposing an ex post punishment or taking some form of
ex ante prevention, preventing people from engaging in a harmless action in order to eliminate
any possibility of a harmful action.

At low levels of institutional development, draconian prevention or anarchy become the only two
options and prevention carries lower costs if cities are sufficiently big. At higher levels of
institutional development, ex post punishment becomes possible, first in smaller cities and then
in bigger cities. When ex post punishment is possible, it creates fewer social costs than ex ante
prevention.

These results change somewhat when I assume that bribes can be large without limit. In this
case, any policy can be enforced at any level of institutional development, as long as penalties
are set to be sufficiently high. The downside of such high penalties is that they create the
potential for police extortion. These results echo those in Djankov, Glaeser, LaPorta, Lopez-de-
Silanes and Shleifer (2003) who argue that countries have an institutional possibilities frontier
that trades the costs of disorder, which are represented by the externality in the model, with the
costs of dictatorship, which is reflected by the costs of extortion. Ex ante prevention somewhat
limits the costs of extortion, because people end up avoiding any occasion in which they can be
help up by the police, but the costs of repressing harmless, beneficial activity can be
considerable.

Section V turns to the provision of infrastructure and its relationship with city size, wealth and
institutional strength. Infrastructure provision, such as sewers, aqueducts, and extra highways
reduce the downsides of density, but the marginal returns to these investments may either rise or


                                                  4
fall when harmful behavior is controlled. Harmful behavior reduces the effective level of
infrastructure, which makes the provision of infrastructure more valuable because of its scarcity.
Harmful behavior also reduces the effective infrastructure that is produced with a unit of
investment. Institutional quality will make infrastructure more attractive if the second effect
dominates the first, which depends on the degree of concavity in the infrastructure benefit
function.

This section also follows Engel, Fisher and Galetovic (2013) and examines the private provision
of public infrastructure through devices such as public-private partnerships. Public-private
partnership can offer a means of avoiding the losses due to waste and corruption that occur with
public provision at low levels of institutional quality. However, the downside of private
provision is the possibility that the private infrastructure builder will itself corrupt the state,
especially if the service requires implicit or explicit subsidies. I specifically focus on the
subversion of the land acquisition process, which has been a particularly important issue in the
development of Chinese cities. The model suggests that public provision will be more attractive
when urban populations are large, because large populations increase the social costs of
expropriating too much land, while private provision will be more attractive when city sizes are
smaller. Private provision also carries lower costs when institutions are strong.

The finally part of Section V turns to the issue of housing price and land use regulation. Housing
costs are minimized when state action protects land from private expropriation and lightly
regulates land use. In the west, private protection of property generally preceded significant land
use controls, but many developing countries manage to combine weak protection from private
incursions (e.g. squatting) along with significant restrictions on new building.

This combination is understood as reflecting the objective function of a grasping public sector.
Protecting private property from squatters is costly to enforce ex ante; restricting new dense
development is far easier. As a result, the public sector regulates new building to extract
concessions from developers, but does a poor job of protecting private property.

Section VI concludes. The mega-cities of the developing world have significant problems that
are impossible to eradicate given the current combination of weak institutions and poverty. Yet,



                                                    5
it seems likely that the process of urbanization itself is the most likely path towards the
prosperity and institutional strength that will eventually lead to more livable cities.




   II.     The Rise of Poor Mega-Cities

In 1960, poor nations were overwhelmingly rural nations and South Korea was one of only a few
poor states with an urbanization rate over 25 percent. The majority of poor countries are now
more urbanized than Korea was then. According to United Nations’ data, the urbanization rate
in less developed countries went from 18 percent in 1950 to 47 percent in 2011 (United Nations,
2012). In fifty years, Botswana has grown three to sixty percent urban. China is now over fifty
percent urban, but it was only 16 percent urban in 1960.

These two examples of rapid urbanization are unsurprising given the equally rapid economic
growth in these countries. Real per capita incomes are 19 times higher in Botswana today than
they were in 1960 and China’s real income has increased nearly eight-fold. The historic link
between urbanization and industrialization seen in the U.S. and Europe has led us to expect city
growth in countries with rapidly growing incomes.

Yet urbanization is also occurring in countries like Bangladesh and Kenya, where per capita
incomes have increased by less than $250 over the past 50 years. Despite stagnant incomes,
urbanization has increased from five to 28 percent in Bangladesh and from seven percent to 24
percent in Kenya. Also remarkably, the urbanization of these poorer places has been particularly
centered on a dominant primate city. Three million people inhabit the Nairobi agglomeration
and Dhaka is home to 15 million inhabitants.

Figures 1A and 1B provide a visual confirmation of the phenomenon. Both figures show the
relationship between per capita incomes in 2012 dollars and urbanization across countries with
per capita incomes below $5000. Figure 1A shows the strong positive relationship for 1960,
where there are no really poor places with high levels of urbanization. Figure 1B shows the
same relationship for 2010. Not only has the overall level of urbanization increased, but the
growth has been particularly dramatic among particularly poor places.



                                                  6
These graphs do not mean that the estimated slope linking urbanization and the logarithm of per
capita income has declined over time. To the contrary, the estimated impact of urbanization on
the logarithm of per capita GDP was 3.6 (standard error of .24) in 1960 and 5.3 (standard error of
.35) in 2010, across all countries. Even among poor countries (defined as having per capita GDP
levels below $5000 in 2012 dollars), the estimated coefficient when the logarithm of per capita
GDP is regressed on urbanization has been roughly constant, around 2.6, over the 50 year period.
However, the r-squared of that regression has dropped significantly from .54 to .33, reflecting the
increasing number of extremely poor, urbanization nations.

Moreover, there is a strong link between GDP growth and initial urbanization among the poorest
places, shown in Figure 2. A ten percent higher level of urbanization among these poor countries
in 1960 is associated with .23 log points faster growth between 1960 and 2010. This coefficient
declines by one-third, but remains statistically significant, when I also control for the years of
schooling in this sample of countries in 1960. I am not suggesting that the link between
urbanization and GDP growth among poorer nations is causal, but the robust correlation should
give us pause before embracing policies aimed at reducing the level of urbanization in a country.

To give a more concrete sense of places that are poor but urbanized, Table 1 lists the seven most
extreme nations in my sample, where per capita incomes are below $1250, populations are over
ten million and urbanization is over one-third: the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
Zimbabwe, Mali, Haiti, Pakistan, Senegal and the Cote D’Ivoire. Five of these countries are in
Africa. Haiti and Pakistan are the two non-African countries. Every one of these countries has
an agglomeration with more than one million inhabitants, and there are three cities of four
million or more. There are another eight smaller countries that also have incomes below $1250
and urbanization rates below one-third, including Liberia, a country almost as poor as the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the Kyrgyz Republic, another non-African example.

In 1960, there were only two countries where per capita incomes were under $1250 in current
dollars and urbanization rates were over one third: Egypt and Nicaragua. The number of
countries rises to ten if we raised the income cutoff to $2000, and it would include seven nations
from Latin America (including Brazil and Peru) and three from the near East (Syria and Iraq as
well as Egypt). Indeed, in 1960, urbanization in the typical South American nation was about 11
percent higher than its income level would predict, and the region’s high level of urbanization

                                                  7
was considered to be a puzzle at the time (Durand and Paláez, 1965), as was the extreme size of
the region’s biggest cities. The unusually high degree of urbanization in Latin America remains,
although since the region has gotten much wealthier, it is no longer the epicenter of
impoverished urbanization.

To put the urbanization of today’s poorer nations in perspective, it is helpful to turn to two
different types of history. Figures 3 and 4 show the time path of urbanization for the United
States and then for England and Wales (based on Friedlander, 1970). The implied time series
coefficient when urbanization is regressed on income is .24 in the U.S. and .25 for England and
Wales, which are both relatively close to the cross-sectional coefficients discussed earlier. The
U.S. was one-third urbanized in 1890 when its income was nearly $6,000 and one-half urbanized
in the 1920s when its income was close to $10,000.

The U.K. became one-third urbanized in 1861 when its income was somewhat lower, around
$5,000, and one-half urbanized in 1881, when its income levels were closer to $6,000. Both of
these figures are substantially higher than the incomes reached by the poorer urbanized places
today, although it is notable that the U.S.—a more closed economy— was more prosperous than
the U.K. before it urbanized. France, Germany, and the Netherlands are closer to the U.S. where
according to De Vries (1984) urbanization levels didn’t reach 50 percent until income levels
were well over $5000.

There were, of course, mega-cities in the distant past which had substantially lower income
levels. Table 2 lists the cities that are thought to have reached a population of around one
million before 1875. Rome reached one million inhabitants around the time of the Julio-
Claudian dynasty, when per capita incomes in the Empire were about $1,000 in today’s dollars
and incomes in Italy were somewhat higher. The capitals of Beijing and Baghdad reached that
population level between 800 and 1200, at substantially lower national income levels (Maddison
via Bolt and van Zanden, 2013). Beijing and Tokyo reached one million inhabitants between
1700 and 1800, also at about $1,000 per capita. By contrast London and New York didn’t reach
that threshold until their national incomes reached $3,000 and $4,565 respectively.

The striking fact about this list is that every one of these cities, except for New York, was the
capital of a large empire. These empires existed precisely because their public sector was


                                                  8
capable of conquering and administering vast land areas. They may not have had per capita
incomes that are comparable to those in the United States in 1880, but these countries were able
to use the powers of the state to bring food to the capital and to battle the downsides of density.

Julius Caesar, for example, fought traffic congestion in Rome by forbidding carts from driving in
the city during the first ten hours of the day. Rome was also famous for its governmentally
produced waterworks, as was Baghdad and Kaifeng. These places didn’t have wealth, but they
did have a competent public sector, precisely because they never would have grown so great with
a capable government.

Today’s poor but urbanized nations cannot rely on such public competence. The overall
correlation between government effectiveness and urbanization is significant, but that reflects
only the well-known correlation between public sector competence and income. Among
countries, with income levels less than $5,000 there is no correlation between governmental
effectiveness and urbanization. Figure 5 shows the weak negative correlation between the 2010
estimate of government effectiveness and urbanization across the 36 countries with per capita
incomes under $1500 and populations over two million. Indeed, Haiti and the Democratic
Republic of the Congo are among the nations with the lowest ratings of governmental
competence in the world.




    III.     Why Have Poor Mega-Cities Spread?



I now turn to a positive model of urbanization that is meant to shed light on the rise of
urbanization in countries that are both poor and poorly managed. The model draws heavily on
Krugman (1991) and the vast literature that followed his start. The ideas in the model are highly
indebted to the work of Matsuyama (1992) and Gollin, Jedwab and Vollrath (2013). 2 The
fundamental result is that openness can reverse the link between prosperity and urbanization,
helping to explain why we have seen this unprecedented rise in poor mega-cities.



2
 Unlike Matsuyama (1992), this paper is specifically about urbanization rather than industrialization, and unlike
Gollin, Jedwab and Vollrath (2013), urbanites here produce traded goods rather than services.

                                                         9
I consider first the possibility of a single city, situated in the middle of a line of 2𝑑 units of one
agricultural land. The city occupies no land and makes manufactured goods that can be shipped
at no cost. Farmers on the agricultural land make farm goods that have iceberg transportation
costs, so that if one unit of the goods are shipped, then 𝑒 −𝜏𝑑 goods arrive at a place “d” distance
away. The total population equals N.

The agricultural sector is characterized by a distribution of land density (which is uniform), a
distribution of population density n(d), which will be a function of distance from the city (d), and
a distribution of production. Output per worker equals 𝐶 + 𝐴𝐴 𝐿𝛾 , where 𝐶 is a constant, L
represents land per worker, 𝐴𝐴 represents agricultural productivity and 0 < 𝛾 < 1. Land per
worker equals the inverse of density, so output per worker will equal 𝐶 + 𝐴𝐴 𝑛(𝑑)−𝛾 , and total
output at distance d will equal 𝐶𝑛(𝑑) + 𝐴𝐴 𝑛(𝑑)1−𝛾 .

                                                                                      𝑖            𝜃
                                                                                        1−𝛼 �𝐶 −
Individual welfare is determined by Stone-Geary preferences, so that utility is 𝛼𝛼 (1−𝛼)

𝐶𝛼𝑀1−𝛼, where 𝜃𝑖 represents local amenity levels which equal 1 in the rural sector, C
represents consumption of the primary, agricultural good and M represents consumption of the
composite manufacturing good. For algebraic convenience, I have assumed that the minimal
level of farm production also equals the minimal level of food needed for survival. I normalize
the price of the agricultural good in the city to equal one; the price of the manufactured good is
denoted 𝑃𝑀 .

A farmer at distance d from the city will have a welfare level of 𝐴𝐴 𝑛(𝑑)−𝛾 𝑃𝑀𝛼−1 𝑒 −(1−𝛼)𝜏𝑑 . In a
spatial equilibrium, where land is not rationed by price, the welfare levels for the farmers will
                                                                                                        (1−𝛼)𝜏 3
have to be equal across space, which implies that 𝑛(𝑑) = 𝑒 −𝜓𝑑 𝑛(0), where 𝜓 denotes                       𝛾
                                                                                                              .       If
                                                                                              −𝛾
there are 𝑁𝐴 farmers in this zone, then welfare levels in rural sector equal 𝐴𝐴 𝑁𝐴 𝑃𝑀𝛼−1 �2 −

If the urban sector has a population level of 𝑁𝑈 , I assume 𝜖𝑁𝑈 workers operate independent firms
producing differentiated products. Each manufacturing worker produces 𝐴𝑀 units of

 I have implicitly assumed that property rights are weak, and all farmers are squatters who freely occupy land, but
must share it with other farmers. This will typically lead to overcrowding in the rural sector. The alternative
assumption, which is more realistic in economies with well defined property rights, is that land is rented.

                                                         10
manufacturing goods. Following Ethier (1979), these products are costlessly aggregated into the
                                                                                 1
non-differentiated manufactured good, so that 𝑀 = (∫(𝑥(𝑖)𝜎 𝑑𝑖)𝜎. Manufactured goods cannot
be shipped until they are aggregated which provides the justification for agglomerating industrial
activities in the city as in Ciccone and Hall (1996). Firms will follow the usual constant markup
                                                                 1        1−𝜎
policy, and total output in the city will equal 𝐴𝑀 𝑁𝑈 (1 − 𝜖)𝜖   𝜎         𝜎    . Workers wages, denominated
                                                     1−𝜎
in the agricultural good, will equal 𝜎(𝜖𝑁𝑈 )          𝜎    𝐴𝑀 𝑃𝑀 and entrepreneurial profits will equal
                    1−2𝜎    1−𝜎
(1 − 𝜎)(1 − 𝜖)𝜖      𝜎     𝑁𝑈𝜎 𝐴𝑀 𝑃𝑀 .

In the spirit of Krugman (1991), there could be free entry into entrepreneurship at the cost of
one’s time, and in that case wages and entrepreneurial profits are equal and 1 − 𝜎 = 𝜖.
Alternatively, 𝜖 could be a fixed proportion of the population, so that each worker has a random
chance of becoming an entrepreneur. 4 I will assume that quality of life in the city equals
𝜃0 𝑒 −𝛿𝑁𝑈 , which can capture a range of negative effects of crowding including disease,
congestion and even housing costs. 5 With these assumptions Proposition 1 follows. All proofs
are in the appendix.

Proposition 1: There exists a unique spatial equilibrium with a positive level of urbanization
where residents are indifferent between the agricultural sector and the urban sector. In
equilibrium, the share of workers in the urban sector is independent of 𝐴𝑀 and 𝜖 and rising
with 𝐴𝐴 , and falling with N, 𝛿, 𝜏 and 𝐶.

The equilibrium is unique because even though the productivity in the city goes to zero as the
number of people in the city gets small, the price of manufactured goods also goes to infinity.
Proposition1 reminds us that within a closed economy, agricultural productivity must pave the
way towards urbanization. Since individuals have a fixed amount of calories that they need to
consume, agriculture must be productive enough to support a large urban population.
Manufacturing productivity has no impact on the level of urbanization, because a lower price of
manufactured goods perfectly offsets the rise in per worker productivity.
4
  Alternatively, there could be a fixed number of entrepreneurs in the economy, or there could be skilled and
unskilled workers and only skilled workers have a chance to become an entrepreneur. This latter assumption can
provide a micro-founding of human capital externalities (Glaeser, Tobio and Ponzetto, 2010).
5
  Since the city occupies no land, to be technically correct, congestion would have to take the form of long lines at a
skyscraper, and costs of living would have to represent the cost of high-rise apartments.

                                                            11
The transportation system is also a critical element in the urbanization process in a closed
economy, because if food doesn’t make it to market, then the cities cannot be fed. Those
transportation networks in turn often depended on the power of the state, such as imperial Rome,
which enabled the transfer of food over vast distances.

Urbanization declines with the level of population in this system. As more people are born, they
do not flock to the cities. They must stay on the farms to ensure that people are fed enough. A
natural parallel to this in European urban life is that it is alleged that the Black Death actually
made urbanization easier by increasing the available per capita food supply.

Is there too much or too little urbanization in equilibrium? The derivative of average social
welfare with respect to the urbanization rates equals:

                                             1−𝜎
    (1) (𝑣𝑢 − 𝑣𝑎 ) − 𝛿𝑁𝑣𝑢 + 𝛾𝑣𝑎 +            𝜎
                                                     𝜗𝑣𝑢 + �(1 − 𝛼)(1 − 𝑢)𝑣𝑎 − 𝛼𝑢𝑣𝑢 − (𝜗 −

                        𝑀   𝜕𝑢


where 𝑣𝑢 and 𝑣𝑎 reflect welfare in the urban and rural sectors respectively, 𝑢 is the urbanization
                                       1−𝜎

rate, and 𝜗 equals                    1−𝜎        .
                     (1−𝜖)(𝜖𝑁𝑈 ) 𝜎 𝐴𝑀 𝑃𝑀 −𝐶


The first term (𝑣𝑢 − 𝑣𝑎 ) vanishes in a spatial equilibrium, as it reflects the net improvement in
utility for the marginal migrant. The second term reflects the social losses from decreasing
amenities levels in the urban area from in-migration. The third term reflects the reduction in
crowding in the countryside, which offsets slightly, the congestion in the city. This effect
ultimately represents the weak definition of property right in the rural sector, and would diminish
or disappear entirely if property right there were better defined. The fourth term reflects the
                                                           1−𝜎
agglomeration economies in the city. The term               𝜎
                                                                 is the elasticity of productivity with respect

to city size. The terms 𝜗𝑣𝑢 multiply to give us marginal utility times expected earnings in the
city.

The fifth term reflects the impact of a pure change in the price of the manufactured good caused
                  𝜕𝑃
by urbanization ( 𝜕𝑢𝑀 < 0). This term is essentially a pure transfer between the two sectors and it

would vanish if 𝜗 = 1 and 𝛼 = 1 − 𝑢. If 𝛼 < 1 − 𝑢, then the agricultural share of the

                                                           12
population is greater than its share of the economy, and that means that lower manufactured
prices essentially redistribute from the few to the many, which increases social welfare given this
utilitarian social welfare function with no diminishing returns to income at the individual level.
If 𝜗 > 1, then urbanites have a greater marginal utility of income, and that makes the price
decrease associated with urbanization less desirable.

Ignoring these purely distributional effects, there are three distinct market failures that co-exist in
the system: adverse urban diseconomies, benefits from more land per worker in the rural sector
and agglomeration economies. At this point, we are far from being confident about the relative
magnitude of these effects, especially in the developing world. 6 As a result, it is difficult to
know whether the growing cities of the world’s poorest countries are too big or too small.

In the spirit of Matsuyama (1992), we consider urbanization in an open economy, meaning that
the city has access to a harbor and anyone who comes to the city can buy or sell manufactured
                                                                                                        1
goods at a now exogenous price 𝑃𝑀 , even if no one lives in the city. I assume that while 𝜎 may

be greater than 1 + 𝛿 (providing increasing returns in the urban sector), it cannot be greater than
2 + 𝛿.

In this case, it is quite possible that there are multiple equilibria reflecting the increasing returns
in the urban sector, as described by the following proposition:

Proposition 2: An equilibrium with a positive level of urbanization exists if and only if (1 −
         1−𝜎
𝜖)(𝜖𝑁)    𝜎    𝐴𝑀 𝑃𝑀 > 𝐶, and 𝐴𝐴 is less than a cutoff value of 𝐴𝐴∗ , which is rising with 𝐴𝑀 , 𝑃𝑀 ,

𝜃0 ,and 𝜏 and falling with 𝑑, 𝛿 and 𝐶. The value of 𝐴𝐴∗ is also rising with 𝜖 as long as 1 − 𝜎 >
𝜖 and N as long as 𝛿 is sufficiently small. If there is an equilibrium with a positive level of
urbanization, then generically, there will exist two levels of urbanization that satisfy the spatial
equilibrium condition. At the equilibrium with the lower urbanization level, increases in
urbanization will cause welfare in the urban sector to be higher than welfare in the agricultural
sector. At the equilibrium with the higher urbanization level, increases in urbanization will cause
the welfare in the urban sector to be lower than the welfare in the agricultural sector.

6
 Glaeser and Gottlieb (2008) discuss the estimation of these magnitudes in the U.S. While there exists some clear
evidence for both urban diseconomies and agglomeration economies, the imprecision of current estimates bedevils
any policy advice about urban bigness.

                                                       13
If there exists no level of urbanization at which welfare in the urban sector is higher than welfare
in the rural sector, then everyone farms. The possibility of a city exists if
              1−𝜎
(1 − 𝜖)(𝜖𝑁)    𝜎    𝐴𝑀 𝑃𝑀 > 𝐶 and if 𝐴𝐴 is not too high. The first condition requires that the urban
sector—even if completely dominant—can earn enough to feed itself by selling its goods on the
world market. The second condition requires that the rural sector is not too productive. Factors
that make the urban sector more productive or pleasant increase the maximum level of
agricultural productivity that permits urbanization.

Proposition 2 highlights the fact that as long as there is any urbanization at all, there are multiple
equilibria that come from agglomeration. In the closed economy, a small city means an
expensive manufactured good and that ensures that some people want to work in the
manufacturing sector. In the open economy, that price effect doesn’t exist, and only
agglomeration economies matter. As such, in the open economy setting, zero urbanization is a
decided possibility. Complete urbanization is not, because agricultural productivity becomes
infinite in that case. The nature of this multiple equilibrium setting also suggests that small
changes in underlying parameters, such as small increases in urban productivity or decreases in
rural productivity, can create far more massive urban change than in the open economy model,
where urbanization can occur with astonishing rapidity. These aspects of the model seem to fit
the rapid switch of the developed world from being overwhelming rural to being significantly
urban.

I now consider the comparative statics in the second intuitively “stable” equilibrium, where
higher values of urbanization reduce the relative advantages of urbanization.

Proposition 3: If a spatial equilibrium exists with some urbanization, then at the equilibrium with
a higher level of urbanization, the level of urbanization is rising with 𝐴𝑀 , 𝑃𝑀 𝜃0 , and 𝜏 and
falling with 𝐴𝐴 , 𝑑, and 𝐶. Urbanization will be rising with 𝜖 as long as 1 − 𝜎 > 𝜖 and N as
long as 𝛿 is sufficiently small.

As such, many of the previous comparative statics are reversed. Urbanization now depends quite
strongly on the variables that determine productivity in the urban sector, such as 𝐴𝑀 , 𝑃𝑀 and 𝜃0 .
Variables that decreases the productivity in the rural sector will now cause the urbanization level


                                                   14
to increase, such as 𝐴𝐴 or 𝜏.   Unsurprisingly, the urban quality of life also determines the level
of urbanization in the city.

Together Propositions 2 and 3 highlight the fact that in open economies, urbanization can be the
result of misery, rather than productivity, especially in the rural sector. Because trade has
alleviated the need for agricultural productivity, cities can develop despite enormously poor
hinterlands. This creates both an opportunity—the ability to escape terribly poor rural land—and
a challenge. Massive cities can develop at far lower levels of income as we see across the world
today.

If we repeat the welfare exercise that we did before, we see that with a fixed manufacturing
                                                                                         1−𝜎
price, the social benefits of increasing urbanization equals 𝑣𝑢 − 𝑣𝑎 − 𝛿𝑣𝑢 + 𝛾𝑣𝑢 +        𝜎
                                                                                               𝜗𝑣𝑢 .

The open economy eliminates the redistributive effects that operate through the price of the
manufactured good.

Mega-Cities versus Dispersed Urbanization

Will urbanization lead to a dispersed set of urban areas, as in Europe or the U.S., and a dominant
mega-city as in much of Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa? This question is discussed by
Ades and Glaeser (1995), and indeed many developing world mega-cities are capitals that have
historically benefitted from governmental largesse. Krugman and Livas (1996) argue that the
third world’s mega-cities reflect may reflect import substitution policies that reduce international
trade. The discussion that follows illustrates that the reverse can be also be true, and that
globalization can lead to more centralization.

I now consider the possible formation of a second urban center. I assume that the land segment
is circular, so that it is possible to form a second city in the middle of 𝑑 units of agricultural land.
In the case of the open economy, both cities will be able to trade with the outside world. In the
case of the closed economy, we focus on the symmetric equilibrium where farmers will trade
only with the nearest city. In both cases, the segments essentially amount to economies identical
to those discussed above, but each with half as much land and half as many people. To simplify
matters, I also assume that 𝐶 = 0.



                                                  15
It follows immediately, that a symmetric two city equilibrium will always exist in the closed
economy, for this equilibrium is equivalent to two one city equilibria with half as many people
and have as much land. I prove in the appendix that a symmetric two city equilibrium is actually
less likely to exist in an open economy than a one city equilibrium, because there is a smaller
range of potential city sizes that make urbanization attractive relatively to rural life when there
are multiple cities.

In Proposition 4, I ask whether urban pioneers face strong incentives to start a second city, and
whether a two city equilibrium is superior to a one city equilibrium. An equilibrium will
generally exist in which only one city exists. The agglomeration structure implies that if there is
no one in the city, and the price of the manufactured good is finite, then there will be no
incentive to move to the city, as long as that city is sufficiently small. Thus, to answer the first
question, I will focus on the minimum scale at which a second city can exist and be competitive
with the first city. In the open economy model, in which urban welfare doesn’t depend on the
size of the agricultural sector, this amounts to just asking what is the minimum city size needed
to generate the same welfare as the existing city, assuming that the existing city represents the
larger of the two equilibrium outcomes discussed in Proposition 2. In the open economy case, I
again ask what is the minimum scale needed for a second city to deliver equal utility to the first
city, assuming that the level of urbanization is constant.

In both cases, the formation of a second city will generate advantages for farmers, by enabling
some of those farmers to save transport costs. In the closed economy model, this will also yield
benefits for the urbanites who will face a better price for their manufactured goods. In the open
economy model, the urban pioneers will receive none of these advantages since the
manufactured good is determined by world prices. In the closed economy model, the urban
pioneers face a strong incentive to be as far from the old city as possible, and to locate on the
opposite side of the circle. In the open economy model, urban pioneers face no such incentives.
Typically, they would just choose a good port, but for symmetry’s sake, I assume that they too
locate at the opposite side of the circle.

In the closed economy, urban residents themselves benefit by having cities interspersed
throughout the countryside, since this improves the terms of trade by lowering the agricultural


                                                  16
produce lost in transport. In an open economy, there is benefit to the rural residents by having
dispersed cities, but the only benefit to urban residents is the reduction in congestion.

Proposition 4: (a) In the open economy, if the equilibrium city size (at the higher urbanization
level) with one city is less than city size that maximizes urban welfare, then a new city must be at
least as large as the old city to attract urban pioneers, and if the equilibrium city size (at the
higher urbanization level) with one city is greater than the city size that maximizes urban
welfare, then a second city must be sufficiently large so that if it were the only city, urban
welfare would be greater than rural welfare.

        (b) In a closed economy, then a second city of any size can attract urbanites, as long as
𝜏𝑑 is sufficiently large and 1 < (1 + 𝛼)𝜎.

        (c) In the open economy case, then welfare is always higher in the stable equilibrium two
cities than with one city if the city size with two cities is higher than the city size that maximizes
urban welfare, and welfare is always higher with one city than with two cities if the city size with
one city is less than the city size that maximizes urban welfare, which will always be the case if
𝛿 = 0. In an open economy, welfare is always higher with two cities, even if 𝛿 = 0, as long as
𝜏𝑑 is sufficiently large and 𝜎(1 + 𝛼𝛾) + 𝛼(1 − 𝜎) > 1.

In an open economy, the appeal of multiple cities depends essentially on the battle between
agglomeration economies and urban congestion. If agglomeration economies are stronger than
congestion, so that the city sizes are smaller than the city size that maximizes urban welfare, then
a second city would have to be as big as the initial city to attract new residents. If congestion
effects are strong, which seems quite relevant in the developing world, then a new city would
still need substantial scale. At a minimum, it would need to be as large as the smaller
equilibrium city in a one city economy discussed in Proposition 2.

In a closed economy, however, the price of the manufactured good is rising with the number of
cities, because decreased distances between the city and the hinterland is increasing the amount
of available agricultural surplus. The benefits of increasing the number of cities—to the
urbanites themselves—are always higher in the closed economy. Moreover, an increase in the
number of cities will always increase the urbanization rate, even if there are no urban


                                                   17
disamenities. A sufficiently dispersed number of cities can justify a wide range of urbanization
levels.

The difference between open and closed economies helps, to us at least, explain the nature of
urbanization in Europe, where cities are dispersed and a relatively low share of the population
lives in cities with more than one million inhabitants, holding per capita incomes constant. The
European difference is that these cities developed during a period of high transportation costs
and generally limited global trade, at least in core agricultural products. This led to a dispersed
set of smaller cities.

An Empirical Test

To test the hypothesis that globalization weakened the link between local agricultural
productivity and urbanization, I examine cross national data from 1961 and 2010. I use 1961,
rather than 1960, because of greater availability of World Bank agricultural data from that year.
My summary measure of agricultural productivity is the product of cereal yield per hectare in the
country and arable land per capita in the country. As these measures are influenced by the level
of technological development which is in turn potentially influenced by the level of urbanization,
these results must be seen as being merely suggestive.

Table 3 regresses:

(2)𝑈𝑟𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = 𝑎 + 𝑏1 𝐿𝑜𝑔�𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝐴𝑔 � + 𝑏2 𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑃𝑜𝑝) + 𝑏3 𝐿𝑜𝑔�𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝐴𝑔 � ∗ 𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑃𝑜𝑝)

where 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑑𝐴𝑔 represents the agricultural productivity measure and population represents
population. I include population primarily because of the well-known correlation between
openness and country size (Alesina and Wacziarg, 1998). While actual trade flows themselves
are highly likely to be dependent on the level of development and urbanization, country
population is at least somewhat more independent. My interest is not in population itself, but the
interaction between population and agricultural productivity, testing the hypothesis that the
connection between urbanization and productivity will be weaker in smaller countries. In all
regressions, I have demeaned the population variable in the interaction term, so the estimated
coefficient 𝑏1 can be interpreted as the impact of agricultural productivity at the mean level of
population in the given year.

                                                 18
Regression 1 shows that as agricultural productivity increased by 1 log point (approximately
doubled) in 1961, urbanization increased by 9.5 percentage points. This effect is, as predicted
much stronger in more populous countries. For example, in a country that is one log point larger
than the international mean, the estimated impact of one extra log point of agricultural
productivity is urbanization rises to 13.3 percentage points. Holding these other variables
constant, more populous countries were less urbanized.

Regression 2, like regression 4, includes continent dummies and this causes the estimate
coefficient on agricultural productivity to drop by almost fifty percent. About half of the cross-
national relationship between agricultural productivity and urbanization in 1961 is explained by
differences across continents. That effect, however, remains significant and the interaction with
population also remains significant.

In Regression 3, we find that the coefficient, without continent dummies, on agricultural
productivity is about 43 percent less than in 1961. The interaction between productivity and
population is also weaker, although both variables remain significant. These results seem to
support the hypothesis that local agricultural strength has become less important in city-building.
The fourth regression shows that the basic agricultural productivity coefficient drops to zero
once continent dummies are included, although there remains significant interactions between
productivity and population.

These results hardly prove the hypothesis illustrated by the model, but they also fail to reject the
model’s key implications. The link between agricultural productivity and urbanization has
declined over time, and it is also weaker in small countries than in big countries. By 2010, there
is even a weak negative correlation between agricultural productivity and urbanization in smaller
countries, which is exactly what the model predicts. We now turn to the second part of the
paper—urban governance is poor, poorly governed nations.




   IV.     Externalities and Density




                                                 19
Cities can create great positive externalities, not just the benefits of low shipping costs, but the
spread of knowledge that creates everyday human capital and collaborative chains of creativity.
Yet cities can also generate negative externalities as well. The same urban proximity that speeds
the flow of goods and knowledge also speeds the flow of infectious disease and facilitates crime.
The negative externality of congestion, for example, is practically synonymous with density.

We now turn to the causes of low quality of life in urban areas—the externalities that are
associated with density. These include traffic congestion, water-borne or other contagious
diseases, and crime. High housing costs are also a downside of urban living, not an externality
but rather an inevitable consequence of high land costs. Still, urban policies, such as restrictions
on land use, can artificially increase the costs of living.

Historically, these downsides of density have been fought with infrastructure investment or
behavioral modification (i.e. punishment and fines) or both, and almost all of these problems can
be solved by competent governments with enough money. Even the densest agglomerations can
provide a virtually unlimited supply of safe clean water by desalination and spending enough on
waste water treatment, like Singapore. Congestion can be eliminated by sufficient road building,
public transport and electronic road pricing. American cities have become safe through a
combination of large scale imprisonment and effective, if expensive, policing. An essentially
unlimited supply of usable space can be provided even in tiny land masses by building up.

Yet all of these solutions require wealth or good government or both, and developing world
mega-cities have neither. To address their issues, it is critical to recognize the institutional
limitations that challenge the ability to deal effectively with negative urban externalities. I first
discuss crime and punishment in urban areas, and then turn to infrastructure in Section V.

This model builds on the models of Djankov, Glaeser, LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes and Shleifer
(2003) and Glaeser and Shleifer (2003) in which the ability to punish bad behavior is limited by
the institutional strength of a particularly society. The added contribution here is to embed that
insight in an urban setting in which the costs of bad behavior are a function of city size. The
model will produce implications about the appropriate response to negative social problems,
although sometimes the appropriate response will be to do nothing. This may sadly suggest that
the awful conditions in many developing world mega-cities are the best that can be expected


                                                   20
given the current level of institutional quality. While all of the models that follow are connected,
they are totally distinct from the model described in Section III, and as such, I reuse for different
purposes some of the notation used above.

Individuals first decide whether or not to take a “harmless action” such as walking around in the
city which carries a benefit of “h”. If they take this harmless action, a proportion “v” of the
population has the opportunity to undertake a “harmful action.” Individuals do not know
whether they will have the opportunity to undertake the “harmful action” at the time that they
undertake the “harmless action.” The harmful action might be introducing waste into a potential
water source, or stealing goods from a neighbor.

If the harmful action is undertaken, then the action either brings private benefits of B+A or B,
and the individual knows the benefits before undertaking the action. A share 𝜋𝑣 of the
population will receive the higher benefit level if they undertake the action, and the remainder
will receive the lower benefit level. This heterogeneity is meant to reflect the possibility that
some people will benefit more undertaking the action than others, and may consequently be more
difficult to deter.

The social cost of the harmful action is denoted C(N), where N reflects the city size and
C’(N)>0. I will assume through that C(0)>A+B, so that it is always socially preferable that
crime does not occur. I assume, throughout, that the action does more damage if the city is
larger or denser. If the action is waste disposal or driving on a crowded street, then the
connection with city population is obvious. If the waste spreads disease, then there are more
people who can potentially be infected by the disease.

If the action is crime, then the connection with city population is less clear. After all, the direct
loser from the crime is just the person who is robbed of his property. However, if we broaden
the costs to include the self-protection that urbanites take in response to crime, then the
downsides of crime would indeed be higher in cities, although formally modeling those costs
would require a somewhat different and more complicated model. An alternative assumption is
that the potential for crime is larger in cities because of proximity to abundant victims (Glaeser
and Sacerdote, 1999), which would produce similar results. In the next section, I will allow
infrastructure to alter the costs of this damage.


                                                    21
The most natural response to this action is to impose a punishment of size P on people who are
caught doing the harmful action. I assume that if a punishment of size P is imposed, then the
social cost of that punishment equals 𝜆𝑃, with 𝜆 may be less than one (if the punishment is a
fine) or potentially greater than one (if the punishment is prison). Everyone is assumed to be risk
neutral, so that if the probability of arrest is denoted d(N), then, as in Becker (1968), the
punishment deters those individuals who have low benefits from perpetrating the action if
d(N)P>B and the punishment deters everyone if d(N)P>A+B.

Significantly, I assume that the probability of arrest is also a function of city size, and that is
grounded in both fact and the long-standing understanding of urban anonymity. Glaeser and
Sacerdote (1999) report that arrests per reported crime decline steadily with city size across
American cities, and this correlation probably understates the true negative correlation because
people in large cities report crime less often, perhaps because a report is less likely to lead to an
arrest. One explanation for this link is that police often solve crimes by considering a range of
possible suspects, and the number of possible suspects is much larger in a big city than in a small
town. Anonymity is a fact of urban life—it is hard to know everyone—and that makes it more
difficult to track down malefactors.

The cost of creating a criminal justice system that engages in ex post punishment equals 𝑁𝐾𝑃 . If
there were no institutional limitations, so the system worked perfectly, then at a cost 𝑁𝐾𝑃 , a
system could be established that would deter all crime, by setting a penalty equal to (A+B)/d(N).
This cost must be compared with the social costs of anarchy, which equals 𝑁(𝑣(𝐶(𝑁) − 𝐵 −
𝜋𝐴). If 𝑣(𝐶(0) − 𝐵 − 𝜋𝐴) < 𝐾𝑃 , but 𝑣(𝐶(𝑁) − 𝐵 − 𝜋𝐴) > 𝐾𝑃 , for N that is sufficiently large,
which I assume, then it will be optimal to develop a criminal justice system that completely
deters crime if and only if the city size gets sufficiently large. Since it costs no more to deter all
crime than to deter the criminals with weak incentives, if there are no enforcement challenges,
then it is preferable to set penalties high and deter everyone.

This result would only be strengthened if I assumed, as is probably realistic, that there are fixed
costs in establishing the criminal justice system that could be shared across a wider city
population. The increasing costs of negative externalities in big cities may help explain why
criminal justice and policing emerges first in cities, including both the cities of the classical


                                                   22
world, and during the post-medieval period, but it does little to help us understand the current
problem of developing world mega-cities.

To introduce institutional limitations, I assume that the maximum expected punishment that can
be imposed on a law enforcement official who takes a bribe is 𝑃. This punishment is meant to
summarize the level of institutional development, not because countries with weak institutions
can’t have draconian punishments on their books, but because those countries will have great
difficulty enforcing such penalties. In countries with weak institutions, or in corrupt cities within
generally well-governed countries, public officials collude in ways that enable them to extract
resources without penalty. Police refuse to rat on other police and judges ignore official
malfeasance.

I go further and initially assume that law-breakers, who are caught, make take-it-or-leave-it
offers to policemen, who then accept those offers if and only if they are greater than this
maximum punishment level 𝑃. The ability to punish police therefore essentially creates an upper
bound on the ability to punish criminals as well. No matter how high the penalties for crime are
officially, the maximum punishment will in practice be no more than the minimum bribe level
that will be accepted be a law enforcer: 𝑃.   This limitation can also be interpreted as the
maximum ability of individuals to pay, based on their level of wealth. I will drop the assumption
of limited bribe levels later.

These assumptions suggest that city size and institutional quality come together to produce an
“institutional possibility frontier,” that determines the possible behavior that can be effectively
deterred. If 𝑃𝑑(𝑁) < 𝐵, then the combination of low probability of arrest, caused by large city
size, and weak institutions mean that no misbehavior can be deterred. If 𝐵 < 𝑃𝑑(𝑁) < 𝐴 + 𝐵,
then misbehavior by those with weak incentives to misbehavior can be deterred but not the
misbehavior of those with strong incentives. In that case, it is sensible to set the penalty at no
more than 𝐵/𝑑(𝑁), since higher penalties lead to higher social costs with no offsetting benefits.
If 𝑃𝑑(𝑁) > 𝐴 + 𝐵, then it is possible to deter all misbehavior, and the optimal penalty is no
more than (𝐴 + 𝐵)/𝑑(𝑁).




                                                 23
Figure 6 shows the two institutional possibility frontiers implied by those two equations. The top
curve is an example of 𝑑−1 �𝐵/𝑃� and the bottom curve illustrates 𝑑 −1 �(𝐴 + 𝐵)/𝑃�. These
curves illustrate the highest level of city size that permits penalties to be higher enough to deter
crime. Higher 𝑃 values reduce the probability of arrest, and therefore require a higher ex post
penalty, as such there is a cutoff value of city size, that rises with the level of institutional
development, that determines whether law and order can conceivably be enforced. When city
sizes rise beyond the level implied by 𝑑−1 �(𝐴 + 𝐵)/𝑃� then criminals with strong incentives

cannot be deterred. When city size rises beyond the level implied by 𝑑 −1 �𝐵/𝑃� then no crime
can be deterred.

Even if crime can potentially be deterred, it is not obvious that prevention is better than anarchy,
as illustrated in Proposition 5. To avoid the possibility that governments would prefer bribing
policemen to standard punishment, I assume that the social cost of a bribe equals 𝜆𝑃 +
𝛿(𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 − 𝑃), which is always strictly greater than the social cost of a punishment equal to the
bribe. The logic of this assumption is that the expected punishment to the policemen carries the
same social cost as other forms of punishment (i.e. 𝜆𝑃) and that there may be some social costs
to bribes that go higher than 𝑃, perhaps because policemen’s wages don’t adjust downward fully
in response to the expected bribes. The 𝛿(𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑏𝑒 − 𝑃) will be irrelevant here, when the accused
make take-it-or-leave-it offers, but will matter when I later allow bribes to be determined more
flexibly. I will assume that 𝜆 ≥ 𝛿, based on the idea that if punishment is a fine that it is
presumably equally costly socially to the losses from the net surplus created by a bribe to a
policeman, but if punishment represents prison time, then the social costs will be higher.

                                                                               𝐴       𝐴
Proposition 5: There exists two threshold levels of city population, denoted 𝑁𝐿𝑃 and 𝑁𝐹𝑃 , with
  𝐴     𝐴                                               𝐴
𝑁𝐿𝑃 > 𝑁𝐹𝑃 , and for cities that have less people than 𝑁𝐹𝑃 , anarchy is always cost-minimizing.
                                            𝐴       𝐴
For cities with population levels between 𝑁𝐿𝑃 and 𝑁𝐹𝑃 , then full punishment is possible and cost
                      𝐴+𝐵
minimizing is 𝑃 > 𝑑(𝑁) and anarchy is the cost-minimizing option that is available. For cities

                              𝐴                    𝐵                                     𝐴+𝐵
with populations above than 𝑁𝐿𝑃 , then if 𝑃 < 𝑑(𝑁), anarchy is the only option. If      𝑑(𝑁)
                                                                                               >𝑃>

𝑑(𝑁)
       , then low penalty punishment is the lowest cost available option and if 𝑑(𝑁) < 𝑃 , full

penalty punishment is available and cost-minimizing. 𝑁𝐿𝑃 and 𝑁𝐹𝑃 are both rising with 𝐾𝑃 , 𝜋
                        𝐴                             𝐴
and B, and falling v. 𝑁𝐹𝑃 is also rising with A and 𝑁𝐿𝑃 is rising with 𝜆.

This proposition is illustrated in Figure 6. For levels of population below the level horizontal
                          𝐴
line, which illustrates 𝑁𝐹𝑃 , then anarchy always carries the lower costs. For higher levels of city
population, then full punishment carries lower costs than anarchy, but full punishment will not be
possible when institutional quality is low. As a result, these cities descend into anarchy despite
the significant benefits that law could bring. For cities of intermediate size, anarchy dominates
limited punishment but not full punishment, and so these cities remain in anarchy until
institutional quality becomes high enough to support full punishment.

Finally, for the largest cities there are three regions depending on city size. At low levels of
institutional quality, anarchy is the only option. For somewhat higher levels of institutional
quality, low level punishment is possible and this reduces costs relative to anarchy. At high
levels of institutional quality, full punishment is possible and cost-reducing.

The graph suggests that larger cities may see some form of externality-preventing law before
smaller cities, but it may be imperfect. However, it also is possible that as city sizes grow,
holding institutional quality constant, cities cross the institutional possibility frontier and law no
longer becomes impossible. This is one interpretation of the breakdown in law and order that
many cities experience as they grow.

The proposition and figure suggests that higher levels of institutional quality are uniformly
related to more law and order, but this might not be the case. Many cities with low institutional
quality have adopted quite draconian methods to address crime and other bad behavior, such as
Julius Caesar’s banning of all wheeled vehicles from Rome during the first ten hours of daylight.
Singapore’s early adoption of relatively tough penalties for minor abuses, such as spitting, might
be another example. These policies, and New York’s stop-and-frisk, can be seen as an
alternative approach that veers towards dictatorship in an attempt to promote urban livability.

Ex Ante Prevention: The Institutional Appeal of Stop-and-Frisk

To allow more draconian policies that carry larger social costs, I now extend the model and
allow the government to act against the harmless action (walking the streets for example) that

                                                  25
carries private benefits and no social costs. I refer to this approach as ex ante prevention and
there are many historic examples of governments adopting such an approach. Sabine (1937)
reports the attempts to control waste in medieval London that included fines levied on
individuals who left waste in public spaces (ex post punishment) and locked gates preventing
access to waterways (prevention). Traffic congestion in classical Rome was reduced by Julius
Caesar’s ban on driving in certain hours. A somewhat more strained interpretation of that
division is that it distinguishes between the standard ex post punishment for crimes, and stop-
and-frisk policies that involve searching ordinary pedestrians who appear suspicious.

People who take the harmless action do not know if they will also have the opportunity to
commit a crime and as such, their net expected benefits of engaging in the harmless action equal
b plus the net private benefits to committing the crime. In a first-best world, the state would
leave the harmless activity alone, and only penalize crime. But it is possible to also ban the
harmless action and if that ban is effective then it will also deter all other crime. We assume that
the probability of catching someone engaged in the harmless action is 𝑑0 (𝑁) > 𝑑(𝑁) and the
maximum penalty is again 𝑃, whether or not the person is also committing a crime. The
probability 𝑑0 (𝑁) captures the probability of arrest, whether or not the individual engages in the
                                                                       𝑑0 (𝑁)
harmful act and I assume that 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑁→∞ 𝑑0 (𝑁) = 0 and 𝑙𝑖𝑚𝑁→∞                      = 1. The cost of creating
                                                                       𝑑(𝑁)

these policies again equals 𝐾𝑃 .

Individuals will engage in the harmless act, and the harmful act if given the opportunity, if
                                                                                            𝑏+𝑣𝐵+𝑣𝜋𝐴
ℎ + 𝑣𝐵 + 𝑣𝜋𝐴 > 𝑑0 (𝑁)𝑃, as such the harmless act can be deterred if and only if               𝑑0 (𝑁)
                                                                                                       < 𝑃.
                𝑏+𝑣𝐵+𝑣𝜋𝐴       𝐵
I assume that     𝑑0 (𝑁)
                           < 𝑑(𝑁), so that it is always possible to engage prevention of harmless

actions at a lower level of institutional quality than is needed to engage ex post punishment with
light penalties. This leads to Proposition 6:

                             𝐾𝑃 +𝑣𝜆𝐵                                                           𝐴
Proposition 6: If ℎ < 𝜋 �     1−𝜋
                                       − 𝑣𝐴�, then if city size if greater than a threshold, 𝑁𝑃𝑅 , then it

is threshold that is increasing with 𝐾𝑃 .A, B. h and 𝜋 and decreasing with v. If city population is
                                                                                           𝑏+𝑣𝐵+𝑣𝜋𝐴
greater than this threshold, then it is cost-minimizing to bar ex ante prevention if         𝑑0 (𝑁)
                                                                                                      <
     𝐴+𝐵                                                         𝐴+𝐵
𝑃 < 𝑑(𝑁), and to engage in full ex post punishment if 𝑃 > 𝑑(𝑁). If city population is less than


                                                      26
  𝐴                                                                   𝐴+𝐵
𝑁𝑃𝑅 , then it is optimal to engage in full ex post punishment if 𝑃 > 𝑑(𝑁) and to accept anarchy

otherwise.

                  𝐾𝑃 +𝑣𝜆𝐵                                               𝐴
       If ℎ > 𝜋 �   1−𝜋
                            − 𝑣𝐴�, then if population is greater than 𝑁𝑃𝑅 it is cost-minimizing to
                                   𝑏+𝑣𝐵+𝑣𝜋𝐴             𝐵
engage in ex ante prevention if      𝑑0 (𝑁)
                                              < 𝑃 < 𝑑(𝑁), to engage in ex post punishment with low
             𝐵            𝐴+𝐵                                                    𝐴+𝐵
penalties if 𝑑(𝑁) < 𝑃 < 𝑑(𝑁), and to engage in full ex post punishment if 𝑃 > 𝑑(𝑁). If the
                          𝐴                    𝐴
population is less than 𝑁𝑃𝑅 but greater than 𝑁𝐿𝑃 , then it is never optimal to engage in ex ante
                                                                                𝐵          𝐴+𝐵
prevention, but it is optimal to engage in low penalty ex post punishment if 𝑑(𝑁) < 𝑃 < 𝑑(𝑁) and
                                  𝐴+𝐵
full ex post punishment if 𝑃 > 𝑑(𝑁).

This proposal suggests that draconian rather than light policies can be the cost-minimizing
strategy when institutional quality is low. Targeting the harmless action does create significant
social costs-- individuals are prevented from undertaking a benign action—but it is easier to
target the harmless action because the probability of detection is higher and the penalties needed
to prevent the harmless action are lower. Ex post punishment requires stronger institutional
strength because the penalties must be more severe to be effective, and as a result, they are more
likely to lead to subversion.

One case where this strategy seems to have been followed is the “stop and frisk” tactics used by
the New York Police Department. Crime had risen significantly in New York City between
1960 and 1975, and crime remained high in 1990, partially because of the Crack epidemic. The
New York Police Department followed somewhat more draconian tactics under Rudolph
Giuliani and Bill Bratton, his chief of police, which were continued under Mayor Bloomberg.
One particularly contentious approach has been stopping and frisking people who appeared
“dangerous.”

The police can be seen as targeting the “harmless action,” merely walking around the city.
Anyone who appeared a threat could be searched and arrested if they carried something illegal,
like drugs or a weapon. This greatly increased the probability of catching someone, although it
was not obvious that the person was really causing much harm. The social costs of the policy
were at least temporarily accepted because it was seen as a necessary means of addressing a city

                                                   27
where the punishments and probability of arrest for serious crimes did not seem to deter crime.
The standard logic of Becker (1968) suggests that the city could have raised the penalties, but it
did not have the power to do that, not because of bribery risk (although that was also present
during earlier years), but because of a lack of legal authority.

Flexible Bribery

We now drop the assumption that people make take-it-or-leave it offers to policemen but rather
that there is Nash bargaining between the criminal and the policemen. If the official penalty for
a crime is P, and the policemen suffers 𝑃 in expected value from taken a bribe, then the
bargained bribe will equal 𝜎𝑃 + (1 − 𝜎)𝑃, if 𝑃 > 𝑃. If 𝑃 < 𝑃, then there will be no bribery
and the arrested individual will pay the official penalty.

In the absence of any other issues, it is then possible to always achieve the first best. If 𝜎𝑃 +
(1 − 𝜎)𝑃 = 𝐴 + 𝐵, then all crime will be deterred and neither punishment nor bribery will occur
in equilibrium. Meeting this threshold only requires that the official penalty is sufficiently high.
However, the downside of very high penalties is that this creates the possibility of police
extortion through false arrests (Friedman, 1999). To capture this possibility, I assume that the
police can accuse those they find engaging in the harmless action (which occurs again with
probability 𝑑0 (𝑁)) of perpetrating a misdeed, and unless a bribe is paid, this will cause 𝜓𝑃 in
harm to those people who are accused. They will therefore be willing to pay a bribe of 𝜎𝑃 +
(1 − 𝜎)𝜓𝑃 as long as 𝜓𝑃 > 𝑃. As before, I assume that bribery leads to a social loss of 𝜆 times
                                                                                      𝛿𝜓𝐵
the bribe. For simplicity, I also assume here that 𝜋 = 1, and 𝑣𝐶′(𝑁) − 𝑑′0 (𝑁) �𝑑(𝑁) +
                               𝛿𝜓𝐵𝑑0 (𝑁)𝑑′(𝑁)
(𝜆 − 𝛿(1 − 𝜎(1 − 𝜓)))𝑃� +                  2    which essentially limits the slope of d(N) relative to
                                  �𝑑(𝑁)�

𝑑0 (𝑁) and C(N).

Proposition 7: Prevention is always possible and this reduces costs relative to anarchy as long as
N is greater than a threshold which is rising with 𝐾𝑃 , h and B and falling with v. An ex post
punishment strategy that deters the harmful action, but does not lead to extortion, is possible if
                   𝜓𝐵
and only if (1−𝜎+𝜎𝜓)𝑑(𝑁) < 𝑃, and this carries lower costs than ex ante prevention, and carries

lower cost than anarchy as long as N is greater than a threshold that is rising with 𝐾𝑃 and B and

                                                    28
                         𝜓𝐵                           1        ℎ        𝜓𝐵
falling with v. If (1−𝜎+𝜎𝜓)𝑑(𝑁) > 𝑃, and 𝑃 > 𝜎(1−𝜓) �𝑑                − 𝑑(𝑁)�, then ex post punishment
                                                              0 (𝑁)

with the minimal effective punishment will also deter the harmless action because of extortion,
               1       ℎ         𝜓𝐵
but if 𝑃 < 𝜎(1−𝜓) �𝑑          − 𝑑(𝑁)� then extortion will not deter the harmless action, will generate
                      0 (𝑁)

                                                          1              ℎ        𝛿𝜓𝐵
costs lower than prevention if and only if 𝑃 < 𝜆−𝛿(1−𝜎(1−𝜓) �𝑑                  − 𝑑(𝑁)� and will generate
                                                                        0 (𝑁)

costs lower than anarchy if N is greater than a threshold level that is increasing 𝐾𝑃 , B, 𝜆, 𝜓, 𝜎
and 𝑃.

The presence of more flexible bribery means that it is possible to deter anything. If the
government sets a high enough punishment, then even that punishment serves to increase the size
of the bribe that can be extracted, and that larger bribe can essentially deter any action. As such,
it is now possible for even the weakest government to deter anything, even though the
punishment will never be used.

While the assumption of flexible bargaining may seem realistic relative to the take-it-or-leave
assumption discussed earlier, I am also assuming that there are no credit constraints that limit the
ability to extract large bribes. If those credit constraints are in effect, then there will be limits on
punishment and the results will be similar to those discussed in the previous section.

                                                                                        𝜓𝐵
As before, there exists an institutional possibilities frontier defined by (1−𝜎+𝜎𝜓)𝑑(𝑁) = 𝑃, which

determines whether it is possible to have ex post punishment with no extortion of the innocent.
If 𝑃 is sufficiently high, then ex post punishment without extortion is possible and always
preferable to ex ante prevention and is preferable to anarchy if city size is sufficiently large.

If 𝑃 is lower than this threshold, then ex post punishment will always be accompanied by
                                                                                        1      ℎ         𝜓𝐵
extortion. If the extortion is sufficiently high, which occurs when 𝑃 > 𝜎(1−𝜓) �𝑑                     − 𝑑(𝑁)�,
                                                                                              0 (𝑁)

then it will deter the harmless action as well as the harmful action. In this case, ex post
punishment essentially becomes ex ante prevention. The threat of being held up by the police
will deter individuals from venturing forth. Notably, this threshold is met when 𝑃 is higher, as
                               𝜓𝐵
long as 𝑃 is less than (1−𝜎+𝜎𝜓)𝑑(𝑁), because higher values of 𝑃 increase the bribes that have to be




                                                    29
                                              1        ℎ         𝜓𝐵
paid to avoid extortion. If 𝑃 < 𝜎(1−𝜓) �𝑑                     − 𝑑(𝑁)�, then extortion is not large enough to deter
                                                      0 (𝑁)

the harmless action and it is always true that ex post punishment dominates ex ante prevention.

If ex post punishment is compatible with individuals undertaking the harmless action, then the
per capita costs of extortion equal are increasing with 𝜆, 𝜓, B, 𝜎 and 𝑃, which explains why all
of those parameters increase the population threshold at which ex post punishment (with
extortion) is preferable to anarchy. The impact of N is uncertain, because higher values of N
make it less likely that any individual will be caught and extorted by the police, but higher values
of N also increase the size of the minimal penalty needed to prevent the harmful action, which
also increases the size of the bribe that is paid contingent upon getting caught.

                 ℎ        𝛿𝜓𝐵
As long as 𝑑            > 𝑑(𝑁), which is necessary but not sufficient for extortion not to deter the
                0 (𝑁)

harmless action, then with low enough levels of 𝑃, ex post punishment with extortion, is
preferable to ex ante prevention because the social costs of bribery are sufficiently low. So at
very low levels of institutional quality, ex post punishment is preferable if it is possible. It is,
                                                       1          ℎ          𝜓𝐵
however, also possible, as long as 𝑃 < 𝜎(1−𝜓) �𝑑                          − 𝑑(𝑁)� then extortion will not deter the

the population cutoffs determining whether anarchy is preferable to either ex post punishment
without extortion or ex ante prevention. The minimum population needed for ex ante
punishment to dominate anarchy is higher than the minimum threshold needed for ex post
punishment without extortion to dominate anarchy. There is also an upward sloping line
between the two, for low levels of N, that illustrates the minimum cutoff needed for punishment
with extortion to dominate anarchy. This line meets the line indicating the threshold for

                                                                30
prevention to dominate anarchy at the values of N and 𝑃 where prevention and ex post
punishment with extortion carry the same social costs.

There are also three upward sloping, but largely vertical lines. The leftmost line indicates the
threshold at which ex post punishment with fines, dominates prevention. For lower levels of 𝑃,
ex post punishment dominates, because the bribes that are paid are lower and the social costs of
punishing the bribe-taking policemen are lower. For higher levels of 𝑃, prevention dominates,
and for still higher levels of 𝑃, as indicated by the middle essentially vertical line, effective ex
post punishment will also deter the harmless action, so prevention is the only real possibility.
The rightmost line indicates the institutional possibilities frontier at which extortion-free
punishment becomes possible, and for levels of institutional quality above that point, there is no
benefit from prevention.

This figure essentially suggests that there are three stages of development for larger cities. At
very low levels of institutional quality, it is cost-minimizing to have ex post punishment, but it
must be expected that this will lead to extortion and bribery. At intermediate levels of
development, ex ante prevention is either preferable or the only real option. At the highest levels
of institutional development, ex post punishment is again optimal.

For smaller cities, either anarchy is always appropriate, because the social costs of the harmful
action are sufficiently low, or it is optimal to engage in ex post punishment at high enough levels
of institutional quality so that extortion and bribery do not occur. For intermediate levels of city
size, it is possible that ex post punishment with bribery is optimal at very low levels of city size,
but then anarchy becomes optimal at intermediate institutional quality ranges and then ex post
punishment with bribery becomes optimal again at high levels of institutional quality. For cities
in this range, prevention is never optimal.




   V.      Urban Infrastructure

Many of the largest urban policy decisions concern the provision of infrastructure. America’s
cities and towns were spending as much on water at the start of the 20th century as the Federal
government was spending on everything except for the post office and the army (Cutler and

                                                  31
Miller, 2006). Sewers, highways, and housing all interact with urban externalities. Good
sewers deal with the waste that can make cities pestilential; highways become less valuable when
they are congested. In a sense aqueducts decrease the effective density at which urbanites, by
importing water from other less dense areas.

In this section, I consider three aspects of infrastructure provision in the developing world. In
the first section, I focus on the connection between infrastructure provision and the ability to
address externalities using ex post punishment, as discussed in the previous section. The model
is the same, except that I have added an ability to improve the quality of life by investing in
infrastructure. In this section, I simply assume that infrastructure is provided at a cost and do not
model the challenges of actually delivering infrastructure. In the second section, I turn to the
problems that poor governance creates for the provision of infrastructure. In the third section, I
discuss issues of land use and housing, but do not present a formal model.

Infrastructure and Externalities

I now turn to urban infrastructure, and its relationship with externalities. If the total quantity of
infrastructure provided is denoted “I”, then if the proportion of the population that take the
                                                                                                𝐼(1−𝛼𝑣�𝑁)
harmful action is denoted 𝑣�, then the per capita created by infrastructure equals 𝑏 �             𝑁𝛾
                                                                                                            �,
        𝐼(1−𝛼𝑣�𝑁)
where      𝑁𝛾
                    represents the effective infrastructure and b(I) is increasing, and weakly concave

and equal to zero of 𝐼(1 − 𝛼𝑣�𝑁) =0. I assume that 1 ≥ 𝛼𝑣�𝑁 for all feasible values of 𝛼𝑣�𝑁 so
infrastructure always carries a positive return. The harmful action effectively reduces the
amount of available infrastructure that can be used, by polluting the water or congesting the
street. The function 𝑁 𝛾 reflects the congestion of the infrastructure due to city population.
Holding infrastructure per capita constant, effective infrastructure is declining with city size 𝛾
>1, and rising with city size if 𝛾 <1. This connects with the previous model, if b(.) is a linear
                𝐼(1−𝛼𝑣�𝑁)
function 𝑏0         𝑁𝛾
                            and then 𝑏0 𝛼𝑁1−𝛾 =C(N).

If the cost of providing I units of infrastructure is just 𝐾𝐼 𝐼, then the optimal level of infrastructure
                                   𝐼(1−𝛼𝑣�𝑁)
satisfies: 𝑁1−𝛾 (1 − 𝛼𝑣�𝑁)𝑏′ �        𝑁𝛾
                                               � = 𝐾𝐼 . This implies that the optimal level of
                                                                        �𝑁)

                                                      𝐼(1−𝛼𝑣�𝑁) 𝑏"�   𝑁𝛾
                                                                            �
infrastructure is rising with 𝑣� if and only if −        𝑁𝛾             �𝑁)
                                                                   𝐼(1−𝛼𝑣       > 1. Social harm reduces the
                                                               𝑏′�         �
                                                                      𝑁𝛾

return to infrastructure (a price effect) but increases the need for infrastructure (essentially an
income effect) and if the latter effect is stronger, which requires the function b’(.) to be
sufficiently elastic, then the optimal level of infrastructure increases with the level of social
harm.

To complete the model, it is necessary to return to the level of harmful behavior. I again assume
that the private benefit of the harmful action is B and that 𝜋 = 0. I also assume that there is no
extortion and no ex ante prevention, and those who are accused of a harmful action make take-it-
or-leave-it offers to policemen, which ensures that the maximum penalty is 𝑃. This implies that
𝑣� either equals v, if there is anarchy, or 0, if there is full prevention, and full prevention is only
             𝑃
possible if 𝑑(𝑁) > 𝐵. I assume that 𝐾𝑃 is sufficiently modest so that at some high enough level

of population, welfare is greater than vB given optimal expenditure and effective punishment.

Proposition 8: Anarchy always has lower costs than punishment when N is low and higher costs
                                                                            −𝑏"(𝑥)
when N is close to 1/𝛼𝑣. If 𝛾 is close to one, or if 1 > 𝛾 and 1 > 𝑥                    for all x or if 1 < 𝛾
                                                                                𝑏′(𝑥)
            −𝑏"(𝑥)
and 1 < 𝑥            for all x, then there will exist a unique population threshold, which determines
            𝑏′(𝑥)
                                                                       −𝑏"(𝑥)
whether anarchy carries lower costs than punishment. If 1 > 𝑥                   , then infrastructure is
                                                                        𝑏′(𝑥)

higher under punishment than under anarchy and increases in 𝐾𝐼 cause the punishment threshold
                        −𝑏"(𝑥)
to rise, but if 1 < 𝑥             , then infrastructure is lower under punishment than under anarchy and
                          𝑏′(𝑥)

increases in 𝐾𝐼 cause the punishment threshold to rise. As before, it is only possible to have full
                      𝐵
prevention when 𝑑(𝑁) > 𝑃.


The proposition suggests that the connection between infrastructure and rule-of-law depends on
the shape of the function b(.). If b(.) is extremely concave, then anarchy leads to more, not less,
infrastructure. This means in turn that higher costs for infrastructure reduce the population
threshold for preferring rule of law as rule of law is essentially a substitute for infrastructure.
Conversely, if b(.) is less concave, for example 𝑏(𝑥) = 𝑥 𝜎 , with 1 > 𝜎 > 0, then rule of law is a
complement with infrastructure, meaning that infrastructure is higher if the society has a
sufficient punishment to prevent harmful behavior and higher costs of infrastructure increase the
minimal threshold needed for rule-of-law to reduce costs.

The comparative statics connection per capita infrastructure and population depend also on the

shape of the function b and the value of 𝛾. For example if 1 > 𝑥                   , then per capita

                                < 0 < 𝛼𝑣𝑁. If   2−𝛾

and then falling with city population. If 1 > 𝑥               , then there is always a discontinuous
                                                      𝑏′(𝑥)

increase in infrastructure when rule of law is adopted. Similarly, if 𝑃 rises, making rule of law
possible, there will be a similar increase in the level of optimal infrastructure.

           −𝑏"(𝑥)
If 1 < 𝑥            for all x, then the conditions are largely reversed and there is a discontinuous
           𝑏′(𝑥)
                                                                              −𝑏"(𝑥)
drop in infrastructure if rule-of-law is adopted. The importance of 𝑥                  reflects the fact that
                                                                               𝑏′(𝑥)

this term determines whether a price effect or an income effect dominates in the first order
condition. When rule of law is adopted then the stock of effective infrastructure rises, and this
reduces the return to more infrastructure through an income effect. Conversely, rule of law also
ensures that each dollar invested produces more effective infrastructure and this increases the
                                                                                                −𝑏"(𝑥)
return to infrastructure through a price effect. For the second effect to dominate, 𝑥                    must
                                                                                                 𝑏′(𝑥)

be less than one.

Public vs. Private Provision of Infrastructure and Rule of Law

We now turn from the benefits of infrastructure to its costs, and consider two potential tools for
providing infrastructure. To switch focus, I assume that there is one piece of infrastructure that
can be built and its benefits are fixed, but the provision of infrastructure can be enormously
wasteful, and that waste occurs through two primary channels.

The first, simplest channel is that the public just pays far too much for the infrastructure either
because of incompetence or corruption. New York’s Tweed Courthouse, for example, was a
particularly famous example of massively overpaying for construction inputs in exchange for
kickback to city officials. At a less pernicious level, whenever public workers are paid more


                                                      34
than the prevailing wage rate, the costs of public provision rise. Private providers have a track
record of subverting the political process to increase their rents.

The second primary channel of waste is the construction of bad projects. Bridges-to-nowhere are
a staple of American political discourse. Many economists have alleged that high speed rail
projects in Spain and China cost far more than the benefits they deliver. It is certainly possible
even with competent provision and scrupulous book-keeping to waste billions by providing the
wrong pieces of infrastructure.

I will focus on the first channel and on the comparison between private and public provision. I
assume that two ingredients are needed for the provision of public infrastructure labor and land,
and there is a tradeoff between the two. Providing the infrastructure on less land requires more
labor, specifically if A units of land are acquired than L(A) units of effective labor are needed.
The value of L(0) is finite.

The opportunity cost of labor is denoted w, and private providers pay exactly that amount.
Public providers are unable to perfectly monitor their workers, and I assume that if public
workers spend a fraction “s” of a unit of time shirking, there is a probability 𝜙(𝑠), which is an
increasing convex function, that they will be caught. If caught, they face a punishment of 𝑃. If
the benefit of shirking is equal to the opportunity cost of time w times a multiplier𝑧 < 1, then
they will maximize 𝑧𝑤𝑠 − 𝜙(𝑠)𝑃, which leads to an optimal level of shirking for the public
                                                                                                   𝑤𝐿(𝐴)
workers determined by 𝛿𝑤 = 𝜙′(𝑠 ∗ )𝑃. The labor cost of the project is therefore                   1−𝑠∗
                                                                                                          ,
                                                                               1
because to get one effective unit of labor, the public must pay for          1−𝑠 ∗
                                                                                     units of labor. The total

cost of the project, therefore, holding land use constant is strictly decreasing in the value of 𝑃.

                                                   𝑤𝐿(𝐴)(1−𝑧𝑠∗ )       𝜙(𝑠 ∗ )𝜆𝑃
The total social costs of the project however is        1−𝑠∗
                                                                   +               , reflecting both the loss of
                                                                        1−𝑠∗

value of time from shirking and the costs of punishment.

One natural way to embed the loss from private provision is to assume that the private entity was
able to wheedle more cash out of the public entity by bribery. This certainly has occurred, upon
numerous occasions, but instead, I assume that the primary cost of private rather than public
provision occurs through land acquisition. The land must be acquired from private entities, and I


                                                   35
assume that the true opportunity cost of the land is 𝑃𝐿 (𝑁), which is increasing without bound in
city size. To eliminate the hold-up problem, the public allows eminent domain, but there is a
public adjudicator, who ensures that land acquisition is supposed to occur at a fair price, and in
the cost of the public provision it does. The strength and weakness of public provision is weak
incentives (Hart, Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). Weak incentives make it difficult for the public
entity to eliminate shirking, but they also mean that the public entity will not try to subvert the
land adjudication process.

                                                                                     𝑤𝐿(𝐴)
The public project then chooses the amount of land to minimize financial costs       1−𝑠∗
                                                                                             + 𝑃𝐿 (𝑁)𝐴,
                                              𝑤𝐿′(𝐴)
which leads to a first order condition of –   1−𝑠∗
                                                       = 𝑃𝐿 (𝑁). I am assuming that the public

manager is choosing land to minimize total costs to the public sector not total social costs. The
first best would set – 𝑤𝐿′(𝐴) = 𝑃𝐿 (𝑁), so because the public entity faces artificially high costs of
labor, it ends up acquiring more land than it would if there was no shirking.

The private entity is assumed to face a fixed price contract, and as such it has an incentive to
reduce land acquisition costs if it can. There is a minimum price that the adjudicator can set of
𝑃𝐿 , so there is a potential gain of 𝑃𝐿 (𝑁) − 𝑃𝐿 that can occur if the private provider can bribe the
adjudicator to set a lower price. If the adjudicator takes a bribe, he again faces a maximum
penalty of 𝑃 and has a probability of being caught of d per unit of land. As such, bribery will
occur when 𝑑�𝑃𝐿 (𝑁) − 𝑃𝐿 � > 𝑃. As such, bribery becomes more likely if the city size is larger.
Again, there is an institutional possibilities frontier based on city size. The larger the city, the
more likely the frontier is to be breached because the returns from expropriating land are higher.
If the private entity makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer to the public adjudicator, then the effective
cost of land becomes 𝑃𝐿 + 𝑑𝑃, and the private entity will also use more land, relative to labor, in
its infrastructure provision.

Proposition 9 assumes that 𝜆 = 0:

Proposition 9: If 𝑑�𝑃𝐿 (𝑁) − 𝑃𝐿 � < 𝑃, then private provision generates the first best, and if

𝑑�𝑃𝐿 (𝑁) − 𝑃𝐿 � > 𝑃, there exists a unique population threshold above which public provision
reduces costs and below which private provision reduces costs. Public land acquisitions are
greater than private acquisition at low levels of population, but at and above the population
                                                       36
threshold, private land acquisitions are greater than public land acquisitions. The threshold is
increasing with d, the probability of catching a corrupt land adjudicator.

The intuition of Proposition 9 is straightforward, private provision of infrastructure reduces costs
when cities are small but not when cities are large. The fundamental loss from private provision
is the subversion of the land acquisition process, and that becomes more and more problematic as
city size rises, because the value of the expropriated land gets arbitrarily large. Since the private
providers pay a fixed amount, they ignore this value and continue to use the same amount of
land, no matter how valuable the city’s space becomes.

The results of the model are meant to highlight this issue rather than provide any definitive
answer. It may be that public expropriation is just as big a problem as private expropriation, and
in that case, private provision would always dominate. Alternatively, the private provider may
have other means of expropriating rents and if those scale up with city size, they will also push
against private provision if cities are sufficiently big.

Land Ownership and Housing

In this last section, I will briefly discuss the issues of land tenure and housing provision in
developing world cities. Governments impact land markets in two major ways. They establish
property rights, which are preconditions for development, and they limit development through
new regulation, presumably to address externalities. One public action protects private owners
from private expropriation, which is called disorder in the framework of Djankow et al. (2003),
and the other exposes owners to public takings, which is called dictatorship in the same
framework.

In the west, the history progressed from property protection to regulation. The early history of
English Common Law is replete with institutional interventions meant to settle the matter of who
owned what and to facilitate private control over private property. For example, Henry II’s
extensive use of juries in the 12th century served in part to establish long-standing property rights
over land that may have been taken during the chaotic reign of King Stephen. While there were
regular attempts by the sovereign to expropriate private property, particularly during the reign of
Richard II, the general trend was towards more firmly established private ownership. The
privatization of the commons provides a particularly infamous example of this process.

                                                   37
The rise of state property regulation was, by contrast, a more modern affair. Development was
reasonably un-regulated at the beginning of the 19th century in the U.S. and U.K., although there
had been limited earlier regulations related to war-making (crenellated walls were occasionally
forbidden in medieval England) and fire (Boston forbid thatched roofs in 1631). Localities
became more assiduous in applying rules to property in the 19th century (Novak, 1996) and then
land use regulation became far more heavy handed during the 20th century. New York City’s
far-reaching zoning ordinance of 1916 is a particularly salient example.

The logic of this progression is relatively easy to understand. During the earlier period, the
public sector understood the widespread social losses associated with combat over land rights.
Establishing clear property ownership was a means of keeping the peace, and owners were
typically willing to pay for their privileges. As city sizes increased, the potential downsides from
negative externalities increased. Fire was the first major externality, but later building
restrictions worried about public health and even the amount of light that would be blocked by a
skyscraper.

All of this is clearly understandable within the scope of the model. As institutional quality
increases, it is sensible to take actions that reduce the externalities from conflict. As city sizes
increased and externalities became more costly, it made sense to increase the number of building
structures that would be regulated.

But the pattern in developing world mega-cities reverses this historic trend. In a large number of
developing world cities, private property rights are at best imperfectly protected. By contrast,
public regulations tend to be stringent. For example, the World Bank has catalogued the number
of official procedures needed to build a warehouse in different parts of the world. Some of the
most extreme cases occur in the world’s poorest metropolitan areas. Yet in these areas, squatters
can often occupy private land with impunity, at least from public retribution. This combination
makes land development particularly difficult, because of the double threat of public regulation
and private expropriation. This may help explain why purchasing power adjusted Class A office
rents in Mumbai are among the highest in the world (Gomez-Ibanez and Masood, 2006).

Yet this phenomenon becomes more understandable in light of enforcement costs in weak
institutional environments. Regulations that limit large structures are cheap to enforce. The


                                                  38
structures are large and obvious, and even if there is only a small probability that a building will
get torn down due to a zoning violation, this may be enough to deter construction.

By contrast, pushing large numbers of poor people off undeveloped land is far more difficult. It
can be difficult to enforce and lead to embarrassing journalism. In an environment where
institutions are weak, the costs of limiting construction seem likely to be far less than the costs of
enforcing rights to private property.

Yet while this claim helps us to understand why property rights aren’t protected against
squatters, it does not explain why developing world mega-cities restrict new development so
intensively. There are three plausible explanations: externality-mitigation, historical accident
and rent extraction. The externality-mitigation explanation is that these regulations are
fundamentally benevolent, because of the externalities that high buildings create. This view is
plausible, but seems unlikely given that newer, taller, more densely situated buildings have the
capacity to mitigate disaster risk and reduce traffic congestion.

The historic accident view postulates that these rules were borrowed from the west, where they
were relatively benevolent. Indian land use planners, for example, were heavily influenced by
the British Garden City model. Little attention was paid to the different conditions in Indian
cities, and as a result, inappropriate institutions may have been imported. Those institutions
remain because they are relatively easy to enforce.

The third hypothesis is that land use regulations persist because they provide political power and
rents. A land use regulation is an invitation to bribery and there have been many scandals in
which developers have paid their way to more lenient rules. Future research is needed to assess
which of these theories is more likely to be correct.




   VI.     Conclusion

In this paper, I have argued that the rise of poor world mega-cities is relatively surprising based
on the history of the world. Typically, wealth, or at least political competence, preceded the
development of large urban agglomeration. Yet over fifty years, the world has seen explosive
urban growth in some of the world’s poorest and most poorly governed countries.

                                                 39
In the first modeling exercise of the paper, I argued that this phenomenon is best seen as a by-
product of globalization. The cities of the west developed in essentially closed economies,
where local agricultural productivity and transportation technology was needed to feed urbanites.
The cities of the developing world today can feed themselves based on mineral exports or aid
from abroad. As in Matsuyama (1992), the switch from closed to open economies reverses key
comparative statics. In a closed economy, agricultural prosperity increases urbanization, while
in an open economy, agricultural desperation causes cities to grow.

In the second modeling exercise of the paper, I examine the consequences when negative urban
externalities collide with weak institutions. An institutional possibilities frontier came about
based on the combination of city population and institutional quality. Larger cities are more
likely to need interventions to alleviate externalities, but urban anonymity also makes it less
likely that a given level of institutions will produce good outcomes. When I allowed for both ex
ante prevention and ex post punishment, I found the more dictatorial approach of ex ante
restrictions might be more effective than ex post punishment when institutions are weak and city
sizes are large.

I also discussed infrastructure, which alleviates the downsides of density. But it is unclear
whether infrastructure becomes more or less attractive as institutional quality increases. The key
condition depends on whether restrictions on harmful behavior do more to increase the stock of
effective infrastructure, thereby alleviating the need to spend more, or do more to increase the
marginal gains from building more infrastructure. I also discussed private and public provision,
and suggested that if the costs of public provision are shirking by public employees and the cost
of private provision is subversion of the land acquisition process, then public provision would
dominate when city sizes are sufficiently large and private provision of infrastructure would
dominate with smaller cities.

Given all of the terrible costs when density is combined with limited resources and poor
government, it may be tempting to take the view that mega-city growth should be constrained.
Yet even if a static calculation might suggest that such limitations would be beneficial, the
dynamics effects of cities push in the opposite direction. I documented the robust correlation
between urbanization and income growth between 1960 and 2010 among poorer countries.


                                                 40
While city-building is no guarantee of income growth, it has led to more prosperity more reliably
than rural living in areas with poor soil quality.

Just as importantly, history seems to suggest that urbanization is one tool for institutional
development. The connections and social movements that form readily in the dense confines of
urban areas can ultimately be strong enough to change and discipline government. The rural past
in the poorer world has shown little evidence of supporting institutional development. The cities
of the developed world have been wellsprings for the growth of politically-minded groups.
Indeed, it is possible that an urban contribution to the growth of institutional quality may be the
most important urban benefit.

decreasing in u, while 𝐴𝐴 �(1 − 𝑢)𝑁𝜓� �2 − 2𝑒 −𝜓𝑑 � is strictly increasing in u. It follows
that there must exist a unique value of u at which the welfare levels are the same.
At this point:

The derivative of the left hand side with respect to u is negative whenever the left hand side is
positive. Equation (A1) can be rewritten as
                                                                         𝛾 𝜓−𝛾

where z refers to a vector of parameters. Since the derivative of h with respect to u is negative in
the equilibrium, we know that u is rising with 𝜃0 and rising with any parameter that increases h,
without impacting the other side. From this logic it follows that u is rising with 𝐴𝐴 , falling with
N, 𝛿 and 𝐶. Urbanization is independent of 𝐴𝑀 and 𝜖.

To see the impact of 𝜏, it is helpful to rearrange the equation to be:
                                                       (1−𝛼+𝛼𝛾)𝜏                                              𝛾

(i.e .except when that value equals the maximum itself), there must be two values of u that
satisfy the equality (since the left hand side begins and ends below the right). At the lower
crossing point, the left hand side is rising with u, and hence the welfare in the urban sector is
rising more quickly than the welfare in the rural sector. But at the higher crossing point, the left
hand side is rising more slowly with u, and hence welfare in the urban sector is decreasing

with any value that causes the right hand side to rise and increasing with any variable that causes
the right hand side to rise. As such, 𝐴𝐴∗ is rising with 𝐴𝑀 , 𝑃𝑀 𝜃0 , and 𝜏 and falling with 𝐴𝐴 , 𝛿 , 𝑑,

Proof of Proposition 3:
At any spatial equilibrium (A2) applies, but at a stable equilibrium, the left hand side must be
decreasing with u. As such, any variable that causes the left hand side to increase will cause the
equilibrium level of urbanization to rise, and any variable that causes the right hand side to
increase will reduce the equilibrium level of urbanization. This implies that urbanization will
be rising with 𝐴𝑀 , 𝑃𝑀 𝜃0 , and 𝜏 and falling with 𝐴𝐴 , 𝑑, 𝛿 and 𝐶. Urbanization will be rising
with 𝜖 as long as 1 − 𝜎 > 𝜖 and N if and only if 𝛾 > 𝛿𝑢�𝑁.

likely that an urban equilibrium exists where there are two cities, and if an equilibrium exists, the

level, city sizes will be larger. Welfare must be strictly higher at the lower equilibrium level
with two cities than with one city, because a larger city sizes, guarantees a higher rural welfare
level which must also be equal to the urban welfare level. A sufficient condition for the new
welfare level to be higher than the old welfare level is that the new city size is greater than
𝑁𝑈𝑀𝑎𝑥 , while a sufficient condition for the new welfare level to be less than the old welfare level
is that the old city size is less than 𝑁𝑈𝑀𝑎𝑥 . If 𝛿 = 0, then all cities sizes are less than 𝑁𝑈𝑀𝑎𝑥 and
welfare must be higher than with one city than with two.

Proof of Proposition 5: The social costs of deterring all crime equals 𝐾𝑃 𝑁. The social costs of
deterring the low incentive criminals, but not the high incentive criminals equals 𝐾𝑃 𝑁 +
𝑁(𝜋𝑣(𝐶(𝑁) − 𝐴 − (1 − 𝜆)𝐵)). The social costs of deterring no crime are 𝑁(𝑣(𝐶(𝑁) − 𝜋𝐴 −
𝐵)). Deterring a limited amount of crime is never preferable to deterring all crime, but it is
preferable to deterring no crime if and only if 𝐾𝑃 + 𝑣𝐵�1 − 𝜋(1 − 𝜆)� < 𝑣(1 − 𝜋)𝐶(𝑁). As
                                                𝐴
such, there exists a city size level denoted 𝑁𝐿𝑃  at which the social costs from anarchy are equal
to the social costs of deterring a limited amount of crime, which satisfies 𝐾𝑃 + 𝑣𝐵�1 −

𝜋(1 − 𝜆)� = 𝑣(1 − 𝜋)𝐶(𝑁𝐿𝑃           For all higher levels of city size, limited punishment is
preferred to anarchy and for all lower levels of city size, anarchy is preferred to limited
                  𝐴
punishment. 𝑁𝐿𝑃     is rising with 𝐾𝑃 , 𝜋 and B, and falling with 𝜆, and v. .

Deterring all crime is preferable to anarchy if and only if 𝑣𝐶(𝑁) > 𝐾𝑃 + 𝑣(𝜋𝐴 + 𝐵), and as
                                         𝐴
there exists a city size level denoted 𝑁𝐹𝑃 at which the social costs from anarchy are equal to the
                                                                                  𝐴 ).

higher levels of city size, full punishment is preferred to anarchy and for all lower levels of city
                                                                 𝐴

and falling with v. If 𝑣𝐶(𝑁) − 𝑣(𝜋𝐴 + 𝐵) = 𝐾𝑃 , then 𝑣(1 − 𝜋)𝐶(𝑁) − 𝑣𝐵�1 − 𝜋(1 − 𝜆)� <

𝐾𝑃 , because 𝐶(𝑁) > 𝐴 + 𝐵(1 − 𝜆), so 𝑁𝐹𝑃      is always less than 𝑁𝐿𝑃 .

As such, for all values of N greater than 𝑁𝐿𝑃 , there exists a value of 𝑃 = 𝑑(𝑁) (which is
increasing with B and N) at which limited punishment is possible and desirable and a second
                    𝐴+𝐵
higher value of 𝑃 = 𝑑(𝑁) (which is increasing with A, B and N), at which full punishment is
                                                        𝐴                      𝐴

              𝐴+𝐵
value of 𝑃 = 𝑑(𝑁), at which full punishment is possible and desirable, but there is no level of
institutional quality at which limited punishment is desirable.

Proof of Proposition 6: The social costs of ex ante punishment are always less than the costs of
high penalty punishment. The social costs associated with ex ante prevention are less than the
costs of anarchy if and only if 𝐾𝑃 + ℎ + 𝑣(𝐵 + 𝜋𝐴) < 𝑣𝐶(𝑁) and we denote the value of N at
                                       𝐴         𝐴                   𝐴
which 𝐾𝑃 + 𝑏 + 𝑣(𝐵 + 𝜋𝐴) = 𝑣𝐶(𝑁𝑃𝑅        ) as 𝑁𝑃𝑅   . The value of 𝑁𝑃𝑅 is increasing with 𝐾𝑃 .A, B.

b and 𝜋 and decreasing with v. The value of 𝑁𝑃𝑅 is greater than 𝑁𝐿𝑃     if and only if 𝑏 >
   𝐾𝑃 +𝑣𝜆𝐵
𝜋 � 1−𝜋 − 𝑣𝐴�. As such, if h is low, then low penalty is never optimal. If h is high, then it is
always cost-minimizing to engage in low penalty ex post punishment. If h is low, then for cities
                                𝐴
with population levels above 𝑁𝑃𝑅  , then it is cost –minimizing to impose ex ante prevention when
ℎ+𝑣𝐵+𝑣𝜋𝐴                                                                           𝐴+𝐵

          <  𝑃 and   then engage in ex post  punishment  with full penalties when  𝑑(𝑁)

                         𝑏+𝑣𝐵+𝑣𝜋𝐴          𝐵

when 𝑑(𝑁) < 𝑃 < 𝑑(𝑁) and then ex post punishment with high penalties when 𝑃 > 𝑑(𝑁).

Proof of Proposition 7: If the policy is to prevent ex ante prevention, then there are no false
accusations, since individuals need to be engaging in the harmless action, i.e. be out on the street,
in order to be accused. In this case, ex ante prevention is always possible as long as +𝑣𝐵 <
𝑑0 (𝑁)(𝜎𝑃 + (1 − 𝜎)𝑃 ) and there are no costs from false arrests. As such a value of P equal to
   ℎ+𝑣𝐵         𝜎𝑃
(1−𝜎)𝑑0 (𝑁)
              − 1−𝜎 will achieve ex ante prevention. The social cost is 𝑁(𝐾𝑃 + ℎ) relative to the
first best.

The social cost of anarchy is 𝑁𝑣(𝐶(𝑁) − 𝐵) relative to the first best.

Alternatively, full ex post punishment can be accomplished if ≤ 𝑑(𝑁)(𝜎𝑃 + (1 − 𝜎)𝑃 ), which
is always possible. If 𝑃 > 𝐵/𝑑(𝑁), then a second best is achievable with a fixed punishment
that is less than 𝑃, leading to no bribery and no extortion at a flat cost of 𝑁𝐾𝑃 .
        𝜓𝐵                                                                            𝐵         𝜎𝑃
If (1−𝜎+𝜎𝜓)𝑑(𝑁) < 𝑃, then a second best is similarly achievable, by setting 𝑃 = (1−𝜎)𝑑(𝑁) − 1−𝜎,
                                                                𝜓𝐵
which implies that �𝜎𝑃 + (1 − 𝜎)𝜓𝑃� < 𝑃, as long as (1−𝜎+𝜎𝜓)𝑑(𝑁) < 𝑃.            Ex post
punishment with full enforcement dominates anarchy if and only if 𝐾𝑃 < 𝑣(𝐶(𝑁) − 𝐵). As
                                           𝐴2
such, there exists a value of N, denoted 𝑁𝐹𝑃  at which anarchy and full punishment yield
equivalent costs, and for higher levels of N full punishment yields lower costs, and for lower
                                                         𝐴2
levels of N, anarchy yields lower costs. The value of 𝑁𝐹𝑃   is rising with 𝐾𝑃 and B and falling
                                                          𝐴2
with v. There also exists a higher value of population 𝑁𝑃𝑅    at which anarchy and prevention
                                                                                           𝐴2
yield equal costs and prevention generations lower costs if and only if N is greater than 𝑁𝑃𝑅 .
                𝐴2
The value of 𝑁𝑃𝑅 is rising with 𝐾𝑃 , b and B and falling with v.
                     𝜓𝐵
The curve (1−𝜎+𝜎𝜓)𝑑(𝑁) = 𝑃 is a similar institutional possibility frontier, that determines a
minimal level of 𝑃 needed to enforce the law without corruption. This defines a minimum value
of 𝑃, that is rising in N, B and 𝜓 and falling with 𝜎 at which full prevention is possible without
extortion.

        𝜓𝐵
If (1−𝜎+𝜎𝜓)𝑑(𝑁) > 𝑃, then it is impossible to eliminate crime without generating extortion.             A
fraction 𝑑0 (𝑁) of individuals who are engaged in the harmless action will also be extorted and
                  𝜓𝐵                            𝜓𝐵
will have to pay 𝑑(𝑁) + 𝜎(1 − 𝜓)𝑃. If 𝑑0 (𝑁) �𝑑(𝑁) + 𝜎(1 − 𝜓)𝑃� > 𝑏, then the extortion will
also eliminate the harmless action, and as such, ex post penalties are equivalent to ex ante
prevention. As such, ex ante prevention and ex post punishment become equivalent over some
values and both carry costs of 𝑁(𝐾𝑃 + ℎ).

             𝜓𝐵

assumed, then the left hand side of the equation is monotonically increasing with N. As long as

there must exist a value of N, greater than 𝑁𝐹𝑃 but less than 𝑁𝑃𝑅 at which ex post punishment
with extortion provides equal costs to anarchy. This value is increasing with 𝐾𝑃 , B, 𝜆, 𝜓, 𝜎 and
𝑃.

When N gets small, 𝑖𝑃𝑅    approaches 𝑖𝐴𝑁  and welfare under anarchy must be higher than welfare
under full prevention, since we have previous assumed that 𝐾𝑃 > 0. As N goes to 1/𝛼𝑣 then
any finite infrastructure expenditure effectively provides zero benefits, and welfare goes to vB,
which is less than welfare under full protection.

Proof of Proposition 9:

If 𝑑�𝑃𝐿 (𝑁) − 𝑃𝐿 � < 𝑃, then private provision generates the first best, and total costs are
𝑤𝐿(𝐴𝐹𝐵 ) + 𝑃𝐿 (𝑁)𝐴𝐹𝐵 , where 𝐴𝐹𝐵 minimizes this amount. If 𝑃𝐿 (𝑁) − 𝑃𝐿 > 𝑑𝑃, then the total
financial costs of the project equal 𝑤𝐿(𝐴𝑆𝑈𝐵 ) + �𝑃𝐿 + 𝑑𝑃�𝐴𝑆𝑈𝐵 , where 𝐴𝑆𝑈𝐵 is again cost
minimizing. Naturally, costs are lower if subversion occurs. In both cases, the financial costs of
producing the project are less under private than under public provision. But the total social
costs of the project are now 𝑤𝐿(𝐴𝑆𝑈𝐵 ) + 𝑃𝐿 (𝑁)𝐴𝑆𝑈𝐵 , and these must be compared with
𝑤𝐿(𝐴𝑃𝑈𝐵 )(1−𝑧𝑠 ∗ )                        𝑤𝐿′(𝐴     )
      1−𝑠 ∗
                   + 𝑃𝐿 (𝑁)𝐴𝑃𝑈𝐵 , where – 1−𝑠𝑃𝑈𝐵 ∗      = 𝑃𝐿 (𝑁). If 𝑃 goes to zero, the public entity
costs go to infinity, while the private costs are bounded. As such, for very low levels of
institutional quality, private provision—even with expropriation—dominates public provision.
If N is close to the corruption threshold for subverting the adjudicator, then this will never hold,
then private provision provides essentially the first best, while the public version entails losses as
long as 𝑧 < 1. The private entity will acquire more land than the public entity if and only if
𝑃𝐿 + 𝑑𝑃 < (1 − 𝑠 ∗ )𝑃𝐿 (𝑁). As long as his condition holds, then if 𝜆 = 0, then private provision
dominate public provision. As N gets arbitrarily large, 𝐴𝑃𝑈𝐵 goes to zero, and 𝑤𝐿(𝐴𝑆𝑈𝐵 ) +
                                        𝑤𝐿(0)(1−𝛿𝑠 ∗ )
𝑃𝐿 (𝑁)𝐴𝑆𝑈𝐵 also becomes larger than         1−𝑠∗
                                                       , which is the maximum social cost given public
provision that is independent of city size.

If 𝜆 = 0, the derivative of social costs given public provision with respect to N equals
         𝐿′(𝐴𝑃𝑈𝐵 )(1−𝛿)𝑠∗
𝑃′𝐿 (𝑁) � 𝐿"(𝐴       )
                          + 𝐴𝑃𝑈𝐵 �, which is less than 𝑃′𝐿 (𝑁)𝐴𝑃𝑈𝐵 because higher costs of land
                    𝑃𝑈𝐵
encourage more labor and labor is underconsumed relative to the social cost minimizing level.
The derivative of social costs given private provision with respect to N equals 𝑃′𝐿 (𝑁)𝐴𝑆𝑈𝐵 . As
long as 𝐴𝑆𝑈𝐵 ≥ 𝐴𝑃𝑈𝐵 then the slope is higher for private provision, and there must exist a unique
point with 𝐴𝑆𝑈𝐵 ≥ 𝐴𝑃𝑈𝐵 where private provision and public provision yield equivalent costs.
If N is close to the corruption threshold for subverting the adjudicator, then this will never hold,
but as N grows sufficiently large, the private entity will always acquire more land, and if 𝜆 = 0
and 𝑧 = 1, then social costs of private provision will be higher than the social costs of public
provision.
Since increases in d lower social costs under private provision, but not public provision, they will
raise the threshold at which public provision is preferred to private provision.

Agricultural productivity is defined as cereal yield in kilograms per hectare times hectares per capita. The interaction between
agricultural and population has demeaned the population in the given year so that the raw coefficient on agricultural productivity can be
interpreted as the impact of agricultural productivity at the mean level of population. Data comes from the World Bank. Standard errors
are in parentheses. A constant is included in the regression but not reported.
