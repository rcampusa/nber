                                         ABSTRACT

If international trade is strictly trade in intermediate goods, would the common presumption, that
small, less developed economies (the South) lose from trade wars still be true? We address this
question by constructing a dynamic general equilibrium model in which the North and the South
trade technology-embodied intermediate goods. We show that the detrimental effects of the trade
war are mitigated by the fact that producers in the South can adjust their choice of imported
intermediate goods and their investment in domestic technologies. We establish sufficient
conditions under which the steady-state trade equilibrium length of the production line and the
range of domestic production in the South both expand in response to a tariff war. It thereby
creates a novel channel of scale-scope trade-off: The South counters the losses from trade
protection in the volume and value of trade (scale) with an upward movement along the value
chain (scope). As a result, average productivity in the South and aggregate technology used by
the South both turn out to be higher.

1       Introduction

Since the Great Recession, we have seen increasing trade protectionism, from Brexit, to the rene-
gotiation NAFTA, the U.S.-China trade war, the ongoing Japan-Korea and the possible U.S.-EU
trade wars. Surprisingly, this bout of protectionism has focused on tari¤s imposed on intermediate
products.1 Taxing intermediate goods violates the Diamond and Mirrlees (1971) principle of op-
timal taxation. Equally surprising, much of this increased protection originates from high income
countries (the North). This suggests an obvious question: If international trade is strictly trade
in intermediate goods, would the common presumption, that small, less developed economies (the
South) lose from trade wars still be true, as predicted in the strategic ...nal product trade litera-
ture (cf. Kennan and Riezman 1988)?2 In particular, if the South is able to adjust its technology
via the composition of intermediate goods trade, would the South necessarily su¤er income and
productivity losses as a result of a trade war with the North?
    We address these important questions by constructing a dynamic North-South model of technology-
embodied intermediate goods trade.3 We stress two channels of technology advancement in the
South: one via technology-embodied intermediate goods trade with the North and another via
investment in domestic technologies. Our paper examines the interplay of these two forces allowing
the length of the production line that transforms intermediate goods into ...nal product and the
ranges of exports and imports to be endogenously determined. In response to a tari¤ war, the
South optimally adjusts their choice of imports from the North that are embodied with better
technology in addition to adjusting its own investment in domestic technology. We will show that
the e¤ ect of the trade war is dampened by the fact that intermediate producers in the South adjust
their investment in technology and that ...nal producers adjust the mix of intermediate goods by
importing new varieties embodied with superior technology, which helps the South move up along
the value chain by taking advantage of the North technologies that are available for trade.
    Consider a developing economy, the South, that produces ...nal and intermediate goods. The
...nal good is produced according to a general quadratic production function with a continuum
of intermediate goods (the production line (cf. Shubik 1959; Peng, Thisse and Wang 2006)).
Intermediate goods may be domestically produced or imported from the North. While intermediate


    1
      For example, in the U.S., nearly 90% of intermediate imports from China face increased tari¤s (cf. Bown 2019).
    2
      This literature goes back to the original contribution by Johnson (1953), later generalizated with more compli-
cated strategies by Mayer (1981) and Riezman (1982) and with political economy by Grossman and Helpman (1995).
It serves as a foundation for the formation of custom unions. In our paper, we are abstracting from such strategic or
lobbying behaviors, but focusing on internationally integrated middle product markets between the North and the
South.
    3
      As documented by Hummels, Ishii and Yi (2001), the intensity of intermediate goods trade measured by the VS
index has risen from below 2% in the 1960s to over 15% in the 1990s.


                                                         1
production technologies in the South are inferior to those in the North, intermediate producers
in the South may invest to improve its own technology. Because we use the general quadratic
production function, we can order all intermediate goods used by the South according to their
levels of embodied technology and solve the model without imposing ex post symmetry. We show
that in equilibrium the South will export intermediate goods with the lowest technology while
importing higher technology intermediate goods from the North.
   We establish su¢ cient conditions for the following results. Foreign trade protection hurts domes-
tic intermediate producers'exports to the North on the intensive margin while lowering domestic
prices of these exportables. Under our general quadratic production function, a longer production
line tends to improve productivity due to the usage of more sophisticated intermediate goods em-
bodying more advanced technologies. Thus, in response to foreign trade protection ...nal producers
in the South can counter it by choosing to expand their production line at the expense of reduced
demand of lower-end intermediate varieties. This thereby creates a of extensive margin e¤ect and
establishes a novel channel of scale-scope trade-o¤ in response to protectionism. Similarly, domestic
trade protection decreases imported intermediate inputs on the intensive margin, but ...nal goods
producers can react to the tari¤s by replacing the less sophisticated intermediate varieties with
higher-end intermediate goods, again by expanding the production line as discussed in the foreign
trade protection above. That is, there is an e¤ect on the extensive margin and a scale-scope trade-
o¤ as well. Furthermore, when importing from the North brings in more advanced technologies,
the incentive to invest in lower-end technologies is reduced.
   These conicting intensive and extensive margin e¤ects mean that the net e¤ects of a trade
war are ambiguous. What we can say is that the potential damage of a trade war is dampened by
the fact that ...nal goods producers adjust their choice of intermediate goods both at the intensive
and extensive margins, and intermediate good producers adjust by investing directly in technology
improvements in their intermediate goods. Since trade acts as a mechanism to transfer technology
from the North to the South, ...nal producers contributes to technology upgrading in the South via
shifting toward importing intermediates embodied with higher end of technology, while intermediate
producers have less incentive to invest in domestic technology upgrading. Whether a trade war hurts
the South is then a quantitative question which requires calibration.
   For the calibration, we use the data from Socio-Economic Accounts and World Input-Output
Tables for the period 1995-2009. We divide all countries (40 countries plus the rest of world) into
two groups: high-income countries (the North) and middle or low-income countries (the South).
We then calibrate our model to ...t various data moments of this constructed North-South trade
dataset. We measure the size of the trade war by using information from the current U.S.-China
tari¤ negotiations.


                                                 2
   Our quantitative results show that both exports and imports fall and the production line ex-
pands. This is consistent with our theoretical results. Although imports decrease, an expanded
production line implies that marginal imports embody better technology, thus enhancing aggregate
technology. The trade war turns out to induce a modest increase in average technology and average
productivity in the South. As a result, both the value-added ratio (per unit of domestic aggregate
intermediate demand) and the consumption ratio in the South also increase modestly despite the
detrimental e¤ects of a trade war on the volumes and values of trade.
   To better understand these results we decompose the tari¤ e¤ects on exports and imports. We
...nd that the reduction in imports is exclusively due to the extensive margin e¤ects. The pure
extensive margin e¤ect on exports is negligible. While there is a large negative intensive margin
e¤ect, this e¤ect is partially o¤set by changes in net domestic aggregate intermediate good demand.
   Next, we look into the role of domestic technology upgrading versus imported technology em-
bodied in intermediate goods trade. We conduct counterfactual analysis by eliminating domestic
technology upgrading and import-induced technological advancement one at a time. Our results
indicate that the intermediate importing channel is the dominant e¤ect. Overall, the response of
increasing high technology intermediate imports as a response to a trade war, in conjunction with a
dominant extensive margin e¤ect, constitutes a key scale-scope trade-o¤ driving the main ...ndings.
By performing sensitivity analysis with respect to various pre-set parameters, we ...nd that our main
results remain valid.

Related Literature
   The idea that technology can be transferred by means of intermediate goods trade is based
on the argument by Keller (2000). This argument is recently renewed in a study of multinational
enterprise by Alviarez, Cravino and Ramondo (2019), identifying that ...rm-embedded technologies
transferable globally account for 20% of cross-country TFP di¤erences. Ramanarayanan (2014)
uses Chilean plant-level data to establish that importing more implies higher productivity, whereas
Halpern, Koren, and Szeidl (2015) also establish a counterfactual result, using Hungarian microdata,
that should all input varieties be imported, a ...rm's revenue productivity would be higher by 22%.
That is, all of these empirical studies verify the importance of imported intermediate goods for
productivity enhancement.
   There is another literature linking the use of intermediate goods with ...nal good productivity.
In his pivotal work, Ethier (1982) argues that the expansion of the use of intermediate goods is
crucial for improving the productivity of ...nal goods production. While Ethier (1982) determines
the endogenous range of intermediate products with embodied technologies, there is no trade in
intermediate goods. Yi (2003) and Peng, Thisse and Wang (2006) examine the pattern of inter-
mediate goods trade, the range of intermediate products with exogenous embodied technology. In


                                                 3
Flam and Helpman (1987), a North-South model of ...nal goods trade is constructed in which the
North produces an endogenous range of high quality goods and South produces an endogenous
range of low quality goods. Although their methodology is similar to ours, their focus is again on
...nal goods trade. Impullitti and Licandro (2018) have a model of ...nal goods trade in which trade
liberalization leads to higher productivity through increased ...rm competition, lower markups, and
higher R&D investment. In contrast with all these papers, our paper determines endogenously both
the pattern and the extent of intermediate goods trade with endogenous technology choice. Thus,
our framework focuses on the trade-o¤ between importing technology embodied in intermediate
goods and advancing domestic technology. Furthermore, we characterize the e¤ects of trade pro-
tection on the volume and value of trade as well as on average technology and average productivity
by accounting for both the intensive and extensive margins.


2     The Model

We consider a small open economy as the domestic country, which is less advanced (South) tech-
nically than the foreign country (North). There are two sectors: (i) an intermediate good sector
in which goods may be domestically produced or imported from the North, and (ii) a ...nal sector
that manufactures a single nontraded good using a basket of traded intermediate goods as inputs.
All foreign variables are labelled with the superscript .
    This economy represents a global value chain featuring an endogenously determined production
line along which a single ...nal product can be manufactured using a basket of technology-embodied
and internationally traded intermediate goods.


2.1   The Basic Environment

We focus on e¢ cient production of the ...nal good using intermediate goods. In addition to the non-
traded ...nal manufactured good, there is a nontraded service produced using a Ricardian technology
with unit labor requirement equal to 1=     where       > 0.
    The domestic economy is populated with a continuum of identical workers of mass one, each
is endowed with a unit of time supplied to the labor market inelastically and allocated to either
manufacture-related activities (N ) and the service sector (1   N ). Individual consumers value both
...nal good consumption (c) and service consumption (s), which are fractional substitutes to yield
utility u(c + s), with   > 0 and u strictly increasing and concave. Individual income I is the sum
of wage income (w 1), capital incomes (KI ) and redistributed pro...ts from ...nal and intermediate
...rms (P I ), i.e., I = w + KI + P I . Further assume that capital installed the beginning of a period
is fully depreciated at the end of the period and is rented out to intermediate producers every


                                                    4
period. With rental income and investment exactly o¤setting each other and given the relative
price of service ps , the remainder of individual income is used for consumption purposes, i.e.,
c + ps s = I     KI = w + P I .
   With this simple structure in the absence of capital or asset accumulation, the consumer'
                                                                                           s
optimization becomes atemporal, so the ...nal good can be chosen as the numeraire whose price is
normalized to one at all time. When the consumption bundle is interior (consuming both ...nal
good and service), we have ps = . In this case, there is indeterminacy from the demand side and
...nal good consumption is entirely pinned down by the supply Y . When ps < , we have a corner
solution with agents consuming the ...nal good only. We rule out the other corner case when the
...nal good is not produced. In the interior case, wage equalization between the two manufactured
sectors and the service sector subsequently implies: w =          . The budget constraint then becomes:
c =    (       s) + P I = Y , from which we can solve for service consumption. This enables us to
restrict our attention purely to the manufactured ...nal and intermediate goods sectors to which we
now turn.


2.2    The Final Sector

The output of the single ...nal good at time t is produced using a basket of intermediate goods of
measure Mt . The endogenous determination of the overall length of the production line Mt plays a
crucial role in assessing the "extensive margin" e¤ects of trade protection on the respective ranges
of export, import and domestic production.
   Each variety requires       units of labor and each unit of labor is paid at a market wage w > 0. The
more varieties used in producing the ...nal good the more labor is required to coordinate production.
This follows Becker and Murphy (1992). Denoting the mass of labor for production-line coordination
at time t as Dt , we have:
                                                         1
                                                Mt =         Dt                                      (1)

In the absence of coordination cost ( ! 0), the length of the production line Mt becomes trivial,
depending on the choke price and the price gradient. In Melitz and Ottaviano (2008), there is a
choke price which sets an upper bound on the number of varieties. In our model, there is no choke
price because higher Mt is associated with better technology and a lower price. Thus, in order
to have an interior solution for Mt , we introduce a coordination cost associated with ...nal good
production.
   The ...nal good at time t is produced with a generalized quadratic production technology:
                               Z    Mt                                Z   Mt              2
                        Yt =                    xt (i) xt (i)di                xt (i)di              (2)
                                0           2                     2   0

measures ...nal good productivity, whereas     >    means that the level of production is higher when
the production process is more sophisticated. We thus refer to          > 0 as the production sophis-
tication e¤ ect, which measures the positive e¤ect of the sophistication of the production process on
the productivity of the ...nal good. To consider the product di¤erentiation e¤ect, the second term
is added ­it is thus referred to as general quadratic production a la Shubik (1959) and Shubik and
Levitan (1980). In particular,   measures the complementarity or substitutability between di¤erent
varieties of the intermediate goods, where      > (resp., <) 0 means that intermediate good inputs
are Pareto substitutes (resp., complements). This generalizes the typical linear demand models in
the industrial organization literature by considering ...rms'competition not only in the quantity but
quality (cf. Singh and Vives 1984; Vives 1985).
   It is important to note that, with the conventional Spence-Dixit-Stiglitz-Ethier setup, ex post
symmetry is imposed to get closed form solutions. For our purposes, we must allow di¤erent
intermediate goods to have di¤erent technologies. Using this generalized quadratic production
technology, we can solve the model analytically without imposing ex post symmetry. Moreover,
under this production technology, intermediate producer markups are endogenous, varying across
di¤erent ...rms.


2.3    The Intermediate Sector

Each variety of intermediate good is produced by a single intermediate ...rm that has local monopoly
power domestically as long as varieties are not perfect substitutes. Consider a Ricardian technology
in which production of one unit of each intermediate good yt (i) requires   units of nontraded capital
(e.g., building and infrastructure) in unit of the numeraire ...nal good:

                                             kt (i) = yt (i)                                       (3)

where i 2 I that represents the domestic production range (to be endogenously determined).
   In addition to capital inputs, each intermediate ...rm i 2 I also employs labor, both for manu-
facturing and for R&D purposes. Denote its production labor as Lt (i) and R&D labor as Ht (i).
Thus, an intermediate ...rm i'
                             s total demand for labor is given by

                                       Nt (i) = Lt (i) + Ht (i):                                   (4)

With the required capital, each intermediate ...rm's production function is speci...ed as:

                                         yt (i) = At (i)Lt (i)                                     (5)


                                                   6
where At (i) measures the level of technology and            2 (0; 1). By employing R&D labor, the inter-
mediate ...rm can improve the production technology according to,

                                   At+1 (i) = (1      ) At (i) +    t (i)Ht (i)                            (6)

where    t (i)   measures the e¢ cacy of investment in technological improvement,               represents the
technology obsolescence rate, and         2 (0; 1). To ensure an interior solution, we impose:       +   < 1.

Remark 1: Note that we have technology choice, not technology adoption or technology spillovers.
These concepts are sometimes confused. Technology adoption permits the use of foreign technologies
to produce goods domestically by paying licensing fees. Technology spillovers are uncompensated
positive e¤ects of foreign technologies on domestic technologies. What we mean by technology
choice, is that domestic producers of ...nal goods implicitly choose the level of technology they
use through their choice of intermediate goods used in the production process. They can use
lower technology by using domestically produced intermediate goods; they can also employ higher
technology by using imported intermediate goods that are produced using foreign technologies.
The trade-o¤ these ...rms face is that adopting higher technology production means a larger range
of intermediate goods and higher coordination costs.
    One may easily extend our setup to incorporate technology spillovers. In particular, consider
the case in which foreign technologies embodied in imported intermediate goods also contribute to
domestic technology improvements via reverse engineering. We can modify equation (6) to allow
for spillovers
                          At+1 (i) = (1     ) At (i) + [(1   &)    t (i)   +&   t (i)] Ht (i)

where   t (i)    measures the e¢ cacy of investment in technological improvement for the foreign country
and &    0 indicates the strength of international technology spillovers. While we will discuss the
implication of this modi...cation in Section 5 below, it is clear that such an extension would not
a¤ect our main ...ndings so long as & is not too large.


3    Optimization

When a particular intermediate good is produced domestically but not exported to the world
market, such an intermediate producer has local monopoly power. Thus, we will ...rst solve for the
...nal sector'
             s demand for intermediate goods, and then we solve for each intermediate ...rm'
                                                                                           s supply
and pricing decisions for the given demand schedule. Throughout the paper, we assume the ...nal
good sector and the intermediate good sector are a small enough part of the entire economy to take
all factor prices as given.

         this problem is atemporal, solved by ...nal producers, taking intermediate producers'prices as

         b. investment (R&D labor) in domestic technology and hence labor allocated to production:

Backward solving is applied to solving these sub-stages.

We ...rst solve for ...nal producers'intermediate demands, followed by intermediate producers'sup-
plies and producer prices (Stage ii-a) as well as labor allocation to production and R&D (Stage

3.1.1      The Final Good Sector

Assume that the South produces all intermediate goods in the range 0; nP
                                                                       t and exports intermedi-
ates in the range 0; nE          E
                      t , where nt          nP                                     P
                                             t , while intermediates in the range nt ; Mt are imported
(see Figure 1 for a graphical illustration). We later solve for nE    P
                                                                 t , nt , and Mt .
    The ...nal good producers have the following ...rst-order condition with respect to the demand
for intermediate goods xt (i):
                                                         Z    Mt
                    dYt                                                  0       0
                           =     (       )xt (i)                   xt (i )di         = pt (i), 8 i 2 [0; Mt ]
                   dxt (i)                                0

which can be rewritten as the intermediate goods demand function:

                                     (     )xt (i)       et = pt (i), 8 i 2 [0; Mt ]
                                                         X                                                      (7)

      et measures the aggregate demand for intermediate goods by domestic ...rms:
where X
                                                     Z   Mt
                                                                     0       0
                                             et
                                             X                   xt (i )di :
                                                     0

    Solving from (7), we can derive the price elasticity of intermediate good demand (in absolute
                       pt (i)     4
value) as   t (i)      et pt (i) .       We now have the following Lemma.
                       X

Lemma 1: (Demand for Intermediate Goods) The demand for intermediate good is downward
sloping. If intermediate goods are Pareto substitutes ( > 0), a larger aggregate intermediate good
demand by domestic ...rms (higher X et ) reduces individual intermediate good demand but raises the
price elasticity for all varieties.

    From (7), it can be seen that the generalized production function yields a linear relative demand
for intermediate goods:
                                                      0                                    0
                                     pt (i)      pt (i ) =     (           )[xt (i)   xt (i )]:                                    (8)

Lemma 2: (Relative Demand for Intermediate Goods) The relative demand for intermediate goods
is downward sloping. Additionally, the stronger the production sophistication e¤ ect is (higher                                      ),
the less elastic the relative demand will be.

    We can then derive the ...nal good producer's ...rst-order condition with respect to the length of
the production line Mt (see the Appendix):5

                                     xt (Mt )         et xt (Mt ) = w + (1 + )p (Mt )xt (Mt )
                                                      X                                                                            (9)
                                                                               t
                             2

where the left-hand side represents the marginal bene...t from and the right-hand side the marginal
cost of expanding the production line. Given                           >     , the solution to relative demand exists if
[     Xet (1 + )pt (Mt )]2 > 2(     )w .
    Next, we analyze the intermediate good sector.


3.1.2    The Intermediate Sector

With local monopoly power, each intermediate ...rm i, given its own production function (5) and
...nal producers' intermediate goods demand functions (7), can jointly determine the quantity of
intermediate good to supply yt (i) and the associated price pt (i), as well as its labor allocation to
production Lt (i) and technology advancement Ht (i). By utilizing capital requirement expression



   4                                                                                      et
                                                                                          X    pt (i)
     From (7), the intermediate demand can be expressed as xt (i) =                                     . Thus, the price elasticity of
intermediate good demand in absolute value is derived as
                                              pt (i)dxt (i)   pt (i)   1               pt (i)
                                 t (i)                      =                 =                   :
                                              xt (i)dpt (i)   xt (i)                   Xet pt (i)

     It is assumed there is a very large M being produced in the world so that any local demand for M can be met
with imports from the rest of the world.


                                                                   9

by the following Bellman equation:
                                                                                                      1

                     s.t.    (5), (6) and (7).

   De...ne pt (i) as the North intermediate goods producer price, which is the delivered price (CNF
price) in the North. Let          be the South tari¤ and                     the North tari¤. Next, consider pricing
decisions. Given unlimited demand in the North, South intermediate producers would not be able
                                                                                                                           pt (i)
to sell above the North tari¤ adjusted price, so the exporting price is given by PtE (i) =                                 1+
over the exporting range [0; nE
                              t ]. South importers are paying the South tari¤ adjusted North price
PtM (i) = (1 + )pt (i) over the import range [nP                                    E    P
                                               t ; Mt ]. Over the nontraded range [nt ; nt ], we solve
(10) to derive intermediate good producer prices PtP (i). Hence,

                               t               t                                        i 2 nP
                                                                                             t ; Mt

Notice that pt (i) is decreasing in At (i), which implies that better technology corresponds to lower
                                                                                                         dpt (i)
costs and hence lower intermediate good prices. As a result, it is expected that                           di      < 0; that is,
the intermediate good price function is downward-sloping in ordered varieties (i).
   Given that intermediate goods are Pareto substitutes, a higher aggregate demand for interme-
diate goods by domestic ...rms lowers the marginal product of each variety, thereby lowering the
local monopoly pricing of each variety, implying a downward shift in the PtP (i) locus. Thus, we
have the following Lemma.

Lemma 3: (Producer Price Schedule) Within the nontraded range [nE    P
                                                                t ; nt ], the steady-state in-
termediate good price schedule is downward sloping in ordered varieties ( i), shifting downward in
response to a larger aggregate intermediate goods demand by domestic ...rms ( Xet ).

   Denoting zt (i) as South's exports of intermediate good i and zt (i) as South's imports of inter-
mediate good i, we can express         the supply of intermediate good i as:

We now turn to solving the system for a steady state.


4    Steady-State Trade Equilibrium

Recall that the North-South trade follows a trade-cost-augmented pricing rule, that is, (i) (will-
                                               pt (i)

                                                                                      t and (ii) (international
competition ) PtP (i) > PtM (i) = (1 + )pt (i) over the import range i 2 nP
                                                                          t ; Mt . We are now
prepared to de...ne the dynamic trade equilibrium:

(i) (Optimization) consumers, ...nal producer and intermediate producers all optimize;

(ii) (Trade) intermediate goods are traded according to trade-cost-augmented pricing rule;

      identities (4);

(iv) (Technology advancement) technologies evolved according to (6);

(v) (Market clearing) labor and ...nal good market clear domestically whereas each intermediate
      good supply net of demand equals net export.

A steady-state trade equilibrium (SSTE) is a DTE such that technologies and all other quan-
tities and values cease to grow.


4.1     Labor Allocation and Technology

In steady-state equilibrium, all endogenous variables are constant over time. Thus, (6) implies:
                                                          1
                                                  A(i)
                                   H (i) =                    ;   8 i 2 [0; nP ]:                             (20)
                                                   (i)
This expression implies a positive relationship between the investment in domestic technology in
forms of H (i). By manipulation (see the Appendix), we obtain the steady-state level of domestic
technology A(i) over the range i 2 [0; nP ]:

                                    A(i) = A (i)L(i) ;            8 i 2 [0; nP ]                              (21)

where
                                               1
                                      A       1
                                                                        > 0:
                                                          ( + )
One can think of A as the technology scaling factor and                       (i) as the technology gradient that
measures how quickly technology improves as i increases.
   Next, we substitute (21) into (17), yielding the following expression in L(i) alone:
                           pt (i)                             +   1
                                            A (i)L(i)                 = w;    8 i 2 [0; nE ]                  (22)
                           1+

which can be used to derive labor demand for i 2 [0; nE ], denoted as LE (i):
                                                                                   1
                               E               pt (i)                          1
                              L (i) =                                 A (i)              :
                                             w 1+

For i 2 [nE ; nP ], the following is used to derive the labor demand:

             M P L(i) = A (i)L(i)      (1         )
                                                      [           e
                                                                  X     (2             )A (i)L(i)   +
                                                                                                        ]=w   (23)

pin down labor demand in steady-state equilibrium (point E ).
   That is, an increase in the degree of production sophistication (                                            ), the degree of substi-
tutability between intermediate good varieties ( ), or the aggregate intermediate goods demand
                    e ) all shifts the M P L schedule down. As a consequence, intermediate ...rms'

demand for labor falls.

Lemma 4: (Labor Demand for Intermediate Goods Production) Within the nontraded range
[nE ; nP ], labor demand is decreasing in the aggregate intermediate goods demand by domestic ...rms
(Xe ), the degree of production sophistication (         ), and the degree of substitutability between
intermediate good varieties ( ) in the steady state.

   Next, we can use (4), (20) and (21) to derive R&D labor demand and total labor demand by
each intermediate ...rm as follows:
                                                             1
                                               H (i) =   A       L(i);       8 i 2 [0; nP ];                                       (24)
                                                  h                          1   i
                            N (i) = L(i) + H (i) = 1 +                 A             L(i);       8 i 2 [0; nP ]:                   (25)

The aggregate labor demand in the manufacture sectors is given by,
                                                    "Z P         #

                                                                                     0


where the residual 1                 N is allocated to the service sector.


4.2   Intermediate Goods Supply, Exports, and Pro...ts

Substituting (21) into (5) yields the steady-state supply of intermediate goods:

                                                                   +
                                             y (i) = A (i)L(i)           ;   8 i 2 [0; nP ]:                                       (27)

From (27) and (13), we obtain the steady-state exports:

                                                                                             e   pt (i)
                                                         E         +                         X   1+
              z (i) = y (i)              x(i) = A (i) L (i)                                               ;   8 i 2 [0; nE ]:      (28)



                                                                  13
                                                                                                                              1
                                                                               p(i)
   To ensure nonnegative pro...t, we impose                                p(i)             x(i)   >      [1 + ( A) ] for i 2 [nE ; nP ] and
              1
 [1 + ( A) ] < 1 for i 2 [0; nE ]. Since the latter condition always implies the former, we can use
the de...nition of A to specify the following condition to ensure positive pro...tability:

Condition N: (Nonnegative Pro...t)                       +       <1            .

This condition requires that the technology obsolescence rate be small enough.


4.3     Production Line and Pattern of Production and Trade

The local country'
                 s technology choice with regards to intermediate goods production depends cru-
cially on whether local production of a particular variety is cheaper than importing it. For con-
venience, we arrange the varieties of intermediate goods from the lowest technology to highest
technology. Consider
                                         (i) = (1 +                  i);           (i) =           (1 +         i):                                                   (29)
It is natural to assume that the advanced country has weakly better basic technology                                                                                  and
strictly better advanced technologies, implying a steeper technology gradient                                                               > .
   Since technology embodied in intermediated goods is upward-sloping in ordered varieties (i),
a longer production line is associated with a new composition of varieties with higher end of
technologies. Through intermediate goods trade, an expansion of production line thus constitutes
a form of technology upgrading via an upward movement along the global value chain.


4.3.1    Determination of the Production Line

We can now derive an expression for aggregate intermediate goods demand by domestic ...rms (see

This is called the domestic aggregate intermediate demand locus. In addition, by substituting (13)
into (9), we can get the boundary condition at M :
                                                                  p

which will be referred to as the production-line trade-o¤ (M M ) locus.
   Before characterizing the relationship between M and X  e , it is important to check the second-
order condition with respect to the length of the production line. From (9), and (30), we can derive
the second-order condition as:
                                         M x(M )                M dp (M )
                                                   >
                                      (1 + )p (M )            p (M ) dM
For tractability, world price is speci...ed by:

                                                 p (i) = p      b i

The second-order condition for an interior solution of M becomes:
                                                       q
                                                         2w
Condition S: (Second-Order Condition) (1 + ) b <            .

To obtain an interior solution of the length of production line, it is necessary to assume that
intermediate goods are Pareto substitutes in producing the ...nal good (                   > 0), which we shall
impose throughout the remainder of the paper. This condition requires that the gradient of the
tari¤ augmented imported intermediate goods prices be properly at.

Remark 2: Under the North-South setting, assume that M                     M , that is, the North owns better
technology in producing intermediate goods. If Condition S fails to hold, we end up with a corner
solution M = M .

   We next turn to the determination of the length of the production line for a given nE ; nP :6
                                                     e =G
To do this, we rewrite (30) as an implicit function: X     e M nE ;nP ) where the function G
                                                        ~ (X;                                ~ is
de...ned as the right-hand side of (30). From (23), the e¤ect of an increase in aggregate intermediate
goods X e is to lower labor demand, As a consequence, the implicit function above gives rise to a
                                  e = G(M
unique ...xed point relationship: X                nE ;nP   ). This is plotted as the XX locus in Figure 3(a)
in which the M M locus is given by (31). Di¤erentiation of both loci with respect to M indicates
both are positively sloped.7
   6
     We determine nE ; nP in subsection 4.3.2 below.
   7
     Intuion for the M M locus result is that since intermediate goods are Pareto substitutes, the direct e¤ect of an
increase in aggregate intermediate goods, Xe , reduces the demand for each intermediate good. As M increases, the
price of the intermediate good at the boundary, p (M ), falls, as does the cost of using this intermediate good. This
encourages the demand for x(M ) and, to restore equilibrium in (31), one must adjust X   e upward, implying that the
M M locus is upward sloping. The intuition for the XX locus is more complicated. For illustrative purposes, let us


                                                         15
    Since the M M locus is the boundary condition pinning down the overall length of the production
line, it is expected to be more responsive to changes in M compared to the XX locus. As a result,
the XX locus is atter than the M M locus. This slope requirement is formally speci...ed as:
                                                        e
                                                       dX                  e
                                                                          dX
Condition C: (Correspondence Principle)                dM XX locus    <   dM M M locus

This condition is particularly important for producing reasonable comparative statics in accordance
with Samuelson's Correspondence Principle.8 Speci...cally, consider an improvement in technology
(higher     or , or lower ). While the M M locus is una¤ected, the XX locus will shift upward.
Should the XX locus be steeper than the M M locus, better technology would cause the aggregate
demand of intermediate goods (Xe ) to fall, which is counter-intuitive. Thus, based on Samuelson's
Correspondence Principle, one may rule out this type of equilibrium. The equilibrium satisfying
Samuelson's Correspondence Principle is illustrated in Figure 3(a) by point E . In Section 5, we
verify these results with our calibration.
                                        e (M ), we can substitute it into (9) to obtain:
    De...ning the expression in (30) as X
                                                                             p
                             (M )       e (M ) + (1 + )p (M ) =
                                        X                                        2(      )w                         (32)

By examining (M ), it is seen that M has two con icting e¤ects: a positive e¤ect via the aggregate
                          e
intermediate goods input X (M ) and a negative e¤ect via the import price p (M ). Speci...cally, an
increase in the overall length of the production line raises the aggregate intermediate goods input
but lowers the import price. Since the XX locus is atter than the M M locus, the negative e¤ect
via the import price dominates the positive e¤ect via the aggregate intermediate goods input. We
summarize this result below.

Lemma 5: (The Length of the Production Line) Under Conditions S, N, and C the steady-state
overall length of the production line is uniquely determined by the XX and M M loci.


4.3.2     Determination of Production and Trade Ranges

We next turn to determining the pattern of domestic production and export. From (11) and (13),
we can obtain the following two key relationships that determine the cuto¤ values, nE and nP ,

focus on the direct e¤ects. As indicated by (30), the direct e¤ect of a more sophisticated production line (higher
M ) is to raise the productivity of manufacturing the ...nal good as well as the cost of intermediate inputs. While the
productivity e¤ect increases aggregate demand for intermediate goods, the input cost e¤ect reduces it. On balance,
it is not surprising that the positive e¤ect dominates as long as such an operation is pro...table. Nonetheless, due to
the con   icting e¤ects, the positive response of X e to M is not too large.
     8
       Samuelson (1947) highlights the purpose of Correspondence Principle as: "to probe more deeply into its analytical
character, and also to show its two-way nature: not only can the investigation of the dynamic stability of a system
yield fruitful theorems in statical analysis, but also known properties of a (comparative) statical system can be utilized
to derive information concerning the dynamic properties of a system."

The two loci are plotted in Figure 4 along with the exogenously determined locus for P M (i) given
by equation (11).
                                               ^ in Figure 4. To see this, we note that, in
   The equilibrium price locus is captured by ABCD
order for domestic intermediate producers'to be willing to export, their exporting prices must be
                                                                                      p (i)
higher than producer prices over the export range i 2 0; nE : P P (i)       P E (i)   1+ .    That is, the
equilibrium price schedule takes the upper envelope of P P (i) and P E (i) in the export range. On
the contrary, to compete with the North, domestic intermediate producers cannot charge higher
than trade-cost-augmented import prices. That is, the equilibrium price schedule takes the lower
envelope of P P (i) and P M (i) for nE ; M . Within this range, domestic intermediate producers
can produce when P P (i)       P M (i)   (1 + )p (i), whereas they are out-competed over the import
range i 2   nP ; M    .


4.3.3    Extensive versus Intensive Margins

From Figure 3(a) and Lemma 5, the XX and the M M loci de...ne a unique association between M
    e , which immediately leads to two novel e¤ects.
and X
   There is a boundary e¤ ect : in response to a shift in technology or a policy parameter, the length
of the production line M changes, as do the ranges of production and trade captured by the cuto¤s
nE and nP . These changes are thus called extensive margin e¤ ects. These extensive margin e¤ects
di¤er from those in the new trade literature where extensive margin e¤ects are the result of ...rm
entry. In our model, extensive margin e¤ects arise from changes in the length of the production line
and from the subsequent changes in the domestic production, export and import ranges.
                                                                                               e
   There is also a domestic aggregate intermediate demand e¤ ect : the corresponding change in X
in response to a shift in technology or a policy parameter will directly a¤ect intermediate goods
demand as given in (13), intermediate producers'variety supply (27), and labor demand (22) and
(23) for producing a particular variety. We call this an aggregate e¤ect because the e¤ects induced
by this channel work through the aggregate demand for intermediate goods and contains both
extensive margin and intensive margin e¤ects. In our analysis on trade protection below, this key
scale-scope trade-o¤ will play a central role.

                                   (i)                                                     1:                        (35)
                                            [1 + (     A)1= ] [p(i)           x (i)]

For i 2 [0; nE ], maximum pro...t is (i) =             0 wN (i),    where the markup becomes a constant given by
                                                         1
(see the Appendix),         0      [1 + (   A)1=   ]          1. Note that in this general quadratic setup, as the
price (p(i)        ) increases, the marginal cost ( [1 + ( A)1= ] [p(i)                         x(i)]) increases more than
proportionately, leading to lower markups. This di¤ers from the constant markup CES aggregator.
   By rearrangement, markup can be rewritten as:
                                                                1
                                      (i) =                h                      i    1
                                                                           x(i)
                                              [1 + ( A)1= ] 1             p(i)

which is positively related to individual variety demand but negatively related to variety price
for i 2 [nE ; nP ]. It is clear that the intermediate good supply schedule (xP (i) = A (i)LP (i)                      +   )
is upward sloping, as is         (i). Likewise, an increase in the technology scaling factor (A) or the
technology gradient ( (i)) reduces the marginal cost more than the price of intermediate goods
leading to higher markups.
   Under Condition N (Nonnegative Pro...t), we then have:

Lemma 6: (Producer Markup Schedule) Under Condition N, the steady-state intermediate good
markup schedule possesses the following properties:

(i) it is upward sloping in ordered varieties (i) within the nontraded range [nE ; nP ], but is a
        constant     0   over the exporting range [0; nE ];

(ii) an increase in individual intermediate variety demand or a decrease in the producer price leads
        to a higher markup function;

(iii) an increase in the technology scaling factor or the technology gradient leads to a higher markup
        function.


4.4     Trade Protection

As a preliminary step towards analyzing trade wars we begin by looking at the e¤ect of trade
protection on the pattern of production and trade, ...rm markups, aggregate and average technology
as well as overall productivity.


                                                              18
4.4.1      E¤ects on the Production Line

We begin by determining the e¤ect of trade protection on the overall length of the production line.
Consider an increase in the North tari¤ ( ). In response to foreign protection (an increase in      ),
the XX locus shifts up but the M M locus remains unchanged.9 The absence of an e¤ect of North
tari¤ on the M M locus is seen from (31). A higher North tari¤ reduces exportable prices, thus
leading to higher domestic demand for exportables. From (30), the aggregate intermediate good
demand by domestic ...rms increases, as does the XX locus. As a result, the length of production line
                             0
expands from M 0 to M and the aggregate intermediate good demand by domestic ...rms increases,
as shown in Figure 3(b). To decompose the net e¤ect into the intensive and the extensive margins,
                                                                                                    00
we ...rst ...x the production length at M 0 , under which the equilibrium point shifts from E to E .
This induces an intensive margin e¤ect on aggregate demand as shown in Figure 3(b). There is
                                                                        00      0
also an extensive margin e¤ect, which can been seen from E to E .
   Domestic protection (an increase in South tari¤ ) increases the domestic cost of imported
intermediate inputs i, (1 + )p (i) and hence decreases demand. This causes the M M locus to shift
down (see Figure 3(c)). The increase in the domestic tari¤ decreases the demand for importables at
                                                                                  e = G(M nE ;nP )
any given M (and thus nE ; nP ). As a result, the XX locus solved by ...xed point X
shifts downward. The shift of the XX locus is always small compared to the shift in the M M locus
as the aggregate channel via Xe is expected to dominate any individual change via x(i). Therefore,
in this case one expects the net e¤ect of domestic trade protection to increase the length of the
                               0
production line from M 0 to M and to increase the aggregate intermediate goods X    e , as seen in
Figure 3(c). Mathematically, the above arguments are ensured by Conditions E and R below.
Speci...cally, we can di¤erentiate (32) to obtain:

                                          dM          p (M )
                                             =
                                           d   (1 + )b       e
                                                          (dX=dM )

                                e
which is positive if (1 + )b > dX=dM . We summarize this condition:
                                                                   e
Condition E: (Dominant Extensive Margin Boundary E¤ect) (1 + )b > dX=dM .

Under Condition E, the extensive margin boundary e¤ect holds true even in general equilibrium
when prices change. In this case, domestic trade protection leads to a longer production line. This
                                    e to M is not too large, the degree of substitution between
condition is met if the response of X
di¤erent varieties of intermediate goods is not too large (low ) and the price gradient is su¢ ciently
steep (high b). Of course, whether this condition holds is a quantitative issue that we shall address
in the calibration analysis. Using Condition E we are able to obtain a number of useful results.

                                                          19
Proposition 1: (The Length of the Production Line) Under Conditions S, N, C and E the SSTE
overall length of the production line ( M ) is increasing in response to either foreign or domestic
trade protection (higher                 or      ).

    While the production line becomes longer (Proposition 1), the e¤ect on the net domestic ag-
gregate intermediate demand is generally ambiguous. To sign aggregate demand we impose an
additional su¢ cient condition (which is consistent with our calibrated economy to be outlined in
the next section):
                                                                                        slope of M M              shift of M M
                                                                                      z   }|             {       z   }|          {
                                                               p (M )
                                                                                        e
                                                                                       dX                        dXe
Condition R: (Regularity Condition)                                 e                                        >
                                                         (1+ )b (dX=dM )               dM                        d
                                                                                             M M locus               M M locus

This is called a regularity condition because it ensures that the net domestic aggregate intermediate
demand is positively related to the length of production line in equilibrium. Intuitively, Condition
R requires that the shift in the XX locus is relatively small compared to the shift in the M M locus.
Under Condition R, we can repeat the same exercise to disentangle the intensive margin e¤ect by
...xing the length of the production line at the original level M 0 , which is measured by the vertical
distance from E to E 00 (a negative intensive margin e¤ect). Subtracting this from the (positive)
net domestic aggregate intermediate demand e¤ect yields the extensive margin e¤ect.
   Finally, we decompose the net e¤ect of domestic protection. Fix the production length at M 0 (see
                                                        00
Figure 3(c)), the equilibrium point shifts from E to E , leading to a lower X  e . Domestic trade
protection results in a negative intensive margin e¤ect on the aggregate intermediate good demand
by domestic ...rms. However, there is a positive extensive margin e¤ect because ...nal producers
react to it by shifting from importing intermediate goods at nP to producing domestically (see the
               00          0
shift from E to E ).


4.4.2    E¤ects on Production and Trade Ranges

We next turn to the e¤ects of trade protection on the two cuto¤s, , nE and nP . Let us begin with the
aggregate demand for intermediate goods X  e . Recall that intermediate goods are Pareto substitutes,
so aggregate demand for intermediate goods has a negative e¤ect on the marginal product of each
variety and hence tends to reduce the price of each variety. When trade protection induces a higher
aggregate demand for intermediate goods as discussed above, this translates into a downward shift
in the P P (i) locus. Other things being equal, both cuto¤s expand. Mathematically, we have:

                dP P (i)           @P P (i) dM          dP P (i)       @P P (i)       @P P (i) dLP (i)       @P P (i) dM
                 d             =    @M d         < 0;     d        =     @        +   @LP (i) d
                                                                                                         +    @M      d    <0

for all i 2 [nE ; nP ].


                                                                       20
                                                                                            p
   Thus, an increase in the foreign tari¤          reduces domestic price of exportables   1+   and hence
causes the P E (i) locus to shift down. That is, for each variety i 2 [0; nE ], a higher foreign tari¤
makes domestic intermediate producers less competitive. The P M (i) locus is clearly una¤ected;
while rising foreign tari¤ has no direct e¤ect on the P P (i) locus, Figure 3(b) indicates a higher
domestic aggregate intermediate demand (X    e ) in response to this tari¤ increase, thereby inducing
the P P (i) locus to shift down (recall that the aggregate channel via X  e is expected to dominate
any individual change via x(i)). From Figures 5-2(a), we can see higher foreign tari¤ would lower
export cuto¤ point nE if the aggregate demand channel on P P (i) were absent (refer to a shift from
E to E 00 ); with rising aggregate demand, however, the cuto¤ point nE would increase (refer to a
shift from E 00 to E 0 ). Combining these e¤ects yields an ambiguous outcome in the export cuto¤.
From Figures 5-2(b), because the only change is via the P P (i) locus, one concludes immediately
that domestic production cuto¤ nP increases unambiguously (refer to a shift from E to E 0 ). Note
that the production line is also expanding (as shown in Proposition 1). In sum, while the domestic
production range [0; nP ] expands in response to foreign protection, the export range [0; nE ] and the
import range [nP ; M ] are generally ambiguous.
   Consider next an increase in domestic tari¤ , as depicted in Figures 5-3(a) and (b). It is easily
seen that this leads to higher prices of importables and hence causes the P M (i) locus to rotate
upward (a shift from E to E 00 ). Thus, while it does not a¤ect the export cuto¤, the import cuto¤
is higher, implying that domestic intermediate producers become more competitive as a result of
trade protection. Similar to foreign trade protection, we also have an e¤ect through domestic
aggregate demand for intermediate goods (and again keep in mind that the aggregate channel via
Xe dominates any individual change via x(i)). This in turn shifts the P P (i) locus downward, thus
inducing both the export and the domestic production cuto¤s to rise. Combining both channels,
we see that both the export and the domestic production ranges expand, though its e¤ects on the
nontraded and the import ranges remain ambiguous.
   Mathematically, the analysis is governed by (33) and (34), where the trade protection e¤ects
on the ranges of exports and domestic production are given by,
                            dnE       @nE       @nE dM     dnE       @nE       @nE dM
                            d     =   @     +   @M d ;      d    =    @    +   @M d
                            dnP       @nP dM               dnP       @nP       @nP dM
                            d     =   @M d ;                d    =    @    +   @M d

How the export and the import ranges change in response to trade protection thus depends crucially
on the relative magnitudes of the extensive/intensive margin e¤ects and the net aggregate inter-
mediate goods demand e¤ects on the length of the production line and two cuto¤s. We summarize
the results in Proposition 2.

Proposition 2: (The Range of Exports, Domestic Production and Imports) Under Conditions S,
N, C and E, the SSTE pattern of international trade features exporting over the range 0; nE and

                                                      21
importing over the range nP ; M with the range nE ; nP being nontraded. Moreover, the SSTE
possesses the following properties

(i) in response to foreign trade protection (higher      ),

        a. the export price P E (i) and the domestic producer price P P (i) decrease;

        b. the range of domestic production 0; nP       expands, but the e¤ ects on export and import
             ranges, 0; nE and nP ; M , and on nontraded range, nE ; nP , are ambiguous;

(ii) in response to domestic trade protection (higher         ),

        a. the import price P M (i) rises whereas the domestic producer price P P (i) falls;

        b. both the ranges of exports and domestic production, 0; nE and 0; nP , expand, but the
             e¤ ects on the nontraded and the import ranges, nE ; nP and nP ; M , remain ambigu-
             ous.


Remark 3: (Exogenous Length of the Production Line) When the length of the production line
M is ...xed, domestic trade protection decreases aggregate intermediate goods whereas foreign trade
protection increases it (see Figures A1(a) and A1(b) in the Appendix). Domestic trade protection
causes producer prices to increase, thus shrinking the export range (as shown in Figure A2(a)). In
contrast, foreign trade protection decreases export prices and expands the range of domestic produc-
tion (Figure A2(b)). Because the overall length is ...xed, the import range (M      nP ) must decrease.
Domestic trade protection raises the overall length and expands the export range, whereas foreign
trade protection causes both the domestic production range and the overall length to increase,
leading to an ambiguous e¤ect on the import range.


4.4.3     Markups, Productivity and Technology

We next turn to consideration of the e¤ect of trade protection on markups. In the domestic
exporting range 0; nE , an intermediate ...rm'
                                             s markup is constant over i. In the nontraded range
i 2 [nE ; nP ], we can see from (35) that markups will respond endogenously to domestic trade policy.
As shown in Proposition 2, in response to a higher foreign or domestic tari¤, the domestic producer
price P P (i) falls when the e¤ect via the extensive margin is strong. Moreover, under Condition R,
both types of trade protection tend to raise domestic aggregate intermediate demand X  e and hence
lower individual variety demand x(i). While the fall in variety price tends to raise the markups
received by domestic intermediate good ...rms, the fall in variety demand tends to reduce them.
Thus, we have:


                                                   22
Proposition 3: (Markups) Under Conditions S, N, C, E and R, both foreign and domestic trade
protection have ambiguous e¤ ect on domestic intermediate ...rms' markups in the SSTE.

   We now turn to determining how trade protection a¤ects productivity and technology. Consider
the benchmark case where Conditions S, N, C, E and R hold. De...ne the aggregate technology
                                  Z nP
                              e
used by domestic producers as A =      A (i; M ) di. Utilizing (21), we can write:
                                         0
                                               Z     nP
                                         e=A
                                         A                 (i)L(i) di                               (36)
                                                 0

One the one hand, from Proposition 2, we learn that the range of domestic production 0; nP
expands. On the other hand, we also know A(i) is lower for all i because both LE (i) and LP (i)
                                        e , as can be seen from (22) and (23). With a dominant
locus shifts down with higher tari¤ and X
                                                                     e. The e¤ect on average
extensive margin e¤ect, there is an increase in aggregate technology A
              Ae                                                                Y
technology    nP
                   , however, is ambiguous. Average productivity, measured by   e,   will increase due to
                                                                                X
the use of more advanced imported intermediate inputs as the overall length of the production line
expands. These results are summarized in the following proposition.

Proposition 4: (Productivity) Under Conditions S, N, C, E and R, both foreign and domestic
trade protection result in average productivity gains and higher aggregate technology of domestic
producers in the SSTE, but its e¤ ect on average technology is ambiguous.

   This result is interesting because it points out that average productivity and average technol-
ogy do not always move together. This is again a result due to our novel channel of the scale-
scope trade-o¤: importing higher-end intermediate goods improves aggregate technology, but this
is accompanied by reduced incentive for investing lower-end domestic technologies. In our model,
although the aggregate technology is higher as a result of a stronger extensive margin e¤ect, the
average technology may be lower theoretically.


4.4.4     Taking Stock

In sum, our model features:

(i) a pure extensive margin e¤ect operating through the boundary e¤ect, M ,

(ii) a pure intensive margin e¤ect via changes in the three price schedules, namely, P E (i), P P (i)
        and P M (i) loci,

                                                             e that a¤ects both intensive and
(iii) a net domestic aggregate intermediate demand e¤ect via X
        extensive margins.


                                                      23
These three channels pin down the net e¤ects of trade protection.
    With unilateral trade protection by the South (higher ), import prices P M (i) rise, whereas
domestic producer prices P P (i) fall. As a result of an expanded production line, both export and
domestic production ranges, 0; nE and 0; nP , increase. Under a unilateral tari¤ increase by the
North (higher    ), the export and domestic producer prices in the South, P E (i) and P P (i), drop.
Again, the expansion of the production line induces a wider range of domestic production 0; nP ,
though its e¤ect on the export range 0; nE is ambiguous. Because both the production length
the domestic production range expand, the range of imports is ambiguous. Nonetheless, either
                                                                                    e and average
type of trade protection leads to higher aggregate technology of domestic producers A
                e.
productivity Y =X
    A trade war thus lengthens the production line and the domestic production range in the South.
The e¤ect on the range of exports and imports, its e¤ect on the volumes and the values of exports
and imports remain a quantitative question, to which we now turn.


5     Quantitative Analysis

In this section we calibrate our model and perform several policy experiments.


5.1     Data

For the quantitative analysis, we use the data from Socio-Economic Accounts (SEA) and World
Input-Output Tables (WIOT) in Release 2013 (Timmer et al., 2015).


5.1.1    Grouping of Countries and Industries

Since we consider the trade between the North and the South, we divide all countries (40 countries
and one RoW) into two groups: high-income countries (the North, or N) and low-income countries
(the South, or S) according to the World Bank'
                                             s 2002 country income classi...cations. The grouping
of countries is listed in Table A1 in the Appendix. Moreover, we focus on the manufacturing
sector (M ) in which we include 14 industries as shown in Table A2 in the Appendix. All the other
industries that are not included are referred to as the non-manufacturing sector (O), which is purely
for the purpose of aggregation in the GRAS algorithm.


5.1.2    Price Deators

Data in the WIOT are expressed in current dollars and at constant prices of the previous year
(World IO Tables PYP) which are combined to derive the data series from 1995 to 2009 at 1995


                                                 24
constant prices (in 1995 USD). Such data include gross outputs, value added, and total ...nal demand
by industry and country. This yields the row totals and column totals for the inputs and outputs of
all intermediate goods transactions at 1995 constant prices. To compute each value of intermediate
goods transactions at 1995 prices requires additional work ­ speci...cally, we use the Generalized
RAS (GRAS) algorithm to ...gure out all cells to match row and column totals (see the Appendix
for details). Based on these, we can compute the aggregated WIOT by groups of countries and
industries. Tables A3 and A4 in the Appendix display the converted WIOT at 1995 constant prices
for the years of 1996 and 2006, respectively.


5.1.3     Values and Price Indexes of Intermediate Goods

By aggregating the converted WIOT at 1995 constant prices, we have obtained the real values of
intermediate goods from the North to the South, from the South to the North, and within the
South. That is, for each year, we have the South's real value of imported intermediate goods from
the North, denoted ImVt , the South'
                                   s real value of non-traded intermediate goods production,
denoted DomVt , and the South'
                             s real value of exported intermediate goods to the North, denoted
ExVt , all at 1995 constant prices. The averages of these variables over the years from 1995 to 2009
are summarized in Table 1.
   From the two sets of price series, one at current and another at constant 1995 prices, we obtain
all the price deators of gross outputs and all intermediate goods in the North and the South. We
then calculate the price indexes of intermediate goods ImVt , DomVt , and ExVt by dividing price
deator associated with each cell of intermediate goods by its corresponding gross output deator
for each year (i.e., relative prices). Lastly, we take the average of the years from 1995 to 2009 for
the purpose of calibration. Table 2 summarizes these averaged prices.

5.2      Calibration

First we pin down the parameter value that can be directly imputed from data. The unit capital
requirement       is imputed by
                                                    CAPcp
                                             =                  = 0:9663
                                                 DomVcp + ExVcp
where CAPcp is South's aggregate nominal value of the capital compensation in the manufacturing
sector; DomVcp is South'
                       s nominal value of non-traded intermediate goods production, and ExVcp
is South's nominal value of exported intermediate goods to the North.
    Given that we only have limited number of observed moments, we must assign pre-set values
to several model parameters. To begin, we choose standard values in the literature by setting the
market discount rate as 2:5% and the tari¤ rates in the North and the South as 5% and 15%,
respectively. In the benchmark, we ignore international technology spillover. To be consistent with
     s law, we set the technology obsolescence rate at 0:462.10 In the benchmark, we set the
Moore'
degree of variety substitution to be             = 0:5. That is, we consider a general quadratic form of ...nal
good production in which intermediate goods are Pareto substitutes. The value of                              is so chosen
that Condition S is met and that the markup ratio is in line with the literature.11 Sensitivity
analysis will be performed for             to rise or fall by 50%. We further assume that labor share of
intermediate goods production is 4 times as much as R&D labor share. To satisfy Condition N
under the above preset values of ( ; ), we thus set the intermediate goods production labor share as
0:4 and the R&D labor share 0:1. Moreover, we assume the North'
                                                              s technology scales and gradients
are 25% higher than the counterparts in the South. Finally, to yield nondegenerate ranges of export,
   10
       The law of motion of A(i) in continous time representation gives dA(t; i) = [IA (i)         A(t; i)] dt, where IA (i) =
[(1 & ) t (i) + & t (i)] Ht (i) . Moore'  s law then implies that under IA (i) = 0, that is, when A(t; i) = A(0; i) exp( t),
                                               1
it takes t = 18 months such that A(t; i) = 2     A(0; i).
    11
       The markup ratio in the aggregate economy is often taken as 1.5 (cf. Hsieh and Klenow 2009), whereas at the
industrial level it falls into the range from 1.15 to 2.15 (cf. Blaum, LeLarge and Peters 2018).


                                                             26
domestic production and import, we set the foreign technology gradient to be 0:05 (under which
the domestic technology gradient becomes 0:04) and set the intermediate choke price to be twice
as much as the average world price of the intermediate goods (the world price p can be measured
by (1 +    ) pE
              data according to (11)). We summarize these parameters in Table 3.

Basically, we calibrate               ; ; ; b;       by minimizing the distances between model moments and
data moments using quadratic loss function with equal weight under nonnegativity constraints.
The details and the imputed values are reported in the Appendix.
   For the data moments, since the values in WIOT are in basic prices for producers and all
international ows are expressed in free-on-board prices, we need to make adjustments to let the
data moments be consistent with their model counterparts. The details of the adjustments are
reported in Table A6 in the Appendix. The calibration results are reported in Table 4 from
which we can see that the ...t is reasonable. The minimizing distance algorithm delivers calibrated
parameter values, which are summarized in Table 5.
Three remarks are in order. First, in our benchmark calibrated economy, regularity conditions,
Conditions S, N, and C, are all satis...ed and xE (0) > 0. Second,                              > 0, so there is a production
sophistication e¤ect in which a longer production line is more productive. Third, Condition E is
met as well, implying a strong extensive margin e¤ect for the overall length of the production line
to play a dominant role.
   In this calibrated benchmark economy, the computed ranges of exports, nontraded intermedi-
ate goods and imports turn out to be: [0; nE ] = [0; 4:95], [nE ; nP ] = [4:95; 16:16] and nP ; M =
[16:16; 19:53], respectively.           Thus, all trading and production ranges are nondegenerate.                      The
corresponding quantities and values of intermediate exports and imports are ExQ = 0:2313,
ImQ = 0:5668, ExV = 0:9158, ImV = 1:9188, respectively. The aggregate intermediate goods

5.3    Policy Experiments

We conduct several policy experiments to examine the impact of trade policy on trade patterns,
output, productivity, and markup. Speci...cally, we analyze the e¤ects of trade wars by considering
the following two scenarios: (i) a trade war in which              increases to 20% and          increases to 12%;
(ii) a trade war in which       increases to 25% and          increases to 25%. The ...rst scenario represents
the situation of the current trade war between the U.S. and China, and the second one represents
an escalation of the trade war.
    In the current US-China trade war, under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the U.S.
has imposed import tari¤s of 25% on roughly $250 billion of its imports from China until now.13
China has also immediately retaliated by increasing tari¤s on $110 billion of imports from the U.S.
(tari¤s of 25%, 20%, 10%, and 5%). To calculate the trade-weighted average tari¤s, we use the
2018 US-China bilateral trade data from the COMTRADE data set of the United Nations at the
6-digit product level of the Harmonized System (HS). We ...nd that the weighted average import
tari¤ in the US is 11:57% and that in China is 19:05%. Hence, we set                        = 20% and        = 12%
as the ...rst policy experiment of trade wars. These estimates are close to the calculation in Bown
(2019) (19:6% and 12:4%, respectively, see Figure 4 in the paper).14 In addition to the ongoing
trade war, the U.S. president has also threatened to escalate the trade war by putting tari¤s on the
remaining $300 billion (tari¤s of 25%) Chinese imports that currently don'
                                                                         t have tari¤s. If these
threats become actions, China will probably increase its existing tari¤s on the U.S. merchandise to
25% in response to this escalation of the trade war. Accordingly, we set                =     = 25% to represent
this scenario of an escalated trade war.15
    The results of the experiments are reported in Table 6(a) and (b). From Propositions 1 and
2, we learn that an increase in either tari¤ under a trade war would lead to a longer production
line M and higher aggregate intermediate goods demand X    e . Moreover, either also results in an
increase in nP . Thus, in our experiments (i) and (ii), the percentage increases in the production
length [0; M ] and the domestic production range 0; nP are large, exceeding 20%. However, in
our trade war experiments, South intermediate ...rms out-compete North ...rms, thus resulting in a
larger expansion in domestic production range than the production line. This subsequently leads

  13
      It is worth noting that nearly 90% of US imports of intermediate inputs from China were subject to special
protection in the trade war during 2018-2019 (Bown, 2019). It is strikingly di¤erent from the conventional wisdom
that governments always avoid applying protection to imports of intermediate inputs, because their domestic ...rms
need access to cheaper inputs to maintain competitiveness advantages (Bown and Crowley, 2016).
   14
      Bown (2019) presents two series of average applied tari¤s: the simple average applied tari¤, which is calculated
by weighting equally the applied MFN tari¤ of each of the roughly 5,000 HS6-digit products, and the trade-weighted
average applied tari¤, where the weights are the trading partner' s product-level exports to the world.
   15
      Ossa (2014) estimates that countries would impose tari¤s of almost 60% in a fully-escalated trade war. Appling
this to the current US-China trade war, Ossa (2019) suggests that there is still substantial room for escalation.


                                                         30
to a narrower import range. (Since the increase in nP is larger than M , the net e¤ect on M                                  nP
is negative.) From Figures 5-2 and 5-3, the increases in                       and       would generate conicting e¤ects
on   nE .   Our quantitative results suggest that the foreign trade protection e¤ect is stronger than
domestic protection in North imports of intermediate goods. That is, the South export range 0; nE
shrinks. Quantitatively, both export and import ranges are narrowed by more than 10%. These
extensive margin e¤ects combined with intensive margin and extensive-intensive mixed domestic
aggregate intermediate demand e¤ects generate sizable negative e¤ects on export volume and value
and import volume and value.
     It is worth noting that, although imports decrease, a longer production line implies that marginal
imports are embedded with better technologies. As a result, in either scenario of the trade war,
                                            e P ) and average ...nal good productivity (Y =X

     Next, we see that, in the second scenario of an escalated trade war, all e¤ects are ampli...ed.
There are particularly strong negative e¤ects on exports and export range nE , and smaller decreases
in imports and the import range M                   nP . Nevertheless, there are still positive e¤ects on average

production line M . Overall, we can see that the escalated trade war leads to the expansion in
the production line and domestic production range but the shrinkage in export and import ranges.
Thus, as a result of trade war, there is import substitution in intermediate goods with more domestic
production replacing imports. We can also see that the escalated trade war may not hurt the South

much because of the expansion in the production line and that goods being imported are all with
superior technology. Therefore, should one remove the extensive margin e¤ect as in the conventional
literature, we would expect a fall in both technology and productivity in the South.
   In summary, while trade wars cause both exports and imports to fall, the production line
expands and aggregate technology rise accompanied by a modest increase in average technology
and average productivity due to a switch from scale to scope in intermediate goods usage. As a
result, value-added in the South turns out to be higher despite the detrimental trade e¤ects. Next
we decompose the trade war e¤ects on exports and imports, and then we look into the scale-scope
components through counterfactual analysis to better understand the respective roles of import-
induced technological advancement and domestic technology upgrading.


5.4      Decomposition Analysis

We look at the e¤ects of tari¤s on trade by decomposing the e¤ects into extensive and intensive
margins as well as the mixed margin.16 The results are reported in Table 7. First, begin with
exports. A trade war leads to a decrease in exports on the extensive margin due lower nE . This
is the case because the negative e¤ect of               on nE dominates the positive e¤ect of               in our bench-
mark calibration in which the variety substitution between intermediate goods                              is 0:5. We will
demonstrate later that trade wars may lead to higher                    nE    if the variety substitution is su¢ ciently
high. Second, as expected, the intensive margin e¤ect on exports is negative. The increase in

  16                                                                                                       e.
       The mixed margin e¤ects are due to changes in domestic net aggregate demand for intermediate goods, X


                                                               32
foreign tari¤ leads to decreases in the exports of each variety with decreases in the supply (y E (i))
and increases the domestic demand (xE (i)). Finally, there is also an e¤ect caused by the change
in aggregate intermediate goods demand. Accompanied by a longer production line, the aggregate
                                                               e will suppress domestic demand
intermediate goods demand becomes higher. Since an increase in X
for the exportables, it will raise the exports of each variety given that the supply is not a¤ected.
                                                                                              e here
Note that this e¤ect is a mixture of both extensive and intensive margins, as the increase in X
is induced by longer production line, while it in turn raises the exports of each variety. In other
words, the detrimental e¤ect of a trade war on exports is dampened by the mixed margin e¤ects
    e . Moreover, from Lemma 1, an increase in aggregate intermediate goods demand by domestic
via X
...rms raises price elasticities of intermediate demands for all varieties. This increased responsiveness
therefore magni...es the contribution of the mixed margin in mitigating the trade war damage on
exports by about 78% (= 296:4%=381:2%).
   Next look at the change in imports. There is no intensive margin e¤ect because the increase in
the domestic production range nP is large enough to induce a full shift of the varieties imported to
the South. In other words, the trade war results in a large extensive margin e¤ect so that the South
will import an entirely new range of varieties which embody better technology. The decomposition
analysis indicates that the decrease in exports is mainly attributed to strong intensive margin e¤ects
while modestly o¤set by the aggregate intermediate goods demand e¤ects. The decrease in imports
is solely from the extensive margin e¤ects because of the absence of the intensive margin.

5.5   Counterfactual Analysis

Recall that there two channels to improve technology in the South: investing in technology up-
grading by domestic intermediate producers and importing technology embodied in intermediate
imports from the North. We next determine which of the two channels play a more signi...cant role
in mitigating the detrimental e¤ects of a trade war. To do this, we perform two counterfactual

                                                   33
exercises: (i) Scenario 1: shut down domestic investment in technology upgrading and (ii) Scenario
2: disable changes in production length and trade ranges, which wipes out technology advancement
via intermediate imports.
   We ...rst perform counterfactual scenario 1. In this case, the intermediate production technology
A(i) is not allowed to be adjusted, while other variables are free to change. That is, A(i) stays as
in the benchmark case before a trade war:
                              8
                              < AE 0 (i) A (i)LE 0 (i)          8 i 2 [0; nE ]
                       0
                      A (i) =
                              : AP 0 (i) A (i)LP 0 (i)          8 i 2 [nE ; nP ]

where the superscript     0   denotes values before a trade war. Remaining details of the derivations
are described in the Appendix. We then conduct counterfactual scenario 2, where we ...x the range
variables   nE ; nP ; M       as in the benchmark case but allow for domestic technology upgrading.
Finally, we shut both channels, which removes all the technological factors.
   Results are in Table 8. Note that due to the presence of covariance e¤ects between the two
technological factors, the sum of the contributions from counterfactual scenarios 1 and 2 may not
equal the overall contributions. This requires rescaling to produce the relative contributions.
   First note that with no domestic investment in technology upgrading and intermediate imports
from the North, the length of production, the ranges of production and trade, and average tech-
nology are all unchanged, remaining at the before-trade war values. However, exports, imports
and their values all change. When we allow technology to change it turns out that intermediate
importing (scenario 2) has a much stronger e¤ect across the board than does domestic investment
in technology upgrading.
   Note that, in response to a trade war, domestic intermediate producers have less incentive to
invest in their own lower-end technology because of lower demand by the North and less competi-
tiveness for exporting. That is, a trade war induces a shift from domestic upgrading to technology-
embedded importing. This adds to the dominance of the extensive margin e¤ects, together consti-
tuting a key scale-scope trade-o¤ driving the main results. Because domestic upgrading is purely
from the scale aspect but intermediate importing contains the scope perspective, our decomposi-
tion analysis shows a clear dominance of the contribution of the latter channel toward explaining
changes in trade, average productivity, and value added and consumption ratios. These results
suggest that although the trade war discourages domestic technology upgrading in the South, it
leads to another form of technology upgrading from expanding the production line and climbing
upward along the value chain. Moreover, the scope e¤ects dominate the scale e¤ects in mitigating
the damage of a trade war, suggesting the important role of intermediate goods trade in technology
transfers between the North and the South.

5.6     Sensitivity Analysis

In this section, we examine the e¤ects of a trade war in the presence of international technology
spillovers or partial tari¤ pass through. We then perform a number of robustness checks by changing
the pre-set parameter values.


5.6.1     Technology Spillover

Recall that our model allows for international technology spillover captured by parameter & . In the
quantitative exercises above, we have set & = 0 as the benchmark. In Table 9 below, we report the
results assuming technology spillover at & = 0:2. Overall, the changes in the quantitative results
are essentially minor compared to our benchmark.

When a = 1, there is no pass-through e¤ect, which is our benchmark case. When a = 0, there is
complete pass-through that fully o¤sets the increase in tari¤. In the exercise below, we assume a
partial pass-through at the rate of 10%, i.e., a = 0:9. Straightforward manipulation implies that
with partial pass-through, the North intermediate producer price (which is the delivered price) is:
                                      0                                 0                                                        p (i)

   With partial tari¤ pass-through, the P E (i) schedule rotates upward. This generates a positive
e¤ect on exporting range, thereby o¤setting part of the detrimental e¤ects of a trade war on exports.
From Table 10, we see that the e¤ects on all other indicators are negligible.



                                                                            37
5.6.3     Robustness Checks

We have conducted robustness checks with respect to reasonable changes in the technology spillover
parameter (& ), technology returns-to-scale parameters ( and ), technology obsolescence rate ( ),
foreign-to-domestic technology gradient ratio ( = ), as well as the variety substitution parameter
( ). Among all,         turns out to be the only pre-set parameter that results in noticeable changes to
which we now turn to. The full set of the sensitivity analysis results is reported in the Appendix.
   In our benchmark calibration with               = 0:5, both scenarios of trade war lead to reductions in
export range (nE ) and export quantity and value (ExQ and ExV ), due primarily to the negative
e¤ects from the increased            dominating the positive e¤ects from the increased . In this subsec-
tion, we will demonstrate that the e¤ects of trade war on exports crucially depend on the variety
substitution parameter . Speci...cally, we recalibrate the model economy using various values of
to demonstrate the properties. Within the range of rise or fall by 50%, i.e.,                     2 [0:25; 0:75], our
main conclusions remain valid qualitatively, as seen in Table 11.
   To understand the results, we compute the degree of production sophistication (                             ), which
rises with . Recall from Lemma 2 that a stronger production sophistication e¤ect reduces the price
elasticities of intermediate demands. Because demand becomes less responsive, the detrimental
e¤ect of a trade war on exports is dampened. Other than this e¤ect, all the other e¤ects are
quantitatively small.

We thus report the cases with     = 0:2 and    = 0:8. Consider the case of    = 0:2, which implies
        = 2:0489. Because intermediate demands become highly responsive, the detrimental e¤ect of
a trade war leads to a corner solution, wiping out South exports entirely. On the contrary, when
    = 0:8 and        = 4:9552, we have irresponsive intermediate demands. In this case, a trade
war results in export range expansion. Despite this, both the quantity and the value of exports
decrease.


6     Concluding Remarks

We have constructed a dynamic North-South trade model to show that the e¤ects of a trade
war on the South are mitigated by importing intermediates goods embedded with more advanced
technologies and by upgrading its own technology via domestic R&D. As a result, by shifting from
scale to scope despite sizeable detrimental e¤ects on the volume and the value of trade, a trade war
actually leads to modest increases in average technology and productivity as well as value-added and
consumption ratios. This research points to the importance of considering the dynamic e¤ects of
trading intermediate goods that embody technology as well as domestic investment in intermediate
good technology when it comes to understanding and quantitatively assessing the e¤ects of trade
wars.

          (A Major Portion of the Appendix is Not Intended for Publication)


   In the appendix, we provide detailed mathematical derivations, data documentation, as well as
detailed calibration strategies and quantitative results.


                                     Mathematical Appendix

   In this Appendix, we provide detailed mathematical derivations of some expressions in the main
text.

Derivation of the ...rst-order condition with respect to the production line (9): Using Leibniz'
                                                                                               s rule,
the ...nal good producing ...rm's ...rst-order condition with respect to Mt can be derived as:

                  dYt                                   et xt (Mt ) = w + pt (Mt )xt (Mt )
                      =                    xt (Mt )     X
                  dMt               2

which can then be combined with the last expression of relative demand function to yield (9).

Derivation of the ...rst-order conditions with respect to the two labor demand (14) and (15): The
intermediate ...rm'
                  s marginal revenue can be derived as:
                           d[(pt (i)     )yt (i)]                             dpt (i)
                                                      = pt (i)       + yt (i)
                                  dyt (i)                                     dyt (i)
                                                      = pt (i)           yt (i)
                                                      = pt (i)           At (i)Lt (i)

where pt (i) can be substituted out with (11). Using this expression, we can obtain (14) and (15).

Derivation of the steady-state level of domestic technology (21): Since VAt (i) = VAt+1 (i), we can
also use (20) to rewrite (18) as:

                                           (1 + )wH (i)1
                                 VA =                            , i 2 [0; nP ]
                                                  (i)

which can then be plugged into (19) to obtain:
                                            1
                    ( + )w          A(i)              p (i)
                                                 =                  L(i) , 8 i 2 [0; nE ]
                       (i)           (i)              1+



                                                         i

Thus for          to have a positive e¤ect on Xe (as in our quantitative model), it is required that the
slope of the XX locus is su¢ ciently steep (though still atter than the M M locus) and the shift
in the XX locus is relatively small compared to the shift in the M M locus.

Price Deators

   The well-known iterative RAS-procedure can be used to derive each value of intermediate goods
transactions in 1995 prices. However, to deal with negative values frequently shown in the columns
with change in inventories, the Generalized RAS (GRAS) algorithm is used to produce the WIOTs
in pyp.17 The GRAS procedure keeps running until the sums over cells in each row are very
close to the exogenously given row totals and the same applies to cells in columns. In other
words, both rows and columns have been scaled up or down by row- and column- speci...c factors
upon completion of the procedure, and these cell-speci...c factors can be considered as cell-speci...c
deators. We therefore use Temurshoev, Miller, and Bouwmeester's (2013) GRAS program in
MATLAB to produce the WIOTs in 1995 prices. Tables A3 and A4 below display the converted
WIOTs at 1995 constant prices for the years of 1996 and 2006, respectively.

     The method is originally proposed by Junius and Oosterhaven (2003) and modi...ed by Lenzen, Wood, and
Gallego (2007).

Imputation of Exogenous Variable
   For exogenous variable w, we impute the value from data by
                                                  L_rcomp + H _rcomp
                                            w=
                                                  L_norm + H _norm
where L_rcomp is the sum of the real values of low-skilled and middle-skilled labor compensation,
and H _rcomp represents the real value of high-skilled labor compensation in the WIOD-SEA
dataset. Other details are reported in Table A5.

We have made adjustments for the purpose of normalization. For _norm and w, we set the
North'
     s average number of employees (which is 62:95 millions people) to be 1. According to this,
the South'
         s average number of employees is normalized. Then, the South'
                                                                     s real wage rate w is
calculated based on its normalized number of employees.

Value Added

     The total value added V A consists of the value added of ...nal good production V F , value added
of intermediate goods production V I , total wage income, and total capital income, which can be
computed in the following ways, respectively.

VF     = value of ...nal output
             value of intermediate goods that are domestically produced and used       value of imports
             value of coordination cost (...nal sector wage)
V I = value of intermediate goods that are domestically produced and used + value of exports
             wage cost (intermediate sector wage)        capital cost

Thus, the total value added V A can be computed as follows:

                 V A = V F + V I + total wage income + total capital income
                       = value of ...nal output + value of exports      value of imports
                       = Y + ExV        ImV

     Three remarks are in order. First, Y is both the value and the quantity, as ...nal good is the
numeraire with its price normalized. Second, this computation is by regarding capital cost as capital
income, so total value added is equal to total pro...t income (from ...nal and intermediate sector)
plus total factor income (labor and capital). Third, the capital cost y (i) is the cost incurred in
intermediate goods production, and the cost has been reected in the price p(i) ­see equation (11)
in the main text.

        Intensive margin e¤ects: through ;                                  on xE ; xM ; y E (quantity) and direct e¤ects on prices

                                     e (domestic aggregate intermediate demand) on xE ; xM ; y E
        Mixed margin e¤ects: through X

Also note that              @           > 0 and                 @         > 0. We can thus decompose the pure extensive margin
and the pure intensive margin, in addition to the mixed e¤ect via domestic aggregate intermediate
demand X e . Let superscripts 0 and 0 denote the values before and after a trade war, respectively.

(i) Exports ExV
      Note that from the policy experiment results (Table 6(a) for the current trade war), export range
                0           0                                                                                0             0            0
shrinks: nE < nE , and there is a decrease in exports of each variety: z (i)                                          y E (i)      xE (i) <
  0             0               0
y E (i)       xE (i)       z (i). The decomposition of the trade war e¤ects on value of exports is thus:
                                          Z    nE

(ii) Imports ImV
                                                                                                                                    0
      According to the policy experiment results, there is a full shift of the import range: M > M 0
          0
and nP > M 0 . Therefore, there is neither intensive margin nor mixed margin e¤ect on imports.
Thus, the trade war e¤ects on value of imports is entirely attributed to extensive margin e¤ects.

Counterfactual Analysis

   This section demonstrates the derivation details of the scenario in which the domestic technology
investment channel is shut down. The other scenario of disabling changes in production length and
trade ranges is straightforward.
   When we shut down the domestic investment in technology upgrading channel, intermediate
production technology is not allowed to be adjusted and hence stays in previous steady state level:

To solve for relevant variables, we need to rewrite the following equations. The subscript 0 denotes
the solutions in the previous steady state, and subscript noA denotes variables without domestic
technology investment. For i 2 [nE ; nP ],
