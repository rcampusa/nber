                 Do Developing Countries Lose front the MFA?

                                  ABSTRACT
     This   paper provides estimates of both national and global

welfare costs of bilateral quotas on textiles and apparel using

an applied general equilibrium model which covers bilateral

quotas on exports of textiles and apparel negotiated between

three major developed importing countries (the US, Canada and the

EEC) and 34 supplying developing countries under the provisions

of the Multifibre Arrangement applying in mid-1980s (MFA III)
     Results using 1986 data clearly show that the vast majority

of developing countries gain from MFA removal, with some gaining

proportionately more than others. This suggests that despite

foregone rent transfers, developing countries would receive gains
by eliminating the MFA. In the central variant analysis, all

developing countries gain by eliminating tariff and MFA
restrictions because, contrary to popular belief, the developing
countries (including Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan) are

relatively small compared to developed countries even in apparel
production. Rather than losing share to other developing

countries under an MFA elimination, higher income developing

countries (like other developing countries) gain market share at

the expense of reduced developed country production.

I.    Introduction

      Trade restrictions on textile and apparel1 exports by developing

countries, under the Multi—Fibre arrangement (MFA) have been a topic of debate

and dispute for many years. Developing countries frequently cite the MEA as

one of the worst of the developed world's trade restrictions against them

since it limits their market access and restricts their development. In

contrast, it is often argued in developed countries that the transfer of quota

rents to developing countries under the MFA more than offsets their loss of

market access. This is given as a reason why developing countries generally

support successive renegotiations of the MFA. There is also a heterogeneity

of interest among developing countries which builds support for the MFA

because higher income large quota receiving original MFA countries (Hong Kong,

South Korea, and Taiwan) have a protected market niche against lower income

developing countries with low quota.

      To the present authors' knowledge, however, there is no currently

available empirical work on any of these questions, and this paper is an

attempt to partially fill the gap. It provides estimates of both national and

global welfare costs of bilateral quotas on textiles and apparel using an

applied general equilibrium model which covers bilateral quotas on exports of

textiles and apparel negotiated between three major developed importing

countries (the U.S., Canada, and the EEC) and 34 supplying developing

countries under the provisions of the Multifibre Arrangement applying in

mid—l980's (MFA III).

      Results using 1986 data clearly show that the vast majority of

developing countries gain from MFA removal, with some gaining proportionately

more than others. In aggregate they gain around $11 billion. This suggests

that despite foregone rent transfers, developing countries would receive gains

by eliminating the MFA. Indeed, in the central variant analysis, all

developing countries gain by eliminating the MFA. This is because, contrary

to popular belief, the developing countries (including Hong Kong, South Korea,

and Taiwan) are relatively small compared to developed countries even in

apparel production. Thus rather than losing share to other developing

countries under an MFA elimination, higher income developing countries (like

other developing countries) gain market share at the expense of reduced

developed country production. Results also suggest annual global gains from

elimination of quotas and tariffs of around $17 billion. Gains to the U.S.

and EEC are around $3 billion each, considerably lower than existing partial

equilibrium estimates for reasons which are discussed in the text.

Sensitivity analyses suggest that a number of model features, including the

treatment of relative countcy size and assumptions made in estimating

production costs in individual developing countries are important for results,

but the main themes of results are preserved.
It.   A General Equilibrium Model of Global Trade in Textiles and Apparel

      Since 1974, imports of textiles and apparel by a number of major

developed countries, including the U.S. • Canada and the EEC, have been

regulated through a series of international agreements among major exporting

and importing countries, commonly known as the Multi—fibre Arrangements (MFAs)

(of which there have now been four).3 These have produced a series of

discriminatory bilateral quotas that now restrict exports by most lower cost

developing countries to the major developed countries.4

      Under these agreements, licenses to export are issued to exporting

countries, who then allocate them to firms within their country. These quotas

restrict trade by limiting imports, and also further distort the pattern of

trade because of their bilateral nature. Since the quotas are specified in

physical terms, they also have the effect of encouraging upgrading of quality

by exporters. Thus, protected producers in importing countries tend to

produce lower quality items since the relative price of these increase in the

protected domestic market.

      The general equilibrium model we use to analyze the effects of these

 arrangements covers three major developed country importers, the U.S., Canada,

 and the EEC, thirty—four developing country exporters,5 fourteen specific

 textile and apparel product categories, and one composite other good.6 The

 fourteen product categories reflect the constraints implied by generating a

 cross country data set covering trade under the different MFA quota categories

 used by the major importing countries (the U.S., Canada, and the EEC)7.

       In the model, all developed countries are treated as net importers of

 textiles and apparel (and exporters of the other good), while all developing

 countries are modelled as exporters of textiles and apparel (and importers of

 the other good). Trade in textiles and apparel among developing countries
                                        4




does not take place in the model; otherwise differences in supply prices

between these countries would be arbitraged away. Interdeveloped country

trade is quota (although not tariff) free. Thus, the model captures trade

diversion effects between developed countries due to their joint bilateral

quotas on exports by developing countries. Domestic prices in the various

developed countries therefore depend on the quota policies of all developed

countries.

      We also make calculations of the impacts of quotas using a version of

the model where only one developed country (the U.S.), and the 34 developing

countries are considered. In this model variant, we illustrate how the

assumptions made on country size affect results when evaluating the effects of

quotas (and rent transfers).

      The model is calibrated to a 1986 multi—country microconsistent data set

involving production, consumption, and trade in fourteen major textile and

apparel product categories and one other good (residual CDP) for each of the

thirty—seven countries captured. Data are also used on supply prices by

product by country, and estimates of key elasticity parameters.

      The data used is not free of problems. For example, while there is some

(albeit limited) quota price data for Hong Kong, there is little direct

information on supply prices for other supplying countries, and an indirect

method, related to that recently used by Hamilton (1988), has to be employed.

Also, because of incompatibilities among the various quota categories used in

the major developed country MFA participants (the U.S., Canada, and the EEC),

capturing effects of quotas on interdeveloped country trade in textiles and

apparel is difficult.
                                           5



      The model structure used is, in part, motivated by weaknesses of

existing studies of the welfare costs of these bilateral quotas for individual

developed countries, which are typically based on the partial equilibrium

assumptions that the importing country (e.g. the U.S.) is a small open

price—taking economy, and that full rent transfer to exporting countries

occurs (see Jenkins (1980), Morkre and Tarr (1980), Morkre (1984), Siberston

(1984), Greenaway (1986), Hufbauer et al. (1986) and Cline (1987)).

      Assumed country size makes a substantial difference to the analyses

since, in the extreme case where the importing country is large, no rent

transfer occurs. Also, in assuming perfectly elastic supply functions partial

equilibrium studies tend to overestimate the costs of textile restrictions to

importing countries. In addition, these studies do not take into account the

added costs to importing countries which arise from not purchasing from the

lowest cost source of supply due to the bilateralism in the quotas. They

concentrate either on single supplying country situations, or average supply

prices across countries and then conduct single supplier analysis.

Furthermore, these studies do   not   capture production substitution effects in

exporting countries between various quota restricted and     unrestricted
categories.   Finally, the welfare costs of trade restrictions used in any one

developed country depend on the severity of restrictions in other developed

countries, since interdeveloped country trade is quota (but not tariff) free,

and these effects are not captured in existing work.

      The model used here is free of these weaknesses. The relative size of

developed to deveoping countries reflects differences in GD?, and so full

rent transfer as in the small economy case, does not occur. Costs of

bilateralism reflecting imports from higher cost suppliers are captured, as

are inter—category production substitution effects, and interdeveloped country
                                        6




trade. It also provides a vehicle for estimating the effects of textile

restrictions on developing countries, something that has yet to be done in the

literature.




      a) Level of Aregation in the Model

      The fourteen textile and apparel products in the model involve seven

restricted and seven comparable unrestricted products. The fourteen—commodity

level of aggregation used is shown in Table 1.

      This approach is employed because despite the MFA, significant volumes

of trade in textiles and apparel take place in unrestricted quota categories.

If products in unrestricted categories are treated as perfect substitutes for

quota restricted products, then in a competitive model countries would

substitute costlessly into products not subject to quota. In practice, there

are differences below the level of aggregation in Table 1 in what is

restricted and what is unrestricted and, in addition, a number of bilateral

agreements include provisions for consultations that can result in

unrestricted products being brought under restraint. An assumption of

qualitative differences between comparable restricted and unrestricted

categories is the way we treat this difficulty in the model.




       b) Production

       Each of thirty—seven countries in the model, including the three

developed countries, is assumed to have a nested constant elasticity of

transformation production possibilities frontier involving the fourteen
                 8
textile products and one composite other good,

        The composite other good is assumed to be freely traded. We use this as

a numeraire, and set its price equal to unity in all countries. Hence,

assuming profit maximizing behaviour, producers in each country choose

quantities X for each of the 14 product categories to maximize

country j for the fourteen textile and apparel commodities X?.

        Since producers in all developing countries are assumed to supply to

both the domestic as well as to the quota—restricted developed country

markets, marginal production is valued at the domestic price. Because quotas

in export markets are assumed to be binding, additional production by any firm

is    for the domestic not the foreign market. Quota rents accruing from sales

to developed countries thus accrue in lump sum form                to   owners of firms, and do

not affect the maximand (4).

        This yields output supply functions

       Each country's trade in the fourteen product categories, and in the

composite other good is given by the difference between production and

consumption. Thus, for each of the fourteen product categories, imports under

product category i by developed country k from country j,                               summed

over supplying countries minus exports under product category i by k to

developed country n, E, summed over developed countries, are given by

       Exports by developed country k to developing country j of the composite

other good,                summed over developing countries, equal the difference

between production and consumption in the developed country, i.e.

and imports by developing country j from developed country k,

        summed over developed countries, equal desired imports by country

j, i.e.

In equilibrium net trades in all products sum to zero across all countries.

        Imports of the fourteen textile and apparel products by the developed

countries also have to satisfy the constraints implied by their bilateral

quotas, i.e.




(28)           <   B,        i=l,.. .7; j=4, .   . .37;   k=l,.. .3




where          are the quotas on imports of products in category i by developed

country k from developing country j. These bilateral quotas have the effect

of segmenting national markets such that different domestic prices will apply

for each of the seven restricted product categories. In applying the model,

we calibrate it to a data set in which developed country quotas are assumed to

be binding, and then examine alternative counterfactual situations in which

quotas are removed.

      In solving the model for counterfactual equilibria associated with

changes in or removal of bilateral quotas in the developed countries, a Newton

method is used (see Whalley (1985)). The size and direction of the Newton

steps are determined by- a Jacobian matrix containing the derivatives of

commodity excess demand functions and government budget and quota rent

imbalances with respect to prices, revenues, and quota premia. This method

uses successive linear approximations to the excess demand functions which are

solved each time for a zero of the functions, until a true equilibrium

solution is obtained.

III. Data, Parameterization. and Elasticities

      To determine parameter values for the demand and production functions in

this model, we use calibration procedures similar to those widely used in

other applied general equilibrium models (see Mansur and Whalley (1984)). We

employ a multi—country microconsistent equilibrium data set for 1986

(described below), augmented by elasticities of transformation and

substitution.

      A number of data sources are used in assembling the microconsistent data

set for 1986 on which model calibration is based. Data on the value of

imports, by MFA product category and country of origin, are from the U.S.

Department of Commerce (1987a, l987b, l987c), Canadian Department of External

Affairs (unpublished data, 1987), and the European Commission (1987).12 The

major problem with this data is that it is difficult to make comparisons

across countries because of the different textile and apparel categories used

in administering quotas in each country or region. Since no such cross

country data set currently exists, we have constructed as close as comparable

14—good cross—country data set as possible to produce trade data under the

different aggregated 1-IFA quota categories used in the model. This data is

presented in Table 2.

      Data on the value of production in the U.s. for textiles and apparels in

separate aggregate categories are taken from the U.S. Department of Conunerce

(l987d), while data in Canada, the EEC and the developing countries are from

the United Nations (1986).13 This data is disaggregated in order to provide

estimates of production for the fourteen product categories in the model using

the ratios of trade in the individual categories to total trade in the

corresponding broad category (textiles or apparel) by country. For each model

product in each country, the value of consumption is determined as the

residual between the value of production and imports, on one hand, and the

value of exports on the other hand.

      As noted in the introduction, data on unit costs of production of

individual textile and apparel products (supply prices) in the various

developing countries are not currently available. While the unit costs of

quota unrestricted products can be approximated by the U.S. price minus the

tariff, the problem with data arises when we try to estimate supply prices of

quota restricted products. These are central to any calculation of the impacts

of developed country textile quotas, since they affect estimates of rent

transfer per unit export.

      Quotas are only freely traded in Hong Kong, with partial trading in

Taiwan and no trading in South Korea, and so quota price data in a range of
                            14
countries cannot be used.        Also quotas are not necessarily allocated to

the most efficient producers within countries, and so even if actual costs of

current producers were known, the minimum potential unit cost for each textile

and apparel product in the various countries remains unknown. We, therefore,

use an indirect method of estimating supply prices of quota restricted items

in developing countries closely related to that used by Hamilton (1988).

      We use data on U.S. quota prices of fifteen product categories for Hong

Kong for 1984,15 based on calculations made by Hamilton (1986); 1982 quota

prices are used in model sensitivity analyses reported on later. Both of

these sets of price data are given in Table 3. U.S. quota prices of the other

MFA products16 for Hong Kong are calculated on the basis of an average of

the quota prices given in Table 3. In aggregating the MFA products in the

U.S. into the seven restricted product categories used in the model, new quota

prices are calculated by taking trade weighted averages of quota prices using

the Hamilton data that fall within the categories used in the model.

         Our method of calculating production costs of quota restricted items in

other supplying countries is to assume that for each product category, the

unit cost can be approximated by the unit cost in Hong Kong multiplied by the

ratio of the supplying country's relative wage rate in textile and apparel

compared to Hong Kong. We apply a further correction for the relative

efficiency of labor and product quality across countries by also multiplying

by each country's relative value of gross output per worker in textiles and

apparel compared to Hong Kong. This makes a large difference to estimated

supply prices.17 Value of gross output per worker is given by dividing

wages per employee by wages in value added, and then dividing by value added

in gross output. Data on wages per employee, value added in gross output and

wages in valued added, for textiles and apparel are from UNIDO (1985). The

resulting average18 supply prices of quota restricted products by country,

both adjusted and unadjusted for differences in labour productivity and

product quality, and for both 1982 and 1984, are presented in Table 4. As can

be seen the correction for labour productivity and product quality makes a

very large difference to these estimates; as large as a factor of ten in some

cases.

         The value of production of other goods in all countries is given by

subtracting the value of production of textile and apparel products from CDP

in each country. Data on GDP by country are from the World Bank (1986) and

from Europa (1987). External sector balance conditions are then used to

calculate the value of trade in other goods in each country.

         The model also requires elasticity values for transformation surfaces

and preferences in each country. For the bottom level of nesting, assumed

values of —0.50 and 5.0 are used for all pairwise nests between comparable

restricted and unrestricted commodities and in all countries. Given there are

no literature estimates to guide the choice of these values we justify our

specification as follows. An assumption of smooth substitutability in

production between comparable restricted and unrestricted conunodjtjes would

not be appropriate, since there would be no effect of the quotas. Therefore,

a low elasticity value is used for all countries, implying a limited ability

to substitute products on the supply side. In contrast, a high degree of

substitutability is assumed on the demand side of the model. This has some

claim to plausibility since from the consumers point of view the relative

difference in product characteristics is small.

      Elasticity values at the top two levels are calculated as follows. For

the developed countries, we base our selection of these values on estimates of

U.S. total demand elasticities and assumed supply elasticities of 1.5. For

the developing countries, we assume a Cobb—Douglas specification for both

transformation and preference functions, which is equivalent to setting all

these elasticities to unity.19 Because of the potentially crucial nature of

these elasticity values for model behaviour, we use a central set of

elasticity values around which sensitivity analyses are performed.

      The U.S. total demand elasticity of —0.60 is based on estimates of this

elasticity for textiles and apparel, reported in Cline (1987). Since no

comparable information on supply elasticities is available we use a value of

1.5, which is intermediate to a range of assumed values used by other

researchers (see, for instance, Jenkins and Creenaway op. cit.). We calculate

implied elasticities of transformation and substitution for the top two levels

of nesting in the developed countries20 consistent with these estimates.

These values are, however, not necessarily consistent with literature

estimates of import demand elasticities for textiles and apparel,

reflecting the well known incompatibilties between literature estimates of

demand and supply elasticities on the one hand, and import demand elasticities

on the other.

        The calibration procedures used to generate the parameter values for the

model involve first decomposing the data represented in value terms into

separate price and quantity data. This is done through a units convention

which defines physical units for all commodities as those amounts which in

equilibrium, sell in the U.S. for $1. Hence domestic prices in developing

countries for quota restricted items are less than one, and domestic prices in

Canada and the EEC are less than, greater than, or equal to one, depending

upon the direction of trade. Once elasticity values have been selected, share

parameters for the CES and CET functions in the model are given from the price

and quantity data and the assumption of agent optimization in each country.

        For instance, first order conditions from profit maximization allow the

share parameters a, b', and d3 to be calculated as

IV.   Results

      The general equilibrium model described above has been used to analyze a

variety of possible changes in quota and tariff restrictions used by

developed countries towards imports of textiles and apparel. In these

analyses major focus is on welfare effects, reported as Hicksian equivalent

variations (EVs)22 by country in billions of 1986 dollars, but trade volume

and production effects are also reported. We have also made calculations

using the simple one developed country version of the same model in which the

size of developing countries is changed. Results using this version of the

model provide a basis for comparison on the issue of rent transfer effects and

the treatment of developed countries as small open economies, as assumed in

partial equilibrium analyses. We first report calculations made using the

basic variant of our model where the three major developed countries and the

34 developing countries are considered, and evaluate the effects of abolishing

developed country bilateral quotas and/or tariffs covering the fourteen

textile product categories considered by the model. Table 5 presents the

welfare, production, and trade effects of removing both developed country

bilateral quotas and tariffs on the fourteen textile products covered by the

model. Results clearly show that all developing countries gain from the

removal of restrictions on trade in textiles and apparel, with some gaining

proportionately more than others. The effects by country reflect the price

changes in each country, as well as the rent transfer effects of the bilateral

quotas. In aggregate, developing countries gain $11.29 billion, suggesting

that gains to developing countries from improved access more than offset

losses from forgone rent transfers as the MFA is abolished. This is even the

case for relatively larger holders of quotas such as Korea, Hong Kong, and

other higher income NICS, whom it has always been argued, have a protected

market niche against lower cost competition under the MFA. In the presence of

quotas they, along with other developing countries, are non—marginal

suppliers to developed country markets. Removing quotas improves all

supplying developing country's market share in developed country markets

rather than reallocating share among them.

      The global welfare gain is $17.25 billion with gains to the U.S. of

$2.59 billion. This estimate is significantly lower than that of dine (1987)

who places the net welfare cost of textile and apparel protection in the U.S.

at around $8 billion using 1986 data. However, dine uses a partial

equilibrium approach which tends to overstate the welfare costs of protection

to the U.S., because it implies full rent transfer. Importantly, this

difference in results occurs even though our model captures the added costs of

bilateralism in these trade restrictions, while dine does not.

       In Table 6 we report results where bilateral quotas alone are removed,

leaving tariffs in place. In this case all developing countries are worse off

compared to the case in Table 5, because their market access is reduced by

developed country tariffs. Even larger gains result for the developed

 countries.   This reflects their more advantageous terms of trade as a result
 of not also eliminating their tariffs, indicating that in the non—small open
 economy case, optimal tariffs for developed countries are non—zero, and that
 1986 tariff levels are below optimal tariffs. This again emphasizes the

 difference in the analysis from the small open economy case.

       The sensitivity of these results has been tested through a series of

 experiments reported on in Tables 7, 8 and 9. Table 7 reports the impacts on

 results of various changes in elasticity values for transformation surfaces

 and preferences in each country. Table 8 provides an indication of the

 magnitudes involved as assumptions on supply prices by country are changed.

 Table 9 reports the effects on results if the composite other good is defined

 to be other manufactures instead of residual GOP23

        based on 1982 quota prices.

         ratio of theIr relative wage rate (canpared to the Hong Kong
         base) is used as en indicator of relative product price at
         international values. No account is taken for differences In

      Results in Table 7 suggest that for some of the countries results are

highly sensitive to changes in elasticities, while others are less so. The

degree of sensitivity seems to be collinear with the size of the country price

effects, and corresponding quantity effects, which are produced when tariffs

and quotas are eliminated. If supply prices for quota restricted products in

Hong Kong are calculated using 1982 rather than 1984 quota prices (Case 2 of

Table 8), supply prices in all developing countries for these products rise.

Both the welfare estimates and the size of quota rents transferred to

foreigners are reduced when this happens.

      Case 3 of Table 8 shows that if relative wage rates (compared to Hong

Kong) are used as an indicator of relative product supply prices, this has a

significant impact on our welfare measures. Prices of quota restricted

products decrease considerably in all developing countries, except Brazil,

Macau, Mexico, Romania, Turkey and Uruguay where prices increase. The effect

of decreasing supply prices is to expand the differentials between foreign

production costs and the price paid by importers. As a result, developed

countries gain even more from elimination of textile and apparel protection.

Some developing countries are worse off, while others are better off. In

aggregate they gain more, despite greater forgone rent transfers. Finally,

results in column 4 of Table 8 show that using an alternative definition of

the composite other good to cover only other manufactures rather than residual

GDP does not have large effects on results.

      To illustrate how important assumptions on country size are when

evaluating rent transfer effects, we report some calculations made using the

simple version of our model, where only the U.S. and the 34 developing

countries are considered. We consider the effects of abolishing both U.S.

bilateral quotas and tariffs.
                                       35




      Table 9 shows the overestimate of the effects obtained when the size of

developing countries is increased in the base period data to which the model

is calibrated, since greater rent transfers to exporting countries occur.

Estimates of welfare effects of both developing and developed countries differ

by almost a factor of 1.5, even though quota premia and elasticity values

underlying the calculation are the same. Both the welfare estimates and the

size of quota rents transfered to foreigners are reduced when the size of

developing countries is decreased. These results suggest that treating

developed countries as price takers as in partial equilibrium calculations

tends to overestimate the effects of quota and tariff restrictions on U.S.

welfare.

      Comparing Case 1 of this Table with the results in Table 5, where quotas

changes also occur in the EEC and Canada provides some sense of trade

diversion effects of quotas between developed countries.24 The estimate for

the cost of U.S. restrictions only considering the developing countries is

more than two times that when all developed countries remove their quotas,

since the trade diversion effects which occur between the U.S. and the other

developed countries do not enter the calculation in Table 9.



V. Concluding Remarks

      This paper analyzes the impacts of bilateral quota restrictions used by

three major developed countries against textile and clothing imports under the

Multifibre Arrangement from developing countries. A numerical general

equilibrium model of global trade in fourteen key textile and apparel

categories involving 3 developed and 34 developing countries is used.

Case 2: Developing country size is two times that of the benchmark.

Case   3:   Developing country size is three quarters that of the benchmark.


       Transformation and substitution elasticities set equal to —0.5 and
5.0 in the bottczn level of nesting for all countries in the model.  In the top
two levels, elasticity values of —0.5 and 1.60 for transformation surfaces and
preferences in the U.S. reflect literature estimates of U.S. total demand
elasticities and an assumed supply elasticity of 1.5. Cobb—Douglas
specifications are used at the top two levels in all developing countries.

In the model, countries are represented by their actual size in terms of GDP,

weakening rent transfer effects compared to partial equilibrium analysis.

      We evaluate both the national and global welfare costs of the bilateral

quotas captured by the model. Using data for 1986, results suggest global

gains from elimination of quotas and tariffs of over $17 billion. The largest

part of these accrue to the developing countries who, in aggregate, gain

around $11 billion. This suggests that despite foregone rent transfers,

developing countries would receive gains from eliminating textile and apparel

protection through improved access to developed country markets.

      Results also show all developing countries gaining in the central

variant of the model from an elimination of the MFA, contrary to popular

belief which suggests that higher income large quota recipient countries (such

as Hong Kong, South Korea and Taiwan) would lose.        In the model, since all of

the developing country suppliers are quota constrained and relatively small

compared to large developed countries, they increase their market share at the

expense   of   developed country producers rather than   lose share to other
developing     countries.

      Estimates of the gains to the U.S. from the model for the removal of

quotas are significantly lower than those of other partial equilibrium

studies, such as dine (1987), who places the net welfare cost of textile and

apparel protection in the U.S. at around *8 billion, rather than the *3

billion reported here. This divergence in results occurs even though our

model captures the added costs of bilateralism. The difference stems from the

partial equilibrium assumptions of price taking behaviour for large developed

countries, which will tend to cause the costs of textile and apparel

protection to be overstated. As might be expected, results show sensitivity

with respect to elasticity parameters and assumptions as to how supply prices

vary across countries, but    the main themes of results remain.

                                         Notes

1.    In the paper we will use the the combination of terms "textiles",

      "textiles and apparel' and "textile products" interchangeably to refer

      to clothing, fabrics, and yarns.

2.    There are, however, other effects of these restrictions not adequately

      captured by our approach. The most important is substitution into

      higher quality due to quotas (see Falvey (1979)). Quantifying quality

      effects due to textile quotas is extremely difficult, and to our

      knowledge has yet to be attempted.

3.    The predecessor for the MFA was the 1961 Short—Term Arrangement

      Regarding International Trade in Cotton Textiles. This was followed in

      1962 by a comparable Long—Term Arrangement, which expired in 1973.

4.    Most developed countries continue to impose tariffs on textile imports.

      Over the years GATT negotiations have slightly reduced these tariffs,

      but not to the same degree as for other manufactured products.

5.    These are: Bangladesh, Brazil, Bulgaria, China, Columbia,

      Czechoslovakia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Egypt, Guatemala, Haiti,

      Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Macau,

      Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, Panama, Peru,   Philippines,   Poland,

      Romania, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Uruguay, and

      Yugoslavia.

 6.   We define the composite other good to be residual GDP in the basic

      variant our model; 'other manufactures' are used in our sensitivity

      analysis reported on later.

7.     We were unable to include all the MFA quota categories in each country

       since they include products which belong to more than one of the

       fourteen specific product categories we identify in our model. The

       categories not included are: handkerchiefs (categories 330 and 630).

       gloves (331, 431 and 631) and other apparel (359, 459, 659) in the U.S.;

       work gloves (31) and swimwear (44) in Canada; and handkerchiefs (19),

       knitted gloves (10), swirnwear (72), shawls and scarves (84), woven ties

       (85), and other clothing accesories (88) in the EEC.

 8.    The index i runs from 1,. ..7 for the restricted products and for the

       unrestricted products from 8,.. .14.

 9.    The index j   runs from 1,. ..3 for developed countries and for developing

       countries from 4,.. .37.

10.    In numerically solving the model, we also introduce non—distorting

       production taxes in the developed countries on all products. Without

       these taxes, government revenue arise only from tariffs and tend to be

       highly sensitive to changes in prices since they depend on the value of

       net trades. These taxes are non—distorting, do not alter relative

       prices of outputs, and have no effect on the equilibrium solution

       produced by the model.

 11.    In our model revenue and quota rents are separately identified, since

        for developed countries revenues are positive and quota rents are zero,

        and for developing countries the opposite is true.
                                        40




12.   In using this data we assume that all bilateral quotas were fully

      binding in the year in question. Whether textile quotas are or are not

      binding has been a source of controversy for some time. For some

      exporting countries not all the allocated (category—specific) quotas are

      fully utilized in any given year (see GATT (1984) and USITC (1987)).

      Thus it appears, at first sight, that the cost to the U.S. of imposing

      these restraints may be overestimated by the model. However, there are

      many reasons why data for export countries can seem to indicate

      non—binding quotas and yet in fact be binding. Quotas assigned to firms

      within an exporting country may not be fully utilized due to capacity

      constraints within firms and the unwillingness of firms to reassign or

      reallocate quota (or sell if there are legal markets) for fear of losing

      their quota allocation in future years. Other reasons can lie in the

      way quota is allocated among importers. Textile quotas in the EEC, for

      instance, are often allocated between importing countries on the basis

      of historical market shares with no trading of quota across countries,

      so that quotas for, say, oats can be binding in Northern Europe but not

      in Southern   Europe. Also sub—aggregate quotas, say for types of shirts,

      may be greater than an aggregate quota for shirts and hence not appear

      to be binding at subaggregate level while be binding at aggregate

      level.

13.   We were unable to obtain production data for some of the developing

      countries. In these cases trade data, along with estimates of mill

      consumption to export ratios obtained from FAO (1985) were used to

      calculate the value of production of each of the fourteen product

      categories in each country.
                                           41



14.   The quota price data that exists is also heavily contaminated by the

      complexities of quota allocation schemes within countries. Thus a firm

      which openly and repeatodly sells quota, risks losing some or all of its
      quota allocation in future years. There is even the possibility of

      firms   producing   where their cost of productiun is above the import price

      in the consuming market to keep quota in future years. Quota price data

      also reveals wide fluctuations on a month by month basis (see Morke

      (1984) and Hamilton (1986)) in part because of the fashion component of

      textiles trade and the need to maintain flexibility to enter various

      product markets quickly to exploit emerging trends.

15.   Tariffs on U.S. imports of textiles and apparel also enter this

      calculation, and these are obtained from CATT (1984).

16.   The bilateral agreements in the U.S. invole comprehensive product

      coverage, which divides all the MFA products into 109 categories.

17.   Hamilton (1988) analyzes these differences between Hong Kong. Taiwan,

      and South Korea and concludes they are small and can be ignored. Here.

      with 35 supplying countries, these factors become considerably more

      important.

      Arithmetic average of all supply prices within the category.

      The reason for making this assumption is because there are currently no

      estimates of import or export demand elasticities for the developing

      countries from which implied transformation and substitution

      elasticities can be calculated.

20.   We assume consuon values between nests.
                                        42



21.   Hufbauer et al. (1986) believe a conservative estimate of import

      elasticity   of demand for imported textiles and apparel in the U.S. to be

      about —1.8. We estimate import elasticity of demand in the U.S. at —8.9.

22.   Welfare estimates under Hicksian equivalent and compensating measures

      are very close, and so only EVs are reported.

23.   In making this calculation, data on total manufacturing output by

      country are taken from the same sources as production data. However,

      data was unavailable for some of the developing countries. In these

      cases production data, along with estimates of the share of textiles and

      clothing in manufacturing production from GATT (1984) were used to

      calculate the value of total manufacturing production in each country.

24.   There is some bias in making this comparison since in Case 1 of Table 5

      all developed country bilateral quotas and tariffs are eliminated,

      whereas in Case 1 of Table 9 only bilateral quotas and tariffs in the

      U.S. are removed. Thus, not only are we capturing the trade diversion

      effects but also the effects of abolishing textile and apparel

      protection in Canada and the EEC, as well as in the U.S. Therefore, the

      comparison   should be interpreted with caution.
