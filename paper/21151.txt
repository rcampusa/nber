                                             ABSTRACT

This paper proposes a structural approach to measuring the effects of electoral accountability. We
estimate a political agency model with imperfect information in order to identify and quantify discipline
and selection effects, using data on U.S. governors for 1982-2012. We find that the possibility of
reelection provides a significant incentive for incumbents to exert effort. We also find a selection
effect, although it is weaker in terms of its effect on average governor performance. According to
our model, the widely-used two-term regime improves voter welfare by 4.2% compared to a one-
term regime, and find that a three-term regime may improve voter welfare even further.

1       Introduction
A key aspect of a well-functioning democracy is the accountability of o¢cials via elections.
Elections may improve outcomes by giving incumbents incentives to exert e¤ort, thus disci-
plining poor performance (Barro [1973], Ferejohn [1986]). They may serve a selection func-
tion by screening out low performers (Banks and Sundaram [1993], Fearon [1999], Smart
and Sturm [2013], Duggan and Martinelli [2015]), but may also lead incumbents to pander
to voters with policies that improve their chances of reelection even if they are not socially
bene cial.1
    One may thus ask what are the e¤ects of barring reelection at some point by introducing
limits on the number of terms that a politician may serve. Though term limits may reduce
electoral pandering and prevent politicians from becoming too entrenched in o¢ce and thus
unresponsive to voter concerns, they may also reduce the incentives for incumbents to exert
e¤ort. They may imply a loss of the bene ts of the experience gained by veteran lawmakers.
Term limits may also reduce the information that voters have about candidates, negatively
impacting the screening function of elections.2 Separating and quantifying these various
e¤ects provides a signi cant challenge to assessing both the positive and the normative
e¤ects of imposing or changing term limits. Examining the e¤ect of term limits further
addresses the larger issue of electoral accountability in the political agency model. The
wide application of this model in political economy suggests the importance of assessing its
empirical relevance.
    Many papers have used a reduced-form approach to try to estimate the e¤ects of term
limits. We discuss these papers in greater detail in Section 2. By its very nature, reduced-
form estimation faces the di¢culty of disentangling the importance of various factors  such
as discipline versus selection  on the net e¤ect of term limits. Nor can such an approach be
used to consider counterfactual experiments central to assessing the welfare impact of term
limits.
    This paper proposes a structural approach to measuring the e¤ects of term limits and
thus electoral accountability. We set out a political agency model with adverse selection and
moral hazard. In the model politicians are of two types: good, who are always willing to
exert high e¤ort; and bad, who would exert low e¤ort in the absence of incentives, such
as the possibility of another term in the o¢ce. Neither the e¤ort level chosen by politicians
    1
      There is a large empirical literature on the e¤ect of elections on outcomes, termed political economic
cycles. Brender and Drazen (2005, 2008) summarize key ndings for political budget cycles. Welfare impli-
cations of opportunistic policymaker behavior are studied by Maskin and Tirole (2004), among others.
    2
      These e¤ects may also characterize indirectly-elected policymakers, as in Vlaicu and Whalley (2014).

                                                     1
nor their type are observable to voters. Instead, they observe incumbent performance, an
outcome that partially depends on the e¤ort. Voters use observed performance to decide
whether or not to reelect the politician. We design our model to mimic those U.S. states
where governors have a two-term limit in o¢ce, currently the most prevalent regime. As such,
in their second term politicians choose their e¤ort level, understanding that the reelection
incentive is no longer relevant.
    Estimation of the structural parameters of the model allows us to quantify discipline
and selection e¤ects and to assess their importance without relying on strong identi cation
assumptions. We consider a baseline of no electoral accountability, that is, where there is no
possibility of reelection. On the basis of this, we can measure how much electoral account-
ability improves outcomes, as well as whether improvements come mainly through discipline
or through selection. The structural model also allows us to run experiments to assess the
welfare e¤ects of changing term limits, where the invariance of structural parameters to the
term-limit regime is critical in avoiding the Lucas (1976) critique.3
    Our main ndings are as follows. We nd that 52% of governors are good and exert
high e¤ort independent of which term they are in. The possibility of reelection provides a
signi cant incentive for some bad governors to exert high e¤ort in order to increase their
chances of reelection. Compared to the case with a one-term limit, allowing a second term
leads 27% of bad governors choose to exert high e¤ort in their rst term of o¢ce, implying
a 13 percentage point increase in the fraction of all governors who exert high e¤ort in their
 rst term. Discipline is not stronger because of a stochastic relation between e¤ort and
performance, as well as an exogenous random component to election outcomes, that is,
success or failure in reelection uncorrelated with performance. The two-term-limit regime
leads to an increase in voter lifetime welfare of about 4:2% relative to the case of a one-
term limit. More than half of this gain in welfare comes from the disciplining e¤ect of
bad governors. The remainder comes from the selection e¤ect, that is, more good governors
surviving to the second term because better rst-term performance stochastically signals high
e¤ort and hence a higher probability that the governor is of the good type. The selection
e¤ect is reduced by a mimicking e¤ect in that high rst-term e¤ort by bad governors makes
it harder for voters to identify them as such. In the absence of mimicking, discipline and
selection e¤ects would be roughly the same size, but mimicking reduces the latter by about

     Parameters are estimated using data from governors limited to two terms. Holding these parameters
constant, we consider alternative regimes (such as a one-term or a three-term limit) where both the politicians
and voters in the economy optimally respond to the changed incentives implied by the di¤erent electoral
regimes.

                                                      2
40%:
    We then consider a version of the model where e¤ort is at least partially observable.
This leads to increased discipline, but this e¤ect is imperfect due to the stochastic nature
of election outcomes: since bad governors know that they can still get reelected due to a
favorable election shock, they do not have a large incentive to exert high e¤ort. Even if e¤ort
were fully observable, only 43% of bad governors are disciplined, leading to a modest 1:6%
increase in welfare relative to the case of unobservable e¤ort.
    Finally, we consider an electoral reform where we increase term limits from two to three
terms. This reform leads to a large increase in discipline (61% of bad governors exert high
e¤ort in their rst term and 26% of them do so in their second term), leading to an increase
in the welfare of voters of 2:8% relative to the two-term benchmark.
    The plan of the paper is as follows. In the next section we briey review the literature
on empirical estimation of the e¤ects of electoral accountability. In section 3 we present our
political agency model with a two-term limit. Section 4 describes our solution and estimation
methods and data. We then present and discuss our estimates and their implications in
Section 5. The nal section presents conclusions. An appendix presents technical details.


2        Literature
As indicated above, there have been a number of papers using reduced-form estimation to
test the e¤ects of term limits on politician performance. For example, Besley and Case
(1995, 2003), Besley (2006), and Alt, Bueno de Mesquita and Rose (2007) consider scal
policy outcomes under U.S. governors (the last paper also looks at economic growth), List
and Sturm (2006) look at environmental policy in U.S. states, and Ferraz and Finan (2011)
consider scal corruption of Brazilian mayors. The methodology is generally to compare
the performance of reelection-eligible governors and lame-duck governors, that is, governors
who are in their last legal term in o¢ce. These papers nd clear and statistically signi cant
di¤erences in performance, but this comparison cannot in itself reveal the relative strengths
of discipline and selection e¤ects in generating these outcomes. Disciplining governors eligible
for reelection to perform better makes it harder to distinguish good and bad governors on the
basis of outcomes, thus weakening the selection e¤ect. Hence, the comparison of performance
of reelection-eligible governors and lame-duck governors can only reveal a net e¤ect.4
    Some of the above research makes further assumptions to try to disentangle the e¤ects.

    4
        Ashworth (2012) makes a similar point in his excellent survey of research on electoral accountability.

                                                        3
For example, Besley (2006) argues that U.S. lame-duck governors are more in tune with voter
preferences, as measured by interest group ideological rankings, suggesting that performance
di¤erences reect a strong selection e¤ect. List and Sturm (2006) argue that discipline e¤ects
will dominate selection e¤ects if the fraction of voters who vote primarily on environmental
issues is su¢ciently small (see footnote 8 of their paper). Ferraz and Finan (2011) argue
that by comparing performance of second-term mayors with that of rst-term mayors who
were subsequently reelected, one can control for unobserved heterogeneity. Based on this,
they argue that changes in levels of corruption largely reect discipline rather than selection.
Finally, Alt, Bueno de Mesquita and Rose (2007) argue that discipline can be measured by
relative performance of incumbent governors in the same term, comparing the performance
of those who are eligible to run again with those who are not (since all have survived the
same number of elections), while selection over characteristics is reected in the relative
performance of term-limited incumbents in di¤erent terms (since each has been elected a
di¤erent number of times but cannot be reelected again).5
    As suggestive as these arguments are, they often rely on special assumptions to tease out
e¤ects. Moreover, they do not fully allow separation of the discipline and selection e¤ects.
For example, Alt, Bueno de Mesquita and Rose (2007) cannot reject the hypothesis that the
discipline and selection e¤ects are almost equal in magnitude. Structural estimation allows
us to do that and, moreover, does not rely on comparison of outcomes across regimes (for
example number of terms to which reelection is possible), where arguably other things have
changed.
    To our knowledge, the only structural approach to the e¤ects of reelection has been that
of Sieg and Yoon (2014).6 They ask whether the mechanism of reelection gives an incentive
for incumbents to moderate their scal policies  Democratic incumbents to act more scally
conservative, Republican incumbents to act more scally liberal. They nd this is the case
for about 1/5 of Democratic incumbents and 1/3 of Republican incumbents. Our paper
di¤ers in some important respects. A key one is a di¤erent focus, where our paper looks
at the incentive e¤ects of reelection on governor e¤ort and overall performance rather than
on the stance of scal policies as in their paper. As such, the papers are complementary.
Second, neither the moral hazard problem of low e¤ort, central to our analysis, nor selection

   5
      Gagliarducci and Nannicini (2013) estimate how increasing politicians wages a¤ects the composition
of the candidate pool and the reelection incentives of those elected. Using a regression discontinuity design
and Italian mayoral elections data they nd that higher wages increase performance and does so dispropor-
tionately through attracting more competent types.
    6
      Structural estimation is relatively rare in political economy. Some examples are Merlo (1997), Diermeier,
Eraslan, and Merlo (2003), and Strömberg (2008).

                                                      4
over non-partisan characteristics, such as competence, play a role in Sieg and Yoon (2014),
where competence is assumed to be fully observed. Hence, given the aim of their paper,
there is no attempt to measure the contribution of selection versus discipline on improving
outcomes, a focus of much of the earlier literature and of our paper.


3       Model
As our benchmark model, we start with a simple political agency model with voters and
politicians that can generate stochastic policy outcomes and reelection rules. Subsequent
versions of the model relax some of this models assumptions. All voters are assumed to
have the same information set and preferences, allowing modeling of a single representative
voter. A governor may serve a maximum of two terms. After a governors rst term, voters
may choose to replace her with a randomly drawn challenger. If a governor has served two
terms, the election is between two randomly drawn challengers. The equilibrium concept we
use is Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium, which will be de ned formally below.


3.1     Governor Types
All governors enjoy rents of r > 0 in each term they are in o¢ce. A governor is one of two
types, either good ( = G) or bad ( = B) ; where the probability that a governor is
good is   P f = Gg ; where 0    1: Governors choose the level of their e¤ort. The
cost of exerting low e¤ort (e = L) is normalized to be zero. The di¤erence between good
and bad governors is in the cost they assign to exerting high e¤ort (e = H). In any term of
o¢ce good governors have no cost of exerting high e¤ort, while bad governors have a positive
utility cost c; which is expressed as a fraction of the rents r of o¢ce.7 For ease of exposition,
we de ne c (e; ) r the cost of e¤ort level e for a governor of type ; where

                        c (H; G) = c (L; G) = c (L; B) = 0 and c (H; B) = c                               (1)

We assume that, like the governors type ; the cost c is observed by the governor but
unobserved by the electorate. A bad governor draws c from a uniform distribution on the


    7
     Note that the two types and their levels of e¤ort should not be interpreted too literally. A bad governor
can be one who is rent-seeking or otherwise not congruent with the voters; for example, leaders may di¤er
in their inherent degree of other-regarding preferences towards voters, as discussed in Drazen and Ozbay
(2015). Alternatively, a bad governor can be one who is low competence (and thus nds it very costly to exert
su¢cient e¤ort to produce good outcomes), or otherwise a poor t for the executive duties of a governor.

                                                      5
unit interval [0; 1] when rst elected, where c remains the same in all terms while in o¢ce.8
The governor understands that her chance of winning reelection is H if she exerts high e¤ort
and L if she exerts low e¤ort, where in equilibrium L < H . Di¤erent levels of e¤ort lead
to di¤erent distributions of observed possible outcomes (as speci ed in equations (5) below).
Hence, these probabilities are a combination of the performance of the governor given her
e¤ort and the probability of reelection given her performance, and they will be determined
in equilibrium.


3.2      Governors E¤ort Choice
The problem of a governor of type  is

                    max [1     c (e1 ; )] r + [1H H + (1     1H ) L ] [1   c (e2 ; )] r                 (2)
                    e1 ;e2


where ei is e¤ort in term i and 1H is an index which equals 1 if e1 = H and 0 otherwise.
    The actions of a good governor are trivial  she exerts high e¤ort in the rst term (e1 = H)
since it is costless and strictly increases her chances of reelection. Since e¤ort is costless and
she is indi¤erent over e¤ort levels in the second term, we simply assume that e2 = H as
well.9
    For a bad governor it is clear that the optimal choice for the second term is e2 = L since
exerting high e¤ort in the second term is costly and has no bene t.10 To derive e1 ; note
that if a bad governor exerts high e¤ort in her rst term, her payo¤ is (1                     c + H ) r, and if
she exerts low e¤ort, her payo¤ is (1 + L ) r: In words, by exerting high e¤ort the governor
would forego some of the rst-term rent but would increase her chances of reelection, thus
enjoying the rent for an extra term. She would therefore nd it optimal to exert high e¤ort
if and only if
                                              c < H      L                                                (3)

The voter does not observe c; but understands the maximization problem that governors face.

   8
      We also considered more general speci cations, including a Beta (a; b) distribution, where the uniform
distribution we use is a special case with a = b = 1: However, a and b were not separately identi ed in our
estimation.
    9
      If we assumed that good types like exerting high e¤ort, i.e. c (H; G) < 0, she would strictly prefer
e2 = H: This would also follow if, consistent with what we argue below about the relation between e¤ort
and expected performance, the good type preferred higher performance.
   10
      In reality, good last-term performance may of course improve opportunities after the governor leaves
o¢ce. The basic point however is that for bad governors the impossibility of another term reduces a key
incentive to perform well, so that they will put in less e¤ort than good governors and perform less well, a
phenomenon that we observe in the data.

                                                     6
He therefore can calculate the probability  that a bad governor exerts high e¤ort in her rst
term, that is,   P fe1 = Hj = Bg : Given the assumption of a uniform distribution for c;
we may then write
                                  = P (c < H       L ) = H   L                                (4)


3.3     Voters Problem
The voter lives forever and prefers higher to lower y; where y is the performance of the
governor in o¢ce. For simplicity, we assume the voters utility is linear in y: We assume that
this performance variable is in part inuenced by the e¤ort choice of the governor according
to the rule
                                                              
                                  yi j (ei = H)  N YH ;  2y                                     (5a)
                                                              
                                  yi j (ei = L)  N YL ;  2y                                     (5b)

for term i = 1; 2; where YH > YL : Since the variance of the two distributions is the same,
if the governor exerts high e¤ort, the outcome will be drawn from a distribution that rst-
order stochastically dominates the one with low e¤ort. Note that we also assume that the
relationship between e¤ort and performance is independent of the governors type or the
term she is in.
   We further assume probabilistic voting in that the utility of the voter is a¤ected by a
shock "  N (;  2" ) occurring right before the election (that is, after e1 is chosen). This
electoral shock may reect last-minute news about either the incumbent or the challenger,
an exogenous preference for one of the candidates, or anything that a¤ects election outcomes
that is unrelated to the performance of the governor. Hence, the existence of the election
shock makes elections uncertain events given the performance of incumbents. Furthermore
 > 0 will capture an incumbency advantage, as will be clear below.
   De ne W (y1 ; ") as the voters life-time expected utility after observing the rst-term
performance of a governor and the election shock. It can be expressed recursively as

        W (y1 ; ") = y1 +    max E fR [y2 + " + W (y10 ; "0 )] + (1   R) W (y10 ; "0 ) jy1 ; "g    (6)
                            R2f0;1g


where    is the voters discount rate between electoral terms, and R is the decision to re-elect.
After observing the performance of the incumbent governor, the voter makes his reelection
choice. If he reelects the governor, he will enjoy her second term performance, which will be
followed by the election of a new governor drawn from the pool of candidates. The successor

                                                 7
governor will deliver a rst-term performance y10 and face a reelection shock of "0 : If the voter
does not reelect the incumbent, then a fresh draw from the pool of candidates occurs.
   The election shock " shows up as an additive term to the utility of the voter, where a
positive " makes the incumbent more appealing relative to the challenger. Note that " does
not a¤ect the type or actions of the challenger that the incumbent faces. It is also important
to note that the voter realizes that he may arrive at this node with (y1 ; ") in one of three
ways: a good governor, a bad governor who exerted high e¤ort, and a bad governor who
exerted low e¤ort. The voter, of course, does not know which of these is the case, but has
beliefs about them.
   We can rewrite the voters problem as

               W (y1 ; ") = y1 +     max fR [E (y2 jy1 ) + " + V] + (1                R) Vg            (7)
                                    R2f0;1g


where we use V to denote E [W (y10 ; "0 )] which is a constant since none of the stochastic
variables are persistent. It can be written as

3.4    Election
If types were observable, the voter would reelect only good governors since they would exert
high e¤ort in their second term while bad governors would not. Since neither type nor e¤ort
is observable, and due to the existence of the election shock, the reelection decision is not
linked deterministically to y1 . Solving the discrete choice problem in (10), the incumbent
would win reelection, i.e. R = 1; if and only if

                                              (1     ) V YL       "

which shows that the incumbent will win reelection if the rst-term outcome y1 is su¢ciently
good (so that the voter has a high posterior probability of the incumbent being good) or if
the election shock " is not too small or too negative (so that the incumbent does not have
too small an incumbency advantage). We can summarize the decision rule R (y1 ; ") with the
following                                      (

3.5    Equilibrium
Good governors always exert e¤ort. A strategy for a bad governor is a choice of whether
or not to exert e¤ort, i.e. ei (B; c) 2 fH; Lg, in each period that she is in o¢ce, i = 1; 2;
conditional on her (privately observed) cost of e¤ort realization c. A strategy for the voter
is a choice of whether or not to reelect the incumbent, i.e. R (y1 ; ") 2 f0; 1g, given the
observed incumbents rst-term performance y1 , and an electoral shock realization ": The
voter updates his beliefs about the incumbents type according to 
                                                                  ^ (y1 ) :
   A perfect Bayesian equilibrium is a sequence of governor and voter strategies, and voter
beliefs, such that in every period: the governor maximizes her future expected payo¤, given
the voters strategy, the voter maximizes his future expected payo¤ given the governors strat-
egy, and the voters beliefs are consistent with governors strategy on the equilibrium path.
As the environment is stationary, equilibrium outcomes will be a collection of equilibrium
objects (H ; L ; ; V), where  is the probability that a bad governor exerts rst-term e¤ort
(equivalently, the fraction of disciplined reelection-eligible bad governors), V is the voters
life-time discounted utility, and H ; L are reelection probabilities following, respectively,
high and low rst-term governor e¤ort. Formally, we have the following de nition.

De nition The outcome of a Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium of the game between a governor
and the voter is a collection of scalars (L ; H ; ; V) where

   1. Given ; the voters choices lead to L ; H and V:

   2. Given L ; H and V, a bad governors choice of e1 leads to :

   To summarize, Figure 1 shows a game tree of the interaction between a governor and the
voter. The sequence of actions and the information structure are as follows:



                                                10
  1. In her rst term, a good governor ( = G) chooses e1 = H: A bad governor ( = B)
      privately observes her cost c and she chooses e¤ort e1 : As a result of this choice, rst-
      term performance y1 is realized.

  2. The voter observes the incumbents performance y1 (which determines his current
      period utility) but not her e¤ort e1 or type . He updates the probability that the
      incumbent is type G using 
                                ^ (y1 ) :

  3. An election shock " is realized.

  4. An election is held between the incumbent and a randomly-drawn challenger. Based
      on his beliefs about the type of the incumbent 
                                                     ^ (y1 ), the election shock ", and her
      performance y1 ; the voter decides whether to retain the incumbent or replace her with
      the challenger. If the incumbent is not reelected, then the game restarts.

  5. If the incumbent is reelected, a bad incumbent chooses e2 = L and a good incumbent
      chooses e2 = H: Based on e2 ; a performance y2 is drawn by nature giving the utility
      of the voter in that term.

  6. At the end of the term, a new election is held between two randomly-drawn candidates
      and the game restarts.


3.6     Model with E¤ort Signal
In this version of the model we allow the voter to observe a noisy signal about the e¤ort level
of the governor. We denote this signal by z and assume that it is symmetric and correct
with probability ; that is

                              P fz = Hje = Hg = P fz = Lje = Lg                         (18)

where   1
        2
               1: The parameter  thus measures the informativeness of the signal. If  =   1
                                                                                               2
then the signal has no content, and the model is identical to the benchmark model. If  = 1
then the signal fully reveals the incumbents e¤ort level, and performance is no longer an
informative signal.
   The signal will only be relevant in the rst term because once an incumbent is reelected,
the voter has no more actions that may be informed by the signal. Thus, the only point
where the signal is useful is when the voter updates his prior  that the incumbent is good.

Further details are presented in the Appendix.


3.7    Model with a Three-Term Limit
In this version we allow for a governor to remain in o¢ce for a maximum of three terms.
The model is a straightforward extension of the two-term benchmark, but outcomes in the
 rst term now have an e¤ect on both the voters and the governors decisions in the second
term. The voter now uses not only y2 but also y1 to decide whether to reelect a second-term
incumbent to a third term. This, in turn, makes a bad governors e¤ort choice in the second
term contingent not only on the cost of exerting e¤ort which she drew when she came to
o¢ce, but also on y1 . That is, suppose a bad governor exerted high e¤ort in her rst term
but drew a performance outcome y1 that was low, nonetheless being reelected to a second
term due to an election shock. She may decide not to exert (costly) high e¤ort in her second
term since the low y1 makes it more di¢cult to convince the voter to reelect her to a third
term. We present the full model in the Appendix.

4     Solution, Estimation, and Data
In this section we discuss our strategy for solving and estimating the benchmark model. We
also present our data. The details for the two extensions  the version with an e¤ort signal
and the version with a three-term limit  are presented in the Appendix.


4.1    Solution
The model has seven structural parameters: ; ; YH ; YL ;  y ; ; and  " : As the de nition of
perfect Bayesian equilibrium shows, given the structural parameters, nding the equilibrium
amounts to     nding values for H ; L ;  and V. In the process of doing so, we need to
evaluate ve equilibrium mappings, 
                                  ^ (y1 ) ; ^" (y1 ) ; R (y1 ; ") ; W (y1 ; ") and   (y1 ) : We solve
the equilibrium as follows.
    The rst thing to notice is that once V and  are known, H and L follow from (16) and
(17), derived from (11), (13), and (15). Thus solving the equilibrium amounts to satisfying

4.2    Estimation
We estimate the structural parameters using Maximum Likelihood. Our data set will consist
of a measure of performance (for one or two terms) and reelection outcomes for a set of
governors. As such, the unit of observation will be a governor stint of one or two terms.
Given the structure of the model, we can de ne the likelihood function analytically. For
a governor who wins reelection, we observe the triplet (y1 ; R = 1; y2 ) : For a governor who
loses reelection, we observe the pair (y1 ; R = 0). Each of these outcomes might come from

of a generic governor winning reelection while producing performance of y1 and y2 can be

   For a governor k with (y1k ; Rk ; y2k ) ; we compute her contribution to log-likelihood using

and the log-likelihood is simply given by

Estimating the structural parameters requires maximizing log L, which we do using standard
numerical optimization routines. We estimate six structural parameters (; YL ; YH ;  y ; ;  " )
and x     = 0:85; which represents roughly a 4% annual discounting over a four-year term.
Once estimates for the structural parameters are obtained, estimates for equilibrium out-
comes (H ; L ; ; V) can be directly obtained using the invariance property of Maximum
Likelihood estimation. Standard errors are computed using the White correction for het-
eroskedasticity for the structural parameters, and the delta method for the equilibrium out-
comes. Further details of the computational method are given in the Appendix.

4.3     Data Description
In order to estimate our model, we use data for U.S. governors. The key choice we need to
make is the variable that proxies for performance y in the data. In the model y represents
something that enters voters utility directly (and thus is observable to them) and at least
in part a¤ected by the e¤ort of the governor. We choose job approval ratings (JAR) for this
purpose because relative to alternatives such as economic, environmental or scal outcomes,
it seems to best t our criteria.11 Our implicit assumption in treating the JARs as measuring
voter welfare is that voter approval ratings represent an accurate assessment by voters of
their own welfare and not pandering by the governor. The robustness of our results to
dropping the results of JAR surveys in the election year discussed in Section 5.3, where it
may be argued that pandering would be most likely, supports this assumption.
    A large fraction of the JAR data come from Beyle, Niemi, and Sigelman (2002), and we
update their dataset through the 2012 election using various online resources. The underlying
data come from surveys of voters at various points of each governors term, where they are
asked to rate the governor as excellent, good, fair and poor (or undecided). For each
governor we measure performance as the fraction of respondents who classify the governor as
excellent or good out of those who express an opinion, eliminating the undecided respondents.
In order to eliminate e¤ects of the governors reelection campaign, we use JAR up to and
including June of the nal year of the incumbents rst term, i.e., the election year. We do
not restrict the second-term JAR. We take the simple average of the JAR numbers over a
term of the governor and use them as y1 and y2 : From here on we use JAR to refer to the
adjusted measures described in this paragraph.
    Our model places some important constraints on the types of governor stints we can use
in the estimation. We start with the universe of all governors that served from 1950 to
present, where we have collected basic information about the governor, some of which comes
from Besley (2006). We also know the outcomes of their reelection bids.12 We then apply
   11
      We also tried real income per capita growth, unemployment and change in unemployment. The former
variable produced some signi cant e¤ect on election outcomes but it was tiny in size which meant that much
was explained by the election shock. As such, our model was not very informative. Nor did these economic
variables have a high correlation with JAR. See Stein (1990) for an argument on why governors may be held
less accountable than national leaders for economic conditions.
   12
      We consider any governor that is eligible for reelection as having run for reelection, that is, we consider
the choice of not running as losing. This is justi ed by our review of such cases where a reasonable interpre-
tation of the events suggests that the governor decided that he or she would not be able to win reelection
and either resigned or sought other alternatives. Perhaps not surprisingly, many of these governors perform
quite badly in their rst term, which results in being predicted by the model as bad governors who did
not exert e¤ort (see Table A2). Dropping these governors would lead to a high value for  and discipline /
selection e¤ects become very small. This analyis is available upon request.

                                                       15
the following lters to eliminate governors who do not t our model of a limit of two terms
of equal length across governors.

    Drop governors who did not have any term limits, or had a one-term limit or a three-
       term limit.

    Drop governors during whose stints state election laws regarding term limits changed.

    Drop governors with 2-year terms.

    Drop governor stints (not just the terms) where the governor was appointed, completed
       someone elses term, or was elected through a special election outside the states regular
       electoral cycle.

    Drop governors who did not complete at least three years of their rst term or at least
       two years of their second term (for example due to resignation, passing away, or being
       recalled).

    These lters yield 149 governor stints.13 Combining this with the JAR data we compiled
yields 93 governor stints. Due to data availability and the prevalence of 2-year terms and/or
absence of term limits early on in our sample, except for one governor from the 1960s, our
data covers elections from 1982 to 2012. There are 26 election years from 32 states in our
sample. 91% of the governors in our sample are male, 55% of them are from the Democratic
Party, 39% have served in the military and 46% of them are lawyers. Comparing these
numbers with the population of all governors over this period, there does not seem to be a
major bias in our sample.
    Our model assumes that all governors are identical, except for their types. In order to
conform to this assumption, our measures of performance need to be uncorrelated with any
observable feature of the governor. This is indeed the case. Our measures of y1 and y2 have
negligible correlations with characteristics of governors such as age, party, whether or not
they are in the same party as the U.S. president, education level and gender, as well as
characteristics of the states in which they serve, such as the Census division to which they
belong.
    We provide the basic data that we use for estimation, namely (y1 ; R; y2 ) in Table A1
in the Appendix. We also revisit some of the choices we make in this section and consider
alternatives in Section 5.3.
  13
     A handful of governors serve multiple stints by being elected after some period following a completed
term-limited stint. We treat each stint as a separate governor. Eliminating these governors from our sample
does not change our results.

5       Estimation Results
5.1     Benchmark Model
5.1.1    Basic results

The estimates of the six structural parameters and the four equilibrium outcomes are given
in Table 1. Several things can be noted. 52% of governors in our sample are good and we
strongly reject the two extremes, all governors being good or bad. Of the bad governors, 27%
of them exert high e¤ort in their rst term and thus are disciplined. Exerting high e¤ort
(for any governor) leads to an average increase in performance of over 20 JAR points, which
is highly signi cant, both statistically and economically. Figure 2 shows the distribution of
JAR for the 57 reelected incumbents in our sample. The red and blue normal distributions
show the estimated performance distributions with the dashed lines showing their means. It
is clear from this gure that it is unlikely that the outcome distributions come from a single
normal distribution as there are two peaks near the two estimated means of the distributions.
    High e¤ort increases the probability of reelection from 45% to 72%. There is also a
signi cant incumbency advantage: an incumbent enters the reelection with an advantage
that is equivalent to having 9:34 JAR points more than his actual JAR. The election shock
has a large standard deviation, which shows that there are many elections in which a governor
with a low JAR is nonetheless reelected or a governor with a high JAR is not reelected. The
election shock threshold ^" (y1 ) ; the posterior probability that a type is good 
                                                                                  ^ (y1 ) ; and
the reelection probability   (y1 ), all conditional on observed y1 ; are illustrated in Figure 3.
The shapes of all these mappings originate from the shape of the 
                                                                 ^ (y1 ) mapping, which in
turn uses the normality of the process that determines y1 : Small rst-term JAR, for example
25, signal to the voter that the governor did not exert high e¤ort; as a result he assigns a
near-zero probability of the governor being the good type. Then, for this governor to win
reelection she needs an election shock of around 15 or larger. Since this is quite reasonable
given the estimated values of  = 9:34 and  " = 13:07; there is about a 30% probability for
this governor to win reelection, despite bad rst-term performance. As y1 increases so does
^ (y1 ) ; until y1 hits 70 after which the reelection probability remains constant at around 80%;

reecting the possibility of an unfavorable election shock after a very strong performance in
the rst term.

5.1.2    Identi cation

Before we turn to the implications of our model with the particular parameter estimates, it
will be useful to discuss their identi cation. First, we nd very strong evidence that there
are two types of governors (that is, 0 <  < 1). To understand why this is the case, assume
to the contrary that there was only one type of governor.14 In this case y1 and y2 for a
governor would be uncorrelated because they would be iid draws from the same distribution.
In our data, however, this correlation is 0:36: With two types of governors, and assuming for
the moment that  = 0 (that is, bad governors never exert high e¤ort), we can generate a
positive correlation from the variation due to di¤erences in governor types.
    Second, we nd  > 0: If on the contrary  = 0; this would imply that (y2                   y1 ) would be
zero-mean and symmetric because every governor draws her performance outcomes from the
same distribution across her terms (with mean YH for good governors and with mean YL for
bad governors), and any di¤erences in the performance between terms is completely due to
luck. In our data y2       y1 has a negative skewness, indicating that it has a distribution with
a thicker left tail. Our model with  > 0 is able to match this because the disciplined bad
governors will have y2        y1 that is negative since they would be drawing from two di¤erent
distributions in their two terms.
    Third, we nd  " > 0 and  > 0; indicating the presence of sizable election shocks that,
on average, favor incumbents. If  " were equal to 0; then any governor with 
                                                                             ^ (y1 ) > 
would have to win reelection and all others would have to lose. In our sample however there
are many governors who lose reelections despite good rst-term performance, implying the
presence of election shocks. Furthermore, de ning W  P (R = 1j^
                                                                 (y1 ) < ) and L 
          (y1 ) > ) as the two surprises (winning elections despite bad performance and
P (R = 0j^
losing elections despite good performance), the election shock having a zero mean would
imply W = L : However, in our sample W > L , which requires that  > 0; that is, an
incumbency advantage.
    Finally, once these key parameters or equilibrium objects are pinned down, the other
three structual parameters, that is, YH , YL and  y ; follow from matching some of the other
properties of the JAR data. These include the mean and variance of y1 and y2 :




  14
     It should be clear that if there was only one type of governor, it is irrelevant if we called them good or
bad. The bad governors would never exert high e¤ort because there is no bene t in doing so.

                                                      18
5.1.3    Measures of interest

To understand what the parameter estimates imply for our model with a two-term limit, we
report results including outcomes in a (counterfactual) one-term world in Table 2. While
some of the measures can be computed analytically, many cannot, and thus we resort to
simulations where we simulate the model for 1,000,000 governor-terms. The rst panel of
the table illustrates the case where a governor was restricted to one term of o¢ce, in which
case only good governors would exert high e¤ort, leading to an average performance of 54
JAR points. Lifetime welfare for a voter V is 360.2 in this case.
    In the second panel we look at summary measures for two-term limited governors. The
two-term world is unambiguously better for the voter. First, more governors exert e¤ort in
the rst term, leading to a higher average JAR. This is because 27% of the bad governors
exert e¤ort in addition to all the good governors, leading to high e¤ort 64:7% of the time
in the rst term, compared with 51:7% in the one-term case. This increases average JAR
in the rst term from 54 to 56:7. Second, because a higher fraction of bad governors than
good governors are screened out in elections, more governors are good in the second term at
59:6% relative to the unconditional probability of 51:7%: Since these governors always exert
e¤ort, the average JAR in the second term is 55:6, compared to 54 in the one-term case.
Putting these together, the life-time welfare of the voter goes up from 360.2 to 375.3; which
is a 4:2% increase. Put di¤erently, a voter in a two-term regime would be willing to give up
about 2:3 JAR points every term ad in nitum in order to remain in that regime and not
switch to a one-term regime.15 Looking at Table 2, it is clear that the voter is better o¤
because the governors performance in both terms is higher relative to the one-term case.
We turn to understanding the di¤erent e¤ects of electoral accountability in next section.
    Given our estimated model, we can compute a few interesting magnitudes about the
governors and their performance in our sample, which are reported in Table A2. In particular
we show the performance measures y1 and y2 that go into the estimation, as well as 
                                                                                   ^ (y1 ) ;
the updated probability that the governor is a good type after observing y1 ;                       (y1 ) ; the
probability that the governor will win reelection given her rst-term performance, as well as




  15
     Relative to the one-term outcome of 54; this 2:3 point increase is also a 4:2% increase. Since the utility
of the voter is linear in JAR, consumption-equivalent welfare is equivalent to simply comparing lifetime
values.

which shows the ex-post assessment of a governors type, after having observed her perfor-
mance in both terms and the reelection outcome.
   We present three examples to illustrate how our model works. The rst is Guy Hunt, who
was the governor of Alabama between 1987 and 1993. His rst-term performance is 60:1;
which is slightly lower than YH but su¢ciently far away from YL for voters to believe that
he is a good type with 70% probability just prior to his reelection bid. This implies a 74%
chance that he will win the election. He wins a second term and has performance of only
                                    (y1 ; R; y2 ) is only 8%: According to our model, he was
38:2 in the second term. As result 
therefore probably a bad governor who exerted high e¤ort in the rst term and low e¤ort
in his second term. Incidentally, he was forced to resign towards the end of his second term
because he was convicted of theft, conspiracy and ethics violations. Our second example
is Mitch Daniels, who was the governor of Indiana between 2005 and 2013. His rst-term
performance is only 48:7; leading the voters to think that he is a good type with only 31%
probability. Despite this, he wins reelection.16 In his second term his performance is 65:2:
As a result, ex post it seems like he was a good governor who exerted e¤ort in his rst term
but had an unlucky performance draw. Our third example is David Beasley, who was the
Republican governor of South Carolina from 1995 to 1999. His rst term performance is
60:8; which gives him a 75% probability of winning his reelection bid. However, he loses
reelection to the Democrat challenger Jim Hodges. This is likely to be a case where a good
governor was unlucky to draw a negative election shock and lose the reelection. Indeed his
loss is considered to be a surprise given how heavily Republican the state had been at the
time.17
   Finally, we can also talk about how good a t our model provides to the data. In Table A2

  16
      The Washington Post names his reelection campaign The Best Gubernatorial Campaign of 2008
where he won with more votes than any candidate in the states history. We can consider this as evidence
of a large positive election shock.
   17
      Owners of video poker machines spent very heavily on advertisements attacking Beasley who had worked
to ban it in the state during his rst term. It is also argued that many conservative Republicans did not
turn out to vote on election day because of what they perceived as Beasleys supposed ip-ops on moving
the Confederate ag from on top of the Capitol.

                                                   20
we report     (y1k ) ; the models implied probability that an incumbent k will win reelection.
If we select a rule that predicts reelection whenever          (y1k ) > 0:5; then we can correctly
predict the reelection outcomes for 75% of the governors (49 wins and 21 losses) in our
sample, incorrectly predicting only 15 wins and 8 losses. One way to assess the performance
of a probability forecast such as (y1 ) is to use the Brier (1950) score, which is de ned
        P
as (1=n) nk=1 [ (y1k ) Rk ]2 where Rk 2 f0; 1g is the election outcome. The Brier score
is between zero (a perfect prediction) and one, with smaller numbers indicating a better
forecast. Our model gets a Brier score of 0:195: For comparison, a naive forecast that uses
the overall fraction of governors who win in our sample (61:2%) for each governor instead of
the     (y1k ) measure gets a Brier score of 0:237:18 A Diebold-Mariano (1995) test, as described
by Lahiri and Yang (2013) rejects equal accuracy between our models forecast and the naive
forecast with a p-value of 0:01: Our model places quite a bit of structure on the relationship
between the observable variables (reelection outcomes and rst-term JAR in this case), which
in principle puts it at a disadvantage against a reduced-form model like a probit. However,
an estimated probit model that uses JAR in the rst term as a predictor (i.e., a reduced-
form model using the same observables as our structural model) yields a higher Brier score
(though the di¤erence is no longer statistically signi cant). Therefore, we believe that the
performance of our model being at least as good as an alternative reduced-form model with
the same information and signi cantly better than a naive forecast is quite impressive.


5.2      Measuring the E¤ects of Elections
One of the key advantages of our structural approach is the ability to conduct counterfactual
exercises to see how outcomes would di¤er if we changed various aspects of the environment
such that the governors and voters behaved di¤erently than they do in the data. We use
this advantage for two important purposes. First, in this section we measure the magnitudes
of the e¤ects of having the possibility of reelection. Second, in Section 5.5, we consider a
change in term limits.
      Elections have three consequences in our model: discipline (bad governors exert high
e¤ort to secure reelection), selection (more good governors are reelected since bad governors
who exerted low e¤ort are identi ed), and mimicking (bad governors who are disciplined look
like good governors). In order to measure the rst two e¤ects, we compare the outcomes in
the benchmark model with a counterfactual model where governors can only serve one term.

  18
     As a point of comparison, a naive forecast that the incumbent wins 50% of the time would lead to a
Bier score of 0.25, regardless of the outcome.

                                                  21
Having more disciplined governors increases rst-term outcomes relative to the one-term case
since more governors overall will exert high e¤ort. In turn, when there is a second election,
the selection e¤ect can be measured as the increase in outcomes in the second term of the
benchmark model relative to the one-term counterfactual model, as there will be more good
governors than bad governors who survive reelection and exert high e¤ort in their second
term.
   These e¤ects are not independent of each other. To see this, consider the case where all
bad governors are disciplined, which means that all governors, good or bad, exert high e¤ort
in their rst term. As a result, there will be no information voters can use to screen governors,
thus leading to identical fractions of each type of governor across the rst and second terms,
so that the percentages in each term would be identical to the one-term counterfactual. This
means the outcome in the second term will be identical to the one-term outcome, that is,
there is no selection e¤ect. It is important to realize that the lack of selection is a negative
consequence of having more disciplined governors in the rst term. We call this third e¤ect
mimicking. Thus, we distinguish between pure selection, which is the screening e¤ect
of elections were there no mimicking, and selection as de ned above. Naturally, selection is
equal to pure selection minus the e¤ect of mimicking.
   In order to identify mimicking, we consider a second counterfactual, one where there is
no discipline as an equilibrium outcome. To obtain this, we assume that the cost of exerting
high e¤ort for bad governors is c = 1; which means none of them exerts high e¤ort. This
ensures that  = 0 in equilibrium and (4) no longer is a part of the description of equilibrium.
Naturally the voters take this into account and adjust their behavior accordingly in solving
their problem. In other words, the voter solves his problem taking in to account that  = 0
and this inuences all equilibrium mappings including, for example, the reelection rule and
thus the equilibrium outcomes L ; H and V. We solve this equilibrium using the structural
parameters in Table 1. Some details of outcomes in this counterfactual case are presented
in Table A1 in the Appendix.
   The bottom panel of Table 2 shows two di¤erent approaches to computing these three
e¤ects. The rst approach uses the change in the number of good governors, measured in
percentage points, while the second approach uses the change in performance. Comparing
the benchmark version with the one-term case, we nd that there is a 13 percentage point
increase in the fraction of governors exerting high e¤ort in their rst term, which leads to
an increase of 2:7 JAR points in performance, or a 5% increase. These are our measures
of discipline. The e¤ect of selection is lower in magnitude, namely a 7.9 percentage point


                                              22
increase in the fraction of good governors (or equivalently governors that exert high e¤ort)
in the second term, leading to a 1:6 JAR point or 3:0% increase in performance. However,
the improvement in the second term due to selection is partially cancelled due to mimicking
 the pure selection e¤ect is 2:6 JAR points, almost identical to discipline  but second-term
performance is 1 JAR point lower due to mimicking.
    As we discussed in the previous section, voters are better o¤ in the two-term-limit world
relative to a one-term-limit one by about 4:2% in welfare. The decomposition in this section
suggests that about 60% of this is due to the disciplining e¤ect of elections: going from
the one-term-limit counterfactual to the no-discipline counterfactual, welfare goes up by 5.8
points while from the no-discipline counterfactual to the benchmark model welfare goes up
by 9:3 points.
    To highlight the signi cance of our structural approach in measuring the e¤ect of elec-
tions, we close with a comparison to a reduced-form approach. A typical analysis of the e¤ect
of elections, for example Besley and Case (1995), compares the performance of politicians
who are in their last terms in o¢ce (lame ducks) with those eligible for reelection, controlling
for various observable characteristics of politicians. According to our model, the rst and
second (last) term outcomes are given by the stylized equations

                           y1 = baseline + discipline                                                  (29)
                           y2 = baseline + pure selection           mimicking                          (30)

where baseline captures the level of performance that would be observed in the absence
of electoral accountability, that is, independent of the e¤ect of elections.19 If we compute
the performance of lame ducks, relative to all others in our model, or, equivalently, regress
the performance of all governors on a lame-duck dummy, we get y2                       y1 = pure selec-
tion mimicking discipline. Using the numbers in Table 2 for the second approach that
uses JAR, with selection as the measure of pure selection mimicking, we get                  1:1: It is not
clear how to interpret this number in isolation since by itself it gives us information about
neither the absolute nor the relative sizes of the three channels we are able to separately
identify. For example, the common nding that performance falls in a governors last term
is often interpreted as reecting simply the lack of discipline, suggesting that removing term
limits would increase voter welfare. To understand why this conclusion does not follow,

  19
      It should be obvious that the three terms other than baseline are complicated functions of the equi-
librium outcomes (i.e. behaviors of governors and voters), as well as of the structural parameters of the
model.

                                                    23
consider our two-term-limit results relative to the counterfactual of having a one-term limit.
First-term performance is indeed higher due to discipline, while second-term performance is
higher due to selection (which itself is mitigated by mimicking). The fall in average perfor-
mance in the last term is simply due to the relative strengths of the various e¤ects, which
reduced-form estimation cannot separate.


5.3    Robustness
As we explained in Section 4.3, we made some choices in preparing the JAR data for esti-
mation. Our benchmark measure of governor performance averaged the results of all JAR
surveys over a governors rst term up to and including June of the election year, where
we used the fraction of respondents who classify the governor as excellent or good out of
those who express an opinion (that is, eliminating the undecided respondents). In Table 3
we consider the robustness of our results to making di¤erent choices: using all surveys in the
 rst term up to the election (All Surveys); dropping all surveys taken in the election year
(No Election Year); taking the average JAR in each year of the term and then taking the
year-by-year average so that respondent sentiment in a year with many surveys would not
be overweighted (Year-by-Year Average); using the median (Median JAR) or the minimum
JAR (Minimum JAR) rather than the average; and, taking the fraction of respondents who
classi ed the governor as excellent or good out of all respondents including the undecided
(Keep Undecideds), which essentially classi es the undecided as expressing low approval.
As the estimates make clear, the results are robust to all of these alternative performance
calculations. The key is that the identi cation of  and  is not a¤ected by these variations.
   We also considered allowing the distributions of YH and YL to have di¤erent variances
(Free  H
        y ). This change also produces little substantive changes in the results. It is also
useful to note that the log-likelihood of the restricted model (our benchmark) is only 0.23
log-points smaller than the likelihood of this unrestricted model and thus the restriction we
place is not rejected by the data.


5.4    Noisy E¤ort Signal
The implications of a noisy e¤ort signal discussed in section 3.6 help to understand the
importance of the election shock for the strength of discipline e¤ects, as well as the trade-o¤
between discipline and selection. Table 4 reports discipline and selection measures (analogous
to Table 2) for di¤erent values of the partially and fully informative signals of governor e¤ort,
the latter both in the presence and absence of an election shock. (See the Appendix for the

                                               24
details of how this version is solved.) Throughout this section, we assume the structural
parameters shown in Table 1 are unchanged but solve for the equilibrium objects for every
 considered. We show the re-computed  in the table.
   The rst column shows the benchmark results presented above, which correspond to
 = 0:5 in this version. The second column shows the e¤ect of a partially informative signal
of e¤ort,  = 0:75: Relative to case of an uninformative (or no) signal, the fraction of bad
governors disciplined rises from 27% to 30%. This is consistent with what theory would lead
us to expect: a higher probability of observing shirking leads to more bad types exerting
high e¤ort. We also nd a stronger selection e¤ect, although the change is small; 3:2%
instead of 3:0%. Hence, the higher selection e¤ect due to observability is present as theory
would suggest, but is small. The reason for this will become clear shortly.
   To better understand the magnitude of these e¤ects, we also considered the case of
 = 1; that is, perfect observability of e¤ort, as shown in the third column of Table 4. (This,
of course, is not equivalent to perfect observability of type, since bad governors can, and
do, mimic the e¤ort levels of good governors.) We see that the fraction of bad governors
disciplined in their rst term rises to 43%, an increase by more than half of the 27% when
e¤ort was unobservable, but not by more as one would be perhaps inclined to expect. The
reason why full observability of e¤ort does not lead to all bad types exerting high e¤ort in
their rst term is the existence of the election shock. Even if a governor is known to be
of bad type  perfectly indicated in this case by low e¤ort  she can still win reelection
with a su¢ciently positive realization of " (reelection probability L = 0:45); conversely,
even if a bad type exerts high e¤ort, she is not guaranteed reelection (reelection probability
H = 0:72) if the realization of " is su¢ciently negative. So, bad types with a su¢ciently high
draw of c will still nd it optimal to exert low e¤ort, even though it will be fully apparent
to the voter that they did so. Hence, discipline is mitigated by the randomness of reelection
outcomes due to reasons unrelated to performance, as theory once again would suggest.
   To con rm this, we simulated the model with full observability of e¤ort ( = 1) but with
the election shock turned o¤ ( " = 0), so that the election shock is constrained to take its
mean value  = 9:34: There is no possibility of a very positive realization of " to save
a low-e¤ort incumbent, though the average incumbency advantage is still present. Now all
bad governors exert high e¤ort, and all are reelected. Mimicking of good governors by all
bad governors implies there is no selection e¤ect, and the fraction of good governors in the
second term is identical to the fraction in the rst term.
   We can now see why partial observability of e¤ort implied such a small increase in the


                                              25
selection e¤ect relative to the case of no observability. As we discussed in Section 5.2, the
mimicking by bad governors in the rst term reduces the e¤ect of selection by making it
more di¢cult to distinguish types based on the performance signal. Perfect observability of
e¤ort (and hence low e¤ort making it unambiguous that a governor is bad) does not induce
perfect discipline on governors when reelection has a signi cant exogenous random compo-
nent. In the limit, when e¤ort is perfectly observable and low e¤ort guarantees electoral
defeat, discipline is perfect (that is, there will be no governors in the third group), but the
selection e¤ect goes to zero precisely because of full mimicking by bad governors.
    The last row in Table 4 shows how the welfare of the voter changes in each case. Having a
moderately informative e¤ort signal is worth 0:3% of welfare to the voter while making e¤ort
fully observable leads to an improvement of 1:6%; which is sizable. Much of the increase in
these cases come from the higher discipline. When selection is absent due to shutting down
election shocks, the welfare gain falls to 1:1%.

5.5     Electoral Reform: A Limit of Three Terms
In this section we consider an electoral reform where governors are allowed to stay in o¢ce
for three terms. To do so we use the estimated parameters from Table 1. We realize that
of the structural parameters, ;  and  " may depend on the term-limit regime in place.
For example, changing term limits may change incentives for people to enter politics and
thus may change the composition of the pool of candidates. Since we do not model the
choice of running for o¢ce, we cannot capture this e¤ect in our model.20 For example  may
be lower under a three-term electoral regime since expected lifetime rents are now higher,
reducing welfare and causing us to overstate the gain from the change in term limits. Also,
the parameters that govern the election shock process could possibly depend on which term
the incumbent is in; for example having more information about a governor may increase
incumbency advantage so that a governor who has served two terms may be reelected more
easily than a governor who has served only one.21 Similarly, perhaps election shocks may
not be as large in a second reelection bid. A change in the incumbency advantage  would
in turn change reelection probabilities and thus the discipline e¤ect. As such, if  did indeed
go up, keeping the election shock process unchanged across terms would likely understate
the welfare gains of the electoral reform we consider.
  20
      Thus, perhaps one way to interpret our counterfactual experiment is one where a governor who thought
she was running for o¢ce in a two-term limit regime is told that she has a limit of three terms on her rst
day in o¢ce.
   21
      Rogers (2014) nds that incumbents in state legislatures face weaker challengers as they near their nal
term, indicating an increasing incumbency advantage.

                                                    26
    Finally, we assume that the mapping from e¤ort to outcomes is invariant to the term of
the governor. One can argue that this can indeed be a¤ected by the term of the governor
in more than one way. For example a third-term governor may have more fatigue and thus
even with e¤ort outcomes may be worse. Alternatively, since a third-term governor knows
the working of the system much better, perhaps things get done more easily, thus increasing
performance conditional on e¤ort. These factors would have complicated e¤ects on welfare;
the possibility of fatigue would reduce the gains from the reform while the idea that a third-
term governor will be more e¢cient would increase the gains from reform. Thus the results
in this section should be read with these caveats in mind.
    Table 5 summarizes our results, where key statistics, obtained via simulating the model
with a three-term limit, are contrasted with those from the benchmark model with a two-
term limit. With a higher prize (staying in o¢ce for an extra term), bad governors now
exert e¤ort with 61:3% probability in the rst term and 25:9% probability in the second
term, compared with 26:8% probability in the rst term for the two-term regime.22 As a
result average performance in the rst term goes up to 60:1 from 56:7: Even though in their
third term all bad governors exert low e¤ort, governors in o¢ce exert high e¤ort 69:7% of the
time, compared with 62:7% in the two-term case, showing that there is a large increase in
discipline. The ip side of this, though, is decreased selection since now more bad governors
slip through elections and survive to their third term. The 7:9 percentage point increase
in the fraction of good governors in the two-term regime (relative to a one-term regime,
our rst measure of selection) goes down to 4:5 for term three in the three-term regime.23
Overall, the voters bene t from the reform, with welfare rising by 2:8%:
    While tedious, in principle one can continue this exercise and increase the term limit to
four, ve or more terms. We think, however, that the problems we explain at the beginning
of this section would become more and more signi cant as we increase the number of terms a
governor can serve and would make our assumption of treating parameters as structural less
defendable. As such we do not undertake this exercise. Nevertheless, we think it is useful to
know that an electoral reform in the U.S. allowing governors to serve more than two terms

  22
      One may question if having 61:3% of bad governors exerting high e¤ort is too high. While it is di¢cult
to answer this question exactly, we can get an idea by looking at the data for unconstrained governors.
There are 137 governors in no-term-limit states who are eligible for reelection after their rst term and 88%
of them choose to run for a second term. Of those who win the second term, 54% of them run for a third
term. The percentage seeking reelection to a fourth term, is 45%, still quite high. Hence, it would appear
that the option of staying in o¢ce for an extra term is indeed valuable because ex post (i.e. at end of the
second term) many governors take advantage of it.
   23
      We can compute our measures of discipline only for the rst term and selection only for the third term
in the three-term regime since discipline and selection are combined in the second term.

                                                    27
may lead to a signi cant increase in voter welfare, if our assumption of holding parameters
constant across regimes is not very egregious.


6     Conclusions
In this paper we constructed a political agency model with adverse selection and moral
hazard, and we structurally estimated the model. The aim was to disentangle the various
e¤ects that electoral accountability has on policymaker performance  speci cally discipline
and selection e¤ects  and, more generally, to assess the empirical relevance of the widely-
used political agency model.
    Many papers have used a reduced-form approach to try to estimate the e¤ects of electoral
accountability on discipline and selection, but this approach faces the di¢culty of disentan-
gling the importance of these two e¤ects on policymaker performance. Structural estimation
allows us to separate empirically the discipline and selection e¤ects of elections. We esti-
mated the e¤ects on the performance of U.S. governors of the common two-term limit regime
relative to the counterfactual case where reelection is not allowed, so that elections can nei-
ther discipline nor allow selection based on performance. A crucial advantage of a structural
model is the possibility of estimating speci c parameters representing discipline e¤ects and
the relative prevalence of governor types, a possibility that reduced-form estimation does
not allow. This is what allows counterfactual experiments to assess the welfare e¤ects of
electoral accountability under di¤erent informational and electoral regimes.
    We found a signi cant discipline e¤ect of reelection incentives, as well as a somewhat
weaker selection e¤ect. Quantifying these e¤ects allows us to assess their relative importance.
More generally, our results indicate that a formal political agency model stressing the role
of accountability nds support in the data, an important point given the widespread use of
the political agency approach in theoretical political economy models.
    Further research may help address some basic questions raised by these results. Why is
there such a large fraction of bad governors in the data? Why dont reelection incentives
discipline a larger fraction of them? Arguing that there is a large stochastic element to
elections doesnt really answer the second question. These two questions are of course related.
Understanding why some governors dont perform well should help explain why the threat
of not being reelected may not induce them to perform better.
    In our opinion, structural estimation can be quite helpful in gaining a deeper econometric
understanding of issues of politician performance and electoral accountability. We believe
this paper is a useful step in that direction.

Note: The numbers on this table are obtained by simulating the model for 1,000,000 terms,
given the structural parameters in Table 1. The one-term limit assumes governors are not
eligible to run for reelection. The δ = 0 version is solved assuming c = 1. All changes in
fractions (such as the ones for Discipline A, Selection A and Mimicking A measures) reported
as percentage point changes.

C       Some Computational Details

that all the integrals we deal with have the following general form

Notes: The no-discipline counterfactual is obtained by setting the cost of exerting high effort
for bad governors to c = 1 so that they never exert high effort, and re-solving the model
so that the voters optimally react to this. The solution uses the estimates of the structural
parameters reported in Table 1.

Notes: y1 and y2 , when available, show the JAR performance of the governor. The absence of
y2 indicate that the governor did not win a second term. π̂(y1 ) is the updated probability of
the governor being good, conditional on first-term performance and ψ(y1 ) is the probability
that the governor will win re-election based on first-term performance. π̄ (y1 , R, y2 ) is the
probability that the governor is good, having observed both terms’ performance, where
available.
