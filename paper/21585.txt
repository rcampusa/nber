The Cost of Uncertainty about the Timing of Social Security Reform

                                             ABSTRACT

We develop a model to study optimal decision making in the face of uncertainty about the timing and
structure of a future event. The model is used to study optimal decision making and welfare when
individuals face uncertainty about when and how Social Security will be reformed. When individuals
save optimally for retirement, the welfare cost of uncertainty about the timing and structure of reform
is just a few basis points of total lifetime consumption. In contrast, the cost of reform uncertainty can
be greater than 1% of total lifetime consumption for individuals who do not save.

1. Introduction

Saving optimally for retirement is di¢ cult because individuals face uncertainty along many dimensions.
Longevity, medical expenses, future health status, earnings, and returns on savings vary for each indi-
vidual. Optimal retirement saving requires understanding the distributions of these uncertainties and
then forming optimal consumption/saving plans.1 Beyond these recognized challenges, the long-term
insolvency of the Social Security system creates an additional level of uncertainty for individuals because
they do not know their future bene…t levels or tax rates. This paper studies how policy uncertainty about
the timing and structure of Social Security reform in‡uences individual decision making and welfare.
       Understanding how to measure policy uncertainty and how it a¤ects economic decisions is a priority
in macroeconomics (Sargent (2005), Fernández-Villaverde et al. (2013), Baker, Bloom and Davis (2013),
Baker et al. (2014)).2 In particular, uncertainty is generated as individuals do not know the path of
future policy until policy makers act. We develop a dynamic setting to study optimal decision making
when individuals do not know when or how policy reform will occur.3 A feature of our setting is that it
is ‡exible enough to handle any distribution over the resolution of timing uncertainty.
       Although the set of potential Social Security reforms is known— either bene…ts must fall or taxes must
rise— which combination of these measures policy makers will ultimately pursue and when reform will
happen are not. We solve and simulate optimal consumption/saving decisions for a 25 year old individual
starting with no assets and facing mortality risk over a …nite lifespan. We abstract from factor price risk
to focus on policy uncertainty and we consider settings where reform at an unknown date is a proportional
bene…t cut, a proportional tax increase, or an unknown combination of the two. In each case the reform
is parameterized to make Social Security solvent over an in…nite horizon.
       After characterizing optimal decision making, we calculate the cost of policy uncertainty about the
timing and structure of Social Security reform in the U.S. when individuals follow the optimal consump-
tion/saving path. The cost is de…ned as the fraction of lifetime consumption that a young individual
facing reform uncertainty would be willing to give up to live in a world with no reform uncertainty where
she is endowed with her expected lifetime income over all possible realizations of reform. Our welfare

     This task can be challenging not just because of limits on information, but also because of limits on self control (Laibson
(1997)) and limits on computational ability (Thaler (1994)).

     Some readers may prefer to reserve the word uncertainty for situations in which probabilities of random events are
unknown and risk for situations in which probabilities are known. In this paper we deal only with known probabilities, and
we use the words risk and uncertainty interchangeably.

     Stokey (2014), Bi, Leeper and Leith (2012), Davig, Leeper and Walker (2010), and Davig and Foerster (2014) use similar
methods to study uncertainty about …scal policy reform.




                                                               2
measure captures the full value of insuring against timing uncertainty. It also nets out the cost of reform
itself allowing us to isolate the cost of policy uncertainty. We …rst consider timing uncertainty alone where
either a bene…t cut or a tax increase balances the Social Securty budget. Next, we consider uncertainty
about both the timing and structure of reform where the Social Security budget is balanced with an
unknown combination of bene…t cuts and tax increases.
   For those who save optimally, the welfare cost is small regardless of whether reform is a tax increase, a
bene…t cut, or an uncertain combination of the two. For realistically parameterized reforms, if individuals
know the distribution of reform dates and structures then they can appropriately save to make the costs of
uncertainty small. Optimal saving behavior provides a benchmark for how low welfare costs can be for an
individual facing reform uncertainty. Tax increases and bene…t cuts have di¤erent e¤ects for low-income
and high-income individuals. If individuals know that the Social Security budget will be balanced with
a bene…t cut, then uncertainty about the timing of reform is regressive. Alternatively, when the budget
will be balanced using a tax increase, then high-income individuals face larger welfare losses because they
face the same percentage tax increase but rely less on the progressive bene…t. Additionally, uncertainty
about both the timing and structure of reform imposes larger welfare costs on low-income individuals
across all parameterizations of the model.
   We also consider the welfare cost to individuals who do not save at all. These individuals consume
their disposable income in each period and rely exclusively on Social Security bene…ts during retirement.
This exercise provides a natural benchmark of how high welfare costs can be when individuals do not use
saving to hedge the reform uncertainty they face. This benchmark is also relevant as Hurst (2006) and
others document that as many as 20-30% of Americans do not save. We …nd that non-savers experience
welfare costs that can exceed 1% of their total lifetime consumption. For those who imperfectly hedge the
reform uncertainty that they face, possibly due to under-saving or not fully understanding the nature of
the uncertainty, their saving behavior would fall between optimal and non-saving behavior. We conclude
that the welfare cost of policy uncertainty about Social Security reform can be quite large, relative to a
world in which a non-saver consumes with certainty her expected income over all possible realizations of
reform.
   Because these baseline exercises correspond to a 25 year old individual starting with no assets, we
explore how initial age and assets in‡uence the cost of living with uncertainty about the timing and
structure of Social Security reform. In every case, higher levels of wealth reduce the cost of uncertainty
as the possible bene…t cut or tax increase is less important to the individual. Moreover, timing uncertainty
is more costly for older individuals in both the case of a certain bene…t cut and when there is uncertainty


                                                     3
about the structure of reform as they have less time to prepare for a future reduction in bene…ts. For
instance, timing uncertainty about a bene…t cut costs a 65 year old with no current assets nearly 5% of
remaining lifetime consumption if an optimal plan is followed thereafter and over 7.5% for a non-saver.
In contrast, uncertainty is less costly for older workers in cases of a tax increase as the increase only
a¤ects a shorter portion of their life and they have a higher probability of being una¤ected by the policy
change.
       We also extend our analysis to consider a grandfathering policy that exempts individuals from reform
once they reach age 55. While individuals are better o¤ under such a policy since they have higher
expected lifetime income, grandfathering does not dramatically reduce the costs of timing uncertainty.
In fact, the costs of uncertainty about the timing of reform are higher in most cases with grandfathering
than without. This is because grandfathering actually makes the distribution of timing risk that young
individuals face more severe, eliminating intermediate cases since either all or none of Social Security
bene…ts are cut.
       Our results are related to a small literature that seeks to quantify the costs of Social Security reform
uncertainty. In perhaps the most closely related work to ours, Gomes, Kotliko¤ and Viceira (2007)
study a model with uncertainty about whether a bene…t cut will occur at a given future date. Their
baseline individual would be willing to give up 0.12% of annual consumption in exchange for learning
about the cut to Social Security bene…ts at age 35 instead of age 65. While this result has a similar
‡avor to ours, individuals in their model never actually face timing uncertainty because the date at which
information is released is known in advance and welfare is measured as a comparison between early and
late resolution of uncertainty.4 Benítez-Silva et al. (2007) also compute the welfare loss from having to
live with uncertainty about the future level of Social Security bene…ts, but there is no timing uncertainty
in their model either. Bütler (1999) studies the welfare cost of uncertainty about the timing of public
pension reform in Switzerland but does not consider the distribution of welfare costs across income groups.
       Taking an alternative approach, Luttmer and Samwick (2012) use survey data to elicit the degree of
Social Security reform uncertainty that individuals perceive and how costly such uncertainty is to them.
They …nd that individuals would be willing to tolerate an additional 4-6% cut in bene…ts in exchange for
certainty about their level.

   4
    Evans, Kotliko¤ and Phillips (2012) consider a model in which future transfers to the old are uncertain because transfers
are based on the stochastic wages of the young. Likewise, van der Wiel (2008) considers the e¤ect of uncertainty about
future Social Security bene…ts on private savings, but similar to Gomes, Kotliko¤ and Viceira (2007), the individual knows
in advance that the government will announce the new level of bene…ts at the date of retirement, so there is no timing
uncertainty.

    For the theory, we combine and generalize existing tools from the two-stage optimal control literature
that deal independently with either timing uncertainty or with structural uncertainty but not both at once.
Examples of two-stage control problems with a stochastic regime switch date (timing uncertainty) can
be found in studies on resource extraction (Dasgupta and Heal (1974)), operations research (Kamien and
Schwartz (1971)), and environmental catastrophe (Clarke and Reed (1994)). And examples of problems
with uncertainty about the characteristics of the new regime (structural uncertainty) appeared in the
resource extraction literature (Hoel (1978)) and later in the technology adoption literature (Hugonnier,
Pelgrin and Pommeret (2006), Pommeret and Schubert (2009), Abel and Eberly (2012)).
    Finally, our paper is related to a literature on long-run risk. For example, Epstein, Farhi and Strzalecki
(2014) compute the “timing premium” which is the amount households would be willing to pay to
immediately resolve uncertainty about future consumption. But there is no timing uncertainty in their
setting. Individuals always know in advance whether they are living in the early-resolution world or the
late-resolution world. Their experiment is to calculate how much households in the second world would
pay to live in the …rst.5 The preference for early resolution in their setting is driven by a recursive utility
structure. We are interested in situations in which decision makers not only face uncertainty about the
outcome of a future event, but the timing of that event is also uncertain. In contrast to Epstein, Farhi
and Strzalecki (2014), we avoid recursive utility in favor of standard CRRA preferences. Of course, in our
model the cost of policy uncertainty would be much larger with recursive preferences because in that case
individuals would pay for early information even if they could not use that information to reoptimize.


2. Theory: Timing Uncertainty and Structural Uncertainty

We begin by solving a dynamic problem that features timing uncertainty only. Then we solve a problem
with both timing and structural uncertainty.6 Optimal planning in the face of timing and structural
uncertainty requires that decision makers compute contingent plans for every possible realization of the
date and structure of reform. Decision makers must then embed these contingent plans into an ex
ante problem that assigns a continuation value to the state variable based on the probability of each

    5
      Blundell and Stoker (1999) and Eeckhoudt, Gollier and Treich (2005) study the connection between optimal consumption
and the timing of income risk. They compare the case in which income risk gets resolved early to the case in which income
risk gets resolved late. Rather than modeling timing uncertainty, this literature focuses on understanding how early versus
late resolution of uncertainty a¤ects decision making. In each case, the timing of the resolution of uncertainty is known in
advance. Likewise, Wright, Bloom and Barrero (2014) extend these ideas to …rm investment behavior.
    6
      Our analysis builds on the two-stage control literature in which the switch date is deterministic and may be a choice
variable or exogenous (Kemp and Long (1977), Tomiyama (1985), Amit (1986), Tahvonen and Withagen (1996), Makris
(2001), Boucekkine, Saglam and Vallee (2004), Dogan, Van and Saglam (2011), Saglam (2011), Boucekkine, Pommeret and
Prieur (2012), Boucekkine, Pommeret and Prieur (2013a), and Boucekkine, Pommeret and Prieur (2013b)).


                                                             5
contingency.
    Time is continuous and indexed by t. Time starts at t = 0 and never ends. The planning interval
of the decision maker, which begins at t = 0 and ends at t = T , is comprised of two possible regimes or
stages. Each stage has a unique performance index and/or state equation. The regime switch date t1
is a continuous random variable, with probability density (t1 ) and support on [0; 1]. This probability
density is known at date zero and no additional information about the timing of reform is revealed over
time, except that the shock has not yet hit. We allow for the possibility that the shock t1 hits after T
and therefore the regime switch is never experienced by the decison maker. The control variable u(t) is
unconstrained and the state variable x(t) is constrained only at t = 0 and t = T , x(0) = x0 and x(T ) = xT .
    A feature of our setting is that it is ‡exible enough to handle non-stationary distributions over the
resolution of timing uncertainty, which contrasts with the standard stochastic dynamic programming
setting in which uncertainty is represented as a stationary process that depends only on the state.7
    The stochastic regime switching control problem can be solved recursively in two steps.8


2.1. Step 1: Post-switch (t = t1 ) subproblem

The …rst step of the recursive procedure is to solve a deterministic control problem from the vantage point
of the switch date t1 , taking as given the timing of the switch t1 and the quantity of the state variable at the
switch date x(t1 ). The program (u2 (tjt1 ; x(t1 )); x2 (tjt1 ; x(t1 )))t2[t1 ;T ] solves a …xed endpoint Pontryagin
subproblem:
                                                                   Z   T
                                            max           : J2 =           f2 (t; u(t); x(t))dt;                             (1)
                                         u(t)t2[t1 ;T ]            t1

subject to
                                       dx(t)
                                             = g2 (t; u(t); x(t)jt1 ); for t 2 [t1 ; T ];                                    (2)
                                        dt

                                            t1 given; x(t1 ) given; x(T ) = xT :                                             (3)

The payo¤ function f2 and the state function g2 are continuously di¤erentiable in their arguments. Given
the Hamiltonian function,


                                    H2 = f2 (t; u(t); x(t)) +              2 (t)g2 (t; u(t); x(t)jt1 );                      (4)

    7
      While it may be that one can characterize uncertainty about the timing of a regime switch as a state dependent process,
it is convenient to specify the distribution of switch dates as a function of time so that we can quickly consider a wide variety
of distributions without having to reconsider the appropriate state space.
    8
      See Appendix A for a full derivation of the solution.




                                                                       6
the necessary conditions that hold on the path (u2 (tjt1 ; x(t1 )); x2 (tjt1 ; x(t1 )))t2[t1 ;T ] include @H2 =@u(t) = 0
and d    2 (t)=dt   =     @H2 =@x(t). For convenience, change the time dummy t to z, and change the switch
point t1 to t and write the solution (u2 (zjt; x(t)); x2 (zjt; x(t)))z2[t;T ] . Thus we have the optimal control
and state paths for all points in time z greater than switch point t.


2.2. Step 2: Pre-switch (t = 0) subproblem

Working backwards, the next step is to solve the control problem from the perspective of time 0, using the
solution from the previous step to construct a continuation function that links the two problems together.
The program (u1 (t); x1 (t))t2[0;T ] solves a …xed endpoint Pontryagin subproblem with continuation function
S(t; x(t)):
                                              Z   T     Z    1
                        max          : J1 =                           (t1 )dt1 f1 (t; u(t); x(t)) + (t)S(t; x(t)) dt;            (5)
                      u(t)t2[0;T ]            0          t

subject to
                                                         Z       T
                                        S(t; x(t)) =                 f2 (z; u2 (zjt; x(t)); x2 (zjt; x(t)))dz;                   (6)
                                                             t

                                                  dx(t)
                                                        = g1 (t; u(t); x(t)); for t 2 [0; T ];                                   (7)
                                                   dt

                                                             x(0) = x0 ; x(T ) = xT :                                            (8)

The payo¤ function f1 and the state function g1 are continuously di¤erentiable in their arguments. The
functions f1 and f2 could change form at the regime switch date, although in our applications f1 and f2
are the same. The state functions g1 and g2 change form at the switch date in our applications. Given
the Hamiltonian function,

                              Z     1
                    H1 =                (t1 )dt1 f1 (t; u(t); x(t)) + (t)S(t; x(t)) +                 1 (t)g1 (t; u(t); x(t));   (9)
                                t


the necessary conditions that must hold on the path (u1 (t); x1 (t))t2[0;T ] include @H1 =@u(t) = 0 and
d   1 (t)=dt   =    @H1 =@x(t).
     To summarize, the optimal control and state paths are (u2 (tjt1 ; x(t1 )); x2 (tjt1 ; x(t1 )))t2[t1 ;T ] for any t
after the realization of the random regime switch, conditional on the switch date t1 and conditional on the
stock of the state variable at that switch date x(t1 ). Similarly, (u1 (t); x1 (t))t2[0;T ] are the optimal control
and state paths for any t before the realization of the random switch. Hence, the path that is actually
followed, conditional on switch date t1 , is (u1 (t); x1 (t))t2[0;t1 ] and (u2 (tjt1 ; x1 (t1 )); x2 (tjt1 ; x1 (t1 )))t2[t1 ;T ] .
     Mangasarian (1966) shows that if g1 and g2 are linear in u(t) and x(t) and the integrands of J1 and


                                                                              7
J2 are concave in u(t) and x(t), then the necessary conditions are su¢ cient. Checking the concavity of
the integrand of J2 is standard. But checking the concavity of the integrand of J1 is more involved. This
is because the integrand of J1 depends on the optimal post-switch path. Thus, one must …rst derive the
post-switch solution (u2 (zjt; x(t)); x2 (zjt; x(t)))z2[t;T ] , which depends on x(t), and then insert this solution
into S before checking the concavity of the integrand of J1 .


2.3. Adding Structural Uncertainty

In addition to stochastic timing of the regime switch, we can easily allow for the possibility that the
structure of the new regime itself (the functional form of the post-switch state equation) is uncertain.
Adding in this second layer of uncertainty is relatively easy and requires just a few adjustments to the
previous method.9
       To add structural uncertainty, we assume that the uncertainty about the functional form of g2 is
summarized by the random variable            , with density ( ) and support on [0; 1], where ( ) is contin-

3. Application 1: Uncertainty about the Timing of Reform

The Social Security program in the U.S. faces severe long run solvency problems. The 2014 Social Security
Trustees Report projects that the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) trust fund will run out of
money in the year 2034. This means that over the coming decades either promised retirement bene…ts
must be cut or the payroll taxes used to fund them must be increased to keep the program solvent.
Gokhale (2013) estimates that an immediate tax increase of 3.1% of taxable wages, or an immediate
bene…t cut of 21%, will keep the OASI program solvent for the in…nite horizon.10
       While there is very little uncertainty about the need for reform, there is a great deal of uncertainty
surrounding its timing and structure. For instance, Sargent (2005) states: “We do not know today...how

   9
     Models with uncertainty about the structure of the new regime appeared in the early resource extraction literature
(Hoel (1978)) and then again in the more modern literature on technology adoption when future returns to technology are
stochastic (Hugonnier, Pelgrin and Pommeret (2006), Pommeret and Schubert (2009), Abel and Eberly (2012)).
  10
     If the disability component of the program is also included, then the required tax increase (assuming no behavioral
response) is 4% and the required bene…t cut is 23.9% as estimated in the 2013 Trustees Report.


                                                           8
subsequent political deliberations from shifting majority coalitions will render U.S. …scal policy coherent.”11
And even though the feasibility/optimality of various Social Security reforms have been widely studied
in macroeconomic models (e.g., McGrattan and Prescott (2014) and Kitao (2014) and the references
therein), this literature treats the timing and structure of reform as part of the household information
set. We focus on the primary question of measuring welfare costs to a single individual in an environment
where the timing and structure of reform are unknown.12
       We begin with an application of uncertainty only about the timing of reform because timing uncer-
tainty is more novel and less is known about its welfare consequences. In this scenario, the individual has
full information about the structure of reform, and we consider the possibility of either a bene…t cut or
a tax increase to render Social Security solvent occurring at an unknown date.


3.1. Notation

Age is continuous and is indexed by t. Households are born at t = 0 and pass away no later than t = T .
The probability of surviving to age t is            (t). Retirement and bene…t collection occur exogenously at
t = tR and labor is supplied inelastically.13 A given household collects wages at rate w(t) during the
working period.
       The government’s current policy is summarized by a tax rate on wage earnings and bene…t annuity
( 1 ; b1 ). There is public knowledge that the current policy is unsustainable. Therefore households know
that reform is coming, but they don’t know when. The reform date t1 is a random variable with probability
density     (t1 ) and support on [0; 1]. The post-reform policy is ( 2 (t1 ); b2 (t1 )). For now, we assume
households have full information about the nature of the reform, they just don’t know when it will kick
in.

  11
     This uncertainty arises not only from the reluctance of elected o¢ cials to propose unpopular reforms, but also from
ongoing disagreements over which reform option is most desirable. In particular, Democrats have tended to favor tax
increases, while Republicans have tended to favor bene…t cuts. For more detail, see recent legislation introduced by members
of Congress and summarized by the O¢ ce of the Chief Actuary, at www.ssa.gov.
  12
     While Bütler (1999) studies a particular example of the implications of uncertainty about both the timing and structure
of social security reform in Switzerland, our methodology allows us to handle any assumptions about the distributions of
both structural and timing uncertainty. This ‡exibility allows us to study timing and structural uncertainty in a general
way and to explore the distributional e¤ects of reform in the US.
  13
     People predominantly retire from the labor force at the early and normal eligibility ages (see Diamond and Gruber (1999)
among others). Fixing the retirement and collection dates allows us to parameterize the model to empirically reasonable
values for these choices while abstracting from natural and institutional complications that shape the incentives behind these
choices.

In this experiment the individual is still subject to a bene…t cut even after the retirement date. We will
consider grandfathering in an extension later in the paper.
   Consumption is c(t) and savings is k(t), which earns interest at rate r. The only constraints on savings
are that initial assets are zero and the individual cannot plan to leave behind debt at the maximum
lifespan, hence k(0) = 0 and k(T ) = 0.


3.2. Household Behavior

Period utility is CRRA, c(t)1             =(1       ), with relative risk aversion , and utils are discounted exponen-
tially at the rate of time preference . In Appendix B we provide a step-by-step derivation of the solution
to a dynamic stochastic utility maximization problem for which the date of reform is a random variable.
Here, we simply report the solution.
   The optimal pre-reform solution (c1 (t); k1 (t))t2[0;T ] solves the following system of di¤erential equations
and boundary conditions:
                             "                RT                                    #                             !           Z

                                                   dk(t)
                                                         = rk(t) + y1 (t)                    c(t);                                                   (13)

The individual follows this path up to the random reform date t1 . The optimal post-reform (after the
shock has hit) consumption path is

                                                    RT            r(v t1 ) y

Note that consumption after reform depends on the timing of reform and on the stock of assets at the
time of reform.


3.3. Welfare

The welfare cost of reform uncertainty is de…ned as the fraction of lifetime consumption that a young
individual facing reform uncertainty would be willing to give up to live in a separate world with no
reform uncertainty and endowed with his expected wealth over all possible realizations of reform dates.
Our welfare measure calculates the value of insuring against timing uncertainty because the no-risk world
guarantees the individual a deterministic consumption path that is based on expected wealth over di¤erent
realizations of the reform date. Our measure also nets out the cost of reform itself, allowing us to isolate
the cost of this speci…c example of policy uncertainty, as we already know from Kitao (2014) and others
that the welfare cost of reform itself is large.14
    To compute the welfare cost of policy uncertainty, consider the case where the individual faces no risk
(NR) about future taxes and bene…ts and is endowed at t = 0 with the present discounted value of her
expected future income. She solves

     Bütler (1999) studies the welfare cost of uncertainty about the timing of public pension reform in Switzerland. However,
she compares the welfare of individuals who must live with timing uncertainty to individuals who live in a separate world
with no timing uncertainty and with reform that is guaranteed to happen at the date that is mathematically expected in the
…rst world. While such a comparison captures important di¤erences in behavior, it does not pin down the cost of uncertainty.
Instead, it confounds changes in wealth with the e¤ects of uncertainty. In fact, it is theoretically possible to come to the
mistaken conclusion that uncertainty actually is a good thing in that environment (because it could increase an individual’s
expected lifetime wealth). For instance, if individuals in the …rst world are uncertain about when a bene…t cut will strike and
the mathematical expectation is that it will strike just before retirement, then individuals would want maximum variance
around this expectation in order to create the possibility of collecting full bene…ts for at least some portion of the retirement
period.

Notice that     S   is the fraction of consumption that the individual would be willing to give up to live in
a world with no timing uncertainty. By endowing the individual with expected wealth over all possible
reform dates, we are calculating how much the individual would be willing to pay to fully insure against
the e¤ects timing uncertainty.
   Our welfare metric               S   is similar to what Epstein, Farhi and Strzalecki (2014) call the “timing pre-
mium,” though in the models that they consider people are willing to pay for early resolution of uncer-
tainty because of the way utility is speci…ed (Epstein-Zin), even if the early information cannot be used to
reoptimize. This contrasts with our CRRA setting in which early resolution leads to welfare gains in part
because it allows for better optimization and smaller distortions to consumption/saving decisions. This
distinction arises because Epstein, Farhi and Strzalecki (2014) consider uncertainty over consumption
streams whereas we consider uncertainty over income streams. If we were to use Epstein-Zin utility then
our timing premium would be larger as it would capture both the distortions to consumption and saving
caused by late resolution of uncertainty and also the innate desire to know one’s consumption outcomes
in advance. Epstein, Farhi and Strzalecki (2014) remain skeptical, however, that people would be willing
to pay very much to know their consumption outcomes in advance if there is nothing that can be done
to change those outcomes.
   We compare our welfare measure for a saver to the cost when the individual does not save. In this
case, the individual sets consumption equal to disposable income in each period. Results for the non-saver
document how large the welfare cost of uncertainty about the timing of reform can be when the individual



                                                               12
does not respond at all to uncertainty. This contrasts with the baseline case where the individual forms
optimal consumption/saving plans to hedge the risk from reform uncertainty.
   For a non-saver, the welfare cost of living with uncertainty about the timing of reform                             N   solves the
same equation as before, but updated to include the no-saving constraint:

Note that we endow the individual in the no-risk world with a consumption path that equals his expected
disposable income at each age, which is a weighted average of y1 (t) and y2 (tjt1 ).
   For both savers and non-savers, our welfare measure follows in the tradition of calculating willingness-
to-pay to avoid uncertainty by comparing expected utility to utility from expected wealth. However, the
welfare cost of timing uncertainty could also be calculated by comparing expected utility to ex ante
expected utility in a world in which the date of Social Security reform is announced at time zero. In this
case, the individual knows that she will follow the optimal deterministic consumption path conditional
on a particular reform date, but ex ante she doesn’t know which deterministic path she will follow. This
alternative measure also captures the value of knowing the date of reform in advance, but it does not allow
the individual to insure her wealth across di¤erent realizations of the timing of reform. As a result, this
alternative measure is guaranteed by Jensen’s inequality to produce a smaller welfare cost from timing
uncertainty than our measure.
   Finally, with this alternative measure, non-savers would by de…nition experience zero welfare loss
from policy uncertainty. This is because non-savers follow the same consumption path no matter when
information about timing uncertainty is announced. In contrast, in our welfare calculations non-savers
prefer a world without uncertainty because their wealth is fully insured. While our results below emphasize
that non-savers have larger welfare losses than savers, this conclusion is reversed for this alternative welfare
measure.




                                                                13
3.4. Parameterization

The model is parameterized to capture individual income levels and survival probabilities over the life
cycle. The parameters to be chosen are the maximum lifespan T , the survival function                 (t), the exogenous
retirement date tR , the real return on assets r, the individual discount rate , the coe¢ cient of relative
risk aversion , the age-earnings distribution w(t), the probability density over reform dates (t1 ), and
policy parameters capturing tax rates and bene…t levels before and after reform f 1 ;                 2 (t1 );   b1 ; b2 (t1 )g.
       Our survival data come from the Social Security Administration’s cohort mortality tables. These
tables contain the mortality assumptions underlying the intermediate projections in the 2013 Trustees
Report. The mortality table for each cohort provides the number of survivors at each age f1; 2; :::; 119g,
starting with a cohort of 10,000 newborns. However, we truncate the mortality data at age 100, assuming
that everyone who survives to age 99 dies within the next year. In the baseline results, we assume
individuals enter the labor market at age 25, giving them a 75-year potential lifespan within the model.
In our baseline parameterization, we use the mortality pro…le for males born in 1990, who are assumed to
enter the labor market in 2015. For this cohort, we construct the survival probabilities at all subsequent
ages conditional on surviving to age 25.
       We normalize time so that the maximum age in the model is T = 1. Thus t = 0 in the model
corresponds to age 25, and t = 1 corresponds to age 100. Because the survival data are discrete (providing
the probability of surviving to each integer age), we …t a continuous survival function that has the following
form:
                                                       (t) = 1     tx :                                                     (22)

After transforming the survival data to correspond to model time, with dates on [0; 1], x = 3:28 provides
the best …t to the data.
                                                                                                      40
       The …xed retirement age is assumed to occur at age 65, which corresponds to tR =               75   in the model.15
We assume a risk-free real interest rate of 2.9% per year, which is the long-run real interest rate assumed
by the Social Security Trustees. In our model, this implies a value of r = 75 0:029 = 2:175. Estimates
of the individual discount rate        vary substantially in the literature, and values of          < r are necessary to

  15
     While the Social Security normal retirement age is 66 for cohorts born between 1943 and 1954, and will gradually rise
to 67 for cohorts born in 1960 and later, we use 65 as the exogenous retirement age for a few reasons. First, income data
from Gourinchas and Parker (2002) is only available until age 65. Second, many individuals stop working and claim an
actuarially reduced Social Security bene…t before the normal retirement age. Finally, this assumption can make our results
easier to compare with previous research, as many prior studies specify a retirement age of 65. This assumption will also be
important when setting replacement rates for individuals of di¤erent incomes. We use replacement rates corresponding to
retirement at age 65, rather than normal retirement age.

generate a hump shaped consumption pro…le in the model. In the baseline model we set                        = 0, although
we consider other values in robustness exercises. In the baseline calibration we also set                 = 3, with other
values considered for robustness.
       We import the individual income pro…le from Gourinchas and Parker (2002) with age normalized onto
model time [0; 1] and the maximum income normalized to one. The continuous-time wage function is
approximated by …tting a …fth-order polynomial to the discrete-time wage data:


                           w(t) = 0:697 + 1:49t        3:41t2 + 19:08t3             59:78t4 + 52:70t5 :                 (23)


Figure 1 shows the graphs of the wage pro…le and the survival probabilities.
       There is not much evidence about the distribution of possible reform dates, as this depends on
subjective expectations about the political process.16 Although the Social Security trust fund runs out
in 2034, uncertainty about reform may extend beyond that date. For example, policy makers may adopt
a temporary …x as 2034 approaches, postponing major reform even further into the future. Or, perhaps
policy makers will work together to address reform well in advance of 2034.17
       Given the lack of evidence, we consider a few di¤erent distributions of (t1 ) to understand the impli-
cations of the distribution of timing uncertainty on individual welfare. To begin, we assume that reform
is a Weibull random variable,

                                                         1
                                                  t1              (t1 = )
                                     (t1 ) =                 e                ; for t1 2 [0; 1]:                        (24)


We consider two special cases, the exponential density and the Rayleigh density. First, we assume                       =1
to generate a constant hazard rate of reform:

                                                                   e   t1 =
                                                       (t1 ) =                 :                                        (25)


Because it seems unlikely that the individual will totally escape reform, we calibrate this function by

  16
     We depart from a literature that assumes individuals don’t fully understand the existing rules of Social Security, while
the political process is stationary and the rules are knowable (Liebman and Luttmer (2014)). Instead, in our setting the
future of Social Security is unknowable.
  17
     The Health and Retirement Study (HRS), an ongoing panel survey of older Americans, regularly asks respondents to
rate the chances of a cut in Social Security bene…ts within the next 10 years. In the 2012 wave of the survey, the mean
subjective probability of a bene…t cut within the next 10 years is around 67%; however, there is much variance around this
value. The Survey of Economic Expectations also elicits information on household expectations about future Social Security
bene…ts (Dominitz, Manski and Heinz (2003), Manski (2004)). While this survey does document substantial uncertainty, it
does not speci…cally measure uncertainty about the timing of reform.



                                                                 15

assuming     1    e          = dt1 = 1%, which implies     =    1= ln 0:01.
   Alternatively, it is plausible that political pressure for reform will mount as the trust fund runs out
of money by 2034. For this reason we also consider a second calibration where the likelihood of reform
                                                                                            0
rises as the trust fund exhaustion date approaches. To capture this, we compute                 (t1 ) = 0 and set
t1 = (2034       2015)=75, which implies

                                                                    1

graphs of these two calibrations of (t1 ). We will report welfare calculations for both calibrations.
   The current Social Security policy ( 1 ; b1 ) in the model is parameterized to match the current policy
in the U.S. Consistent with our modeling in earlier sections, we focus only on retirement insurance (the
Old Age and Survivors, or OASI, program) and ignore disability insurance. The OASI payroll tax rate
(combined employer and employee shares) is          1    = 10:6%. The employee pays the full tax in our model
because labor is inelastic. Bene…ts b1 are chosen to match observed replacement rates for various income
groups.
   Social Security bene…ts are based on an individual’s Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME), cal-
culated as average monthly earnings, indexed for economy-wide wage growth, over the highest 35 years
of the individual’s career. A progressive bene…t formula is applied to AIME to arrive at an individ-
ual’s Primary Insurance Amount (PIA), the monthly bene…t payable if bene…ts are claimed at normal
retirement age. Claiming before normal retirement age— for example, at age 65, as we assume in our
model— results in an actuarial reduction to bene…ts. The progressive bene…t formula implies that the
replacement rate— the ratio of monthly bene…ts to AIME— falls with AIME.
   The Social Security Trustees Report publishes replacement rates for several stylized workers, each
earning a …xed multiple of the economy-wide average wage throughout their career. According to the
2013 Trustees Report, the very low income group, which has career-average earnings equal to 25% of the
economy-wide average wage, receives a replacement rate of 67.5% of AIME if bene…ts are claimed at age
65. The low-income group, which has career-average earnings equal to 45% of the economy-wide average
wage, has a replacement rate of 49.0% of AIME. The medium income group, which has career-average
earnings equal to the economy-wide average wage, receives a replacement rate of 36.4% of AIME. The
high income group, which has career-average earnings equal to 1.6 times the average wage, receives a



                                                           16
replacement rate of 30.1% of AIME. Finally, workers who earn the maximum taxable amount in each
year of their career receive a replacement rate of 24.0% of AIME. These replacement rates apply to the
year 2055, when the 1990 cohort turns 65. To compute pre-reform bene…ts, b1 , we apply these replacement
rates to the AIME for the normalized life-cycle income pro…le in our model, which is 0.92927.18
    For the policy experiments considered in this paper we assume that the reform will balance the Social
Security budget over the in…nite horizon. While the Social Security Trustees reports provide detailed
estimates of long-run funding shortfalls for the combined Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance
(OASDI) program, obtaining estimates for the OASI program alone is more challenging. Gokhale (2013)
estimates that the in…nite horizon OASI funding shortfall beginning in 2012 amounts to $15.9 trillion,
representing 3.1% of the present value of taxable wages over that period (which Gokhale estimates as
$505.7 trillion). Thus, with no behavioral response, a tax increase of 3.1 percentage points would be
needed to close the funding shortfall. Gokhale also estimates that a 21% bene…t reduction would be
required to eliminate the in…nite horizon shortfall.19
    To determine how the required bene…t cut and tax increase change if the government postpones
reform, we combine these estimates with the 75-year horizon estimates of taxable wages and bene…ts
provided in the 2012 Trustees Report. The Trustees Report estimates that the present value of taxable
wages over 2012-2086 is $341.5 trillion. Combined with Gokhale’s in…nite horizon estimate, this suggests
that the 2012 present value of taxable wages over 2087 through the in…nite horizon is $505.7 trillion -
$341.5 trillion = $164.2 trillion. If no changes are made before that point, the in…nite horizon shortfall
remains the same in 2012 present value, as funds would need to be borrowed to cover any shortfall over
2012-2086. Thus, the required tax increase in 2087 would be $15.9 trillion / $164.2 trillion = 9.7% of
wages. This calculation suggests that the required tax increase rises by 6.6 percentage points over 75
years (which coincides with the time elapsed between model time 0 and model time 1). Thus, a linear
approximation of the post-reform tax rate is          2 (t1 )   =   1   + 3:1% + 6:6%   t1 . Note that we ignore the
slight increase in the required tax hike between 2012 and 2015.
    For bene…t cuts, the 2012 Trustees Report estimates that the present value of OASI costs are $48.8

  18
     In computing AIME for our life-cycle model, we disregard wage indexation because the Gourinchas and Parker (2002)
real income pro…les are already adjusted not only for price in‡ation, but also for cohort and time e¤ects.
  19
     Gokhale’s estimate of the present value of taxable wages di¤ers somewhat from the estimate provided in the 2012
Trustees Report, which is $530.2 trillion. Of course, the required tax and bene…t adjustments could be much di¤erent in
a macroeconomic model that includes household behavioral responses and factor price responses to demographic and …scal
shocks. For instance, in Kitao (2014) the required tax increase is 6% and the required bene…t cut is 33%. Our welfare
costs go up when we feed bigger policy shocks such as these into our model. While the Trustees Reports take into account
behavioral responses in their estimates of the tax increase required to close the combined OASDI shortfall, they do not
provide similar estimates for OASI alone.



                                                           17
trillion over the following 75 years. The OASI unfunded liability as a share of these costs is 15.19%.
The Trustees report does not provide an estimate of the bene…t cut required to close the OASI 75-year
shortfall. However, the report notes that the combined OASDI program has 75-year unfunded liabilities
of $8.6 trillion, representing 15.23% of the present value of combined OASDI costs over the period and
requiring a 16.2% bene…t cut to eliminate.20 That is, the required bene…t cut is 1.064 (16.2% / 15.23%)
times the unfunded liability as a share of costs. If we assume that this ratio holds over any horizon,
Gokhale’s estimate of a 21% bene…t cut implies that the in…nite horizon unfunded liability amounts to
19.74% of costs, and that in…nite horizon costs are 15.9 trillion / 19.74% = $80.5 trillion. Thus, costs over
2087 through the in…nite horizon are $80.5 trillion - $48.8 trillion = $31.7 trillion. Unfunded liabilities
are $15.9 trillion / $31.7 trillion = 50.1% of this amount, suggesting that the required bene…t cut in 2087
is 1:064      50:1% = 53%. Since the required bene…t cut rises by 32 percentage points over 75 years, a
linear approximation of the new bene…t level is b2 (t1 ) = b1          (1    21%     32%     t1 ).
       By parameterizing tax increases and bene…t cuts in a realistic way that is consistent with available
evidence and actuarial projections, we are potentially understating the costs of uncertainty. We assume
that Social Security will continue to exist and that reforms will be modest, whereas in reality a large
portion of young households are not sure if Social Security will exist at all when they retire (Dominitz,
Manski and Heinz (2003)). For instance, Luttmer and Samwick (2012) elicit willingness to pay to remove
reform uncertainty by asking individuals to answer survey questions in which there is a non-trivial chance
that Social Security will be eliminated completely. Individuals in our model are not worried about such
radical reform risk and therefore our welfare costs may understate the costs associated with individuals’
perceived uncertainty about reform.
       As an initial pass, we consider two possible reforms:

         Full bene…t cut. An across-the-board reduction in bene…ts to b2 (t1 ) for all current and future
         retirees (no exemption for current retirees) and no change in taxes.

         Full tax increase. An across-the-board increase in the OASI tax rate to                2 (t1 )   for all taxpayers
         regardless of age and no change in bene…ts.

       We consider each reform separately and assume that individuals know which reform will occur, but
they are uncertain about the timing. The results from these scenarios clarify the intuition of how timing

  20
    It is not stated in the Trustees report whether this estimate assumes any behavioral response. We suspect the required
bene…t cut may also di¤er from the unfunded liability as a share of costs because not all costs are bene…t payments, and
because cutting bene…ts may a¤ect revenue via the taxation of bene…ts.


                                                           18
uncertainty in‡uences individual consumption and saving decisions. We will later consider the case where
individuals are also uncertain about the structure of reform, not knowing if it will be a bene…t cut, a tax
increase, or some combination of the two.


3.5. Results

The optimal consumption/saving rules have been solved analytically, up to an unknown constant c(0).
To simulate results we guess and interate on c(0) until the boundary constraints are satis…ed.
   The results for the bene…t cut and tax increase scenarios are plotted to gain intuition about the e¤ects
of uncertainty about the timing of reform. Figure 3 shows consumption pro…les over the life cycle for
the full bene…t cut experiment for an individual with average earnings who faces a constant hazard rate
of reform. Four pro…les are plotted: the optimal consumption path conditional on still being in the pre-
reform regime c1 ; a pair of optimal post-reform consumption paths, c2 , conditional on reform at t1 = 0:5
and t1 = 0:8 as examples; and the consumption pro…le from a world with no Social Security risk where
the individual is endowed upfront with expected lifetime income, cN R . The path the individual actually
follows is c1 up to the stochastic date of reform and then consumption drops to c2 . Although there are
many c2 paths, we only plot two possibilities for illustrative purposes. This …gure shows how uncertainty
about the timing of bene…t reform causes non-trivial distortions to consumption-saving decisions. If the
reform shock is realized early, then consumption falls below the level without Social Security risk, whereas
a later reform shock leaves consumption above the no-risk path.
   Figure 4 plots the same information but for the case of a tax increase, again for an individual with
average earnings who faces a constant hazard rate of reform. We show two hypothetical reform dates,
t1 = 0:2 and t1 = 0:5 as examples. Reform dates after retirement are not plotted because even though
reform may strike after retirement, there is no distortion to consumption since individuals no longer pay
Social Security taxes when they are not working. Similar to the case of a bene…t cut, consumption always
drops at the moment reform strikes.
   The drop in consumption in either scenario is the result of rational, forward-looking behavior in the
face of uncertainty. Reconsider Figure 3 and suppose the individual is standing just to the left of t = 0:8.
From this perspective, the individual knows the shock may happen at any time over the interval [0:8; 1]
and therefore bases consumption on that expectation, which is rational ex ante. But if the shock hits
at the next moment (i.e., at t = 0:8) then ex post the individual turns out to be a little poorer than
anticipated the moment before and hence consumption must be revised down. Individuals are always
surprised the moment reform occurs.

   Table 1 compares the welfare cost of timing uncertainty between individuals who save optimally and
those who do not save, for …ve di¤erent income groups. Comparisons are shown for the case of a bene…t
cut as well as the case of a tax increase. Recall that in this exercise we assume that the individual only
faces timing uncertainty and therefore knows the structure of reform in each case.
   Among those who save optimally, the welfare cost of timing uncertainty is just a few basis points
of total lifetime consumption. The exact value within this range depends on the income group and on
whether reform is a bene…t cut or a tax increase. In all cases, the magnitude of the welfare cost is
relatively small.
   We also …nd important distributional e¤ects as we look beyond the average individual. Focusing on
those who save optimally, uncertainty about the timing of a bene…t cut is more harmful to low income
individuals than to high income individuals. This is due to the progressively of bene…ts. For example,
Table 1 shows that, for the case of constant hazard rate of reform (Panel A), the very low income group
will experience a welfare loss that is more than 4 times larger than what is experienced by the highest
income group that maximizes their Social Security contributions in each year of work. This asymmetry
occurs because Social Security bene…ts are a larger share of total retirement income for the poor than for
the rich, and uncertainty over something important is going to be more costly. This result continues to
hold in Panel B when we replace the exponential distribution with one that peaks at 2034.
   But this distributional e¤ect reverses its sign for the case of uncertainty about the timing of a tax
increase. Essentially, now the progressivity argument works in the opposite way. Even though all income
groups pay the same tax rate, uncertainty about the tax rate is more costly for the rich because Social
Security bene…ts are smaller for them (relative to their wage) and hence they face uncertainty about a
larger portion of their wealth than do the poor. This result holds across both assumptions about the
distribution of reform shocks.
   The most interesting results are found in the comparison of savers to non-savers. In the case of a
bene…t cut, non-savers experience welfare costs that can exceed 1% of total lifetime consumption. This
is roughly 1 or 2 orders of magnitude larger than the costs to those who save optimally. Not knowing
when a bene…t cut will occur is very costly when bene…ts are the sole source of retirement income, and
simply having access to capital markets allows optimal savers to hedge away most of the timing risk. The
regressivity of timing uncertainty is reversed for non-savers. This reversal arises because replacement rates
are lower for high income groups. But comparisons across income groups is probably less interesting in
this case because income may be an important determinant of saving behavior.
   Timing uncertainty about a tax increase, however, imposes costs on non-savers that are in the same


                                                     20
ballpark as the costs imposed on savers. In both cases, the welfare cost of timing uncertainty is small.
This result holds for both assumptions about the distribution of reform shocks.


4. Application 2: Timing and Structural Uncertainty

Now we consider the case where both the timing and structure of Social Security reform are uncer-
tain. First we introduce notation and welfare, and then we compare simulated welfare costs from this
application to the previous application with only timing uncertainty.


4.1. Notation and Welfare

Let ~2 (t1 ) be the new tax rate that would be su¢ cient to balance the budget without any reduction in
bene…ts, and likewise let ~b2 (t1 ) be the new bene…t level that would balance the budget without a tax
increase. Of course, ~2 (t1 ) >   1   and ~b2 (t1 ) < b1 . But the new policy that the government actually chooses
is an uncertain, linear combination of these extremes. We will express the new tax policy as a function
of a continuous random variable                with density ( ) and support on [0; 1]:


                                           2 (t1 ;   ) =       1   + (~2 (t1 )             1 );                                    (27)

                                          b2 (t1 ; ) = b1              (1       )(b1       ~b2 (t1 ));                             (28)

4.2. Results

Table 2 augments the information in Table 1 to include the welfare costs of double uncertainty. For
those who save optimally, the welfare cost of double uncertainty is similar to the welfare cost under just
timing uncertainty only. And, as in the case with only timing uncertainty, the welfare cost experienced
by non-savers can be more than 1% of total lifetime consumption. Not knowing when or how reform
will occur is very costly when bene…ts are the sole source of retirement income. Having access to capital
markets allows optimal savers to hedge away much of the costly uncertainty that they face.
   Figure 5 shows the e¤ects of double uncertainty on consumption allocations over the life cycle of an
average earner facing a constant hazard rate of reform. As with previous …gures, we plot the optimal
consumption path given that reform has not yet happened, c1 , the consumption path corresponding to a
hypothetical world without reform risk, cN R , and many post-reform consumption pro…les c2 conditional
on reform striking at various dates. We show the following reform dates t1 2 f0:1; 0:2; :::; 0:8; 0:9g, and
we show just three particular realizations of the structure of reform   2 f0; 0:5; 1g for each of the reform
dates. Although our welfare calculations take into account that the timing (t1 ) and structure ( ) of reform
are continuous random variables, we plot just a few realizations to highlight the types of consumption
paths that individuals may experience.
   By showing some of the contingent consumption plans formulated by the individual, Figure 5 illus-
trates the breadth of the distortions to consumption caused by the presence of double uncertainty about
Social Security reform. For instance, the distortion to consumption in the middle of the retirement period
is especially severe. The positive consumption spikes result from the cases in which the individual draws a
full-tax-reform shock (with no bene…t cut). This is a positive shock to expected wealth during retirement
since the individual learns that there is no risk of a bene…t cut. Consumption drops in cases where the
individual draws a full-bene…t-reform shock, eliminating the hope of escaping bene…t reform.
   Whereas uncertainty about the timing of reform always triggers downward corrections in consumption,
with double uncertainty the consumption correction can be positive. This is because a tax increase is
good news for individuals near retirement or already in retirement. Now that they know their bene…ts
are safe, they scale up their consumption spending in response to the positive income shock.

5. Extensions

In this section we show how our results change when we alter certain assumptions. Unless we say
otherwise, we assume baseline parameterizations for the distributions of timing uncertainty (exponential
distribution) and structural uncertainty (uniform distribution).


5.1. Age and Wealth Heterogeneity

The parameterizations that we have considered so far are based on the expected utility of an individual
who enters the labor force in 2015 at age 25 with no assets. Of course, there are many other individuals
at di¤erent ages and levels of accumulated savings who face uncertainty about the future of the Social
Security system. This section evaluates how the welfare e¤ects of reform uncertainty depend on the age
and assets of the individual.
   We will use the same notation and methods as above, and we will intepret time zero as any arbitrary
older age. Let t0 2 (0; 1) be the fraction of the total lifespan that the individual has already lived. We
perform the following normalization of parameters in order to normalize the individual’s current age t0 to
zero, so that time runs on [0; 1] regardless of where in the life cycle the individual is currently standing.
First, we parameterize the retirement age tR as the fraction of the remaining total lifespan spent working.
Second, we estimate new survival functions        (t) on [0; 1] that use survival probabilities conditional on
surviving to the current age t0 . We …t the survival function             (t) = 1      tx to the appropriate cohort
in the underlying mortality data, e.g., 45 year olds in 2015 were born in 1970. Third, we modify the
wage distribution by replacing all t on the right-hand-side of w(t) with t^(t)            t0 + t(1   t0 ). Fourth, we
replace all t1 on the right-hand-side of (t1 ),   2 (t1 ),   and b2 (t1 ) with t1 (1   t0 ). In the case of (t1 ), we
also renormalize the height of the p.d.f. to ensure unit mass under the curve. We set                =   1= ln 0:01 as
before. Fifth, we set r = (1    t0 )   2:175.
   We consider the welfare costs for individuals beginning at age 45, 55, and 65 (model ages t0 =
0:27; t0 = 0:4; t0 = 0:53). In each case, we consider …ve levels of initial assets. For each age, the baseline
asset level is the assets that the individual in our initial exercise for a 25 year old worker would have
accumulated if reform has not hit by the older age, k1 (t0 ). Beyond this baseline level, we consider levels
of wealth of zero, half the baseline, twice the baseline, and three times the baseline. We also consider the
case of a non-saver at each age who by de…nition has zero wealth. For all cases, we consider the baseline
density function with a constant hazard rate of reform.
   Table 3 shows the results for the case of timing uncertainty over a bene…t cut. Each panel of the



                                                       24
graph shows results for one of the …ve income groups considered in the previous results. The …rst column
replicates the result for the 25 year old worker that begins with no assets for comparison. We …nd
that additional initial wealth holdings reduce the welfare cost associated with timing uncertainty as the
possible bene…t cut has less impact on the overall level of consumption for the individual. Moreover, older
individuals face larger costs associated with uncertain policy reforms. That is, as individuals are closer
to retirement, the potential of a future bene…t cut has greater costs for individuals as they are closer to
retirement. This is the case even though the distribution of reform has the same exponential distribution
as in the original results. The higher cost instead arises as retirement bene…ts become a larger portion of
an individual’s remaining lifetime income and the horizon to save more for retirement and hence mitigate
the costs is shorter. Indeed, for a 65 year old with no accumulated assets the cost of uncertainty about
the timing of reform is nearly 5% or remaining lifetime consumption. The costs are over 7.5% for a 65
year old non-saver.
    Table 4 shows the results for the case of timing uncertainty over a tax increase. In this case, wealth
still reduces the costs of uncertainty about the timing of reform, but older workers have lower costs as
they have a shorter remaining working life that could be subject to the tax. To highlight this intuition,
the welfare costs of 65 year old workers is exactly zero as they no longer face any uncertainty about their
future income stream.
    Finally, Table 5 shows the results for the case of double uncertainty about both the timing and
structure of reform. Here, as in the initial results, the distribution of the structure of reform between a
bene…t cut and a tax increase is uniform. The pattern of results is similar to the case of bene…t cuts with
higher levels of wealth reducing the cost of uncertainty and older ages having larger welfare e¤ects, but
the magnitude of the welfare costs do not increase by as much for older individuals. A 65 year old with
no wealth who saves optimally going forward has a welfare cost of nearly 3% of lifetime consumption
while the non-saver is nearly 3.5%.


5.2. Grandfathering

Up to this point, we have assumed that the individual never escapes reform risk. However, almost all
serious proposals to reform Social Security contain some element of grandfathering of older individuals
into the old regime.21 Here we assume the individual is exempt from the new regime and grandfathered
into the old regime if he survives to age tG 2 (0; 1). That is, after tG the individual is exempt from any

  21
     The only exception of which we are aware is the proposal to reduce the cost-of-living adjustments that Social Security
bene…ciaries receive by indexing bene…ts to the chained consumer price index.


                                                            25
reform.22 We can continue to use the same notation and methods, as long as we set

                                                             Z   1                  Z    tG
                          (t1 ) = 0 for t1 2 [tG ; 1], and           (t1 )dt1 = 1             (t1 )dt1 :              (34)
                                                             1                       0


      We set tG = 0:4 to re‡ect grandfathering at age 55, which protects older workers from experiencing a
bene…t cut just prior to retirement. We ignore the fact that grandfathering would require the bene…t cut
experienced by younger individuals to be larger. Table 6 reports results when reform is grandfathered for
the bene…t cut, tax increase, and double uncertainty cases with the exponential distribution of reform
dates. We …nd that grandfathering actually increases the cost of timing uncertainty relative to the results
without grandfathering for both the bene…t cut and tax reform cases. For double uncertainty, the welfare
costs are higher for an optimal saver but slightly lower for non-savers. When interpreting these …ndings,
recall that our measure of welfare only measures the cost of uncertainty about the timing and structure
of reform, while netting out the wealth e¤ects of the cost of reform itself. Therefore, individuals would
still prefer to live in a world with grandfathering as it increases their expected lifetime wealth, but
grandfathering actually increases the risks associated with the timing of reform because the individual
either experiences a full cut to bene…ts or no cut, with no chance of anything in between these extremes.
      This welfare measure is interesting for policy as it provides a fair comparison given the changes in
costs of di¤erent reform options, since grandfathering any policy change would be costly. Note that in all
cases, individuals know that reform will be grandfathered. While in reality almost all reform proposals
would grandfather those close to retirement, it is not clear how well individuals understand this. In the
2012 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a survey intended to be representative of older
Americans, respondents were asked about the probability of their own current or future Social Security
bene…t being cut in the next 10 years. Among individuals aged 55 and older, the mean response to this
question was 55 percent, and the 75th percentile response was 80%.


5.3. Extreme Political Risk

We have thus far used a uniform distribution over                    (the structural uncertainty parameter) in all of
our calculations for the double uncertainty case. This assumption implies that any particular convex
combination (compromise) between a full tax increase and a full bene…t cut is just as likely as any other
combination. This may be a reasonable starting assumption, but it could be the case that the structure
of reform will ultimately look more like the outcome of a tug-of-war contest between two political parties,

 22
      Actual reform proposals generally exempt individuals close to retirement from bene…t cuts but not from tax increases.


                                                             26
with one side winning completely and the other side losing, rather than a compromise.23
       In this subsection we assume that the structure of reform is uncertain and will be either all on the
tax side or all on the bene…t side, with no probability of a convex combination. We assume that these
two possibilities are equally likely. This maximizes the degree of policy uncertainty along the structural
dimension, which nearly doubles the welfare losses relative to the baseline with uniform structural uncer-
tainty. This is true for both savers and non-savers. To see this, compare the results in Table 7 to those
in Table 2.


5.4. Larger Tax and Bene…t Adjustments

The quantitative evidence from some theoretical macroeconomic models that include household behavioral
responses and factor price responses to demographic and …scal shocks suggests that the required tax
and bene…t adjustments could be much larger than what is estimated in the Trustees reports. Using
the estimates of the required tax increase and bene…t cut from Kitao (2014) as the base adjustment,
together with the same penalty for delay that we have been using throughout, gives the new tax rate

 2 (t1 )   =   1   + 6% + 6:6%     t1 and the new bene…t level b2 (t1 ) = b1            (1    33%      32%      t1 ). Table 8
shows how much larger the welfare costs of reform uncertainty can be under these larger tax and bene…t
adjustments.


5.5. Di¤erential Mortality

It is well known that low-income individuals su¤er from lower survival probabilities at all ages relative
to high-income individuals. We have recomputed our welfare analysis for the case of income-speci…c
survival functions based on Social Security administrative data provided in Chart 1 of Waldron (2013).
These data suggest that among 63 year old males, the death rate of the …rst, third, eighth and tenth
lifetime income deciles are, respectively, 2.6, 1.3, 0.8, and 0.6 times that of the average of the …fth and
sixth deciles.24 Based on this, we assume that throughout their lives, maximum earners face age-speci…c
hazard rates of dying that are 0.6 times those of average earners, high earners face age-speci…c hazard
rates that are 0.8 times those of average earners, low earners face age-speci…c hazard rates that are 1.3
times those of average earners, and very low earners face age-speci…c hazard rates that are 2.6 times those

  23
     See Baker et al. (2014) for a discussion of political polarization in recent years in American politics. Also see Davig and
Foerster (2014) for a similar discussion.
  24
     These relative death rates likely understate the extent of di¤erential mortality as the sample in Waldron (2013) excludes
disabled individuals, individuals who have not accumulated the 10 years of earnings required to qualify for Social Security,
and individuals who do not survive to age 63.



                                                              27
of average earners. (If scaling by these factors causes an age-speci…c hazard rate to exceed 1, that hazard
rate is set to 1).
   Allowing hazard rates to di¤er by income groups causes almost no change to our calculations of the
welfare costs of uncertainty about the timing of reform: the magnitude of the welfare cost is still about
the same; the fact that uncertainty is regressive continues to hold; and non-savers continue to experience
far bigger costs than savers.
   Perhaps the most surprising result is that di¤erential mortality does not undo the distributional
e¤ects. One may think that, because the regressivity of the uncertainty cost is driven by the progressivity
of Social Security bene…ts, including di¤erential mortality would undo our results since this would unwind
(or even reverse) the progressivity of Social Security. While Coronado, Fullerton and Glass (1999) show
that di¤erential mortality unwinds the progressivity of Social Security in a cross-sectional sense, it does
not unwind the progressivity in a longitudinal sense. At a moment in time, the ratio of aggregate
bene…ts collected by survivors to aggregate taxes paid by workers would tend to be low for segments
of the population with lower survival probabilities; but this has nothing to do with how a given worker
treats Social Security taxes and bene…ts in an expected utility (longitudinal) model. In such a model,
the progressivity of Social Security is only related to the bene…t-earning rule and not to mortality risk,
because the latter enters the model only though the discount factor in the utility function. Regardless of
their survival type, expected utility maximizers make an optimal consumption-saving plan that accounts
for the contingency that they survive until the maximum possible date. In other words, income ‡ows
(like Social Security) in the budget constraint of an expected utility maximizer are not discounted for
survival risk.


5.6. Preference Parameters

Tables 9 and 10 provide alternative estimates of the welfare cost under di¤erent assumptions about the
preference parameters. Not surprisingly, if we increase the degree of risk aversion, the cost of reform
uncertainty can go up signi…cantly. In Table 9 we report results for the case of      = 5 (recall that the
baseline value was   = 3). And in Table 10 we report results for     = r = 2:9% per year (recall that the
baseline value was   = 0).




                                                    28
6. Conclusion

The long-term insolvency of the Social Security system makes it di¢ cult to plan and save for retirement
because individuals do not know their future bene…t levels or tax rates. This paper studies how policy
uncertainty about the timing and structure of Social Security reform in‡uences individual decision making
and welfare. We solve and simulate optimal consumption/saving decisions in a setting with uncertainty
about the timing and structure of a one-time Social Security reform shock. Optimal planning in the face of
these two layers of policy uncertainty requires that households compute a contingent consumption/saving
plan for every combination of the realization of the timing and structure of reform. Then households
must recursively embed these contingent plans into an ex ante problem that assigns a continuation value
to asset holdings based on the probabilities of the many contingencies.
   We use our model to quantify the cost of policy uncertainty about the timing and structure of Social
Security reform. We …nd that if individuals save optimally, then the welfare cost amounts to only a few
basis points of total lifetime consumption. Optimal foresight/planning allows the individual to hedge
away much of the welfare costs of policy uncertainty. However, at the other extreme, individuals who do
not save experience welfare costs that can exceed 1% of their total lifetime consumption.

Appendix A: Proof of Necessary Conditions

Step 1. Solve the post-reform (t = t1 ) subproblem:
     This step of the backward induction procedure is a standard Pontryagin problem. The optimal
control and state paths after the switch is realized must solve a standard deterministic control problem.
We denote the solution to this subproblem (u2 (tjt1 ; x(t1 )); x2 (tjt1 ; x(t1 )))t2[t1 ;T ] , where the extra notation
is meant to convey the dependence of the solution on the switch date t1 and on the state variable at that
date x(t1 ). The last part of Step 1 is strictly for convenience: we take this solution and change the time
dummy t to z, and change the switch point t1 to t and write (u2 (zjt; x(t)); x2 (zjt; x(t)))z2[t;T ] . Thus we
have the optimal control and state paths for all points in time z greater than switch point t. This change
of dummies is innocuous but proves to be very helpful below in the process of linking the subproblems
together though the continuation functional in the next step.
Step 2. Solve the pre-reform (t = 0) subproblem:
     This step requires a little more explanation. The purpose of this step is to …nd the optimal paths
for the control and state before the realization of the switch. Hence, using the solution from Step 1, the
objective functional is

                                      Z   t1                                      Z   T

where S(t1 ; x(t1 )) is the continuation value or continuation function,

                                                            Z    T

                                                                t1

               RT
and likewise    0     (t1 )S(t1 ; x(t1 ))dt1 is the continuation functional. The constraints are

                                               dx(t)
                                                     = g1 (t; u(t); x(t)); for t 2 [0; T ] ;                                                 (A4)
                                                dt

                                                                                34
                                                                 x(0) = x0 , x(T ) = xT .                                               (A5)

Note that the control and state variables are de…ned over the entire planning interval because the switch
could happen at any time on this interval, and hence the pre-switch problem amounts to choosing a path
for these variables over the full interval. The marginal valuation of the state variable re‡ects the fact
that the switch could happen at any moment in time, and hence the entire timepath of the state variable
is relevant in determining the continuation value during the second stage. The solution to the above
problem is the one that will be followed up to the random switch point.
   This appears to be a non-standard control problem, but with some algebra we can convert it into a
standard one for which the standard Maximum Principle applies. To make progress, change the dummy
of integration in the second integral in J1 from t1 to t, and also change the dummy in the continuation
functional from t to z. Now we restate the objective functional as

                                             Z       T   Z   t1                                              Z    T
                  max           : J1 =                                   (t1 )f1 (t; u(t); x(t))dtdt1 +               (t)S(t; x(t))dt   (A6)
                u(t)t2[0;T ]                     0       0                                                    0
                                                                         Z   1Z T
                                                                 +                       (t1 )f1 (t; u(t); x(t))dtdt1 ;
                                                                          T     0


where
                                                             Z       T
                                  S(t; x(t)) =                           f2 (z; u2 (zjt; x(t)); x2 (zjt; x(t)))dz:                      (A7)
                                                                 t

This innocuous change of variables is helpful because it allows us to write the continuation function S as
a function of x(t). In doing so, u2 (zjt; x(t)) and x2 (zjt; x(t)) now take on the interpretation of the optimal
control and state variables for all points in time z that are beyond the switch date t and conditional on
x(t).
   Changing the order of integration in the …rst term in J1 , along with applying Fubini’s Theorem to
the third term in J1 , causes a more manageable Pontryagin problem to emerge. Let us now restate our
problem one last time

                                         Z   T           Z       1

subject to
                                                             Z       T
                                  S(t; x(t)) =                           f2 (z; u2 (zjt; x(t)); x2 (zjt; x(t)))dz;                      (A9)
                                                                 t

                                             dx(t)
                                                   = g1 (t; u(t); x(t)); for t 2 [0; T ];                                               (A10)
                                              dt


                                                                                    35
                                                   x(0) = x0 ; x(T ) = xT :                                                  (A11)

This reformulated objective functional has an intuitive interpretation. The …rst term in the integrand
gives the payo¤ of u(t) and x(t) through the function f1 (t; u(t); x(t)), weighted by the probability that
the random switch will occur sometime after t. The second term gives the payo¤ of holding x(t) through
the continuation value S(t; x(t)), weighted by the density function (t). Thus, the …rst payo¤ term f1 is
weighted by one minus the c.d.f. because this payo¤ is relevant as long as the switch comes later than
t, whereas the second payo¤ term S is weighted by the p.d.f. because this payo¤ is relevant only at the
switch point. The standard Maximum Principle can be applied to this reformulated subproblem. We
denote the solution to this subproblem (u1 (t); x1 (t))t2[0;T ] . This is the solution path for all t before the
realization of the random switch.

This is the optimal consumption path after the reform shock has hit.
   Anticipating our method for solving the pre-reform subproblem, we will need to change the time
dummies: now think of t as the reform date and z as any time after the reform date. Thus, rewrite the
solution as
                                                              RT          r(v t) y

Step 2. Solve the pre-reform (t = 0) subproblem:
   Next we solve the t = 0 subproblem,
