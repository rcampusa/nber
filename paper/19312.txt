                                              ABSTRACT

Household investment in preventative health products is low in developing countries even though
benefits from these products are very high. What interventions most effectively stimulate demand?
In this paper, we experimentally estimate demand curves for health products in Kenya, Guatemala,
India, and Uganda and test whether (1) information about health risk, (2) cash liquidity, (3) peer effects,
and (4) intra-household differences in preferences affect demand. We find households to be highly
sensitive to price and that both liquidity and targeting women increase demand. We find no effect
of providing information, although genuine learning occurred, and we find no evidence of peer effects,
although subjects discussed the product purchase decision extensively.

1. Introduction
        Over ten million children in developing countries die each year, many by diseases which could
be avoided by simple preventative health investments (Jones et al. 2003). Many studies have shown
that investment in preventative health products yields enormous health benefits in developing
countries. 1 Despite these benefits, investment in preventative health products is generally low among
poor households and tends to fall off rapidly at even small positive prices (i.e. Dupas 2009; Cohen and
Dupas 2010; Dupas 2013; Ashraf, Berry, and Shapiro 2010). Why does investment in preventative
health remain low when benefits are high? In this paper, we present results from a novel set of field
experiments designed to explore the relative importance of various factors that potentially influence
the demand for preventative health products.
        We consider four main factors which have been identified in other research as possible
determinants of either the level or the elasticity of the demand curve for health products. First,
households may lack health information: they may not be fully aware of the health risks they face, or
of the role that a product can have in mitigating such risks. Indeed several studies reveal positive
effects on health behavior from informing households about the benefits of certain types of sickness
prevention. For example, Cairncross et al. (2005) and Luby et al. (2004, 2005) show large behavioral
effects of intensive education campaigns on hygiene, while Jalan and Somanathan (2008) and
Madajewicz et al. (2007) find that informing households about fecal and arsenic water contamination,
respectively, influenced them to use alternative water sources and purification technology. Second,
households may lack liquidity. This could be because they are credit constrained (i.e. Tarozzi et al.,
2013; Devoto et al., 2012), because they lack a secure place to save money (i.e. Dupas and Robinson,
2013a), or because they do not save as much as they planned to for behavioral reasons (i.e. Ashraf et
al. 2006; Duflo et al., 2011). Peer effects may constitute a third influence, creating situations where
multiple, Pareto-rankable equilibria may exist, and where sub-optimal levels of health product
adoption are possible if there are few early adopters. Depending on the characteristics of the product,
such peer effects may tend to increase investment (i.e. Dupas 2013) or decrease it (i.e. Miguel and
Kremer 2007). Fourth, numerous studies have shown that there may be intra-household conflict in
spending on health (particularly for children). For example, Thomas (1990) and Duflo (2003) provide




1A partial list of technologies with high returns includes chlorine for water (Fewtrell et al. 2005; Arnold and Colford
2007), insecticide-treated bed nets (Lengeler, 2004), and iron supplementation (Thomas et al., 2006; Bobonis et al. 2006).
                                                             1
evidence that women are more likely to invest in children’s health than men, suggesting that
targeting preventative health products at female household heads may be important. 2
        To test these different hypotheses, we perform a set of field experiments in four countries –
three smaller studies in Guatemala, India, Uganda, conducted in 2008, and a larger study in Kenya
conducted in 2010. In each site, we follow recent papers to estimate experimental demand curves by
providing households with coupons for randomly selected discounts that could be redeemed in
exchange for a given health product. 3
        Our paper contributes to the existing literature in three significant ways. First, while there
have been a number of studies of single factors that may affect health product demand in individual
countries, our study in Kenya is among the first to simultaneously test multiple hypotheses to
determine which factors have the greatest relative impact on demand. Second, because we carry out
tests on three different kinds of preventative health products, we are better able infer from our results
as applying to health products more generally. Finally, our findings on the effect of information and
price have an added degree of external validity since we test these factors in all four of our country
sites, providing greater confidence that results are not highly context-dependent.
        Our main experiment in Kenya was conducted among 999 households in 2010 and focused on
a particular health technology which has not been examined in previous studies, but which could have
potentially significant health impacts: rubber shoes for children. One important way shoes may
improve health is by preventing hookworm infection, which is typically transmitted when a person’s
skin comes into contact with contaminated soil (usually through bare feet). While worms can be easily
treated after infection (see Miguel and Kremer, 2004), initial infection can be avoided by wearing
shoes. 4 Though the effect of deworming is an open question on a global scale, our main study takes
place in a region in Kenya in which deworming has been shown to have important short- and long-
term impacts (Miguel and Kremer, 2004; Baird et al., 2011), and substantial spillovers for young
children (Ozier, 2011). 5 While we did not perform parasitological tests for worms, self-reported

2 Dupas (2011) provides an excellent and more amplified review of these issues.
3 See, for example, Cohen and Dupas (2010), Dupas (2009), Kremer and Miguel (2007) and Ashraf et al. (2010).
4 Though there are no randomized controlled trials on the effect of shoe wearing that we are aware of, several non-

experimental studies show that regular shoe usage is associated with reduced hookworm infection when controlling for
other risk factors (Phiri et al. 2002, Erosie et al. 2002). This seems plausible given the transmission pathway for the
disease.
5 Recent work by Taylor-Robinson et al. (2012), suggests that the benefits of deworming campaigns may not be

substantial. The authors synthesize 42 randomized control trials of deworming efforts .and conclude that there is
insufficient evidence of consistent beneﬁt on nutrition, hemoglobin, school attendance or school performance. Nonetheless,
worms are likely a major problem in this part of Kenya given these earlier studies.

                                                            2
infection was quite high: Respondents reported that 23% of their children had worms in the past year.
While much of this is due to poor sanitation, low shoe usage is also a major risk factor. In our sample,
only 17% of children owned shoes and a smaller percentage wore them regularly. In this geographical
context, preventing infection by wearing shoes is likely to have a substantial direct health effect, as
well as a positive spillover effect on others. 6
        Our Kenya study carried out the following set of experimental treatments in conjunction with
our basic price treatment. To measure the impact of information, we provided a randomly selected
subset of households with an information script on the dangers of worm infection, transmission
pathways, and on the importance of wearing shoes in hookworm prevention. To assess the role of
liquidity constraints, we gave households a randomly determined amount of cash. 7 In order to test for
peer effects, we geographically stratified the intensity of our low-price treatments to ascertain
whether households surrounded by heavy adoption are more likely to purchase the shoes. We are also
able to use random variation to examine whether information spilled over to the neighbors and other
peers of treated households. To examine whether demand varied by parental gender, we randomly
selected either the husband or wife (among married couples) for participation. This person was the
one to receive the coupon, cash, and information script.
        An important result from our set of experiments is that, despite the importance often given to
information dissemination in health campaigns in developing countries, we find that information
alone has no impact on the ultimate purchase decision. We show that while the informational script
substantially increased knowledge about worms, this did not translate into increased demand. Our
estimates are precise enough that we can rule out large effects, and the results are not specific to
Kenya: we find no effect of information in Guatemala and Uganda, and some mixed evidence in India.
These results suggest that information alone is unlikely to be a panacea for underinvestment in
preventative health products. We also do not find any evidence that peer effects play a significant role
in household purchases of the shoes.
        By contrast, we find strong evidence that liquidity is important. Increasing the cash payment
from zero to the mean payout in the experiment (35 Kenyan shillings, or US $0.47) increases
redemption by approximately 8 percentage points. This is roughly equivalent to an 8 Kenyan shilling


6 While preventing hookworm infection might be the most important health benefit of shoes, it is not the only one.
Wearing shoes reduces foot injuries and the chance of infection from such injuries.
7 The cash payment was very small relative to lifetime income. The average payout was 35 Ksh, relative to weekly income

of 900 Ksh and asset ownership of around 23,000 Ksh (see Table 1). Thus, the payout had a negligible effect on household
income and should only have affected cash-on-hand.
                                                           3
(Ksh) reduction in the price, or about 9.4% of the 85 Ksh retail price. This result implies that credit or
liquidity constraints are an important limiting factor in health investment.
       We also find that women are more likely to redeem their coupons (by about 9 percentage
points). This corresponds to roughly a 9.5 shilling reduction in price, or 11% of the retail price. This
result is closely related to earlier studies on intra-household investment such as Thomas (1990), who
shows that the propensity to invest in children increases more strongly with female than male income,
and Duflo (2003) who uses an exogenous change in pension eligibility in South Africa and finds
similar results. However, our study is different because the experiment did not change relative
incomes (and by extension, intra-household bargaining power). Instead, the experiment only varied
which spouse received the coupon. This result suggests that the flow of information within the
household may be limited. In this context, it appears that mothers value health investment in children
more than fathers, and that there is intra-household conflict over the allocation of resources between
health investment in children and other expenditures. Increasing investment in children appears to
increase the mother’s welfare, but may increase her husband’s welfare by less, or even reduce it. Thus,
if the husband receives the coupon, he may not choose to redeem it and withhold knowledge of it from
his wife. This result is similar to Ashraf (2009), who finds evidence of intra-household communication
barriers in a field experiment on savings in the Philippines.
       While credit constraints and targeting women are therefore important, ultimately these effects
are limited relative to the effect of price. About 78% of the variation in health-product purchase is
explained through price variation alone, overshadowing liquidity and gender effects. Price was also by
far the dominant factor in the smaller studies in Guatemala, India, and Uganda.
       Our results have several important policy implications. First, as in Devoto et al. (2013),
Tarozzi et al. (2013) and others, our results suggest that providing credit to cash-constrained
households could increase investment. Another alternative might be to provide people with savings
products geared towards health. For example, Dupas and Robinson (2013b) experiment with several
simple savings mechanisms and find that providing even the simplest savings technology (a box with
a lock) increased investment in preventative health by 68%. Second, in line with many other papers,
our results suggest that targeting interventions at women are more likely to positively affect
investment in child health. Third, our results also suggest that simple information campaigns are
unlikely to manufacture additional demand for health products. While intensive and potentially very
costly educational interventions in the spirit of, for instance, Cairncross et al. (2005) or Luby et al.
(2004, 2005) might be effective in stimulating demand, less involved interventions are unlikely to

                                                    4
have much impact. Finally, price is by far the biggest determinant of investment: a major reason for
low investment in preventative health products is simply that low-income households are unwilling to
pay high prices for them. Thus the potential subsidization of preventative health products, on
externality grounds, is clearly an implication of our research. 8

2. Experimental Design, Kenya
2.1. Background
Worldwide, over 2 billion people are infected with soil-transmitted helminths (STHs), the most
common of which include hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm (Hotez et al., 2007). Such infections
are very prevalent in Western Kenya, where this study takes place. 9 School-aged children and
pregnant women are especially vulnerable to STH infection. While mild infection typically has limited
health consequences, more severe infections can have effects on morbidity, and are also suspected to
increase vulnerability to other illnesses, such as malaria, HIV, tuberculosis, and anemia. 10 A number
of studies have demonstrated important health and education effects of reducing worm infections
(Miguel and Kremer, 2004; Baird et al., 2011; Ozier, 2011; Bleakley, 2007).
        Once infected with hookworm, children can be dewormed through the use of the relatively
inexpensive drug albendazole. Another pathway to reduce worm infection is to prevent children from
getting infected in the first place. When an infected person defecates in the soil, hookworm eggs hatch
and develop into larvae, which are able to live in the contaminated ground for up to a month before
requiring a human host to survive (Brooker et al., 2006). Hookworm helminths are most commonly
contracted through the skin (typically through bare feet), after which they migrate into the
circulatory system, passing through the trachea and on to the esophagus where they are swallowed
and passed into the intestines (Bethony et al., 2006). Thus, in areas where people do not have access to
pit latrines or flush toilets, hookworm is likely to be a problem.
        An important way to prevent hookworm infection is to limit skin contact with infected soil.
Since infection is often through the feet, the simplest technology to prevent infection is to wear shoes.

8 It is also possible that demand for any particular health product is muted because households face competing risks. If so,
demand might be increased by complementary health investments.
9 In a study conducted in the Rongo district of Western Kenya, Riesel et al. (2010) found that 30% of children between the

ages of 2 and 18 were infected with hookworm alone, and 68% were infected with at least one hookworm, roundworm, or
whipworm parasite. Similarly, Pullan et al. (2011) estimate that 54% of the population of Busia (the district of study)
resides in a STH hyperendemic area, while the combined STH (i.e. hookworm, roundworm, and whipworm) prevalence
rate across Western province is 80.7%.
10 See Hotez et al. (2007) for a comprehensive discussion of the current medical literature..



                                                             5
Several studies have documented a strong correlation between regular shoe-wearing and a decreased
incidence of worms. For instance, Phiri et al. (2002) and Erosie et al. (2002) estimate worm infection
odds ratios of 7.1 and 1.8, respectively, to regular shoe wearing among school children in Malawi and
Ethiopia (while controlling for other risk factors). While these studies cannot document a causal
relationship between the lack of shoes and incidence of STH infection, the findings suggest that
wearing shoes should reduce infection given the transmission pathway.
        While there are obvious non-health benefits to wearing shoes, the public health evidence
suggests that, overall, shoes are likely to have large direct effects on health (not only by preventing
hookworm infections, but also by keeping children clean and by preventing potentially very painful
foot injuries). In addition, the social return to shoe-wearing will be even higher because of spillovers
to other individuals living nearby. In our sample, health is a major reason that people report for why
they wear shoes; in our data, 74% reported health as the most important reason to buy shoes while
26% reported that it is to have children properly dressed. Similarly, 76% and 54% list worm and
injury prevention, respectively, as reasons to purchase shoes. Another 43% report keeping children
clean as a reason (which can be related to health as well). 11

2.2 Sampling
        Our main experiment was conducted in the Busia and Samia Districts of Western Kenya from
February to May, 2010. Busia is a rural area near the Ugandan border with an estimated population of
about 44,000 (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2001).
        In our sample, parents reported that 23% of their children had a worm infection in the
previous year (Table 1). This is due in part to the fact that shoe ownership is so low: parents report
that only 17% of children own shoes, and an even smaller proportion of children were actually
observed to be wearing shoes by an enumerator during home visits (13%).
        There are several types of shoes available in Western Kenya. The most expensive are dress
shoes, which cost about 750 Kenyan shillings (US$10) per pair. 12 These types of shoes are typically
worn by adults or by children on more formal occasions, such as going to church. They are far less
likely to be worn around the home by children, where worm infection is probably most likely to take
place. A more common type of shoe is open-toed rubber shoes (flip-flops or rubber sandals), which are

11 Conceivably, households could instead avoid worms by treating their children with albendazole, which costs about US
$0.70 at local pharmacies and which needs to be taken every 6 months. Since shoes cost about $1.13, and assuming shoes
last 1 year, then the shoes would have to prevent 80% as many worm infections as albendazole to be cost-effective solely
on health costs. Note, however, that this is a conservative estimate since shoes have other benefits.
12 The exchange rate was roughly 75 Ksh to $1 during the sample period.

                                                            6
less expensive, costing about 85 Kenyan shillings (US$1.13) per pair at retail prices, and which are
more likely to be worn around the home. For this reason, we focused on the latter product for this
study. 13 While open-toed shoes as these might be less effective than dress shoes, if worn regularly
they should presumably limit infection through skin contact with the soil or when using the latrine.
        To obtain as representative a sample of households as possible, a door-to-door census was
conducted with 1,547 households in two villages located roughly 11 kilometers apart (Ikonzo and
Bhukulungu). The census collected basic information, including whether the household had a male or
female head, the number of children in the household, and the GPS location of the household. With
this data, we created 51 geographic clusters based on the GPS coordinates, and randomly selected
1,069 households for project participation, stratified by geographic cluster. We were able to interview
999 of these (93.4%). 14

2.3. Experimental Treatments
        We implemented four main experimental treatments, all cross-cut against each other (see
Appendix Figure A1 for the experimental design and Appendix Table A2 for the sample sizes in each
treatment cell). All treatments were conducted after administering a baseline survey (discussed
below), and obtaining informed consent. First, we estimate an experimental demand curve by
implementing a methodology based on Kremer and Miguel (2007), Cohen and Dupas (2010), Dupas
(2009), and Ashraf, Berry, and Shapiro (2010). In particular, we visited households and provided them
with a coupon offering a random discount on the shoes. The market price at the time was about 85
Ksh ($1.13), and we provided households with coupons for 5, 15, 25, 35, 55, or 65 Ksh. Coupons were
valid for a period of about 2 months.
        Second, to measure the impact of information on health investment, we randomly selected half
of the households to receive an information script on the symptoms of worms, transmission pathways,
and on several strategies to prevent infection, including wearing shoes, using pit latrines, and
hygiene. 15 In addition to its emphasis on prevention, the script also stressed the dangers of untreated
hookworm infection in children (anemia in particular) and the accompanying issues of growth
retardation and delayed cognitive development. We used a script, rather than a more involved
educational seminar, because results from our earlier studies in Guatemala, India, and Uganda



13 The shoes were too small to be worn by adults and therefore could only be used by children.
14 Appendix Table A1 shows attrition by treatment status. As can be seen, attrition appears to be orthogonal to treatment.
15 The script can be found on the authors’ websites.

                                                            7
suggested that a script had similar impacts to a seminar (as we will discuss later). In addition, using
the script made it easier to randomize at the individual level.
        Third, to measure the role of liquidity, we provided households with randomly varying cash
payments. As part of our baseline survey, we elicited risk and time preferences for all households
using standard laboratory techniques. For the risk preference questions, households were given a
series of choices in which they could decide how much to invest (out of 40 Ksh or 100 Ksh) in an asset
which paid out three times the amount invested with probability 0.5 and nothing with probability 0.5.
For the time preference questions, households were given the option of accepting 40 Ksh immediately
or a larger amount in the future.
        To incentivize truth-telling, we implemented a Becker-Degroot-Marschak elicitation
mechanism in which one of the questions was randomly selected for payout. Though all questions had
a positive probability of being picked, the odds of being a lower-stakes question were higher. This was
implemented by picking a numbered piece of paper out of a bag, which indicated the question that
would be paid out. If a risk question was picked, a colored ball was drawn to determine whether the
amount invested would be tripled or lost and the respondent was given his money. If a time
preference question was picked and the respondent chose to take the smaller amount in the present,
he was paid immediately. If he chose to take the larger amount in the future, he was revisited later to
receive the payout. To minimize the need to revisit households and to maximize the chance that
households got cash immediately, the odds of picking a risk preference question were higher. 16 Our
empirical strategy is based on the fact that, conditional on risk and time preferences, the cash payout
is random. We can therefore use variation in the amount paid out to estimate the effect of liquidity on
purchase (while controlling for risk and time preferences).
        Fourth, to measure whether there are differences within the household in the willingness to
invest in health technology in households with both a female and male head, we randomly selected
either the husband or the wife for the intervention. 17
        Finally, we can causally estimate externalities using the experimental variation in the
treatments. For any given pre-existing social group, it is random how many people in that group
received the script, lower-priced coupons, or any of the other experimental treatments. Thus, by
16 Ultimately, only 1% of households were selected for a time preferences question for which they elected to wait – the
remaining 99% received cash immediately.
17 If both spouses were present, enumerators would ask to interview the sampled respondent privately. However, if the

other spouse insisted on listening to the survey, he was not prevented from doing so. This occurred 14.5% of the time. As
might be expected, we find some evidence that such households were less responsive to the gender treatment, though the
difference is statistically insignificant. It is likely, however, that the spouse being present attenuates the gender
differences.
                                                            8
random chance, the intensity of treatment varies within any social network. We have two measures of
social networks. The first is geography (as measured by GPS location), as in Dupas (2013).
Furthermore, to create additional variation, we stratified intensity by geographic cluster (so that the
variance across clusters exceeds that obtainable by random chance). Second, at baseline, we asked
people to identify the three people whom they spoke with most often, and matched these names to
their assigned treatment group (if they were in the study area). Of the 966 people willing to give the
name of at least one contact, we matched 68.9% of the named contacts to our census list. We therefore
estimate network effects by comparing the probability of purchase across people with randomly
varying treatment intensities among their friends or neighbors.

3. Data
        There are three main pieces of data that we use to evaluate the program. First, at baseline, we
administered a background survey to all sampled households. In addition to standard demographic
questions, we collected information on child health, worm exposure, and shoe ownership. We also
collected information on household knowledge of worms, transmission pathways, and prevention
strategies at the end of the survey. 18 As this was collected after reading the script for those sampled
for it, this allows us to test treatment-control differences in knowledge at the time of administration.
We use the follow-up survey discussed below to measure retention over the project period.
        After the survey, we paid households their random cash payout and gave them a coupon which
could be redeemed at a local shop for the price indicated. The shops were located in market centers
that households would typically visit regularly for shopping (approximately 1.5 kilometers away from
the average household). The coupon was pre-printed with the household’s ID number on it, so that
any redeemed coupon could be matched to our household data. We hired an enumerator to supervise
the redemption and maintain a log containing the name of the person redeeming the coupon, the
number of coupons redeemed at one time, and the sizes of the shoes purchased. We rely on these
administrative records from the shop to examine purchase decisions.
        Lastly, we conducted a follow-up survey with 379 randomly selected households once the
redemption period had ended (about 3 months after the first coupons had been given out). 19 The


18Note that the worm knowledge questions were asked in an open-ended way (that is, the codes were not read out).
19Participation in the follow-up appears to be orthogonal to treatment in the full sample (see Appendix Table A1, column
3). Within the subsample of married households (Column 4), however, households receiving a price of 25 or 35 Ksh are
somewhat overrepresented, while households where the husband was sampled for treatment are somewhat less
represented. The differences are small, however, and are unlikely to much affect our follow-up results since we use that
                                                           9
follow-up survey included questions on shoe usage, as well as the same module used to measure worm
knowledge in the baseline. In addition, after some qualitative piloting, we added in a number of
questions about why people redeemed their coupons, which we use to support our main empirical
findings.


4. Empirical Methodology
         Since all treatments were randomized, we can obtain an unbiased effect of each of the main
experimental effects on the purchase of shoes with the following specification:
                                      65

                               𝑌𝑖 = � 𝛽𝑗 𝑃𝑖𝑗 + 𝛾𝑆𝑖 + 𝛿𝐶𝑖 + 𝜇𝐺𝑖 + 𝑋′𝑖 𝜙 + 𝜀𝑖                                                 (1)
                                     𝑗=5


where 𝑃𝑖𝑗 = 1 if household i received a coupon at price j, 𝑆𝑖 = 1 if the household received the script,
𝐶𝑖 is the cash payout the household received, and 𝐺𝑖 = 1 if the husband was sampled to receive the
coupon. We estimate the coefficients on the price, script, and cash payout for the entire sample.
However, to estimate differences in redemption between husbands and wives (𝜇), we run separate
regression for dual-headed households (81% of households are dual-headed). Finally, 𝑋𝑖 is a minimal
vector of controls consisting only of controls for risk and time preferences (since the experimental
payout is only random conditional on risk and time preferences), and dummies for the stratification
clusters (which we include to improve precision, as discussed in Bruhn and McKenzie, 2009).
         In dual-headed households, we were not always able to enroll the sampled respondent in the
project and so instead enrolled the spouse (mostly because the male was the selected spouse but he
worked away from home during the day). We therefore also present an Instrumental Variables
specification in which we instrument the male participating in the project with being sampled to
participate.
         Finally, as discussed in the previous section we can estimate geographical spillovers with the
following regression:
                                              𝐽

                                      𝑌𝑖 = � 𝛽𝑗 𝑇𝑖𝑗𝑟 + 𝛾𝑁𝑖𝑟 + 𝑋′𝑖 𝜙 + 𝜀𝑖                                                    (2)
                                            𝑗=1




survey primarily to calculate averages rather than to compute treatment effects. The only treatment effect we use the
follow-up for is the effect of the script on knowledge, and the script is not correlated with appearing in the follow-up.

                                                              10
where 𝑇𝑖𝑗𝑟 is the proportion of people within a radius r from person who received the given
treatment T. There are J such treatments (the prices, script, cash payout, and gender treatments).
Here 𝑋𝑖 includes the same controls as the previous regression, but also includes all the individual level
treatments. We also include the total number of people in the cluster (𝑁𝑖𝑟 ) in order to account for
possible scale effects.
        We can perform a similar regression for self-identified baseline contacts. While the total
number of contacts named is not random, nor is the number of contacts who could be matched (as
those who could not be matched are likely to be outside the study area), conditional on the number of
contacts that were matched, the number receiving any treatment is random. Thus the following
regression can be implemented:
                                       𝐽

                                 𝑌𝑖 = � 𝛽𝑗 𝑇𝑖𝑗 + 𝛾𝐶𝑖 + 𝑋′𝑖 𝜙 + 𝜀𝑖                                      (3)
                                      𝑗=1




where 𝑇𝑖𝑗 is the proportion of contacts who are treated, and 𝐶𝑖 is the total number of contacts.


5. Results
5.1. Background Statistics and Randomization Check
        Background statistics for the sample are presented in Table 1. For each variable, Column 1
presents the sample mean, while the remaining columns test whether the treatments are orthogonal
to that variable. To do this, we regress each variable on indicators for all the experimental prices, the
script and gender treatments, and the amount won in payments from the experimental games. As the
experimental payments are only random conditional on risk/time preferences, we include those in the
regressions as controls (for all variables but the risk/time preferences themselves). We split the table
into household (Panel A) and individual (Panel B) variables, as we expect the individual variables to
differ between men and women (one of the experimental treatments).
        From Panel A, Column 1, 81% of households are dual-headed, and the average household has
3.5 children. As mentioned previously, health problems are common – respondents reported that 23%
of their children had worms in the past year, and the average child’s health is rated 2.53 on a scale of
1-5 (where 1 is “very good” and 5 is “very poor”). Shoe ownership is low (parents report that 17% of
their children have shoes, though this may be an overestimate as only 13% of those present were
wearing shoes at the interview), and it is common for children to use the “bush” instead of a latrine –
                                                   11
92% of children do this at least occasionally. This is consistent with low average income – total
household income is just 900 Ksh (US $12) per week, putting these households around the $1 per day
level.
         Turning to Panel B, only 28% of respondents are men. This is because we sampled the male
for the interview in only half of the households, and we were only able to successfully interview 61%
of those men (the remainder lived away from the home most of the time or were away from home
during our interviews). In addition, there are very few unmarried men - the vast majority of single-
headed households are widowed females. The average respondent is 39 years old and has 5.6 years of
education, and 67% of the sample is fluent in Kiswahili. Shoe ownership is low and worms are
prevalent among adults as well: 34% own shoes and 26% report having worms in the past year.
         Turning to the randomization check in Columns 2-5, we find very few differences between
treatment groups. The experimental payout is negatively correlated with child shoe ownership and
positively correlated with adult health status, but coefficients on script, gender, and price treatments
are all insignificant for all variables. We conclude from Table 1 that treatment is orthogonal to
baseline characteristics.

5.2. Experimental Treatments
5.2.1 Estimating Demand for Children’s Shoes
         Our first main result is to estimate the demand curve for children’s shoes. We present this
graphically in Figure 1 (without any controls) and in the first column of Table 2. As can be seen,
demand falls off relatively quickly with the price. While 93% of households buy when the price is 5
Ksh, only 77% buy at 35 Ksh, 51% at 55 Ksh, and 42% at 65 Ksh. As the market price is around 85
Ksh, these results suggest that the majority of people value shoes at a price lower than the market
price. Note that although we never provided coupons to receive the shoes for free, the fact that 93%
redeem at 5 Ksh suggests that there is not a discontinuity in demand at 0 Ksh.
         It is important to note that these redemption figures are upper bounds on true demand at
these prices. This is because the other experimental treatments, in particular the cash payout, tended
to increase demand (as we will show later). It is also possible that the program tended to create a
general excitement for the product, which increased demand at all prices. In addition, since
households talked with others about the prices they received for their coupons (as we will show in the
spillover effects section), it is possible that people were particularly price sensitive because they were
aware of whether they got a favorable price or not. Finally, since the vouchers had an expiration date,
it is possible that they encouraged some people to redeem who would otherwise have procrastinated
                                                   12
(note, however, that to the extent a deadline is important, policymakers could certainly implement
time-limited coupons).
        Even without any other controls, the R-squared in Column 1 shows that 78% of the variation
in the purchase decision can be explained by the price alone. This finding is in line with other recent
studies which show that demand is very price sensitive in developing countries. 20 The primacy of
price in this setting is particularly striking in that households had to go to a nearby shop to redeem
the coupon, and most did not redeem until a few days later – thus, households had to hold the money
for a few days, and would have had many chances to spend the money on something else.

5.2.2 Effects of Interventions on Demand
        In Figure 2, we plot demand curves for various treatment groups (note that results in this
figure are not regression adjusted with controls). Panel A shows how demand varies with the script
payment. We find that there is no discernible effect from the script. The two demand curves lie
virtually on top of one another, crossing each other three times. Table 2, Column 3 confirms these
basic results in a regression framework with controls. Note that the standard errors are relatively
small, so that we can confidently rule out large positive effects of the script.
        Panel B shows how demand differs by the gender of the respondent. Since gender is only
randomly determined for those households which have two heads, this regression is restricted to the
81% of households which are dual headed. Though the standard errors are relatively large (especially
when comparing demand at each particular price), there is evidence that women are more likely to
redeem coupons than men. Note that these are Intent-to-Treat comparisons – the gender differences
are bigger for those households in which we were able to successfully interview the sampled spouse.
        To measure gender difference quantitatively, we include a treatment indicator for the male
being sampled in Table 2, Column 4. This regression is restricted to dual-headed households. We find
that when the male is offered the coupon, the household is 5 percentage points less likely to buy shoes
(significant at 10%). Since we were not able to treat all the men sampled for the interview, we run an




20It is possible that households sold the shoes (or the coupon) after purchasing them. However, the data suggests this is
unlikely: at follow-up, the enumerator asked to see the shoes and record their condition. Ninety percent of households that
purchased shoes could produce them, and most of the remainder reported that the child was away from the home and
wearing them. Thus, an extreme upper bound on resale would be 10%. Of the households who could produce the shoes,
94% of the shoes appeared used, which suggests that most coupons were redeemed and used by the sampled household
(especially given that it would be hard to produce another pair of shoes not acquired through the program, since baseline
ownership is so low).
                                                            13
IV specification in Column 5 and find a 9 percentage point effect, again significant at 10% (see
Appendix Table A3 for the first stage). 21
         Figure 2, Panel C shows the effect of the cash payout. 22 For simplicity, this graph does not
control for risk/time preferences (the results look very similar with those controls). As the payout is
continuous, we graph the 𝛾𝑗 coefficients from the following regression

                                              65

                                      𝑌𝑖 = � (𝛽𝑗 𝑃𝑖𝑗 + 𝛾𝑗 𝑃𝑖𝑗 ∗ 𝑅𝑖 ) + 𝜀𝑖                                                (4)
                                            𝑃𝑗 =5


where 𝑅𝑖 is the cash payout (in 100s of Kenyan shillings).
         The mean and median cash payout were 35 Ksh and 30 Ksh, respectively. They thus represent
a very small fraction of weekly income (which from Table 1 is around 900 Ksh per week), and an even
smaller fraction of total households wealth (again from Table 1, the average household owns 23,000
Ksh worth of animals and durable goods). Thus, if these payouts affect demand, they work through a
cash-on-hand effect, rather than because they have any effect on total income. We find strong
evidence of a liquidity effect, particularly at intermediate or high prices (the smaller effect at lower
prices is because demand is already so high to begin with). Table 2, Column 3 shows the regression
results with controls for risk/time preferences. On average, every additional 100 Ksh in randomized
cash payout increases the probability of purchase by 22 percentage points. Although we do not
present regressions with interactions with price, the basic results are robust to the inclusion of
controls (i.e. the cash payout only matters at moderate or high prices).
         One possible concern with the cash payout would be if people felt that they were expected to
spend the money on shoes. We view this as unlikely for several reasons. First, they had to redeem the
coupon at the shop on their own, after the field officer had left. Second, during the survey,
respondents were explicitly informed that the cash payouts were as compensation for their time, not
to help them buy the product. Third, consistent with other studies, redemption fell off rapidly as the
price increased, suggesting that households did not feel impelled to purchase the product at even
moderate prices.

21 Though not shown in the table, we do not observe any interaction between gender and receiving the information script
(results on request).
22 We do not have accurate records of experimental payouts for 3 of the 999 households. To avoid losing these households

in the regressions (such that direct comparison across columns is possible), we create a dummy for having missing
information for this variable and then code their cash payout as zero. Thus the experimental payout coefficient is identified
off of only those for whom we have non-missing data. We omit the dummy for “missing experimental payout information”
for space.
                                                             14
5.3. The Script and Worm Knowledge
        One important finding thus far is that the worm education script has no effect on the purchase
decision. Is this because the script was ineffective in conveying knowledge? To address this question,
we gave a nine-question worm quiz (at both baseline and follow-up) to test the effect of the script on
knowledge about worms and worm prevention. In Table 3, we regress the percentage of questions
answered correctly on the script treatment. We find large effects: in the baseline, respondents who
were given the script scored 34 percentage points higher on the quiz (on a low base of just 29% in the
control group). In the follow-up survey, the difference was somewhat smaller but still highly
significant: a 24 percentage point difference, against a base of 37%. Thus, health knowledge did indeed
increase, but the increase in knowledge did not increase demand for the shoes. 23

5.4. Peer Effects
        There were strong reasons to expect that there might be spillover effects in our experiment.
Several studies in agriculture find large spillover effects (e.g. Foster and Rosenzweig, 1995; Conley
and Udry, 2010). Health-specific studies also tend to find spillover effects, though these effects can
either serve to increase adoption (e.g. bednets in Kenya in Dupas 2013, menstrual cups in Nepal in
Oster and Thornton 2012) or decrease it (e.g. deworming drugs in Kenya in Kremer and Miguel,
2007), depending on relative costs and benefits, as well as health externalities.
        There are three possible channels through which spillovers may occur in the context of this
experiment. First, people may talk to each other about the health benefits of the shoes from
information they got from the script. Second, if shoes are an experience good, people who were
exogenously induced to buy shoes because they received a low-priced coupon may learn from using
and may then discuss benefits with contacts. Third, exogenously increasing usage among friends and
neighbors might stimulate demand through an imitative channel, since shoes are readily observable
and carry a certain prestige value.
        Despite expectations to the contrary, we find very little evidence of imitative peer effects in the
purchase decision (either positive or negative) for either geographical neighbors or health contacts
(Table 4). First, Panel A presents geographical spillovers across different radii (300, 500, and 1,000

23A possible confounding factor for why information does not lead to purchase is that shoes have other non-health
benefits, and people buy shoes only for these other reasons. However, we have two pieces of evidence to suggest this is not
the case. First, when asked, a significant portion of people report health as an advantage of wearing shoes. Second and
more robustly, we also find no evidence of information effects in the smaller studies we conducted in Guatemala, India,
and Uganda which focused on products with minimal non-health benefits (soap and multivitamins). These results are
discussed in more detail in Section 7.
                                                            15
meters). For each specification, we report the percentage of contacts receiving the script, the
percentage receiving a low-priced coupon (which we define as less than 35 Ksh here), 24 and the total
number of people living within the radii. 25 Although many of the point estimates are positive, none
are significant and many are quite small (given that the independent variable is measured as a
percentage). Note, however, that the confidence intervals on these estimates are wide, and include
fairly large values. Panel B does the same for the matched informational contacts and, again, there is
no discernible positive effect, even though the confidence intervals are much tighter than for
geographical neighbors (if anything, the effect for the script is negative, though small and significant
at only 10%).
         Why don’t we observe any spillovers (either positive or negative)? One important reason is
that the scope for social learning (either through the script or through experience with the product)
might be limited in this case. In particular, since information did not have a first-order effect on the
individual who received it, it is unlikely that we would find second-order informational conformity
across households. 26 Furthermore, while it might be possible to learn about the protective benefits of
shoes from wearing them, this process might be very noisy, making it difficult to extract a signal.
Shoes have been around for a long time and the benefit of wearing the shoes is not immediately
obvious (as is more apparent with brand new technologies with which people are unfamiliar). It also
might be possible that it takes time for information to diffuse generally, and there was not enough
time for information to travel in the relatively short period between the baseline and follow-up
surveys. A study conducted over a longer time horizon may be able to identify some of these delayed
peer effects.
         Thus, unlike most studies of spillover effects in development (which focus on social learning),
the main role for externalities in this experiment is likely through imitative peer effects. We might
expect these in our study because shoes are often desirable for children, and seeing other children
wearing shoes may increase the demand for children to have and wear them. There is considerable
evidence that such effects can be relevant in human capital (e.g. Borjas, 1995, Sacerdote, 2001).
Munshi and Myaux (2006) provide one of the few pieces of evidence for pure imitative effects for a
health product (contraceptives) in a developing country.


24 The results are not sensitive to defining this variable differently.
25 Due to the geographic stratification, there is more variation in the price than in the script. The percentage of neighbors
getting a price lower than 35 Ksh has a mean of 0.67 with a standard deviation of 0.17, while the percentage of neighbors
receiving the script has a mean is 0.51 and a standard deviation of 0.11.
26 We also do not find evidence of knowledge spillovers on the worm quiz (results upon request).

                                                             16
        To shed more light on why we find no imitation, we present responses to the follow-up
debriefing survey we conducted at the end of the project in Table 5. Interestingly, the Table shows
that the lack of spillover effects is not because people do not place value on imitation or relative
wealth. From Panel A, the majority of people report that seeing their peers’ children with the shoes
made them (and their children) want them more. Most people also report that they would feel poor if
the neighbors bought the shoes and they did not, and they also report that they would value certain
prestige items more if their neighbors had them (such as a TV). Furthermore, Panel B shows that
people do report talking about the program with others: 72.5% of people who received the script
reported talking to somebody else about the health effects of worms and 51.7% of people who didn’t
receive the script reported hearing from others about worms.
         Why then didn’t people who saw many of their neighbors purchase shoes buy them
themselves? We asked those parents who purchased shoes what factor was most important in
redeeming the coupon. Forty-two percent reported that the price was the biggest factor and 33%
reported health (including worms and other injuries). However, only 10.8% reported responding to
pressure from children and 7.5% reported some influence of neighbors. Thus while “keeping up with
the Joneses” may well be an important consideration for people, the primary barrier is clearly price.
        Moreover, social interactions were actually so strong that they might have mitigated the
desire to imitate. From Panel B, 78.9% of people report that their neighbors knew what priced coupon
they got. In Panel C, we asked people if they would be seen as a “bad parent” if they did not buy the
shoes at different prices. While 77.9% of parents report that they would be seen as a bad parent if they
didn’t buy the shoes at a low price, only 50.3% reported that they would be if they didn’t buy the
shoes at a high price. Thus, imitative peer effects may have actually been mitigated by the strength of
social connections. 27

6. External Validity
        In 2008 we conducted smaller-scale studies in three different countries with two products that
could be used by both children and adults: hand soap and multivitamins. This trio of smaller studies
took place prior to, and served as the pretext for, our larger experiment in Kenya. The scope of the
smaller studies was confined to ascertaining information and price effects alone, but findings are
strongly consistent with the Kenya study, indicating that the effects of these demand factors are


27Another possibility which we are not able to rule out is that spillovers extended beyond a given social network. For
instance, the program might have created excitement in the entire study area.
                                                            17
unlikely to be limited to one geographical context or health product. The studies were carried out in
in the small village of Panyebar, Guatemala (pop. 2,031), the town of Busia, Uganda (pop. 36,600), 28
and the large city of Chennai (Madras), India (pop. 4,700,000) 29. These experiments were more
limited in scope than the Kenya study: all respondents were women, we did not conduct long
interviews with households, we did not measure knowledge from the information treatments, and we
did not measure peer effects. However, the general results nevertheless concur strongly with those in
Kenya.

6.1. Experimental Design
         In each of the three country sites, our experimental protocol was designed to be very similar.
Households were randomly selected to receive either hand soap or a multivitamin supplement, where
the retail value of the products ranged from approximately $2 in Guatemala and Uganda to $1 in
India. Both products could potentially have large health effects. The use of soap accompanied by
regular hand washing is documented to decrease diarrhea in both children and adults in developing
countries (Luby et al., 2004, 2005; Ray et al., 2011; Curtis and Cairncross, 2003). Similarly, women
and children in resource-poor regions are known to suffer from nutritional deficiencies (Stein, 2009;
Torheim et al., 2010), a possible solution to which may be the increased use of multivitamins and/or
iron supplements in women of reproductive ages and/or children (Huffman et al., 1998, Yip, 1994;
Ramakrishnan, 2004). 30
         The only intervention in all three of these sites was an information treatment. In Guatemala,
treated households were invited to a five-day public health seminar lasting an hour and a half each
morning. In Uganda, households attended a one day health seminar that emphasized basic hygiene,
nutritional information, and preventative healthcare through the encouragement of hand washing and
proper vitamin intake. Finally, in India, treatment households were read a health script. For those
offered soap, the script reminded people that hand-washing with soap and clean water at the
appropriate times could prevent germs from spreading. For those offered vitamins, the script focused
on the importance of broad vitamin intake for general health.

28 Busia, Uganda is located on the Ugandan side of the border with Busia, Kenya (Busia is a border district).
29 Population sources: Panyebar, Guatemala: Ludwinski et al., (2011); Busia, Uganda: Uganda Bureau of Statistics (2002);
Chennai, India: Census of India (2011).
30 The specific products differed slightly across countries. In Guatemala, the hand soap was a three-pack of standard anti-

bacterial soap bars, a product that was used among Guatemalan households, but not widespread. Soap products were
similar in India, but differed slightly in Uganda, where the hand soap was a more common multi-purpose soap. In all three
sites, the vitamin product was an 8-oz. bottle of multi-vitamin syrup primarily intended for children, but often used by
adults. Instructions recommended once-daily use as a supplement to existing meals.
                                                            18
       To measure the impact of information, all households were visited for an endline survey. After
completing the survey, households were given cash as a gift for participating, and offered the
opportunity to purchase the health product directly from the enumerator at a randomly selected
discount (25%, 50%, or 75% of the retail price). This design negated any issues with cash liquidity
since subjects used the money from the survey payout to pay for the health products, and was done to
minimize any frictions related to product purchase. Of course this came at a trade-off of the more
realistic scenario in which one typically must purchase such products at a local store.
       The sample sizes for the 3 studies were 350 in Guatemala (197 treatment and 153 control),
455 in India (208 treatment and 247 control), and 516 in Uganda (266 treatment and 250 control).

6.2 Results
6.2.1 Background Statistics and Randomization Check
       Appendix Table A4 presents background statistics as well as a check on the effectiveness of
our randomization in each of the three countries. While we have few covariates to compare across
samples, there are some stark differences across countries. For example, average years of education is
just 1.94 in Guatemala, compared to 5.7 in Uganda and 5.5 in India. As expected, there are few
differences between treatment groups. Taking the prices first (Column 7), the only differences with a
p-value less than 0.10 are education in Uganda and India. There are a few differences in regards to the
seminar or script treatments. In Guatemala, women in the treatment group are younger; in India,
women in the treatment group are less educated. Finally, women in Uganda who received coupons for
soap were less educated and more likely to have access to piped water than women offered vitamins.
We control for these covariates in our regressions (although omitting them makes little difference to
our estimates).
6.2.2 Experimental Results
       The basic experimental results are summarized in Figure 3 and in Table 6. Each panel
presents results from a different country, and each panel has two graphs which plot the treatment and
control means (along with the standard error of the difference). The left graph shows soap, and the
right shows vitamins.
       Panels A (Guatemala) and B (Uganda) show the same pattern as Kenya: there is no discernible
effect of the seminar on purchase, at any price, and demand tends to fall off rapidly for most


                                                   19
products. 31 This is confirmed in the regressions in Table 6: the point estimate for the health seminar
is small and insignificant. Although regressions without controls are not shown, the R-squared of
regressions which include only prices also vary between 0.69 and 0.95, suggesting again that price is
the most important factor. Panel C (India) shows a somewhat stronger effect of the script, especially
for soap (though the effect is positive for both products). Though it is hard to definitively attribute a
causal factor for this difference given differences in samples, one possibility is that because subjects
had cash on hand and chose whether or not to redeem the coupons right after being read the script,
the script served as a “nudge” toward coupon redemption. Though the result could be due to sampling
variation (since only 1 of the 6 possible product-country pairs is statistically significant), we speculate
that the nudge together with the absence of transportation costs and the provision of liquidity might
have encouraged purchase.
        Taken together, the results from these smaller studies support the key findings of our main
study in Kenya: 1) investment in health products is highly sensitive to price; and 2) information about
health products has a small or negligible effects on its own, unless – perhaps – other frictions are also
removed simultaneously.

7. Discussion: What Influences Investment in Preventative Health?
        In this section, we compare our results to those of other recent experiments on health product
adoption in LDCs. We do not attempt an exhaustive review and focus solely on preventative health
investments. 32 We summarize our results in Table 7, where we identify the previous studies by
author, country, and health product, and list results for four key outcomes: the effect of price changes,
information campaigns, gender, and spillovers through peer effects.
        Overall, we find a number of similarities. First, as in many other recent studies, we find that
demand for our preventative health products is highly price sensitive. While it is impossible to make
direct comparisons since the product and the range of subsidy varies across studies, our estimated
elasticities (calculated at the mean price) fall in the -0.40 to -0.90 range. This is similar to the -0.37
mean elasticity reported in Cohen and Dupas (2010) for long-lasting insecticide-treated bed nets in
Kenya and the -0.60 mean elasticity reported in Ashraf et al. (2010) for chlorine in Zambia. Our
results are not as stark as those observed in the Kremer and Miguel (2007) study of deworming

31 The one exception is soap in Uganda. Redemption rates were high across our price treatments because the particular

soap we used in the experiment was a recognized item to households and was apparently viewed as a bargain even at a
25% discount.
32 For a much more exhaustive review (including other health decisions such as choice of water source or handwashing

behavior and other methodologies), see Dupas (2011).
                                                         20
drugs, in which even a modest US $0.30 cost-recovery fee decreased demand by 80%, or Miller and
Mobarak (2011) who report an elasticity of -2.3 for improved cook stoves. Of course, differences in
price sensitivity across products will be heavily influenced by how much household decision-makers
expect to pay for these products, which may depend on previous availability and exposure to the
product. Nevertheless our basic price results are very much in line with previous research finding that
demand for health products is very price elastic in LDCs.
         Although there are relatively few randomized experiments on how information affects
preventative health investment (rather than behavior change more generally), most of these studies
tend to find small effects, as we do. Kremer and Miguel (2007) find no effect of education targeted at
children on worm-preventing behavior. Also, since they find extreme price sensitivity for deworming
drugs among the parents of children in the program, the intervention did not increase subsequent
demand for the drugs among parents. Similarly, Kremer et al. (2011) find that providing information
has little effect on uptake of chlorine for water. In a study similar to this one, Ashraf et al. (2013), find
that information does not affect the level of investment but does affect the slope of the demand curve.
Dupas (2009) also finds that scripts to make health more salient have little effect (note however that
those scripts did not convey health information). 33
        One exception is Luoto et al. (2012), who carry out randomized trials in Kenya and
Bangladesh on point-of-use water chlorination and filters. In both countries they implement two
different marketing campaign treatments, one emphasizing only the positive health benefits of the
water products, and a second strongly contrasting the positive outcomes associated with usage with
the negative outcomes from non-usage. They find that the contrast-marketing message households in
Kenya were about 5 percentage points more likely to have uncontaminated water in their home with
insignificant results in Bangladesh. However, they find significant effects in both countries from a
treatment in which subjects make a public commitment to use the product.
        Thus early results suggest that simply providing information is not consistently effective in
these types of investment decisions. Results in these studies may differ from some of the more positive
results of health information summarized in Dupas (2011) for several reasons. First, the information
provided in these studies was not very specific to the household. This differs from, for instance, Jalan
and Somanathan (2008) and Madajewicz et al. (2007), who find that informing households that their
own water source is contaminated (with fecal bacteria or with arsenic, respectively) induces behavior

33While the script treatment in our study did not increase preventative health investment, it might have affected other
behavior (for example, hygiene). Unfortunately, we do not have data to test this.

                                                            21
change. Such targeted information is likely very salient. Second, the interventions in Table 7 simply
provided information during a one-time-only visit and so did not intensively attempt to change
behavior or to instill learning. This is very different from studies like Cairncross et al. (2005) or Luby
et al. (2004, 2005), who find that intensive educational interventions conducted over many months
were effective in improving hygiene. Third, the main outcome in the studies we summarize is whether
households actually purchased the health product, which means that even if information increased the
perceived value of the item, the household still had to gather enough money to buy the product. This
is difficult for the very poor who do not have access to credit or to good savings products. By
contrast, soap was provided as part of the intervention in Luby et al. (2004, 2005), while the main
outcomes in Cairncross et al. (2005) were various measures of self-reported behavior. We believe
these results have important implications for health practitioners in developing countries, where
information campaigns have often played a leading role in trying to change health behaviors.
       As mentioned previously, our estimates of the impact of peer effects differ greatly from other
studies, almost certainly due to differences in products. The other study of which we are aware which
focuses on imitative peer effects is Munshi and Myaux’s (2006) study of contraceptive adoption in
Bangladesh, in which women may have eschewed purchasing the contraceptives until there was
evidence of their acceptability within their religious group, a case of pure conformity in which
imitation may occur in the process of breaking social stigma. In the other studies (Miguel and
Kremer, 2007; Dupas, 2013; Oster and Thornton 2012) peer effects are likely to be the product of a
learning process, in which households begin to understand the private and social costs and benefits of
a product, an effect unlikely with a well-known product such as shoes.
       Another area in which our findings relate to previous studies is in the area of gender effects.
As discussed in Section 2, since there were no income transfers, the result that preventative health
investment is higher when the woman receives the coupon suggests not only intra-household
differences in preferences, but also constraints on information sharing within the household. A close
paper in this respect is Dupas (2009), who randomized whether the female head, male head, or both
heads jointly would receive a coupon for a bednet. While she finds no difference in takeup between the
treatment in which the male gets the coupon individually and the treatment in which the female does,
she finds that investment in both cases is lower than when both are given it simultaneously. Her
result may also suggest some communication constraints. Miller and Mobarak (2011) also find that
wives show a stronger preference for purchasing improved cook stoves in Bangladesh, but that this



                                                   22
preference cannot be acted upon if the price is high or if their husband’s decision contradicts their
own.

8. Conclusion
To conclude, we attempt to synthesize and summarize the main finding from our paper and related
experiments, and to offer a few suggestions for future research.

1. PRICE   MATTERS.   In keeping with numerous recent studies, we find that many low-income
households fail to invest in preventative health products simply because they are unwilling to pay
market prices for them. We find relatively high price elasticities in each of our four field experiments
and across all three of our health products. Because of the strong positive externalities associated with
preventative health products, policymakers may consider subsidies as one means of boosting adoption.

2. INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS OFTEN HAVE LIMITED IMPACT ON THEIR OWN. Compared to the effect of
lower prices, the types of information campaigns we summarize here generally have little effect on the
purchase of health products in recent experimental studies, including ours. While more intensive,
long-term campaigns have been effective, more modest programs have very limited effects. In our
study sites, providing information had no effect, except perhaps as a “nudge” when other constraints
were simultaneously removed. More research should be done to ascertain the conditions under which
health information campaigns might be more effective.

3. PEER   EFFECTS WILL BE STRONGER FOR PRODUCTS WHICH HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE FOR A SHORTER

TIME OR FOR WHICH SOCIAL ACCEPTABILITY IS IMPORTANT.           We should expect peer effects in health
product adoption when we have a strong a priori theory for their existence. This ought to be when
there is strong asymmetric information about product effectiveness between users and non-users or
when bandwagon effects are socially important in the use of a product (such as contraceptives in the
case of Munshi and Myaux, 2006). Otherwise, peer effects are likely to play a small role in adoption.

4. PARENTAL GENDER MATTERS FOR CHILDREN’S HEALTH PRODUCTS. Though such findings are likely
very context-dependent, at least in this particular experiment, marketing health products to mothers
increased investment. This appears to be driven both by differences in gender preferences and a
limited flow of information within the household.

5. LIQUIDITY IS IMPORTANT FOR HEALTH INVESTMENT DECISIONS. Cash on hand appears to influence
health product purchase. Our results suggest that this is not likely due to pure credit constraints
                                                    23
(since even for these very poor households, the experimental payouts were small). Other work in this
same part of Kenya shows that merely providing people with simple places to save greatly increases
investment in preventative health (Dupas and Robinson, 2013b). Designing products to help
households accumulate necessary liquidity may be a fruitful avenue for future research.

Notes: In Column 1, the overall sample mean is reported (with the standard deviation in parentheses). Columns 2-5
report results from a regression of the given dependent variable on price dummies, an indicator for whether the
household was sampled for the script, an indicator for whether the male was sampled to participate, and the
experimental cash payout. Columns 2-4 report coefficients (standard errors in parentheses), while Column 5 report
the p-values for the test of joint insignificance of all the price dummies. The table is broken into panels for household
and individual level variables because individuals means would be expected to differ between men and women. The
coefficient on the experimental payout is not included in the regressions for time/risk preferences as the payment is
not orthogonal to those (and they are included in controls in all regressions - see text). See text for definitions of
risk/time variables. Exchange rate was about 75 Ksh to $1 US during this time period.

  One is "very good" and 5 is "very poor."

  This variable is listed as an individual level variable since men are more likely to wear shoes than women.

Notes: Experimental payout is in 100 Ksh. Exchange rate roughly 75 Ksh to US $1 during this time period. 3
of 999 househols are missing information on the experimental payout. To avoid dropping these, we code
them as 0 and include dummies for having a missing value (so that the coefficients are relevant only for
those with non-missing values). Clusters were calculated from GPS coordinates and sampling was stratified
at that level. Standard errors in parentheses. * significant at 10%; ** significant at 5%; *** significant at 1%

 The regression in Column 5 is an IV treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) regression, where an indicator for the
male being interviewed is instrumented with whether the male was sampled for the interview. See Appendix

  Relative to a zero price, a $0.30 fee cost-recovery fee decreased demand 80%.
4
  About 80 percent of respondents bought Clorin at 300 Kw with 50 percent buying at 800 Kw (3200 Kw = $1US).
5
  Neither health nor financial encouragements significantly affected purchase.
6
  Households who were surrounded by other households receiving a low price in a first phase (who were much more
likely to purchase bed nets) were more likely to purchase them in the second phase.
7
  Usage falls from 58% to 3.5% when price increases from zero to 20 Kenyan shillings and take-up is low at all positive
prices.
8
  Taken at means of price and take-up. When provided consumer information, magnitude of elasticity increases to -
0.876.
