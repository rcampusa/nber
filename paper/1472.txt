                      Pay Differences Between
                      Women's and Men's Jobs:
                   The Empirical Foundations of
                   Comparable Worth Legislation

                               ABSTRACT


     Civil rights legislation of the 1960s made it illegal for an employer
to pay men and women on different bases for the same work or to discriminate
against women in hiring, job assignment, or promotion. Two decades later,
however, the ratio of women's to men's earnings has shown little upward
movement. Furthermore, major sex differences in occupational distribution
persist with predominantly female jobs typically paying less than pre-
dominantly male jobs. This negative relationship between wage rates and
femaleness of occupatiop has stimulate4 efforts, in both the judicial and
political arenas, to establish "comparable worth" procedures for setting
wage rates.

     This paper etimates the relationship between wages and femaleness of
occupation and finds that it is indeed negative even after controlling for
relevant worker and job characteristics. The magnitude of the relation-
ship, however, implies a surprisingly small effect for a comprehensive
comparable worth policy. The estimates indicate that, even if comparable
worth succeeded in eliminating this negative relatipnship, the disparity
between mean male and female wages would be reduced by well under ten
percent of its current magnitude.

                           THE EMPIRICAL FOUNDATIONS OF
                            COMPARABLE WORTH LEGISLATION

          Civil rights legislation of the early 19605 made it                 illegal for

an employer to     pay   men and women on different bases for           the same     work or

to    discriminat, against women in hiring, job assignment,               or promotion.

Two decades      later, however the ratio of
                                •                  women' s   to men' s    earnings has

shown little upward movement. Furthermore,            major sex differences in
occupational distribution persist with predominantly              female jobs

typically    paying less than prominantly male jobs. For example, in
1983 the percentages       female among   truclcdrivers   and secretaries were
respectively 3.2 and 99.0, with the truckdrivers receiving considerably
higher   wages. Similar comparisons can be          made of engineers versus
librarians,    professors of    economics versus professors of art history,
and   literally hundreds of other examples of primarily               men's jobs (Mis)
versus primarily      women's jobs (Wis).

         Such comparisons have generated much         discussion, in both           the

judicial   and   political arenas, concerning the desirability of

establishing     "comparable   worth" CCW)     procedures for setting wage
rates.     The presumption underlying the CW movement            is    that   the

observed   negative   relationship between wage rates and femaleness of an
occupation    reflects an "undervaluation"       by society of WJs relative to
pus. Accordingly, CW legislation —— either           partial (applied to a

particular   branch of government     and/or    a subset of private employers) or
comprehensive —— would      require that   an   employer's wage structure across

 jobs   be justified by "job evaluation" procedures. Specifically, each
 job within an organization would be assigned points in each of several
 dimensions (such as skill requirements, responsibility, effort, and
 working conditions), and these scores would somehow be aggregated to an
overall index for determining relative compensation levels.' Under the
presumption that WJs are currently undervalued, a legal requirement that
relative wage levels be set in this manner, rather than by the present
cothination of market and institutional forces, would tend to reduce the
disparity in the remuneration of MIs and WJs.
       The primary object of this paper is to estimate and analyze the
negative relationship between wage rates and femaleness of an
occupation. This relationship, which is the empirical basis for CW
legislation, is further discussed and couched in a convenient
econometric framework in Section I. Section II presents an empirical
analysis of the relationship, and Section XII explores how the
relationship differs between the public and private sectors. Section IV
sulmnarizes the implications of the results for CW policy.

                               I.   Conceptual Issues

          The   presumed stylized fact that motivates cw proposals   is the
negative    relation, ceteris paribus, between an individual's hourly
earnings (W,     which we express logarithmically) and the fraction of
workers   in his or her occupation who are women (F). Specifically, we
posit that

       20f course, this job evaluation process is extremely
problematical. A detailed discussion in Treiman and   Hartmann (1981)
notes that 'there are no definitive tests of the 'fairness' of the
choice of compensable factors and the relative weights given to them,"
and concludes that the process is "inherently judgmental."

(1)       W—    f(Z,P,S)

where Z    is   a vector of characteristics that influence earnings (human
capital, location, working conditions, etc.) and S denotes the
individual's sex. This earnings function is depicted in Figure 1. The
vertical axis measures the average log wage rates f or men and women
given their average values of the Z' s. These wages W5                    are assumed to
be negatively related to F on the horizontal axis.              The   figure as drawn
assumes    that, given     F, men typically earn more    than women •       This would
occur   if men   have higher-earning average characteristics or if women are
subject to wage discrimination.
          In the framework of Figure 1, one can view the relevant civil
rights provisions of the 1960s as an attempt to move the men's and
women's functions,       net of average differences in the Vs,            into
confluence.      Realization of that goal, however,       would still leave women
with    lower pay than men      because women would   still   tend   to   be

concentrated     in occupations with larger F. The CW proposals of the
1980s can be viewed        as   an attempt to remedy this situation by making
3W/aF=O, that     is,   by making Figure l's earnings functions horizontal.
         Although the sources of the functions' negative slopes are not
the main focus of this paper, they warrant some discussion. The two
most prominent explanations for the negative relationship between wages
and femaleness of occupation are sex differences in preferences and
occupational exclusion.' According to the preferences explanation,
workers   have   heterogeneous tastes for ob chararacteristics, and the

         3A third explanation is that wages for some WJs, especially
hospital nurses, are depressed because nployers have Inonopsony power.
There is little evidence, though, that this analysis applies to enough
WJs to provide a general explanation.
                                          I

distribution of thes, tastes differs between men and women. These
 gender differences in job preferences might arise fr socialization
concerning sex roles and "apprOpriate" work (the nurse/doctor syndrome),
differing family responsibilities, or differing expectations regarding
continuous versus intermittent labor market attachment. In any case,
such taste differences would lead to sex differences in occupational
distribution. Furthermore, if the preference distributions were such
that the supply of workers to female—dominated occupations were
especially large relative to the demand, these occupations would pay
relatively low wages. In this analysis, the negative relationship
between wages and feialeness of occupation results from voluntary
choices, and the wage structure cannot be "improved" by legislative
fiat. The relative wage changes mandated by a CW policy would be
undesirable on efficiency grounds and not especially appealing on equity
grounds. 4
         An    alternative explanation for aw/aFco is that   women   are
systtically excluded from many occupations and are thus "crowded"
into a subset of occupations with depressed wage rates. • According to
this explanation,     women become secretaries, librarians, and art
historians     not by choice, but because they are blocked from becoming
truckdrivers, engineers, and economists. The employer practices that
would lead to such occupational exclusion are
                                              illegal under Title VII of

the Civil Rights Act, and vigorous enforcement of that statute appears
to be a more suitable long—run remedy than     CW   legislation. On the other
hand,   even   the complete elimination of occupational exclusion would

mainly benefit new feiale workers and might be of little help to older
 wanan already coraitted to traditionally female career paths. CW policy
might then be advocated on equity grounds as a means of compensating the
 latter group.
       Whatever the source of the negative relationship between wages
and femaleness of occupation, the remainder of this paper attempts to
quantify that relationship and thereby to ascertain the potential impact
of CW on women's wages relative to men's. We estimate for each sex the
following linearized version of equation (1),

(2)      W=      +        +
                     5F
where 05 is a vector of parameters (for sex 5) associated with the
characteristics vector Z and £ is a disturbance term. For an individual
of sex 5, 5=aw/aF and exp () represents the ceteris paribus wage
ratio between a virtually all-female occupation and a virtually all—male
occupation.' In the present formulation, then, the CW goal of making
        can be described as setting
         The average log wage for each sex is              and the male—
female difference in average log wages is

Since the goal of Cl is to eliminate the negative partial relationship
between wages and femaleness of occupation, we can obtain an upper bound
on CW's relative wage impact by determining how much D would be reduced
if the second term in equation (3) were eliminated by setting

 (The reasons why even comprehensive CW legislation is unlikely to reach
 this upper bound will be discussed below.) The next section describes
our efforts to estimate the 's and CW's potential impact.

                          II. irical Analysis
      To estimate equation (2), we use May 1978 Current Population
Survey (CPS) data on nonagricultural wage and salary workers, at least
16 years old, who responded to the supplementary questions concerning
their "usual weekly earnings" and "usual weekly hours. - Relative to
other surveys, the CPS has the advantage of detailed occupational
information on a large national sample. Relative to subsequent cs
samples that were asked the supplementary questions, the May 1978 sample
has the advantages of a larger size and a more "normal" unemployment
situation.
       The dependent variable in our regression analyses is the natural
logarithm of the ratio of usual weekly earnings to usual weekly hours.
This variable, W, averages 1.757 for the 24,056 men in our Sample and
1.346 for the 19,412 women. This implies that D in equation (3) is
l.757—l.346=.4fl, which means that the (geometric) mean wage for women
is 33.7 percent less than that for men. Our goal is to estimate how
much of this wage difference is attributable to femaleness of occupation
and how much to other factors.

       Our femaleness variable, F, is the proportion female in the
individual's three—digit occupation. Whenever possible, these values
were obtained from 1978 CPS data as reported in the January 1979
loyment and Earnings. In occupations for which the CPS cell sizes
were too small to allow publication, we had to extrapolate from 1970
census data. The resulting F variable ranges from less than .01 (for
                                      7


such categories as firefighters, autaDobile mechanics, and plumbers and
pipefitters) to over .99 (secretaries and housekeepers).
       The other variables, comprising the Z vector in equation (2).
are: years of school ccwpleted; potential work experience (age minus
years of school minus six) and its square; regional durilDy variables for
Northeast, North Central, and West; three dunies for residence in a
large, medium, or small SMSA; race dwirnies for black or other minority
race; dunes for voluntary and involuntary part-time work; two marital
status duzmiies, one for married and the other for separated, widowed, or
divorced; number of children and a duny for presence of children;
dunes for union membership and, if not a newber, coverage by a union
contract; a government employment dummy; dummies for 20 major industries
(mining, construction, durable goods manufacturing, etc., with private
households as the omitted category); the traction of workers in the
individual's occupation who worked less than 30 hours in the 1970 census
week; and a series of occupational characteristics indices, developed by
the staff of a National Research Council committee,' describing the
"general educational development," "specific vocational preparation,"
strength, physical demands, and undesirable environmental conditions
associated with the occupation. The corfl.ttee itself acknowledged that
these latter variables are arbitrary and of dubious validity; on the
other hand, they are qualitatively similar to the job evaluation scores
that would be applied under a CW policy and therefore ought to be
controlled for in the estimation of the 7'!.
       Indeed,   the general question of whether a variable should be
included in the I vector comes down to this issue of whether CW would

        'Miller et al. (1960, appendix F).
                                         8


 allow an ip1oyer to base pay on that variable. For example, the
 industry duimnies undoubtedly belong in the regressions because CW would
requir. equal pay f or work of comparable worth only within firms. Wage
differences between firms would not be covered, and a fortiori industry
wage differences would be unaffected. On the other hand, whether union
status belongs in Z depends on whether CW would permit an employer to
pay union workers in one occupation on a different basis than nonunion
workers in another occupation. Presumably, variables such as race and
marital status do not belong in the regressions except as proxies for
other characteristics that employers would be allowed to use. Given the
considerable azithiguity in the choice of Z variables, we will make
careful efforts in the analysis below to clarify how different control
variables affect the estimation of the 's.
          We begin by estimating, for each sex, simple regressions of W on
F.     The results, which describe the gross relationship between wages and

femaleness of occupation, are reported in columns 2 and 5 of Table 1.

For    men, the   estimated coefficient for F
                                                  m' is —.343, which implies a
.710    wage ratio between virtually all—female and all—male occupations.
For women, the estimated coefficient           is —.244, implying a .783 wage
ratio. These results       confirm Treiman and   Hartman's (1961) findings from
aggregate data that earnings are negatively related to femaleness of
occupation for both men and women and that the relationship is stronger
among men.
         These    estimates, however, take   no account of differences in
workers' characteristics or the characteristics of their jobs. Columns
3 and 6 in Table 1 report the results of estimating multiple regressions
of W on F controlling for the full Z vector described above. In
                                         9


general,the estimated coefficients of the control variables are
unrejarkable. It is worth mentioning, though, that th. coefficient
estimates for schooling and experience appear smaller than most in the
earnings function literature simply because the wage effects of
schooling and experience are partly absorbed by the coefficients of the
"general educational developnent" and "specific vocational preparation"
occupational variables.
        What is more striking is that the inclusion of the Z variables
reduces the estimated F coefficients by more than half. Pot men,
controlling for Z reduces the estimated coefficient of F from         .343
to 5"—.158; for women, the reduction is from f=.244 to 5=—.O9O. The
new coefficient estimate for men implies a .845 ceteris parthus wage
ratio between virtually all—female and all-wale occupations. The new
coefficient    estimate for women implies a ratio of .914.
        Two important questions arise concerning the interpretation of
these coefficient estimates. First, if we take the multiple regression
estimates at face value, what do they imply about the potential impact
of Cw? As discussed above, CW can be viewed as an attempt to set
           and thereby to eliminate the second term in equation (3) f or D,
the male—f ernale difference in average log wages. A simple computation
using   m'       and the sample means of      and Ff estimates this term to
be .029, as compared    to   a total D of .411. Given these estimates of the
's, then, even total elimination of aw/aF would reduce D by only about
7 percent. To put it another way, whereas the (geometric) mean      wage was


      'The "wrong" sign of some of the other occupational
characteristics' coefficient estimates is a common result (see Brown
(1980)).
                                       10


 previously 33.7 percent less for .uen than for men, eliminating aw/aF
 would merely change this figure to 31.8 percent.
       Of course, all this rests on our multiple regression estimates
 and        If instead we used the simple regression estimates      and
 we would estimate the second term of D to be .102. Even then, setting
       would leave most of D remaining, but the difference from the
 multiple regression implications is considerable. This raises the
 second question of how the inclusion of various control variables
affects the estimation of the 7's. To clarify the influences of
different variables, we use the fact (demonstrated in the appendix) that
the change from a simple to a multiple regression estimate of can be
expressed as

                    K
(4)      7_t=       =1


where the $'s are the estimated coefficients of the K control variables
in the log wage regression and the biF's are the coefficients from
auxiliary simple regressions of the control variables on P. Equation
(4) enables a straightforward decomposition of the difference 54 into
the parts attributable to each control variable.
         Table 2 suimnarizes the decompositions for       and          The
striking finding is that, for both men and women, the bulk of the
reduction from to 5 is due to the industry dunwoy variables. A closer
look at the underlying data reveals the main reason for this industry
effect: workers    in construction and manufacturing
                                                       (especially durables)
are   relatively well—paid given their other characteristics and are
predominantly male. Once the wage effect of belonging to these
                                       11


industries is separately accounted for, the remaining effect of
femaleness of occupation is considerably reduced.
       It is crucial to understand that, even if the relation between
wages and femaleness of industry arises from discriminatory exclusion
practices, CW would not remedy the resulting pay diff stances. As
discussed above, CW would require equal pay for work of comparable value
only within firms. Interindustry wage differences would be unaffected.
Consequently, the smaller estimates from the multiple regression
analyses are clearly better indicators of the potential impact of CW.
Indeed, if anything, they probably exaggerate OP s impact because they
control only for industry effects and not firm effects. Ia ideal data
base that enabled controls for firm effects as well could also take
account of CW's inability to alter pay differences between firms in the
SaDie industry.'
     Although of much less importance than the industry variables, the
duzrny variables for union membership and coverage account for about 15
percent of 4.      This   reflect! the facts that there is a large estimated
union/nonunion wage differential for both men and women and that union
organization is much more prevalent in Itis than in WJs. It is also
interesting to note that the portion of the average log wage
differential between men and women that can be attributed to these union
variables   is .30 x .209 + .03 x .113 — .15   x .214 — .04 x   .128 =   .028.

        'Treiman and Hartmann (1981, pp. 39—40) surrmiarize several
studies findings that, within occupations and industries, women tend to
be concentrated in lower—paying firms. 01 would not address this source
of wage differences. Indeed, if CW legislation were enacted, its
inapplicability to interfirm differences might be exploited through
business reorganizations. For example, a firm might "contract out"          its
female—dominated clerical functions to another firm to preclude pay
comparisons with its other job categories.
                                   1.2


nearly the same portion that we estimated as Cli's potential impact. In
other words, a policy that (somehow) eliminated the relative wage impact
of union membership and coverage would have about the same effect on the
female/male wage ratio as would economy—wide Cli legislation.
     It could certainly be argued that some of the variables included in
Table l's multiple regressions should in fact be excluded. For example,
a stringent CW law might require firms to pay their nonunionized
employees comparably with their unionized employees. If so, the
unionization variables should be excluded from the regressions.
Similarly, although some variables such as those for marital status may
proxy for legitimate determinants of pay, they may not belong in the
regressions in their own right.
     Therefore, to check the robustness of our estimates of aw/aF, we
have also estimated a parsimonious model that controls only for
schooling, experience, region, 5)6k, government employment, industry,
and occupational characteristics other than fraction part—time. The
results are very similar to those in the full model. For men, the
estimated   is —.176 (.015), as compared to —.168 in the full model.
For wnen, the estimated 7 is —.085 (.014), as compared to —.090.
Eliminating these 's through CW would reduce D, the male—female
difference in average log wages, by .085 x .71 —   .176   x .21   .023, even
less than the .029 estimated in the full model.
     The most important implication of these results is that, since Cli
would not apply across industries (or, indeed, across firms), it is
unlikely to eliminate a major fraction of the disparity between women's
and men's wages. If the model is estimated without the industry dummy
variables, the estimated 75 are somewhat greater, implying greater

 effects   from QL'• As far as       we know, however, interindustry wage

 equalization is beyond the scope of any proposed or imagined CW
 legislation.

           III. Differences between the Public and Private Sectors
       Most of the legislative and judicial activity with respect to ew
 hasbeen in the public sector. Several states and municipal governments
 have opted or been forced by the courts to adopt 01 procedures for
 determining pay scales across occupations, and a current bill in
 Congress calls for the same in the federal civil service. Legislation
applying CW to the entire economy (i.e., with the same coverage as the
Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act) seems at least
 several years from enactment. it is, therefore, interesting to see if
the negative ceteris paribus relation between wage rates and femaleness
of jobs is stronger in the public than in the private sector. Is there
an empirical justification for the current concentration of CW activity
in the public sector?
       Table 3 reports the estimated 's when the CPS sample is divided
into public and private employees. The simple and multiple regression
results in the first two rows are analogous to the full—sample results
in Table 1.11 For both men and women, the multiple regression estimates

       "In fact, the estimates of        in the full model exclusive of
industry dummy variables are —.210 (.015) for men and —.105 (.013) for
women, not drastically larger than those that do account for industry.
It turns out that the occupational characteristics variables are rather
highly correlated with industry and thus account for a large portion of
the reduction in when the industry variables are omitted.
       "One   surprising result in   Table 3 is that, for male public
employees, the simple regression estimate of 7 is much smaller in
magnitude than the multiple regression estimate. Equation (4)'s method
for assessing the influence of various control variables reveals large
positive values of       for years of school and the occupational
                                      14


of the 's are indeed larger in the public than the private sector,
although the differences are not statistically significant at
conventional levels. These     estimates imply that a CW—induced
elimination of ai/a   would reduce 1), the average male-female log wage

differential, by .042 in the public sector and .037 in the private
sector. Both of these figures are larger than our full—sample estimate
of .029, but they are still small relative to the public sector D of
.293 and the private sector D of .451.
     In the previous section, we argued that estimation of 's should
control for industry effects, but this is not entirely clear in the
public sector. A state government, for example, might declare that its
employees would be paid "comparably" across department lines —- in
public administration, hospitals, transportation, education, etc. To
explore this possibility, the third row of Table 3 reports the public
sector 's estimated without controlling for industry. These estimates
are considerably higher than those with industry controls, and they
imply that eliminating aw/a in the public sector would reduce that
sector's D by .064. On the other hand, all our public sector estimates
may exaggerate the impact of 0.1 because they do not control for
governmental unit. Even if a state government, for instance,
implemented CW across department lines, it would not have to pay
comparably to the federal government, municipalities, or other state
governments. Just as the previous section's estimates overlook 0.1's

characteristics indices. In other words, male government employees with
more education and higher—earning occupational characteristics tend to
work in occupations with relatively high fractions of women. Thus,
although the simple relation between W and F is small for this group,
the relation becomes much larger when schooling and occupational
characteristics are controlled for.

inability to affect wage differences between firms, this section's
public sector estimates overlook Ct?' s inapplicability to
intergovernmental wage differences.

                                IV. Conclusions
       This study has measured the relationship between wages and
femaleness of occupation. When relevant worker and job characteristics,
including industry effects, are controlled for, a negative relationship
between wages and femaleness of occupation still appears, in accordance
with the concerns of the comparable worth movement. The magnitude of
the relationship, however, implies a surprisingly small effect for a
comprehensive CW policy. Our main estimates indicate that, even if Ct?
succeeded in eliminating this negative relationship, the disparity
between   mean   male and female wages would be reduced by well under ten
percent of its current size, and we believe that, if anything, these
estimates overstate CW's impact. These findings may disappoint Ct?
advocates who expect Ct? to achieve drastic changes in the U.S. relative
wage structure; correspondingly, they may soothe the fears of Cli
opponents who view it as the worst idea since minimum wage legislation.
     At various points in the paper, we have presented statistical
calculations of CW's potential impact on the male—female wage
differential. These are useful for assessing CliPs initial effects, but
they should not be taken as predictions of its ultimate impact on the
relative earnings of men and women. The most plausible model of Clii's
long—run effects is one in which only a fraction of WJs are covered by
the law. (At present, CW activities are limited to a portion of the
public sector; even a comprehensive Ct? law would, like existing fair
employment legislation, be effectively confined to the public sector
                                    16


plus large private firms.) As Killingsworth (1984) and Ehrenberg and
Smith (1984) have noted, given downward-sloping demand curves, any
policy that raises the wages of covered WJs relative to M3s and
uncovered w3s will lower employment in the former relative to the
latter. Thus, CW would raise the wages of covered W3s, lower the wages
of uncovered WJs, and increase the fraction of all tlJs in the low—wage
uncovered sector.'2 Whether wlen in the aggregate would gain or lose,,
either in absolute terms or relative to men, depends on the size of the
relevant diand elasticities."

     ''This result is similar to those concerning the impact of unionism
and minimum wage legislation in 3obnson and Mieszkowski (1970) and Welch
(1914).
     "Recent   estimates of multi—factor partial elasticities of
complementarity, as in Grant and Hanermesh (1981), suggest that the
long—run demand elasticities may be rather high, in which case women
would lose froiit CL In addition, unless a comprehensive U'l law
contained strict provisos against "contracting out" (as described in
footnote 9), the reduction in WJs in the covered sector might be very
large indeed.

        The   full regression model is

        W•          •   +   ••

In what føllows, it will be convenient to eliminate the constant term by
interpreting all variables as deviations fran sample means. The simple
regression estimator of 7, omitting Z, is then

          •

We   wish to prove that the multiple           regression estimator of .     with Z
included, is

(Al)            -

where


        b=    Z'F(FP)l

is the vector of coefficients from auxiliary simple regressions of each
Z variable on F. Equation (Al) is equivalent to equation (4) in the
text.
        The multiple regression estimator of th. full parameter vector              is




        (p    = [ (F Z)]-1 (,)             W

Applying      Theil's (1971, p. 18) equation (2.15)        for inverses of
partitioned matrices shows that the one             in the above   expression   can be

written   as

Substitution of the full expressions for B and C into the expression for
