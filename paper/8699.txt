Mental Illness and the Demand for Alcohol, Cocaine and Cigarettes

JEL No. I1



                                              ABSTRACT


        The purpose of this paper is to estimate the effect that mental illness has on the demand for
addictive goods. Mental illness could affect the level of consumption of addictive goods and could affect
the price elasticities of addictive goods. Demand theory suggests that mental illness would affect
consumption if mental illness affected marginal utility. In addition, mental illness would affect the price
elasticity if mental illness affected the rate at which marginal utility diminishes. The empirical models
allow for endogeneity between mental illness and addictive consumption since prior research suggests
such a relationship. The results show that individuals with a history of mental illness are 25 percent more
likely to consume alcohol, 69 percent more likely to consume cocaine and 94 percent more likely to
consume cigarettes. Individuals with a history of mental illness are responsive to price although the price
elasticites differ somewhat from whose without mental illness. These results provide an added
justification for higher taxes and other supply reduction activities since they show that these policies are
effective with this high participation group. The results also suggest that an additional method of reducing
the consumption of addictive goods is to subsidize the treatment of mental illness.

1. Introduction

         While this paper is primarily intended for economists, the subject matter is, in part,

usually the domain of psychologists. As such, some definitions are needed from the outset. The

US Surgeon General (USDHHS, 1999) describes mental illness as abnormalities in cognition,

emotion, mood and social function. Almost everyone experiences these problems to some

degree. Mental illness is associated with an inappropriate level and duration of these problems.

What is inappropriate, and what is not, is derived from social norms and is neither objective nor

fixed. Despite these difficulties, a systematic approach to classification and diagnosis of mental

illness has been developed by the American Psychiatric Association. The definition and criteria

for diagnosis of specific mental illnesses are contained in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual

of Mental Disorders (DSM) (American Psychiatric Association, 1987). Substance abuse and

substance dependence refer to specific disorders defined in the DSM. Economists generally use

the term substance abuse more loosely to refer to a harmful level of consumption of addictive

goods. Since this paper relies on the definitions of mental illness provided by the DSM, the term

substance abuse is used only in its DSM context. However, mental illness is defined to exclude

substance abuse and substance dependence disorders since the inclusion of these disorders would

bias the mentally ill group to high addictive consumption.

         Diagnosable mental illness affects about 24 percent of the US population in any given

year, and about 43 percent of the population has had a diagnosable mental illness some time

during their lives.1 There is considerable correlation between mental illness and the consumption

of addictive goods.2 The 24 percent of the population with a current mental illness consumes

 Illicit drugs were limited to cocaine since the data set used in this study includes too few heroin users and there is
very limited price data for other illicit drugs.


                                                            2
about 38 percent of all the alcohol, 44 percent of all the cocaine and 40 percent of all cigarettes.

The 43 percent of the population who have had a period of mental illness sometime during their

lives consumes about 69 percent of all the alcohol, 84 percent of all the cocaine and 68 percent

of all cigarettes. Both consumption of addictive goods and mental illness are associated with

increased levels of mortality, physical illnesses, non-fatal accidents, lost income, reduced

productivity and emotional damage caused to children by afflicted parents (McGinnis and Foege,

1993, USDHHS, 1999).

        The interaction between the consumption of addictive goods and mental illness is a

complex process. Psychologists (see Kessler et al. 1996) have contributed greatly to this subject,

while the economics literature makes very limited reference to it. However, economists have

shown that price increases reduce the consumption of alcohol, illicit drugs, and tobacco as well

as outcomes related to the consumption of these goods. Economists should therefore be

interested in the interaction of mental illness and demand for these addictive goods. If mental

illness alters demand, then the affected individuals may be more or less responsive to higher

prices. If prices have less effect for this group, then treatment may be more important than tax

increases and other supply reduction policies for the mentally ill. Alternatively, individuals with

mental illness may be more affected by higher prices and be more responsive to tax increases and

other supply reduction policies. If this is true, then it is an added justification for higher taxes

and other supply reduction activities, since these policies target high consumption individuals.

        There have been prior studies by psychologists of the causality between mental illness

and addictive consumption. These studies suggest that causality between mental illness and

addictive consumption may go in both directions.3 Studies by Kessler et al. (1996) and Brady

and Sonne (1999) find that individuals with mental illness are more likely to develop an alcohol




                                                   3
or illicit drug disorder than other individuals. However, a review by NIAAA (USDHHS, 1993)

finds that alcohol use, at low doses may reduce certain psychiatric symptoms, but prolonged and

high dose alcohol consumption can have the opposite effect. Also a note by Leshner (2001)

argues that illicit drug use may be a factor in the onset of mental illness. A study by Lasser et al.

(2000) finds that mental illness increases the likelihood that an individual will smoke. However,

studies by Breslau and Klein (1999) and Wu and Anthony (1999) have found that tobacco can

have a causal effect on mental illness. None of these studies, nor any other prior studies which

account for mental illness, consider the potential effect of prices in altering the pathology of

these comorbidities.

           Prior studies of addictive consumption by economists have considered differentials in

price elasticities by use level and by demographic variables. Studies of alcohol demand by

Manning et. al. (1995) and Kenkel (1996) found that heavy drinkers were less responsive to price

changes than moderate drinkers. A study by Grossman, Chaloupka and Sirtalan (1998) finds that

heavy drinking by youth is more price responsive in the long run than in the short run. A study

of alcohol and cocaine demand by Saffer and Chaloupka (1999) for a number of demographic

groups finds negative price effects. Grossman and Chaloupka (1998) also found negative price

elasticities in a study of cocaine consumption by youth. The Report of the Surgeon General

(USDHHS, 2000) lists 38 studies which indicate that higher tobacco prices or taxes reduce

smoking for various demographic groups. None of these studies, nor any other prior studies

which account for price, consider the effects of mental illness.

           This paper has two goals. The first goal is to empirically examine the effect of mental

illness on the level of consumption of alcohol, cocaine and tobacco. Raw data indicate that

mental illness is associated with higher consumption of addictive goods. This may be due to

3
    Some psychological dysfunctions are organic in nature and thus would not be related to addictive consumption.

                                                           4
uncontrolled factors such as income or education. The research in this paper examines the effect

of mental illness holding other factors which affect addictive consumption constant and

controlling for reverse causality. The second goal is to empirically estimate the price elasticity

of alcohol, cocaine and tobacco for individuals with a history of mental illness.


2. The Empirical Model

       Mental illness could affect the marginal utility derived from consumption of addictive

goods. The reason for this is that consumption of addictive goods disrupts the flow of the

neurotransmitter, dopamine. This disruption is believed to be responsible for producing feelings

of pleasure and reward. Individuals with mental illness may derive a greater marginal utility

from these chemically induced feelings of pleasure and reward since they mask the symptoms of

mental illness. Mental illness could also affect the rate at which the marginal utility diminishes,

but there are no a priori expectations about the direction.

       A demand function can be derived from a utility function with an addictive good, a non-

addictive good and mental illness as arguments. In this utility function the marginal utility of

addictive consumption is assumed to be positive and diminishing and the marginal utility of

mental illness is assumed to be negative. The demand function is derived using a quadratic

utility function in Appendix I. The derivation shows that if mental illness increases the marginal

utility from consumption of the addictive good, then consumption will be higher. The model

also shows that if mental illness affects the rate at which marginal utility diminishes, then price

responsiveness will be affected.

       The empirical demand function takes the form:

                                      A = A(M, P, I, Z),      (1)




                                                  5
where A is the addictive good, and M is mental illness, P is the price of the addictive good, I is

income and Z are other relevant factors. Prior research has highlighted the potential endogeneity

between mental illness and addictive consumption. To account for endogeneity requires

specification of a probability of mental illness equation. The mental illness equation can be

interpreted as a production function and is analogous to a physical health production function

such as specified by Grossman (1972). In this case however, rather than physical, it is mental

and rather than health, it is illness that is “produced”.

                                       M = M(A, H, L, Y)               (2)

In this equation, mental illness is produced by the consumption of the addictive good, a family

history of mental illness H, stressful life events L, and other factors Y. Considerable research

(USDHHS, 1999, Kessler, 1997) shows that family history of mental illness and stressful life

events have a causal relationship to mental illness.


3. Data
          The empirical work employs the National Comorbidity Survey (NCS) with appended

price data. The NCS was a congressionally mandated survey designed to study mental illness in

the United States. The NCS uses the revised third edition DSM nomenclature to define mental

illness. The survey, conducted in 1991, included 8,098 respondents, although only 5,877

respondents were asked more detailed questions on family background and stressful life events.4

The NCS limited tobacco use questions to 4,411 respondents. Of these respondents, 2,897 were

asked detailed questions on family background and stressful life events.

          The NCS includes a series of detailed questions regarding alcohol, cocaine and tobacco

consumption. These questions have been used to define alcohol, cocaine and tobacco


4
 The data include respondents from age 15 to 54 with a fixed residence. About 4 percent of the sample was
interviewed in late 1990.


                                                        6
participation variables. These variables are each equal to zero for individuals who report that

during the past 12 months they did not participate and otherwise are equal to one.

        The price of alcohol was estimated from data taken from the Inter-City Cost of Living

Index, published quarterly by the American Chamber of Commerce Researchers Association

(ACCRA). The ACCRA data contain the price of standard brands of beer, wine and distilled

spirits. The ACCRA sample only a few stores in each location. Since beer prices vary widely

by store type and wine consumption is limited, distilled spirits price was selected as the price of

alcohol. The alcohol price was matched to the individual records in the NCS by county FIPS

code for 70 percent of the sample. Most of the remainder of the individuals were matched by

using the price from a similarly sized community in the same state. Only 3.4 percent of the

sample could not be matched by either method and were dropped from the alcohol regressions.

        The price of cocaine was estimated from the US Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement

Agency's STRIDE data set. The total cost, purity, weight and other information are recorded in the

STRIDE data set. Total cost can not simply be divided by number of grams to get price because

the price of a gram is lower for larger purchases. Variation in purity and imperfect information

about purity on the part of purchasers further complicate the issue. A regression of the log of total

cost on the log of weight, the log of purity, and dummy variables for city and year was estimated.

Imperfect information about purity is addressed by predicting purity based on the other regressors.

To identify the total cost model, the coefficient of the log of predicted purity is constrained to equal

the coefficient of the log of weight. The log of the price of one gram of pure cocaine is then given

as the sum of the intercept, the relevant city coefficients, and the relevant time coefficients. This

procedure eliminated variations in price or unit cost due to variations in weight or purity. The anti-

logarithm of this predicted price is the price of one unit of 100 percent pure cocaine. This price




                                                   7
was then divided by the intercity cost of living provided by the ACCRA. The cocaine price was

matched to the individual records in the NCS by county FIPS code for 64.3 percent of the

sample. The remainder of the individuals were matched by state using a weighted average price

computed using the MSA’s in the state.

         The cigarette price data come from the Tobacco Institute and are matched to the NCS

data by state. The price includes generic cigarettes and state and federal taxes. Since tax rates

change during the year, a weighted average state and federal tax was used. The weights

represent the proportion of the year the tax rate was in effect. The price and tax data are in cents

per pack.

         The component of the NCS that was used to collect data on mental illness is called the

Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI). The CIDI was developed by the National

Institute of Health, the World Health Organization and the University of Michigan and is a non-

clinician administered instrument which generates psychiatric diagnoses. The instrument has

undergone extensive testing for reliability and validity. The CIDI includes an extensive series of

questions which are used to define a series of dichotomous mental illness variables.5 A series of

12 non-substance related disorder groups are defined in the data set. These disorders are defined

for both past year occurrence and for occurrence anytime during the respondent's life. Two

dichotomous mental illness variables were defined as equal to one for the occurrence of any of

these 12 disorder groups during the past year and during the lifetime. The 12 disorder groups are

listed and described in Appendix 2. In this paper, an individual is defined as having a mental

illness if they met the criteria for any one of the 12 non-substance abuse disorders. Alcohol and

drug abuse and dependence refer to specific disorders defined in the DSM and are not included

5
 These mental illness variables were created in a recode of the original data done by the University of Michigan.
These mental illness variables are defined in accordance with DSM-III-R which was current during the data


                                                          8
in the definition of mental illness used in this paper. This distinction is necessary since the topic

of this paper is the interaction of addictive consumption and non-substance related mental illness.

Inclusion of addictive consumption disorders with other disorders would bias the mental illness

group towards high addictive consumption. While mental illness is defined as a dichotomous

variable, it is interpreted as an observable indicator for a continuous unobserved latent variable.

         A series of demographic variables are also defined from data collected in the NCS. A set

of dichotomous variables equal to one if the individual reports that they are Black is defined.

Also, a dichotomous gender variable is defined. A dichotomous measure equal to one for those

currently married or living together is also defined. Continuous age and age squared variables

are defined. A dichotomous religion variable is defined as equal to one if the respondent

indicates affiliation with any religion. Finally, a continuous income variable was defined.

         The NCS data set also contains information on the individual’s family history. There is

evidence (Kendler and Prescott, 1998) that genetic factors can affect an individual’s demand for

addictive goods. Studies of genetic factors predict that a family history of addiction problems

increases the probability of addiction problems.6 However, the environmental link is ambiguous.

Observing an alcohol or drug abusing parent may deter a child from following the same path.

Dichotomous parent alcohol abuse and dichotomous parent drug abuse variables were defined.

These variables are equal to one if the natural mother had a problem with alcohol or drugs.

         A family history of mental illness can also affect an individual's probability of mental

illness. However, this variable would not directly affect an individual's addictive consumption.

  Although the probability of addiction increases, most children brought up in a household with an alcohol or drug
abusing parent do not become abusers themselves.

A dichotomous variable equal to one if the natural mother had periods of depression is also

defined.7

           The NCS data set also contains information on stressful life events which may have

happened to the respondent. Ten stressful life event variables were defined. These variables

include measures of: sexual abuse, loss of close relationship, death of a relative, legal problems,

and poor physical health. Poor recall of events in the distant past or misreporting of these data

are possible. Summary definitions and mean values for all variables used are presented in table

1. The means are presented in table 1 for the full sample as well as for those with and without

past year and lifetime mental illness.



4. The Empirical Strategy

           The empirical work presented in this paper is designed to estimate the effect of mental

illness both on the level of consumption and price elasticity of alcohol, cocaine and tobacco.

Neither question is ideally answered with a single estimation technique. Two stage least squares

(TSLS) is an ideal technique for estimation of the effect of mental illness on addictive

consumption, controlling for endogeneity and holding constant other factors such as

demographic variables. Differential price elasticites can also be estimated with TSLS but this

requires a mental illness interaction term which creates two endogenous right hand side

variables. In addition, all of the variables in the demand function may differ between individuals

with and without mental illness. To allow for this possibility, every variable would have to be

interacted with mental illness creating a series of endogenous variables and an unlikely

estimation problem. A more attractive method of estimating differential price elasticites is to

divide the sample into two groups. The Heckman sample selection model is appropriate since

7
    There is a parallel question on father's depression but it has too many missing values for inclusion.

                                                             10
sample selection may be endogenous. This model allows for all the coefficients to differ

between the two groups. Likelihood ratio tests can be performed to determine the need for

estimation of separate equations. However, TSLS models are still preferred for answering the

question about levels of consumption since selection models do not include a mental illness

variable.8 A comparison of constants from the selection model is imperfect since the constant

term reflects the effects of all excluded variables. The best alternative is to include a variable for

mental illness which is done in the TSLS models.

            Identification is an important issue in the estimation of any simultaneous model. An

intuitive understanding of identification in the model presented in this paper is dependent on the

definition of mental illness. Since mental illness is not a usual variable in economic research,

some added discussion of the concept may be useful. Mental illness is a common occurrence

with about a quarter of the population affected each year and with many individuals recovering

without any intervention. This is because mental illness includes minor as well as major

problems. An extensive definition is presented in Appendix 2. The specification of equations 1

and 2 models the path of causation from a family history of mental illness and stressful life

events to mental illness. That is, the mental illness problems of the parents and the individual’s

stressful life events will increase the probability of mental illness in the individual. The

individual’s probability of consuming addictive goods may increase as a result of mental illness.

These relationships are illustrated in figure 1. This specification assumes that a family history of

mental illness and stressful life events do not directly enter the addictive good demand function.

These variables have an indirect affect on addictive consumption through their effect on mental

illness. Family history and stressful life events have a direct effect on mental illness, and mental

illness has a direct effect on addictive consumption.

8
    Lambda can be interpreted as proportional to the inverse of the probability that the individual is mentally ill.

                                                              11
        An alternative view assumes that diagnosable mental illness is primarily a reflection of

serious problems. In this case, some stressful life events might not precipitate mental illness but

might increase the demand for addictive goods. In this alternative specification stressful life

events enter both the addictive good demand function and the mental illness function. The path

of causation is illustrated with a question mark in figure 1. This specification is identified since

the price of the addictive good enters only the demand curve and a family history of mental

illness enters only the mental illness function. For these instruments to be valid they should have

no added effect in the structural addictive demand equation. The validity of this specification is

examined with a test for an overidentfied model proposed by Davidson and MacKinnon (1993).



5. Results

        The first empirical issue which needs to be addressed is the potential endogeneity of

mental illness and addictive consumption. A Wu-Hausman test was performed for each of the

three addictive goods to test for endogeneity. For each good, two sets of Wu-Hausman tests

were performed by predicting both dependent variables with reduced form equations and

including the predicted values, along with the actual values, in the structural equations.9 Both

structural equations were then estimated with OLS. The predicted mental illness variables were

significant in the alcohol and cigarette demand functions, but not in the cocaine demand

function. The second set of tests were performed by including the predicted addictive

consumption variable in the mental illness structural equation. These tests never rejected

exogeneity. However, since causality must go in either one or both directions, there is enough



9
 Angrist (2000) and Heckman and MaCurdy (1985) show that TSLS is an acceptable method of estimation in cases
of endogenous dichotomous dependent variables. All of the functions were estimated with robust standard errors,
clustered on state, to account for unobserved state level heterogeneity.


                                                      12
evidence to conclude that there is endogeneity with mental illness in cases of alcohol and

cigarettes.

        The failure to find evidence of endogeneity for cocaine might be due to the low

prevalence of cocaine use. Only about two percent of the sample used cocaine in the past year.

However, about 24 percent of the sample had a mental illness in the past year and 43 percent had

a mental illness sometime during their lives. Even if every cocaine user were mentally ill they

would comprise only eight percent of all past year mentally ill individuals and four percent of all

lifetime mentally ill individuals. That is, cocaine use is so minor a factor compared to other

causes of mental illness that the exogeneity hypothesis can not be rejected.

        The first theoretical question that this paper seeks to answer is the effect of mental illness

on alcohol, cocaine and cigarettes participation. To examine the effect of mental illness on

addictive good participation, TSLS models were estimated for alcohol and cigarettes and probit

models were estimated for cocaine. All of the demand functions include either a past year or

lifetime mental illness variable. The results are presented in table 2. The mental illness

coefficients represent the increase in the probability of participation when the dichotomous

mental illness variable switches from zero to one. These coefficients are all positive and

generally significant and are presented in table 2. A somewhat more intuitive concept results

when the marginal effects are divided by the mean addictive good participation rate. The result

is the percentage increase in the participation rate for those with mental illness over those

without mental illness. Past year mental illness is found to increase alcohol participation by

about 20 percent, and lifetime mental illness is found to increase alcohol participation by about

25 percent. For cocaine, the increases are 27 percent and 69 percent, respectively. For

cigarettes, the increases are 86 percent and 94 percent, respectively.




                                                  13
       The TSLS estimates also include the effects of price and other variables on addictive

good participation. This is interesting because the NCS data have never been used to estimate

addictive good demand functions. The price-participation elasticities are .43, .66 and .70, for

alcohol, cocaine and cigarettes, respectively. The other independent variables are similar to prior

empirical studies and are examined in the selection models presented below. One variable

which has not been included in prior addictive demand studies is the effect of a family history of

problems with the addictive good. The results show that a family history of alcohol problems

has a positive effect on alcohol participation and a family history of drug problems has a positive

effect on cocaine participation. There was no data on family history of problems with tobacco in

the NCS data set.

       The TSLS estimates can also be used to examine the alternative specification which

includes stressful life events and family history of mental illness in both the demand and the

mental illness functions. For these instruments to be valid they should have no added effect in

the structural addictive demand equations. A test of validity proposed by Davidson and

MacKinnon (1993) for an overidentfied model is to regress the residuals from the structural

equation on the instrumental variables and calculate nR2, which is distributed as a chi-squared

density function. This test was performed for all addictive participation functions, and the null

hypothesis of independence between the instrumental variables and the error term could not be

rejected. That is, the exclusion of stressful life events and family history of mental illness in the

addictive demand functions is valid. Additional estimation with this specification produced

results that were very similar to the specification which excludes stressful life events from the

demand functions. Based on these results, the alternative specification is rejected in favor of the

specification which is presented in tables 2 through 5.




                                                  14
         The second question that this paper seeks to answer is the effect of mental illness on

alcohol, cocaine and cigarettes price elasticites. To answer this question Heckman selection

models for alcohol, cocaine and cigarette participation were estimated. These results are

presented in tables 3, 4 and 5, respectively.10 Each table contains demand functions for those

with and without both past year and lifetime mental illness. These tables also present the

selection equation for past year and lifetime mental illness which is the reduced form mental

illness equation from structural equations (1) and (2) described above. Each demand function

contains the parameter, rho, which is proportional to the coefficient of lambda and measures the

correlation between the error terms in the demand function and the selection equation. A

significant value for rho is evidence of endogenous selection. Each table also presents the results

for two likelihood ratio tests for each pair of demand functions. The first likelihood ratio statistic

tests for a significant difference between the price coefficients and the second likelihood ratio

statistic tests for a significant difference between the coefficients of all the included regressors.

         The next empirical issue is whether different demand functions are needed for those with

and without mental illness and if so, is selection endogenous? The likelihood ratio tests indicate

that the demand functions in all cases are significantly different between the two groups. These

results imply that separate demand functions for those with and without mental illness are

needed. Rho is significant for one equation in the alcohol and cocaine regressions. For

cigarettes, however, rho is significant in all equations. Since at least one demand function in

each pair for alcohol and cigarettes shows evidence of endogenous selection, to be consistent, all

  Since these models all have dichotomous dependent variables in both the demand function and the selection
function, they are estimated with the Heckprob procedure in Stata, using robust standard errors clustered on state.


                                                         15
regressions are estimated as endogenous selection models.11 Inclusion of an insignificant lambda

does not bias the other variables.

         For alcohol participation, the price elasticites for both mental illness groups are larger

than the corresponding coefficients for those without mental illness. For cocaine, one case has

an insignificant price coefficient and should be ignored. In the other case, mental illness reduces

price elasticity. For cigarettes the results are mixed, higher in one case and lower in the other.

These results show that individuals with mental illness are price responsive and that the

elasticities are not substantively different from those who are not in the mentally ill group.

         It is also interesting to examine the marginal effects for the other independent variables

since they also differ between those with and without mental illness. The most interesting results

are for religious adherence and for family history. Religious adherence has a negative effect on

addictive consumption and it is a larger negative effect for those with mental illness. Family

history increases consumption of alcohol and cocaine for the mentally ill, but the effect tends to

be weaker for those without mental illness. Gender, race, income, age and education mirror the

results found in other studies of these goods with no systematic pattern across all three

substances for those with and without mental illness.

         Finally, tables 3, 4 and 5 present results for the mental illness reduced form equations.

They are all very similar across the three substances and for past year and lifetime mental illness.

These are interesting results since there are no prior studies of mental illness production

functions in the health economics literature. Prior studies of mental illness in health economics

have mostly considered treatment payment options or the effects of mental illness on income and


11
  The evidence of endogeneity between mental illness and addictive consumption is stronger than the evidence of
endogenous selection. In the former case the problem is correlation of error terms across structural equations and in
the latter case the problem is correlation between the error terms of a reduced form equation and a structural
equation.

work. This prior work does point to the potential endogeneity between mental illness and some

of the included variables. Since this paper focuses on addictive consumption, the potential

endogeneity between mental illness and other variables such as income and education is not

addressed. Because of these biases, these estimation results should be viewed as only suggestive

of the relationships.

       The mental illness reduced form equations correctly predict the dichotomous mental

illness variables for about 70 percent of the sample. Income, education and marriage have a

negative effect on mental illness. Age has a parabolic relationship to mental illness indicating

that the onset of metal illness decreases after the age of 40. Women are more likely to have a

current year mental illness than men. However, there is no gender difference for lifetime mental

illness. Being black also has a negative effect on lifetime mental illness but no effect on past year

mental illness. The other variables include family history of depression and stressful life events

including poor physical health. A depressed mother has a significantly positive effect on mental

illness. The stressful life events and poor physical health are generally positive and significant,

although the effects are stronger for past year mental illness.



6. Conclusions

       Economists have recommended price increases as a tool to reduce the consumption of

addictive goods and their related costs. However, no research has specifically examined the

interaction of price and mental illness on addictive consumption. The primary goals of this paper

were to determine whether mental illness has any effect on the level of consumption of addictive

goods or on the price elasticity of addictive goods. The empirical models allow for the

possibility of endogeneity between mental illness and addictive consumption. The empirical




                                                 17
results show that mental illness increases participation in addictive goods and that mental illness

has no substantive effect on the price elasticity. These results suggest that alcohol and tobacco

taxes and drug interdiction are effective with this high participation group. The results also

suggest that an additional method of reducing consumption of addictive goods is to treat, or

subsidize the treatment of, mental illness.

                                            Derivation of the Demand Function

            The individual maximizes the following utility function subject to an income constraint:

Max : U ( A, X , M )
ST : PA + X = I .

To derive the demand curve, let the utility function be quadratic in A.

            1
U t = α1 A − α 2 A2 − α 3 M + α 4 X .
            2

A is consumption of the addictive good, with corresponding price P, X is consumption of the non-

addictive good, with price normalized to one, I is current income, and M represents mental illness.

In addition, the following restrictions are imposed on the parameters:

       ∂U
Ua =        = α1 − α 2 A > 0
       ∂A
        ∂ 2U
U aa =        = −α 2 < 0
        ∂A 2
       ∂U
Um =         = −α 3 < 0.
       ∂M

The first and second conditions indicate positive but diminishing marginal utility of addictive

consumption. The third condition shows that mental illness reduces utility. Furthermore, the

marginal utility of current consumption and the extent to which it diminishes may vary with mental

illness. To allow for this possibility, let α1 and α2 depend on M:

α1 = δ 1 + δ 2 M
α 2 = θ1 − θ 2 M .

If δ2 and θ2 are positive parameters, then mental illness raises marginal utility and lowers the rate at

which it diminishes. The first-order condition for maximization with respect to A is:12

     δ 1 + δ 2 M − (θ 1 − θ 2 M ) A = λP.



12
     λ is the marginal utility of income.
                                                           27
Solving this condition for A yields the following current period demand for the addictive good,

A = ψ 1 (M ) −ψ 2 (M )P

where,

     δ1 + δ 2 M
ψ1 =            >0
     θ1 − θ 2 M
         λ
ψ2 =            > 0.
     θ1 − θ 2 M

         Holding all else constant, ψ1 represents the effect of mental illness on consumption. Mental

illness has a positive effect on consumption if current marginal utility is higher or if marginal utility

diminishes less for mentally ill individuals.

         The effect of mental illness on the price responsiveness of consumption is given by the

following derivative:


      ∂2 A    ∂ψ 2
           =−      .
     ∂P∂M     ∂M

If mental illness reduces the rate at which marginal utility diminishes such that θ2 is positive, then

the price effect, given by negative ψ2, rises in absolute value. In this case, mentally ill individuals

will be more responsive to price. If, on the other hand, the extent of diminishing marginal utility is

greater for the mentally ill, then the price effect is smaller in absolute value and this group will be

less price responsive.13


13
   The above analysis applies to a continuous measure of consumption. Since the dependent variable used in this study
is dichotomous for participation, it is not appropriate to analyze the effects with differential calculus. The reservation
price π, defined by evaluating the marginal utility of A at A=0, equals δ1 + δ2M. Optimal consumption is zero if π<λP
or if π*<P, where π*=π/λ is the reservation price expressed in dollars. If mentally ill individuals have a higher marginal
utility, they will have a higher reservation price. They will therefore be more likely to participate. Furthermore, if the
mentally ill individual is initially not participating because π*<P, then the decline in P required to shift the status from
non-participation to participation is smaller than if the individual were not mentally ill and had a lower reservation
price. Thus, mental illness also tends to increase the participation response with respect to actual price.

                    Psychiatric Disorders from the National Comorbidity Survey

The following disorders are defined as dichotomous in the NCS data set. The mental illness
variable used in this study was defined as equal to one if any of these disorders were present:

1) Generalized anxiety disorder is defined by a protracted period of anxiety and worry,
accompanied by multiple associated symptoms. These symptoms include muscle tension, easily
fatigued, poor concentration, insomnia and irritability.

2) Social Phobia describes people with marked and persistent anxiety in social situations, including
performances and public speaking. The critical element of the fearfulness is the possibility of
embarrassment or ridicule.

3) Simple Phobia include common conditions which are characterized by marked fear of specific
objects or situations. Exposure to either the object of the phobia, either in real life or via
imagination or video, invariably elicits intense anxiety, which may include a panic attack

4) Panic Attack is a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort that is associated with numerous
somatic and cognitive symptoms. These symptoms include palpitations, sweating, trembling,
shortness of breath, sensations of choking or smothering, chest pains, nausea or gastrointestinal
distress, dizziness or lightheadedness, tingling sensations and chills or blushing and hot flashes.
The experience generally provokes a strong urge to flee or escape from the place where the attack
began.

5) Panic Disorder is diagnosed when a person has experienced at least two unexpected panic attacks
and develops persistent concern or worry about having further attacks or changes his or her
behavior to avoid or minimize such attacks.

6) Agoraphobia comes from the ancient Greek meaning a fear of an open marketplace.
Agoraphobia today describes severe and pervasive anxiety about being in situations from which
escape might be difficult or avoidance of situations such as being alone outside of home, traveling
in a car, bus or airplane, or being in a crowded area.

7) Post traumatic stress disorder refers to the anxiety and behavioral disturbances and functional
impairment which develop after exposure to an extreme trauma, such as rape, other severe physical
assault, near death experience, witness to murder and combat, and which persist for more than a
month.

8) Major depression features one or more major depressive episodes each of which lasts at least two
weeks. The symptoms of major depression include expressed mood and loss of interest or pleasure.
Other symptoms vary but might include sleep disorders, unusual weight changes, psychomotor
changes, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, diminished ability to concentrate and thoughts of death.

9) Dysthymia is a chronic form of depression. Its early onset and unrelenting, smoldering course
are among the features that distinguish it from major depressive disorder. It is sometimes
associated with passive, avoident and dependent traits. There are less symptoms required than there
