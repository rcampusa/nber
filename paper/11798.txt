Foreign Subsidization and Excess Capacity

                                           ABSTRACT

The U.S. steel industry has long held that foreign subsidization and excess capacity has led to its
long-run demise, yet no one has formally examined this hypothesis. In this paper, we incorporate
foreign subsidization considerations into a model based on Staiger and Wolak’s (1992)
cyclical-dumping framework and illustrate testable implications of both cyclical excess capacity and
structural excess capacity stemming from foreign subsidization. We then use detailed product- and
foreign country-level data on steel exports to the U.S. market from 1979 through 2002 to estimate
these excess capacity effects. The results provide strong evidence of both cyclical and structural
excess capacity effects for exports to the U.S. market. However, the effects are confined to such a
narrow range of country-product combinations that it is unlikely that such effects were a significant
factor in the fortunes of U.S. steel firms over the past decades.

1. Introduction

        For decades, the U.S. steel industry has long held that distortionary policies of

foreign governments have led to its long-run demise. The main argument, as described and

developed by Howell et al. (1988), is that foreign government subsidies cause foreign

producers to have excess capacities. High protective trade barriers in foreign countries allow

the foreign producers to sell at high prices in their own market and then dump the excess on

the U.S. The understandable reaction of the U.S. government is to erect antidumping and

countervailing duty laws, safeguard actions, etc., to protect the U.S. industry from such

behavior. (Mastel, 1999)

        Most economists have dismissed the effect of foreign subsidization and excess

capacity and, instead, point to other factors as responsible for the long-run decline in

employment in U.S. steel. For example, Oster (1982) documents the slow adoption of new

technologies by the U.S. steel industry. A related trend has been the rise of minimill steel

production, which uses scrap metal in a steel production process that is indisputably lower

cost than integrated mills, but has historically produced lower quality steel.1 Crandall (1996),

Moore (1996), and Tornell (1996) have argued that minimill production may be more

important for explaining the decline of large integrated steel producers in the U.S. than

imports. Alternatively, Tornell (1996) provides a model and evidence suggesting that

powerful labor unions have been able to appropriate rents to such an extent that U.S. steel

1
 Over time, minimill production has successively innovated into making increasingly higher-quality steel
products which likely puts even more pressure on traditional integrated steel mills.

firms have rationally disinvested over time. Finally, economists have suggested a familiar

political theme to the steel industry’s history of trade protection. Lenway et al. (1996) and

Morck et al. (2001) find evidence that the firms that lobby for protection are typically larger,

less efficient, less innovative, pay higher wages, and habitually seek protection versus firms

that do not lobby. A natural conclusion is that trade protection is not to prevent unfair

competition, but rather the result of rent-seeking activities by less-efficient and non-

competitive firms.

        Rather than simply dismiss the steel industry’s arguments, this paper considers

excess capacity effects and examines whether the data support that such effects occur

and, if so, are having a significant effect on the U.S. steel industry. In addressing this

issue, we find it is important to distinguish between cyclical excess capacity and

structural excess capacity. A model of cyclical excess capacity is developed by Staiger

and Wolak (1992) in which a foreign monopolist supplies its own protected home market,

but may also export to a competitive market. The foreign monopolist is assumed to have

two costs – production and capacity. The export price lies above the (short-run)

production costs, but below the total (long-run) production plus capacity costs. Capacity

decisions are made before the production decision, and the foreign firm’s domestic market

experiences random demand shocks. This can lead to short-run (or cyclical) excess capacity

in low demand periods that is then sold at market-clearing prices in the competitive export

market and provides an explanation for rational cyclical dumping by the foreign firm.

        Foreign subsidization is not modeled in the Staiger and Wolak framework and, thus,

obviously not a necessary element for cyclical excess capacity effects. We modify the model

to consider the effects of subsidization by a foreign government and demonstrate that foreign

subsidization leads foreign firms to invest in more capacity than without subsidization. This



                                                3
increases the likelihood and/or increases the volume of their exports to the U.S. market. We

term this the structural excess capacity effect. We also demonstrate that such foreign

subsidization can exacerbate cyclical excess capacity effects.

         To our knowledge, there are only a few studies that have empirically tested for

positive export supply responses to negative domestic demand shocks (i.e., cyclical excess

capacity effects)2, and none that have formally tested for the effects of foreign subsidization

(structural excess capacity effects).3 The latter hypothesis is difficult to examine due to data

availability on foreign subsidization programs. However, the U.S. steel industry has filed

hundreds of countervailing duty (CVD) investigations to identify and quantify the effects of

foreign government subsidization against a fairly exhaustive list of relevant steel products

and foreign country sources over the past decades. As a part of these CVD investigations, the

relevant U.S. agencies publicly document a history of all foreign government subsidization

practices in each case. They also provide estimates of the value of each subsidy program as a

percent of the firm’s export sales and determine which ones are significant enough to cause

injury to the domestic industry. These data provide a unique opportunity to directly estimate

the effects of purported foreign subsidy programs on foreign exports to the U.S. market.

         We test for both cyclical and structural excess-capacity-related effects using data on

exports of 37 different steel products from 22 different foreign countries to the U.S. market


2
  The most closely related empirical literature are papers that examine whether export supply increases
when domestic industries have excess capacity during low-domestic-demand periods. For example,
Dunlevy (1980) finds that “export sales are inversely related to the pressure on domestic capacity” (p. 131)
in an examination of aggregate export behavior for the U.S. and the United Kingdom. Yamawaki (1984)
finds evidence in support of the hypothesis that Japanese steel export prices are lower in periods of excess
capacity. Crowley (2006) develops a model where firms dump into export into foreign markets when home
demand is low and shows that the foreign government improves foreign welfare in such situations with an
antidumping duty (AD). Her empirical analysis shows that the U.S. government agencies are more likely
to rule affirmatively when foreign demand is weak. She does not test directly for cyclical dumping effects
from negative home demand shocks.
3
  Howell et al. (1988) and U.S. countervailing duty (CVD) investigations provide figures on purported
foreign subsidies in the steel industry, but does not examine how such subsidies affect market outcomes,
particularly the supply of steel to the U.S. market.

from 1979 through 2002. Our statistical estimates provide evidence for cyclical excess

capacity effects on exports to the U.S. markets. We also find statistical evidence of

structural excess capacity effects -- foreign subsidization significantly increases export

volumes to the U.S. Importantly, however, we find these excess capacity effects to be quite

isolated in exports to the U.S. steel market. We find such effects only for less-developed

country sources in our data, particularly the Latin American countries of Argentina, Brazil,

and Venezuela, which account for a small share of U.S. steel consumption. The very narrow

scope of these excess capacity effects in the U.S. steel market make it unlikely to be a

significant source of the U.S. steelmakers troubles over the past few decades.

         The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we present a simple version of

the Staiger and Wolak (1992) model to illustrate cyclical excess capacity effects on steel

exports to the U.S. market. We then extend the model to draw out structural excess

capacity implications of foreign subsidization. Section 3 discusses the detailed data on

foreign subsidization that has come out of hundreds of U.S. CVD steel cases for the past

few decades and whether an initial look at the data suggests that foreign subsidization

may significantly impact the U.S. steel market. Sections 4 and 5 describe the statistical

approach we use to examine our excess-capacity hypotheses and present our results,

respectively.



2. Conceptual Framework

        This section presents a simple version of the cyclical-dumping model in Staiger and

Wolak (1992) and shows how demand shocks in the foreign firm’s domestic market (foreign

demand) can lead to cyclical dumping of excess capacity into the U.S. (export) market. We

then introduce foreign subsidies into the model and illustrate how foreign subsidization leads



                                               5
to testable implications about the probability and magnitude of exports, as well as the

responsiveness of foreign export supply to the U.S. market to foreign demand shocks.

          Following Staiger and Wolak (1992), there is a foreign firm which is a monopolist in

its own domestic market, but which may also sell products to the export (hereinafter, the

U.S.) market. The demand function in the foreign firm’s own market is a simple linear

function of price, wherein the intercept (α) is an i.i.d. random variable. That is, demand is

given by Q F = α − P F , where QF and PF are quantity and price for the foreign market,

respectively. In the U.S. market, the foreign firm is a price-taker facing an exogenously-

given price.4 Short-run marginal costs (c) are constant until capacity is reached, at which

point marginal costs are infinite.5 Capacity costs are assumed to be increasing in capacity

and represented by a simple quadratic function, η0 K + η1 K 2 , where η0 ,η1 >0.6

           The timing of decisions is as follows. The foreign firm first makes its capacity

decision before the demand shock is realized. After the demand shock is realized, the foreign

firm chooses how much to produce and sell in its own domestic market and export to the U.S.

market.



2.1. Capacity Choice

          Capacity decisions are made prior to the realization of the foreign firm’s domestic

demand level. Modeling of the capacity decision is based then on expected profits, with an


4
  The assumption of an exogenously-given U.S. price differs from Staiger and Wolak (1992), which
assumes that the U.S. price is determined through market competition between the foreign firm and a
competitive fringe in the U.S. market. As discussed below, the very small market shares of individual
foreign-country import sources in the U.S. steel market (i.e., the foreign firm is a fringe player in the U.S.
market) makes the assumption of an exogenously-determined U.S. price from the perspective of the foreign
firm a reasonable one. Such an assumption also makes the model much easier to solve and describe.
5
  We make this assumption for simplicity, but would obtain similar implications for increasing marginal
costs, provided such costs approach infinity as production nears capacity.
6
  This is a second modification of the Staiger and Wolak set-up, which assumed linear capacity costs. This
treatment allows for closed-form solutions.


                                                      6
expected value of the demand level defined by α e . Expected profits are maximized with

choices of the capacity level (K) and the domestic output level (QF) and the export level (QE).

That is, the firm solves the following expected profit maximization problem:

         Max Eπ = (α e − Q F )Q F − cQ F + ( PUS − c)QUS − η0 K − η1 K 2
       K , Q F , QUS
                                                                                                       (1)
                                                                        subject to K ≥ Q + Q .
                                                                                         F      US



The optimal domestic output and export levels chosen at this stage are planned levels that can

be changed after demand is realized in the foreign firm’s market. In contrast, we assume that

the optimal capacity choice chosen in this stage cannot be changed after demand is realized.

        We initially focus on the case where the U.S. price is large enough to warrant sales

given capacity i.e., PUS − c > 0, but not so large as to warrant capacity investment in its own

right; i.e., PUS − c −η0 < 0. 7 This assumption means that the foreign firm will not build

capacity intended for production and sales to the U.S. market given expected foreign demand.

This follows assumptions in Staiger and Wolak (1992) and the steel industry’s arguments that

these foreign suppliers would not export to the U.S. under normal circumstances. The

optimal capacity decision in this case, K*, equates marginal revenue with (long-run) marginal

costs defined by production costs and marginal capacity costs, yielding the following

condition:

                                        *   (α e − c −η0 )
                              K * = QF =                                    .                         (2)
                                                             (2(1 + η1 ))

As would be expected, capacity and, hence, expected output increases in the expected

demand intercept, and falls with increases in production costs and capacity costs.




7
 As we discuss later, one effect of subsidies can be to affect the capacity from a case in which the firm
does not consider the US market in its investment decisions to a case where it does. This is developed and
discussed later.


                                                    7
        Figure 1 depicts the optimal capacity decision under these assumptions, where the

price is below long-run marginal costs (production plus capacity costs – c+η0), but above

marginal production costs (c). Long-run marginal costs intersect with expected marginal

revenue at point A, yielding an optimal capacity of K*.



2.2. Production and Export Decision

        In the second period, the foreign demand parameter is realized (which we note as α ),

and the foreign firm maximizes current profits by choosing the level of output in its own

domestic market (QF) and exports to the U.S. market (QUS), given it’s optimal capacity choice

in the first period (denoted as K*). In this case, the capacity decision is made and the demand

shock is realized. Profits are defined by:

         Max
         F US
              π = (α − Q F )Q F − cQ F + ( PUS − c)QUS subject to Q F + QUS ≤ K *,               (3)
        Q ,Q



        Solving (3), it is easy to see (and show) that the foreign firm’s output is determined

by selling all of the output that can be produced given capacity in its domestic market (i.e.,
   *
Q F = K * ) or by allocating capacity between its domestic market and the U.S. market (i.e.,

   *   α − PUS          *            *         α − PUS
QF =             and QUS = K * − Q F = K * −             ). For realizations of the demand
          2                                         2

parameter greater or equal to the expected demand ( α e ≤ α ) it is clear that all production

will be sold in the foreign market with no export sales. However, for low enough realizations

of demand below expected demand, the firm may divert export sales to the U.S. market.

Such export sales would be considered dumping under a cost-based definition as the U.S.




                                                8
price is below the firm’s long-run marginal costs, and this is then what we call cyclical

excess capacity (or cyclical dumping) effects.8

        Figure 2 depicts outcomes for various foreign demand realizations. MRExpected in

Figure 2 represents the marginal revenue schedule when the realized foreign market demand

exactly equals the expected value (α=αe) and the equilibrium production occurs at point A.

Note that the equilibrium occurs at an intersection point above the constant marginal costs of

production (c), since the firm must also cover per-unit capacity costs which are not shown

explicitly in the Figure 2. Given our assumptions on the firm’s marginal costs relative to the

U.S. price, the firm sells all its production to its own foreign market in this case and none to

the U.S. market.

        Now consider other possible demand realizations. For any demand realizations

where the associated foreign marginal revenue schedule is above marginal revenue in the

export market (PUS) out to the given capacity (K*), it is clear that the foreign firm sells all

production into the foreign market. This is true for both MRHigh and MRExpected in the figure.

For a low enough demand realization, represented by MRLow, the marginal revenue in the

foreign market is below the marginal revenue from sales in the U.S. market after point D, and

the firm optimally ships dumped exports (represented by the distance between points C and

D) to the U.S. market, while selling the remaining production (distance between the vertical

axis and point D) to the foreign market. Thus, while the U.S. price cannot cover both

production and long-run capacity costs on its own, the firm will rationally choose to sell into

the U.S. market in the short-run for unexpectedly low demand realizations.




8
  We note that such export behavior would also be considered dumping under a price-based definition in
this model, provided the equilibrium foreign price is above the U.S. price.


                                                    9
2.3. Government Subsidies

         We now consider how government subsidization affects the firm’s choices and

market outcomes in this model. We assume government subsidization comes in the form of

capacity subsidization and specifically model such a subsidy (s>0) as entering the capacity

cost term in the following manner: (η0 − s ) K + η1 K 2 .9 This simple setup illustrates that

subsidies directly reduce capacity costs. The resulting objective functions and equilibrium

solutions are the same as above after substituting η0-s for η0. It is straightforward then to

show that capacity is increasing in the level of the subsidy. If the subsidy is large enough

such that PUS − c − (η0 − s ) > 0 then the original capacity decision results in planned exports

(sales to the US). This is depicted in Figure 3, where the subsidization drives the capacity

choice out to KS* (from a non-subsidized capacity of KNS*), such that exports to the U.S. will

occur even when realized foreign demand equals expected demand. In this case, the firm

would export the production represented by the distance between E and F for a realized

demand equal to the expected demand (MRExpected schedule). This is then what we term a

structural excess capacity effect on U.S. exports from this foreign market.

         Interestingly, the model shows that foreign subsidization (the source of structural

excess capacity) can also exacerbate the cyclical excess capacity effects. In comparing

demand shocks around KNS* (no subsidization) to KS* (subsidization) in Figure 3, the range

of foreign demand realizations where the firm would be serving only the foreign firm’s own

market is much smaller in the case of subsidization. Thus, there will be greater range of



9
  Many of the foreign subsidization programs found in CVD investigations are connected with capacity
costs, such as equity infusions to rescue failing firms. However, export and production subsidies are also
considered as well in CVD investigations. Fortunately for our purposes, hypotheses about the effects of
subsidization on exports are qualitatively unaffected by modeling capacity subsidization, as we do here, or
by modeling foreign subsidization as a per-unit subsidy on sales to the export market that would effectively
increase the price the foreign firm receives in the export market (PUS + s) or as a production subsidy that
effectively lowers production costs (c-s).


                                                    10
demand shocks that affect export supply in the model and, hence, a higher probability of

cyclical excess capacity effects for the U.S. market. This is our third excess capacity

hypothesis that we explore more below in our empirical analysis – foreign subsidization can

exacerbate cyclical excess capacity effects.

        An important assumption in our analysis to this point is that the foreign firm’s costs

relative to the U.S. price of steel would not warrant the firm building initial capacity to serve

the export market. This follows Staiger and Wolak’s assumptions and the contention of the

U.S. steel producers that these foreign producers are exporting due to excess capacity issues,

not an inherent comparative advantage in producing steel. We’ll term this the inefficient

foreign firm assumption. If one relaxes this assumption so that the foreign firm is efficient

enough to initially build capacity for the export market given expected demand, the model

would still predict that exports would be negatively related to foreign demand shocks.

However, excess capacity effects on exports would only apply to the additional amount of

exports from a negative demand shock beyond the “normal” supply of exports for an

expected foreign demand realization. Whether foreign subsidization would continue to

exacerbate cyclical excess capacity effects depends on how efficient the foreign firm is. If

the unsubsidized foreign firm is inefficient enough that it would stop exporting to the U.S.

market for high foreign demand realizations, then this effect would still remain in the model

as well. Finally, structural excess capacity effects would be unaffected by relaxing the

inefficient foreign firm assumption.

        In summary, the model in this section provides three excess capacity effects that we

will explore in our empirical analysis. First, if foreign markets are protected, negative

foreign demand shocks will generate greater exports to the U.S. market even without any

subsidization by the foreign government. This is the cyclical excess capacity (or dumping)

hypothesis. Second, foreign subsidization will lead to greater exports to the U.S. market –


                                               11
the structural excess capacity hypothesis. Finally, under certain conditions, foreign

subsidization will lead to larger cyclical excess capacity effects.

        The next section provides information on foreign subsidization in the steel industry

uncovered by U.S. CVD investigations and a preliminary analysis of the structural excess

capacity hypothesis. This is followed by section 4, where we develop an empirical

specification based on this section’s modeling to examine the statistical evidence for all three

hypotheses.



3. U.S. countervailing duty investigations and information on foreign subsidization

        Due to the potential effects of foreign subsidization on a domestic industry, the

U.S. and World Trade Organization statutes allow domestic industries to obtain relief

from imports that are subsidized by foreign governments through the use of CVD

protection. In these cases, an ad valorem subsidy rate is calculated that, once applied as a

CVD, is intended to offset the advantage gained in the domestic market by the exporting

foreign firms due to subsidization by their government. In the U.S., CVD calculations

are done by the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the U.S. Department of

Commerce with CVD determinations for each case published in the Federal Register.

These CVD determinations document all foreign subsidization programs related to the

products subject to the U.S. CVD investigation and provide an ad valorem subsidy rate

for each of these programs, as well as a total ad valorem subsidy rate which is the CVD if

the imports are found to be causing injury to the domestic industry.

        The ITA determinations provide us with a wealth of information on foreign

subsidization, including histories of foreign subsidization programs with start and end

dates for various programs. These investigations consider an exhaustive list of programs


                                               12
and report information on many programs listed by the U.S. petitioners, including those

for which no subsidization benefit was found. As we document below, the U.S. steel

industry has filed hundreds of CVD cases since 1980, many of which have been found to

have insufficient evidence of foreign subsidization or deemed too insignificant to be

injurious to the domestic industry. Thus, it is quite unlikely that there are any significant

foreign government programs subsidizing steel exports to the U.S. that have not been

examined by these CVD investigations.

        While we have excellent information on the occurrence of foreign subsidization

of steel imports in the U.S., there is obvious measurement error in the ITA’s calculation

of the degree of foreign subsidization. The ITA’s methodology for calculating an ad

valorem subsidy rate is to add up the monetary value of subsidy afforded to the foreign

firm and divide this by a corresponding revenue stream. For example, if the subsidy is

connected with all of the firms exports (not just to the U.S.), it divides the subsidy benefit

by the total value of the firms’ exports. If it is a production subsidy, it divides by the

firms total sales, both domestic and foreign. Francois, Palmeter and Anspacher (1991)

discuss many of the economic problems with this methodology.10 Another significant

issue is the treatment of “non-recurring” subsidies, such as one-time equity infusions by a

foreign government to stop a firm from going bankrupt. Translating the effect of such an

event into an ad valorem subsidy that affects the market in subsequent years requires a

significant number of assumptions. Our data appendix describes these ITA procedures in




10
  A related literature in the trade law area discusses the difference between a competitive-benefits
approach that focuses on the market advantage gained by the foreign firm from subsidization (i.e., an
economics-based approach) and a “cash-flow approach” that the ITA uses in its calculations. For example,
see Diamond (1990).

more detail, as well as our construction of a subsidy rate measure over time from

information in ITA CVD determinations.

         As mentioned above, the U.S. steel industry has a substantial history of filing

CVD cases, with 289 cases filed on steel products from 1980 through 2002.11 The most

active periods were in the early 1980s leading up to the significant Voluntary Restraint

Agreements (VRAs) with virtually all significant importers beginning in 1985, a large

group of cases when these VRAs were allowed to expire in 1992, and significant activity

in the late 1990s and early 2000s prior to the steel safeguard actions imposed by the U.S.

in 2002.

         Table 1 provides a more detailed look at U.S. CVD activity in steel products over

the 1980s and 1990s from a foreign country level. The first three columns report the

number of CVD cases by foreign country source and the number of “successful” cases

through either an affirmative decision by U.S. authorities or through a private suspension

agreement.12 There is substantial variation in the frequency with which countries are

investigated and the frequency with which they end in “successful” outcomes for the U.S.

steel industry. The primary activity has been against EC/EU countries, Korea, South

Africa, and the Latin American countries of Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico. Success

rates are generally much lower with respect to the EC/EU countries.13



11
   Throughout the paper, we define “steel products” as those falling under Standard Industrial Classification
331, including steel mill products, pipes and tubes, and wire-related products. Our starting year is 1980, as
this was the first year under new AD and CVD rules that are associated with a large increase in subsequent
filing activity.
12
   These “successful” cases do not include ones that were withdrawn in periods before comprehensive
VRAs were negotiated since it is not always clear whether the case was withdrawn due to the impending
VRA or a decision by the petitioners that the case would not be successful.
13
   Interestingly, Japan was never subject to a CVD investigation in steel products during this period. China
likewise experienced no CVD investigation, but this is due to ITA’s ruling that such calculations are not
appropriate for non-market economies.


                                                     14
       The next two columns of Table 1 provide average CVDs for affirmative cases and

for all non-suspended cases. As above, we assume a zero CVD for the non-affirmative

cases. To the extent that the ITA’s CVD calculations were a good measure of the

effective subsidization rates, these columns provide evidence for where foreign

subsidization is greatest. By these calculated rates, subsidization is more extensive in

Argentina, Brazil, Canada (though only for the few cases investigated), Italy, South

Africa, and Spain. In our statistical analysis below, we use the information on

government subsidization reported in these CVD cases to “directly” examine whether

such foreign subsidization increases exports into the U.S. steel market.

       We can more specifically examine the efficacy of the structural excess capacity

hypothesis by looking at the extent of the U.S. steel market affected by the foreign

subsidization uncovered in ITA investigations. High subsidization rates may mean little

if it is only occurring for a small percentage of products. In the final two columns of

Table 1, we provide a snapshot of the percentage of each country’s exports of steel to the

U.S. market that are covered by a CVD as of 2002 and then the share of total U.S.

consumption accounted for by the foreign country’s exports of steel. Thus, multiplying

the two percentages together (in decimal form) provides a measure of the percent of the

total U.S. steel market affected by foreign subsidization by the particular foreign country.

For example, imports of steel from Canada account for 4.4% of the U.S. steel market in

2002 and 0.3% of these Canadian imports are subject to a CVD. Thus, the CVDs in place

as of 2002 indicate that 0.01% (0.003 × 0.044 × 100) of the U.S. steel market is affected

by Canadian subsidization of steel exports to the U.S. France, Germany and Italy have

the largest share of their U.S. exports affect by CVD orders and relatively large shares of




                                            15
the U.S. market. But even the biggest impact – Germany – translates into just 0.34% of

the U.S. market affected by its subsidization. Totaling up across all these country sources

(which represents virtually all of the imports into the U.S.) provides an estimate that

1.32% of the U.S. market is affected by foreign subsidization.

        To the extent that 2002 trade volumes are depressed by the presence of the CVD,

this 1.32% number may not be representative of the portion of the steel market that was

affected by foreign subsidization. As an alternative, we take the 1990 trade volumes of

the products with CVD orders in 2002 as a share of total 1990 U.S. steel market.

Virtually all the CVDs in place in 2002 became effective after the 1983-1992 VRA

period. Using 1990 trade volumes, the estimate is 2.61% of the total U.S. steel market

affected by foreign government subsidization, as revealed by the CVD investigations. As

a percent of imports only, not the total U.S. steel market, almost 13% of imports are

affected using the 1990 trade volumes.

        We can also calculate an approximate trade-weighted CVD rate across all

imported U.S. steel mill products for 2002. For trade weights, we use product-level

import volumes reported in the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) Annual

Statistical Reports. We calculate a trade-weighted 2002 CVD rate for imported U.S. steel

mill products of 0.35% when using 2002 trade volumes, and 0.84% when using 1990

trade volumes.14

        In summary, the data from U.S. CVD cases are not suggestive of large effects on

the U.S. steel market from foreign subsidization. The most generous numbers suggest

that 13% of imports are affected, translating into 2.6% of the total U.S. steel market with

14
  The product categories reported in the AISI Annual Statistical Reprots are sometimes larger than that
covered by the U.S. CVD order. In this sense, the trade-weighted CVD we calculate will be an
overestimate.


                                                    16
an average trade-weighted CVD on imports of 0.84%. We next turn from a descriptive

approach of ITA’s calculations of CVD rates to a more formal statistical analysis of

whether excess capacity is prevalent in the foreign markets.



4. Empirical Specification and Data Description

        In this section we develop an empirical specification based on the model in

section 2 to estimate cyclical and structural excess capacity effects, as well as describe

the data we use to examine our hypotheses.

4.1. Empirical Specification

        Following the model in section 2, the empirical specification assumes each

foreign country is a fringe competitor with respect to the U.S. market. The second-to-last

column of Table 1 suggests that this is a reasonable assumption. Canada is the foreign

country with the largest U.S. market share at 4.4% in 2002. Brazil and Mexico are next

with less than 3%. Germany, Korea and Japan have a little more than 1%, and all other

countries have around 0.5% or less of the U.S. market.15 This assumption of fringe

competition simplifies the empirical analysis through the notion that each country acts as

a price-taker in the U.S. market and acts independently of import decisions by other

foreign suppliers to the U.S. market.

        An important feature of the data available is fairly disaggregated product level

detail by country. As discussed more below and in the data appendix, we have U.S.

import data by country source for 37 different, but consistently-defined, steel product




15
 While these are 2002 numbers, these market shares change very little over the previous two decades and
were, of course, much smaller before 1980.


                                                  17
categories. Identification of our coefficients of interest comes from substantial variation

in the data across country-product combinations.

        Given these considerations, we estimate the following base empirical

specification, pooling observations over import source countries (i), products (j), and

years (t):

     ln EX ijt = α + β1 ln USPijt + β 2 ln FDemit + β 3 ln Subsidyijt + β 4 ln TProtijt + ε ijt . (4)

        We estimate this specification using data that is first-differenced by country-

product combinations to control for unobserved heterogeneity along these dimensions

and as a way to address time series issues with some of our variables. We also include

separate product, country, and year dummies in this first-differenced specification.

        Our dependent variable in (4), ln EXijt, denotes exports to the U.S. measured as

the log of net tons for product j from country i in year t. The first regressor, ln USPijt is a

measure of the logged real foreign currency price for product j available on the U.S.

market in year t. Given the small individual market shares of foreign countries in the U.S.

steel market noted in Table 1, we assume here (as in our theory) that the U.S. price is

taken exogenously by the exporters. Since the U.S. price must be translated into the

appropriate foreign currency and adjusted into real terms, this variable is country-specific,

as well as product- and year-specific. We expect a positive sign on this variable’s

coefficient since a higher realized price for their exports to the U.S. would make the

foreign firm (modeled in section 2 above) more likely to build capacity for exports to the

U.S. and/or divert current production to the U.S. market for a given realization of foreign

demand..




                                                   18
        The variable ln FDemit is a primary focus variable and is constructed as a logged

measure of demand for steel products in the foreign market. We expect a negative

coefficient on this variable, as theoretically a higher demand in a foreign firm’s own

market leads to lower exports to the U.S. market. Such a result would be consistent with

the cyclical excess capacity (or cyclical dumping) hypothesis of Staiger and Wolak. We

use real industrial value added data taken from the World Bank’s World Development

Indicators to proxy for foreign demand for steel products since steel is an intermediate

input into most industrial activities.16 We also examine whether foreign subsidization

exacerbates any cyclical dumping effects by interacting the foreign demand variable with

our measure of foreign subsidization, which we describe next.

        The term ln Subsidyijt is the log of 1 plus the ad valorem foreign government

subsidization rate that we construct from ITA determinations. A statistically significant

positive coefficient on this term would confirm a structural excess capacity effect of

foreign subsidization on U.S. steel markets. Due to concerns with how the ITA

calculates the magnitude of these ad valorem subsidy rates, we also examine the

sensitivity of our results when we instead use a simple dummy variable for the presence

of foreign subsidization.

        The term ln TProtijt denotes a matrix of variables measuring special U.S. trade

protection programs that occurred during our sample, including CVDs, antidumping

duties, VRAs in the latter half of the 1980s, and safeguard tariffs. We assume that

standard ad valorem tariff rates are controlled for by year dummies included in the

regression. We add “1” to the CVD, antidumping duties and safeguard tariffs and log

16
  Industrial production indexes or real GDP data give qualitatively identical results in our statistical
analysis. Real value added was not available for Taiwan and we use an industrial production index instead.

them, whereas the VRA coverage is a binary variable. We expect the coefficients on

these trade protection variables to be negative.



4.2. Data

         Our sample consists of 22 countries, 37 steel product categories, and years 1979

through 2002. These data dimensions were largely determined by data availability of

steel imports which we draw from yearly volumes of the American Iron and Steel

Institute’s (AISI’s) Annual Steel Report. The 22 countries are the historically largest

exporters of steel to the U.S. market. They include the countries listed in Table 1, as well

as Austria (1979-2000), Finland (1979-1999), and Greece (1979-1987) for which data do

not span the entire sample period.17 The strength of the AISI Annual Steel Reports is

reporting of data by consistent product categories throughout the sample period, ensuring

that virtually all steel products are covered in our sample.18 A few categories were

combined to provide consistency throughout and the data appendix provides a list of the

product categories covered.

         Data on U.S. prices comes from producer price indexes published by the U.S.

Bureau of Labor Statistics and available from their website at:

http://www.bls.gov/ppi/home.htm. In unreported results, we alternatively used steel price

data obtained from Purchasing Magazine which yielded qualitatively identical results

17
   All other countries’ observations span all years of the sample with the exception of South Africa, for
which the years 1987-1995 are not reported due to the anti-apartheid embargo imposed on that country.
We get qualitatively identical statistical results whether we include South Africa in the sample or not.
While we include China in our sample, the U.S. does not conduct CVD investigations for non-market
economies. However, we note that we get qualitatively identical statistical results whether we include
China in the sample or not.
18
   An alternative would be to collect data by Harmonized Tariff System (HTS) codes down to even the 10-
digit level. However, HTS codes, especially for a highly-scrutinized sector such as steel, are changing on a
frequent basis, sometimes drastically. One would also have to concord the change from the TSUSA-based
system before 1989 in the U.S. to the HTS.


                                                    20
throughout all our regressions. The data appendix provides a concordance we construct

between our price series and the 37 steel product categories in our sample. We convert

steel prices into the foreign country’s currency by multiplying by an appropriate

exchange rate and convert into real terms using the country’s GDP deflator as provided

by the International Monetary Fund’s publication, International Financial Statistics.

        Our measure of foreign subsidization was constructed from Federal Register

notices of ITA CVD decisions and is described in detail in our data appendix. Special

protection measures, such as CVDs, antidumping duties, VRAs, and safeguard tariffs also

come from Federal Register notices and publications of the USITC. The data appendix

has further details on sources and variable construction.



5. Empirical Results

        Table 2 provides regression results based on estimating equation (4) for our sample of

22 countries and 37 products from 1979 through 2002. The F-test of joint significance of the

regressor matrix passes easily at the 1 percent confidence level across the various

specifications in Table 2, and our main regressors are generally of expected sign and

statistically significant at standard confidence levels. The coefficient estimates can be read as

elasticities since they are logged (with the exception of the VRA variable).

        Column 1 of Table 2 provides results of our benchmark model. Statistical

evidence for cyclical, as well as structural, excess capacity effects is strong. The

coefficient on the foreign demand variables is -1.525 and statistically significant at the 1-

percent level, indicating that a 10% decline in the foreign demand variable is associated

with a 15.25% increase in exports to the U.S. market. This is confirmatory evidence for

cyclical excess capacity effects.


                                               21
        The case for structural excess capacity effects is supported by a positive and

statistically significant coefficient on our foreign subsidization variable. The coefficient

on this variable suggests that a 10% increase in the foreign subsidization rate of a steel

product increases its exports to the U.S. market by over 30%.

         The control variables in the regression perform fairly well. As one would expect,

we find a positive coefficient on the export price variable, indicating that steel exports

increase to the U.S. when the foreign firms receive a higher price (in their own currency)

for their U.S. exports. The effects of antidumping duties and safeguard tariffs on foreign

exports to the U.S. are negative, as expected, and statistically significant with elasticities

of -1.648 and -1.480, respectively. CVDs are not estimated to have a significant impact

on exports though the associated coefficient is negative in sign as expected. The

coefficient on the VRA indicator variable is also negative as expected and statistically

significant, indicating that exports fall about 35% when subject to a VRA with the U.S.

during our sample.

        In Column 2 of Table 2 we examine whether foreign subsidization exacerbates the

cyclical excess capacity effects by including a term that interacts the foreign demand

variable with an indicator variable for the presence of positive foreign subsidization. A

negative coefficient on this variable would indicate that the elasticity of exports to the

U.S. market is even more pronounced for negative demand shocks; i.e., that cyclical

dumping is even larger in magnitude. While the estimated coefficient on this interaction

term is negative, it is statistically insignificant.

        In Column 3 of Table 2 we examine whether the cyclical dumping effect is

asymmetric and depends on whether foreign demand is generally in a high or low state.




                                                22
Our simple model of cyclical dumping in section 2 would suggest that if foreign steel

producers are relatively inefficient and/or unsubsidized, we would see little to no

response of U.S. exports to foreign demand shocks if foreign demand was already at a

high level such that the foreign firm was serving its own market at full capacity. Foreign

producers with an inherent or government-induced comparative advantage in producing

steel are less likely to see any asymmetric response of exports to demand shocks in their

own foreign market. To examine this we include an interaction term between the foreign

demand variable and an indicator variable for whether foreign demand is above its trend.

The estimated coefficient is negative and statistically insignificant, suggesting no

asymmetric responses, consistent with the notion of foreign subsidized firms and/or ones

with an inherent comparative advantage.

       Before turning to alternative specifications and samples, we comment on a

number of data and specification issues. First, our empirical specification does not

include any explicit controls for capital costs, which were clearly important in the model

we present in section 2. However, differencing our data by country-product

combinations controls for any time-invariant cost differences across these cross-sectional

units. In addition, we include separate product, country, and year fixed effects. In this

first-differenced specification, product fixed effects controls for any unobserved

differences in trends common to a particular steel product. Country fixed effects control

for unobserved differences in trends common to a country across all its steel products.

And year effects control for any macroeconomic shocks. To the extent that changes in

capital costs for country-product combinations can be decomposed into these fixed

effects in an additively separable way, we have fully accounted for such changes.




                                             23
       One may be concerned with data measurement issues with regard to our key

variables. We proxy for foreign demand with real industrial value added, though we get

qualitatively identical results when we use industrial production indexes or real GDP

measures reported in the International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics.

We prefer the data on real industrial value added since data for industrial production

indexes are missing for a significant number of observations in our sample and because

real GDP measures include economic activity in many sectors, such as services, that

hardly consume any steel at all.

       As our data appendix describes in more detail, there are measurement issues with

our subsidy variable, particularly the measured magnitude of the subsidies. In addition,

subsidy programs that start before a CVD case in our sample are clearly documented,

whereas ending dates for programs that continue past the CVD case are not. Besides

unintended measurement issues one could also worry that the size of the subsidy rates

may be biased by political, rather than economic, considerations. Thus, as an alternative

to our subsidy rate variable we construct a dummy variable that takes the value of “1”

when a foreign subsidization program begins for a country-product combination and “0”

otherwise. We are the most confident about the information on when a foreign subsidy

program begins and it seems much more difficult to fabricate such information for

political reasons on the part of the ITA. In unreported results, we find that the coefficient

estimated on this subsidy dummy variable is significantly positive at the 1% level and

indicates a 34% increase in exports to the U.S., ceteris paribus. Coefficient estimates of

other regressors are qualitatively identical regardless of which subsidy variable we use

throughout our analysis.




                                             24
5.1. Examining subsets of countries and products

       As section 3 documents, U.S. CVD investigations brought by the steel industry

have targeted certain products and countries. In this section, we examine the extent to

which there are differences in excess capacity effects across subsamples of our data. For

each of these investigations we construct a dummy variable indicating a particular

subsample of the data and then interact this dummy variable with all our main control

regressors. Table 3 shows the coefficient estimates for our key excess capacity variables

for the different subsamples, as well as an F-test of statistical difference between the two

subsamples’ estimates.

       The first sample split we examine is between products which were subject to

significant U.S. CVD investigations and those that were rarely, if ever, investigated.

Steel products in the “high CVD activity” category include hot-rolled bars, plates, cold-

rolled and hot-rolled sheet and strip, and wire rods. We would expect excess capacity

effects to be larger for high CVD activity products if these are the types of products that

are heavily subsidized and protected by all foreign governments. However, as reported in

Table 3, there are no statistical differences for the coefficient estimates on our foreign

demand or subsidy variables, our respective measures of cyclical and structural excess

capacity effects, across high and low CVD activity products.

       We next split our sample into non-OECD countries and OECD countries.

Inherent efficiencies in steel production and/or the extent of government subsidization

may systematically differ across these two sets of countries. Results in Table 3 show that

while there are no statistical differences between these two sets of countries with respect




                                             25
to cyclical dumping effects, structural excess capacity effects from foreign subsidization

are limited to only the non-OECD countries in our sample.

         In fact, as shown in the last set of results in Table 3, both cyclical and structural

excess capacity effects can be shown to be limited to only three countries in the sample,

the South American countries of Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela. The coefficients on

the foreign demand and subsidy variables for these three countries are large in magnitude

and statistically significant, while the coefficients on these variables for all other 19

countries in our sample are very close to zero in magnitude and statistically insignificant.

As shown in Table 1, these three South American countries accounted for just 3.6% of

U.S. consumption of steel in 2002. We have tried a variety of other sample splits with

various country groupings, none with these stark results.

         Thus, while we have estimated statistically significant excess capacity effects for

our entire sample, they are apparently driven by a very narrow group of foreign country

sources that are a small part of the U.S. market. This is consistent with our analysis of

the CVD activity shown in Table in section 3 earlier. Taken together, it is difficult to

imagine that excess capacity effects have had a significant role in the fortune of U.S. steel

firms.

         There are a few remaining issues that may affect interpretation of our results.

First, our subsidy variable is constructed from information stemming from all CVD cases,

regardless of the outcome of the case. Interestingly, we do not find any statistical

differences in the subsidy effect whether the outcome of the related CVD case is an

affirmative decision, negative decision, withdrawal of petition, or suspension due to an

agreement amongst the various firms and the ITA. A second concern may be the impact




                                               26
of export markets other than the U.S. Taking the U.S. steel industry defenders at their

word, this should not be a concern as the U.S. is the only significant market that is

relatively open to steel imports. However, to the extent the rise or fall of other export

market availability impacts our countries and products similarly, our inclusion of year

dummies should control for these effects.



6. Conclusions

       The U.S. steel industry has been the largest user of special U.S. trade protection

laws by a wide margin. Their justification is that such laws are necessary to protect them

from foreign producers that enjoy protected markets with significant government

subsidization, leading to substantial dumping of excess capacity into the relatively open

U.S. market. This paper takes these claims seriously and confronts them with the data.

We use a unique database on U.S. imports of 37 different steel products across 22

different foreign country sources from 1979 through 2002 to examine the evidence for

both short-run cyclical excess capacity effects on exports to the U.S. market, as well as

long-run structural excess capacity effects stemming from foreign subsidization. We

find statistical evidence for both effects. However, examination of subsamples of our

data reveals that these effects are limited to a very small set of foreign export sources that

account for a small share of the U.S. steel market. Thus, we conclude it is unlikely that

these excess capacity effects have been a significant factor in the U.S. steel industry’s

performance over the past decades.

Data Appendix

The following provides greater detail on our data sources and variable construction.

Data on Foreign Exports to the U.S. (Dependent Variable)
Collected from American Iron and Steel Institute’s (AISI’s) Annual Statistical Report,
various volumes. We collect these data by the product categories reported in this source.
However, for consistency over time, we combined a few product categories. In particular,
all “plate” categories were combined, including “Plates – in coils” and “Plates – cut
lengths”. A number of categories, including ”galvanized”, “other metallic coated” and
“electrical” were combined into a “Sheets & strip – Other” category. Likewise, a number
of pipe categories, including “Stainless pipe and tubing”, “Nonclassified pipe & tubing”,
“Structural pipe & tubing”, and “Pipe for piling”, were combined into an “Other pipe and
tubing” category. See table A.1 below for a list of our 37 product categories. The 22
countries included in our sample are those listed in Table 1 of the paper, as well as
Austria (1979-2000), Finland (1979-1999), and Greece (1979-1987) for which data do
not span the entire sample period. We are also missing observations for most of the pipe
and tubing categories before 1982. These steel import data are reported in net tons and
we use the log of the sum of the variable + “1” as our dependent variable.

Real U.S. Steel Price in Exporter’s Currency (Independent Variable)
As mentioned in the text, we primarily rely on Producer Price Indexes from the Bureau of
Labor Statistics (BLS) for our data on steel prices. For a robustness check we also use
steel price data from Purchasing Magazine provided by Benjamin Liebman at St.
Joseph’s University. The following table concords our steel product categories to the
steel price series we have available from these two sources.

  “Average price series” is a weighted average of price series for wire rod, hot-rolled
sheet, hot-rolled plate, galvanized sheet, rebar, and wide beams. Data for these price
series are only available from 1980 through 1999. They are monthly data and were
averaged on an annual basis.

In our statistical analysis we derive a price variable by multiplying these U.S. price series
by an exchange rate that converts into the foreign currency and then deflate using the
country’s GDP Deflator to convert into real terms. Finally, we log the variable.

Our primary source for the GDP deflator series for each country is the International
Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics, CD-ROM, June 2005.

Our exchange rate data (foreign currency per U.S. dollar) come from a few different
sources. For Argentina, Brazil, China, Greece, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, South Africa,
Taiwan, we downloaded annual exchange rates through 1999 from the Economic History
Services website www.eh.net/hmit/exchangerates, which also gives conversion to new
currencies over time. We then added exchange rates from 2000-2002 using data from
Werner Antweiler’s PACIFIC Exchange Rate Services website: http://fx.sauder.ubc.ca/.

Foreign Demand for Steel as Proxied by Real Industrial Value Added (Independent
Variable)
Our source for this variable is the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI).
The WDI database does not provide these data for Taiwan. Thus, we turn to official
statistics of the Taiwanese Directorate – General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics,
available online at: http://eng.dgbas.gov.tw/mp.asp?mp=2. We use an industrial
production index for the Taiwanese economy as a proxy for real value added. Our
paper’s qualitative results are robust to whether Taiwanese observations are included or
not.

Foreign Subsidization Rates (Independent Variable)
The Import Administration of the International Trade Administration (ITA) of the U.S.
Department of Commerce performs all subsidy rate calculations in CVD cases since 1980.
Their determinations for each case are published in the Federal Register and list all
foreign programs purported to directly or indirectly subsidize a product in a CVD case.
There is a wide variety of programs considered by the ITA, including grants, equity
infusions, debt forgiveness, loans at below-market interest rates, input subsidies, export
subsidies, and duty drawbacks on imported inputs. The most recently revised rules
followed for CVD investigations and subsidy rate calculations, as well as the original
statutes governing CVD investigations and remedies, can be found online at the ITA:
http://ia.ita.doc.gov/regs/index.html.

The basic methodology is the following. The ITA determines the cash benefit of the
subsidy connected with each program it considers and then divides this by a
corresponding revenue stream to determine an ad valorem subsidy rate. For example, if
the subsidy is connected with all of the firms exports (not just to the U.S.), it divides the
subsidy benefit by the total value of the firms’ exports. If it is a production subsidy, it
divides by the firms total sales, both domestic and foreign. The final subsidy rate for a
product and country source then totals the subsidy rates across the programs found to
provide subsidization.




                                              38
Determination of the current cash value of continuous, or “recurring”, subsidy programs
is relatively easy. Determination of the current value of an infrequent, or “non-recurring”,
subsidy program, such as a one-time equity infusion by the government to allow a firm to
avoid bankruptcy a number of years prior to the current CVD case is obviously more
difficult. In these cases, the ITA uses the following formula to “allocate” the cash benefit
of such subsidies over time: Ak = {y/n + [y – y/n(k-1)d]} / (1+d), where Ak is the amount
of the subsidy benefit allocated to year k, y is the face value of the subsidy in the year it
occurred, n is the average useful life of renewable physical capital for an industry
(determined to be 15 years for steel plants), and d is the discount rate. The ITA’s official
regulations do not indicate the basis or rationale for this formula. Notable features of the
formula is that it assigns a declining value of the subsidy benefit as years pass and that
the benefit assigned to the last year (year n) is larger than y/n, the amount one would
assign to each year if the benefit were equally apportioned to each year of average useful
life of capital in the industry.

For the purposes of this paper, we use the information in the ITA determinations in the
following way to get measures of foreign subsidization over time for the products subject
to a CVD investigation. We create a subsidization rate measure by using the reported
subsidization rates for each program, as well as their starting and ending dates. If no
starting date is reported for a recurring subsidy program, we assume it was occurring at
the same rate for all prior years back to the beginning year of our sample, 1979. If the
program is recurring and still in place at the time of the CVD investigation, we assume it
continues on until the end of our sample. We update when there is a subsequent CVD
investigation of the same product and country combination. If a CVD case is suspended
in lieu of an agreement with the foreign government to suspend subsidization or
otherwise mitigate the effect of such subsidization on its exports to the U.S., we assume
that all subsidization has stopped. If CVDs are withdrawn or terminated due to the
voluntary export agreements that occurred with some countries in 1982 and virtually all
countries in 1985, we assume that subsidization continues. We assume all subsidization
is discontinued when a CVD is revoked by a sunset review. In some cases, the ITA
calculates subsidy rates for various foreign firms (not a simple country-wide rate). In
these cases, we create a weighted sum of the subsidy rates assuming the firms have equal
market share of the U.S. imports of the investigated product.

Products are matched to our dataset through reported Harmonized Tariff System (HTS)
codes accompanying the cases (Tariff System of the United States Annotated (TSUSA)
system prior to 1989). Often the CVD cases are defined narrowly enough that the
product is matched to just one product category in our dataset, though sometimes they
span multiple product categories. Sometimes a CVD product may be only a limited
subset of one of our product categories. We have no obvious way to determine the
portion of a product category that is covered by the CVD, so we simply assign the
subsidization rates to the entire product category. Finally, there are a small handful of
country-product combinations in our dataset where multiple CVD cases apply. In these
situations, we cumulate the subsidization rates across these cases for that country-product
combination in the years in which there is an overlap.




                                            39
Antidumping and Countervailing Duty (AD//CVD) Rates (Independent Variable)
AD/CVD rate data were obtained from http://www.brandeis.edu/~cbown/global_ad/.
These data were then matched up to AISI product categories using an approximate
concordance in “Appendix D: Definitions of Certain Terms and Descriptions of Products
Subject to the Investigation” in Office of Industries, USITC. (April 1995) Steel
Semiannual Monitoring Report: Special Focus: U.S. Industry Conditions. Washington,
DC: USITC Publication 2878.

For AD rates, we assumed that the initial dumping margins remain until an order is
revoked. In other words, we do not adjust margins as administrative reviews occur. The
rationale is that dumping margins only change as companies must respond to the initial
dumping margin and raise prices. The impact on imports should be similar whether the
dumping margin is collected or not collected due to the firm raising prices. With CVD
rates, we adjusted these as they changed with administrative reviews.

The following rules governed how we recorded data on AD/CVD decisions (as well as
subsidy rates described above) into an annual observation: If the decision comes out prior
to August 1, it is applied as the rate for the entire year. If the decision comes out on Aug.
1 or later, it gets applied to the following year.

Often AD/CVD rates may only apply to part of the product category. Since we do not
have information on composition, we cannot prorate the AD/CVD rate. In a few
instances, a product category becomes subject to more than one AD/CVD rate. To
account for this, we sum the applicable rates. We add “1” to these variables and log for
our statistical analysis.

Safeguard Tariffs (Independent Variable)
Safeguard tariffs were placed on select steel products (primarily flat-rolled products, plate,
bar, rod, and fittings) effective March 20, 2002 by order of President Bush. Most
developing countries, as well as Canada and Mexico were exempted from these measures.
We use the USITC publication Steel: Monitoring Developments in the Domestic Industry
(Investigation No. TA-204-9) and Steel-Consuming Industries: Competitive Conditions
with Respect to Steel Safeguard Measures (Investigation No. 332-452) (Publication 3632,
September 2003), pp. 1-5 and 1-6, to determine safeguard tariff coverage across our
sample of countries and products. We add “1” and log this variable for our statistical
analysis


VRA coverage (product and country combinations) from 1983 through 1993
(Independent Variable)
We use Table 7 of Michael O. Moore’s National Bureau of Economic Research working
paper no. 4760, “Steel Protection in the 1980s: The Waning Influence of Big Steel?”,
June 1994, as well as, p. i of preface to Monthly Report on Selected Steel Industry Data:
Report to the Subcommittee on Ways and Means on Investigation Number 332-163 Under
Section 332 of the Tariff Act of 1930, published by the U.S. International Trade
Commission, February 1986, to determine whether a product category from a particular



                                             40
foreign country import source was subject to a voluntary restraint agreement or not. This
variable is an indicator variable and is therefore not logged.
The following table provides summary statistics of these main variables in the base
specification of our statistical analysis.
