De facto Fiscal Space and Fiscal Stimulus: Definition and Assessment

                                              ABSTRACT

We define the notion of a ‘de facto fiscal space’ of a country as the inverse of the tax-years it would
take to repay the public debt. Specifically, we measure the outstanding public debt relative to the de
facto tax base, where the latter measures the realized tax collection, averaged across several years
to smooth for business cycle fluctuations. We apply this concept to account for the cross-country variation
in the fiscal stimulus associated with the global crisis of 2009-2010. We find that greater de facto fiscal
space prior to the global crisis, higher GDP/capita, higher financial exposure to the US, and lower
trade openness were associated with a higher fiscal stimulus/GDP during 2009-2010. Joint estimation
indicates that higher trade openness was associated with lower fiscal stimulus and higher depreciation
rate during 2009-2010.

1.        Introduction


The dire outlook of the global economy in the second half of 2008 propagated unprecedented
fiscal expansions of most OECDs and emerging-market countries. The resultant fiscal stimulus
focused attention on the degree to which countries possess ‘fiscal space’ and on ways to apply it
in a counter-cyclical manner. A frequent concern about ‘fiscal space’ is the lack of clarity about
it. In attempts to clarify this fuzzy concept, Heller (2005) defined it “as room in a government’s
budget that allows it to provide resources for a desired purpose without jeopardizing the
sustainability of its financial position or the stability of the economy.” Our paper aims at
defining a measurable ‘fiscal space’ variable, and applies this concept in the context of the global
crisis.
          To proceed, we define concept of a de facto fiscal space as being inversely related to the
tax-years it would take to repay the public debt. A useful notion is the de facto tax base,
measuring the realized tax collection, averaged across several years to smooth for business cycle
fluctuations. The ratio of the outstanding public debt to the de facto tax base, or the tax-years
needed to repay the public debt, provides information about the relative fiscal tightness of
countries. We apply these concepts in order to explain the cross-country variation in the fiscal
stimulus during the aftermath of the global crisis.


2.        Assessment of the de facto fiscal space prior to the crisis (2000-2006), and the cross
country variation in the fiscal stimulus, 2009-10

          Insight regarding fiscal space may be provided by tracing the pre-crisis, 2006 public debt
as a fraction of the pre-crisis average tax revenue during 2000-2006. To recall, the early 2000s
were viewed as the continuation of the blissful “Great Moderation” – a period characterized by
the drop in macroeconomic volatility and risk premium during the late 1990s and early 2000s.1
The pre-crisis tax revenue measures the de facto tax capacity in years of relative tranquility. The
presumption is that a lower pre-crisis public debt relative to the pre-crisis tax base implies

1987- 2007 as the “Great Moderation” period.




                                                   1
greater fiscal capacity to fund stimuli using the existing tax capacity. Similarly, lower average
fiscal deficits relative to the average tax revenue during 2000-2006 may suggest greater fiscal
space at the on-set of the crisis.
        Figure 1 reports this measure of 81 countries, subject to data availability in 2006. It
shows the wide variation in the tax-years needed to repay the public debt, from well below 1 year
in Australia (indicating a high fiscal space), to about 5 years in Brazil, and above 10 years in
Madagascar (indicating a very low fiscal space). For most of the countries in our sample, the
tax-years it would take to repay the public debt in 2006 were below 4 years. Figure 2 reports
another measure of fiscal tightness, focusing on flows instead of stocks [i.e., on fiscal deficits
instead of public debt]: the average fiscal deficits relative to the average tax revenue. Both
figures are consistent with the notion that, even without increasing the tax base, a fair share of
countries had significant fiscal space in 2006.2




3.      Assessment of the de facto fiscal space prior to the crisis (2000-2006), and the cross
country variation in the fiscal stimulus, 2009-10

        We apply these concepts in order to explain the cross-country variation in the fiscal
stimulus during the aftermath of the global crisis. To recall, the early 2000s were viewed as the
continuation of the blissful “Great Moderation” – a period characterized by the drop in
macroeconomic volatility and risk premium during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The pre-
crisis tax revenue measures the de facto tax capacity in years of relative tranquility. The
presumption is that a lower pre-crisis public debt and lower average fiscal deficits relative to the
pre-crisis tax base imply greater fiscal capacity to fund stimuli using the existing tax capacity.
Figure 3 summarizes the averages of these measures for the low, lower-middle, upper middle,
and high-income countries. The figure suggests that in 2006, the middle income countries’ fiscal
space was higher than the low income countries. While the debt overhangs [2006 public
debt/GDP] of the low and lower middle income countries are slightly above the other groups,

tax base.



                                                    2
their ratio to the tax base is much higher than that of the upper middle income and the OECD
countries. This in turn implies that the low and lower middle income countries may have more
limited fiscal space than the upper middle income and the OPEC countries. Consequently, the
fiscal stimuli of the richer countries would have the side benefit of helping the poorer countries
in invigorating the demands facing lower income countries.
        Table 1 overviews the crisis related fiscal stimulus/GDP, 2009-2010, subject to data
availability and latest releases. The crisis propagated a significant fiscal stimulus in the USA,
Japan, and Germany, the magnitude of which increased from 2009 to 2010, reflecting various
lags associated with fiscal policy. It also induced massive “bailout” transfers to the banking
systems in the USA, Germany and the UK, attempting to stabilize the financial panic. It is
noteworthy that in Germany and the UK the size of the transfers to the financial systems
exceeded the fiscal stimulus to the non-financial sector. Similar trends, though in varying
intensity, were observed in emerging markets. China, South Korea and Russia provided front
loaded fiscal stimulus at rates that were well above the one observed in the OECD countries.
Notable is the greater agility of the emerging markets’ response relative to that of the OECD
countries, reflecting possibly a faster policy response capacity of several emerging markets.3
This observation is remarkable considering the earlier evidence of the fiscal pro-cyclicality
observed in emerging markets and developing countries during the 1980s-90s [see Kaminsky,
Reinhart and (2005)].

        Based on data availability reported in Table 2, we present in Table 3 the regression
analysis, accounting for the cross-country variation in the fiscal stimulus during 2009-10, in 75
(out of 81) countries. The explanatory variables are the de facto fiscal space, GDP per capita,
trade openness, inflation, and measures of the financial exposure to the US. GDP per capita
(PPP, thousands), Trade/GDP (percentage), and Inflation (GDP deflator, percentage) are 2000-06
averages. The financial exposure to USA is the position of each country as of 2006, obtained
from the US Treasury International Capital System (TIC): ‘assets’ is foreign portfolio holdings

 The deeper safety net of the OECD [unemployment insurance, food stamps, social security, socialized
medical care, etc.] provides automatic stabilizers that work to cushion the economy in addition to the
crisis related stimulus.



                                                   3
of USA securities, and ‘total’ is ‘assets’ plus USA portfolio holdings of foreign securities. To
account for potential correlation among countries in each geographic region, the cross-section
estimation is done with clustering at a regional level (according to the World Bank’s geographic
classification). As shown, the regression analysis explains about a third of the variations across
countries in crisis-related fiscal stimulus, and in the stimulus plus net cost of financial sector
support. The coefficient estimates of key determinants are all statistically significant (t-statistics
in parentheses), indicating that a greater de facto fiscal space, higher GDP/capita, higher
financial exposure to the US, and lower trade openness were positively associated with fiscal
stimulus/GDP during 2009-2010.4

        We provide in Figure 4 the economic significance of the cross-country estimates in
regressions (2) and (5) of Table 3. For each explanatory variable, we multiply its standard
deviation with the estimated coefficient in the regression, to approximate the effect of its one
standard deviation change on the size of fiscal stimulus. The calculation suggests that the size of
the stimulus in 2009-10 is larger in countries with higher income, smaller trade openness, larger
de facto fiscal space, and greater financial exposure to the USA. For the de facto fiscal space
measure, a decrease in the public debt/tax revenue by 1.84 [from that of the lower middle income
group (3.70) to that of the high income OECD group (1.86)] implies, all other things being equal,
an increase of the fiscal stimulus during 2009-2010 by 14.0*1.84 = 26 basis points, or 0.26
percent of GDP.

        Table 4 provides results of alternative dependent and explanatory variables. As the fiscal
stimulus/GDP is bounded between 0 and 1, we explore the log-odds ratio as the dependent
variable in equation (7). As only a third of countries carry out fiscal stimulus from 2009-2010,
equation (8) provides the results from a Tobit estimation. Equation (9) was estimated for the
sub-sample of countries that engaged in fiscal stimulus. Regressions (7), (8) and (9) support the
positive association between fiscal space and the size of stimulus. We also run a regression
using the flow fiscal space variable (fiscal deficit/tax revenue in Table 4). The coefficient

  The interaction term in regression (3) implies that the positive association of de facto fiscal space with
the fiscal stimulus is stronger in higher GDP/Capita countries.



                                                      4
estimates of this second measure are statistically significant in the fiscal stimulus equation, and
in the stimulus plus net cost of financial sector support equation. For the flow measure of the de
facto fiscal space, a decrease in the fiscal deficit/tax revenue by 0.18 [a one standard deviation]
implies, other things being equal, an increase in the fiscal stimulus during 2009-10 by 0.55
percent of GDP. The fiscal deficit/tax revenue provides therefore an alternative measure of
fiscal space.




4.     Concluding remarks

       Our analysis shows the usefulness of the de facto fiscal space concept in accounting for
the size of fiscal stimulus. Intriguingly, we found that higher trade openness had been associated
with a lower fiscal stimulus. A possible interpretation is that, as fiscal multipliers may be lower
in more open economies, these countries opted for a smaller fiscal stimulus, putting greater
weight on adjustment via exchange rate depreciation (‘exporting their way to prosperity’). This
interpretation is validated in Table 5, reporting the SUR regression analysis of fiscal stimulus
and exchange rate depreciation. We found that greater trade openness is robustly associated with
a lower fiscal stimulus and higher depreciation rate during 2009:Q1-2010:Q2. These results
validate the presence of gains associated with greater fiscal coordination among countries. A
coordinated fiscal stimulus may generate positive spillover effects, mitigating the reliance on
competitive depreciations.

This table reports crisis-related fiscal stimulus/GDP, net cost of financial sector support/GDP, and government expenditures/GDP [G/Y] from 2000-09 (all in annual

understanding the aggregate demand equation where G + C + I + NX = Y, ‘G’ in the equation is not the G reported below; the bailout, beyond a transfer, does not
increase aggregate demand directly.
