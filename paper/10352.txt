                                           ABSTRACT

This paper examines the contribution of Leonardo of Pisa [Fibonacci] to the history of financial

mathematics. Evidence in Leonardo's Liber Abaci (1202) suggests that he was the first to develop

present value analysis for comparing the economic value of alternative contractual cash flows. He

also developed a general method for expressing investment returns, and solved a wide range of

complex interest rate problems. The paper argues that his advances in the mathematics of finance

were stimulated by the commercial revolution in the Mediterranean during his lifetime, and in turn,

his discoveries significantly influenced the evolution of capitalist enterprise and public finance in

Europe in the centuries that followed. Fibonacci's discount rates were more culturally influential

than his famous series.

I. Introduction

        Present value analysis is a method for comparing the relative economic value of

differing payment streams, taking into account the time-value of money. Mathematically

reducing all cash flow streams to a single point in time allows the investor to decide

which is unambiguously the best. According to a recent survey of corporate financial

officers by Graham and Harvey (2001), the present value criterion is now used by

virtually all large companies in the capital budgeting decision.1             The modern present

value formula was developed by economist Irving Fisher in 1930, however its origins

extend much deeper in the tradition of Western thought.2 Geoffrey Poitras’ excellent

survey of the early history of Financial Economics traces related interest-rate problems

back to 15th Century Europe.3 The roots of the present value criterion may lay deeper

still, however. In this paper, I argue that an important early formulation of the present

value criterion appeared in the work of one of the most famous mathematicians of the

Middle Ages, Leonardo of Pisa [1170-1240], commonly called Fibonacci.

        Leonardo was arguably the first scholar in world history to develop a detailed and

flexible mathematical approach to financial calculation. He was not only a brilliant

analyst of the business problems of his day, but also a very early financial engineer

whose work played a major role in Europe’s distinctive capital market development in

the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance.                  This paper examines the range of

Fibonacci’s contributions to Finance in historical and economic context, and specifically

focuses on his particular development of present value analysis.                   While many of

Fibonacci’s mathematical tools -- including his use of interest rates -- were a direct

extension of      Indian and Arabic mathematics,             he appears to have invented a new

mathematical approach to financial decision-making. This innovation, in turn, allowed

European mathematicians to value increasingly complex financial instruments in the

centuries that followed. As such, his intellectual contributions shed some light on the

role of mathematics in the broader trajectory of economic development in the Middle

Ages and indeed on the distinctive divergence of European society in the world economy.

        Fibonacci wrote Liber Abaci in the year 1202 in the city of Pisa. It is best known

for the Fibonacci series – a sequence of numbers describing                      geometric population

growth.      What is less well-known about Fibonacci’s book is that the famous series is

only a single example in a book almost entirely devoted to the mathematics of trade,

valuation and commercial arbitrage. Liber Abaci develops a wide range of practical

mathematical tools for calculating present value, compounding interest, evaluating

geometric series,’ dividing profits from business ventures, and pricing goods and monies

involving a complex variety weights, measures and currencies. The table of contents

gives a sense of the structure and topics covered in the book.4

       Liber Abaci      begins with an exposition of the fundamentals of arithmetic,

followed by chapters on valuation, relative value, companies and metallurgy. Chapter 12

contains a wide variety of problems, including interest rate and present value examples.

Chapter 13 presents a method of solution through linear interpolation, and Chapters 14

and 15 present more abstract mathematical results. Proceeding as it does from the

simple to the complex, the book is organized as a manual for instruction, and it is likely

that Leonardo used it himself for teaching commercial arithmetic.

       However, it is not only the content and use of the book that makes it important,

but the historical and economic context.    Liber Abaci was written at a time of nearly

unprecedented commercial interaction between East and West. Italian merchants traded

actively with the Arab world – bringing exotic goods to an increasingly prosperous

Europe.      This period of economic vitality stimulated the development of practical

mathematics – in effect, creating a market for mathematical knowledge. This knowledge,

in turn became a major factor in the economic trajectory of Europe over the next several

centuries.    The 500 year period following Leonardo saw the development in Europe of

virtually all the tools of financial capitalism that we know today: share ownership of



                                            3
limited-liability corporations, long-term government and corporate loans, liquid and

active international financial markets, life insurance, life-annuities, mutual funds,

derivative securities and deposit banking. Many of these developments have their roots in

the contracts first mathematically analyzed by Fibonacci.                    What began with his

application of mathematics to current commercial problems may have led to important

later economic innovations and the development of Western capitalism as we know it

today.



East and West

         Leonardo’s contribution is also interesting in a global context.             Historians have

long puzzled over the extraordinary economic divergence between Western Europe and

China over the period from 1200 to 1700 AD.5                  These innovations are all the more

puzzling in the context of China’s comparatively advanced scientific, technological,

political and cultural advantages at the time.6 For example, Marco Polo’s account of

China in the late 13th Century highlighted the extraordinary advancement of Chinese

civilization in Western eyes. Polo and his fellow travelers encountered a vast nation

politically unified under Mongol rule. The wonders of Yuan China included magnificent

cities, a widely literate population and highly advanced art, science and technology.

       More relevant to our study, however, China also had a sophisticated system of

government finance that included both a paper and a metallic currency, a system of

national government monopolies on commodities, closely regulated commercial markets,

as well as a centuries-long legal tradition of property rights.   By contrast, Europe of

Polo’s day was a fragmented patchwork of cities, states and communes, only partially

unified by the holy Roman empire and the Crusades. The Mediterranean world was

politically fragmented in the Middle Ages but economically connected by a network of

commerce. Thus, almost by definition, virtually all trade in Europe in the 13th century

was international.

       The Mongol rulers of Macro Polo’s era in the Khan’s capital near modern-day

Beijing could sip tea picked thousands of miles away in China’s southern province of

Yunan and shipped through China – perhaps even via the great man-made inland canal

system linking the Yangtse and Yellow River valleys.          They could     read   books

published in the distant Southeastern Chinese province of Fujian, paid for in national

currency accepted across the breadth of China. On the other hand,          a merchant in

Fibonacci’s Pisa who traded goods just within Northern Italy had to be able to calculate

currency conversions from the money of each city-state – mastering the comparative

values and differential silver content of Bolognese, Pisan, Venetian and Genoese lira, and

knowing their value relative to Byzantine besants, Imperial pounds, Barcelona lira and

Magalonese soldi. The very complexity of European commerce at the time necessitated

arithmetical tools for solving problems of conversion and exchange. Fibonacci’s book

thus met an important commercial need.




                                            5
       Perhaps more relevant to the issue of the great divergence between East and West

however is that Fibonacci’s mathematical technology in general, and the present value

criterion in particular, facilitated the development of financial contracts, instruments

and markets in Europe. Some of these financial contracts existed in Europe or were

created during Fibonacci’s lifetime, however the mathematical capacity to calculate the

present value of differing instruments led to a sustained period of financial innovation in

a relatively localized geographical area.    The financial divergence that began in 13th

Century Italy culminated most dramatically in the commercial encounter between China

and the great capitalist powers of the 19th Century, with the opening of the treaty ports of

Canton and Shanghai after the Opium Wars.        At that moment, a country with a long

tradition of family and clan-based finance met a culture of business armed with the

extraordinary capacity to borrow and raise equity capital from complete strangers. This

encounter offered both a challenge and an opportunity to Chinese entrepreneurs and

government officials and led to a rapid process of economic and political change that

continues into the modern era.



II. Fibonacci and the Commercial World of the 13th Century

       Interest in the Medieval origins of the European commercial revolution has

stimulated some remarkable scholarship – from the extensive archival explorations into

the roots of capitalism by the late Robert Lopez and his students to the geography-based

quantitative traditions of the late Ferdinand Braudel and his followers. The contributions

of both narrative and quantitative history has created a rich picture of the sudden

emergence of trade and business in Medieval Europe after the year 1000.               Most




                                             6
characterize it -- for better or worse -- as a commercial revolution and an economic

awakening from the Dark Ages. Although the scholarly contributions based on primary

archival sources are too numerous to cite here, synthetic works in this tradition include

Ferdinand Braudel’s classic three-volume work, Civilization and Capitalism, Joseph

Gies’ Merchants and Moneymen: The Commercial Revolution, 1000-1500, and Robert
                                                                                     7
S. Lopez’ The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages, 950-1350.                        The dramatic

change during this period has recently stimulated economists to analyze the institutional

structures that supported the new long-distance trade.                  Avner Greif, for example,

suggests that Italian cites had to develop new ways of dealing with foreign merchants –

including internally and externally recognized coalitions and business associations.8 In

other recent work, Peter Spufford describes the world of the merchant in 13th century

Medieval Europe in detail and points out that the very factors that impeded European

trade – from bad roads and a multiplicity of currencies, to varying legal standards and

lack of credit markets also created opportunities for entrepreneurs who could surmount

them.9 Wealthy urban centers throughout the continent stimulated a demand for exotic

goods and an enterprising merchant and banking sector emerged to meet this demand –

extending mercantile ties outside of Europe to the wider basin of the Mediterranean and

beyond, importing goods from the Middle East and occasionally even further afield.

Marco Polo and his brothers, for example, manned a Venetian trading station in the

region of the Black Sea from which he either launched his long journey to China, or

perhaps simply collected travelers accounts of distant Cathay.

        Fibonacci and his family were also an integral part of this                          commercial

revolution.10 According to Leonardo’s brief autobiography in Liber Abaci, his father was

an administrative official in the Pisan colony of Bugia in North Africa. Leonardo was

summoned as a youth to the colony, and trained there according to his father’s request in

Arabic mathematical methods.               As a result of Fibonacci’s bi-cultural education, he

enthusiastically embraced “the Indian Method” of calculation, i.e. the use of Arabic

numerals. In fact, while the use of Arabic numerals had appeared sporadically in Western

Europe before Fibonacci’s time, Liber Abaci was one of the first works to methodically

describe the new number system to Europeans and to demonstrate its practical,

commercial use through detailed and copious examples.

        The Pisan colony of Bugia in the Middle Ages was an important source for two

trade items: a fine grade of beeswax and high-quality leather. Originally a minor Roman

colony, the city was revived in the 11th Century by the Berbers. The Pisans took the

Algerian colony from their Genoese rivals in the mid-12th Century, and established a

trading port that not only exported North African goods, but also served as a conduit of

Eastern luxury items of all kinds into Europe.

        Leonardo’s father served as a customs official and perhaps local representative

of the merchants in the Pisan colony in the late-1100’s and thus may have had

responsibility for recording the inflow and outflow of the goods through the port.11 At

least two problems in Liber Abaci concern the calculation and payment of customs duties.

Indeed, as an official representative of the Italian merchants in Bugia, Leonardo’s father

would presumably have understood the nature and value of the range of merchandise in

which they traded, and perhaps even the system of record and notation, accounts and

language used by Arab traders. Leiber (1968) notes regular business correspondence in

Arabic between Muslim and Pisan merchants from the years 1200 to 1202.12 Thus,

Leonardo not only had an education in Eastern mathematics, but deep family roots in

Mediterranean trade.

        In his own account of his life, Leonardo explains that he traveled extensively

throughout the Mediterranean as a young man – presumably as a merchant himself. He

notes that he pursued mathematical knowledge from “whoever was learned in it, from

nearby Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily and Provence …to which locations of business I
                                              13
traveled afterwards for much study.”               Leonardo returned from his travels sometime

around 1200, at about age 30 and published Liber Abaci in 1202. He revised it in a

second edition of 1228.            The oldest extant edition of the book is a handwritten

manuscript from 1291, now in the Biblioteca Riccardiana in Firenze.14 Copied more than

goods. The modern French word “duanes,” for example, derives from the Arabic “dowanes” for customs.

to books. Although he cites other works, his own account suggests that mathematical education during his
lifetime was, at least in large part, an oral tradition.

sixty years after the original, according to Siegler (2002) it contains a variety of minor

mathematical errors – some noted by the later copyist, other not, suggesting a slow

accretion of mistakes through repeated hand-copying over the decades from 1228 to 1291

– implying among other things            a sustained interest in the book after its original

appearance.15 Indeed, the fact that Leonardo produced a second edition attests to the

interest in the book even during his lifetime.

        Little else is known of Leonardo’s life in Pisa, except that he wrote a number of

other mathematical treatises, and corresponded with members of Emperor Fredrick II’s

court. The emperor himself is thought to have read Liber Abaci, and, on one of his visits

to Italy, granted the famous mathematician an audience.

        Leonardo received a pension from the Republic of Pisa in 1241 for “ educating its

citizens and for his painstaking, dedicated service.”             Professor Heinz Lhneburg has

posted a Latin transcript of the document – it suggests that the city was equally grateful

for his teaching (doctrinum) and his accounting and valuation (abbacandis estimationibus

et rationibus).16 We can thus surmise from this that much of his life was devoted to

teaching mathematics and advising the Pisan government on issues of finance and

accounting.

Sources and Predecessors

        Leonardo gives considerable credit throughout Liber Abaci                    to the work of

Muhammad ibn Mūsá Al Khwārizmī [c.780-850], the 9th century court astronomer of

Baghdad who wrote the famous treatise The Algebra, for whom that entire branch of

mathematics is named.17 A few earlier “Algorisms” – as translations and variations on

The Algebra are called --        appear in European context before the publication of Liber

Abaci. The earliest dates to the early or Mid-12th century.18 However these other

algorisms hone fairly closely to Khwārizmī’s work.

        Liber Abaci, obviously owes an intellectual debt to Al Khwārizmī, not only in his

use of Indian numerals but also in the extensive use of algebraic methods. The two

works differ significantly in many ways, however. Liber Abaci is a much longer book,

containing many more problems and solutions and introducing a considerably broader

range of practical applications.       More importantly, the two authors treat fundamentally

different types of practical problems.           For example, most of Al Khwārizmī’s non-

geometric examples are problems of inheritance. They deal with the complexity of

dividing assets among family members and other claimants. A typical question is:

                        [A man] leaves two sons and ten dirhems of capital
                 and a demand of ten dirhems against one of the sons, and
                 bequeaths one-fifth of his property and one dirhem to a
                 stranger..”19

        Thus, Al Khwārizmī’s focus is not fundamentally commercial, but directed

towards legal issues related to legacies and dowries – a class of problems that might in

fact have inspired him to write his book. As we will see in further discussion of Liber

Abaci below, Leonardo takes the solution methods from Al Khwārizmī’s Algebra and

adapts them to problems of dividing the capital from commercial ventures among

partners, rather than among family members. Thus, the works share methodological

approaches but differ in applications and scope.

        An equally important precedent for Liber Abaci’s more commercial orientation is

the practical tradition of Hindu mathematics.                  For at least seven centuries before

Fibonacci, Indian mathematicians were calculating interest rates and investment growth.

For example, one of India’s earliest mathematicians, Āryabhata [475 – 550] presents and

solves some interest rate problems in his famous book, Āryabhatīya -- a work otherwise

known for its contribution to astronomy.20 In the 7th Century, Bhāskara [c. 600-680]

wrote and extension and commentary on Āryabhatīya which contains several practical

applications of       the mathematics in the earlier work, including partnership share

divisions, and the relative pricing of commodies.21 Sridharacarya’s [c. 870-930] 10th

Century Trisastika, a work of 300 verse couplets, contains a few very practical interest

rate problems and a division of partnership problem.22

        One particularly interesting example of an Indian mathematical precedent to

Leonardo’s work is a problem posed by the ninth-century Jain mathematician Mahavira

[c. 800-870]in his Ganita Sara Sangraha.                  In the Indian work, three merchants find a

purse lying in the road. The first asserts that the discovery would make him twice as

wealthy as the other two combined. The second claims his wealth would triple if he kept

the purse, and the third claims his wealth would increase five fold. Precisely the same

problem appears in Chapter 12 of Liber Abaci, leaving little doubt that at least certain

classical problems in Leonardo’s book derive from Indian texts – whether transmitted by

word of mouth over centuries through the Arab world, or even directly through now-lost

Arabic translations of Hindu works. Closer to Leonardo’s era, and very close to the spirit

of the financial problems in the Pisan’s work, the Lilivati of Bhāskarācārya [1114-1185],

dates to about 1150 A.D. and, like the earlier works Trisastika and Āryabhatīya, contains

some loan problems and methods of finding principal and interest.23                         Despite broad

parallels, however, none of the earlier Indian works develop a present-value criterion.

         Even in Europe there may have been mathematicians who shared Fibonacci’s

interest in applied mathematics. Savasorda [d. 1136], a Jewish encyclopoedist in 12th

Century Barcelona composed a mathematical treatise on arithmetic and geometry, but

also solved problems involving price, quantity and money.24 Levey (1952) argues from

close textual similarities that Fibonacci must have seen Savasorda’s work and adapted his

methodology of proof, although the work is not cited by the Pisan. Perhaps a follower

interest on loans of various sorts, from unsecured debt to mortgages to investment in seafaring enterprises.
Thus the commercial context for the development of the mathematics of discounting in India preceded the
surviving mathematical texts on the subject.

of Savasorda was one of the unnamed mathematics masters whom Fibonacci visited on

his travels.

        Thus, although we will never know all of Fibonacci’s sources for mathematical

methods and problems, his acknowledged Arabic precedents, and the likely multiple

Indian precedents, provide at least a conceptual foundation for his work. Never-the-less,

the differences are as interesting as the similarities. No previous work of algebra or

applied mathematics comes close to the comprehensive analysis of business and financial

transactions of Liber Abaci, and none provides a comparable text for the actual teaching

of applied mathematics. While it is structured a bit like previous algorisms – with the

number system first, followed by the introduction of basic operations and then fractions,

a large part of the book is devoted to progressively more complex word problems. In

chapter after chapter, Fibonacci first introduces a very simple problem and its solution,

and then provides increasingly sophisticated examples that use the same method of

solution and require applications of tools mastered in previous chapters. Let us now turn

to some of Liber Abaci’s key contributions.



Fractions and The Rule of Three

        After an initial discussion of arithmetic operations in the first four chapters,

chapters five and six of Liber Abaci introduce fractions and mixed numbers. Leonardo’s

fractions are a bit different from the modern form. They are “factored.” For example the

                                   3 2 1
number 5.123 would be written              5 . That is, the denominator of the leftmost
                                  10 10 10

fraction is the product of all denominator values that precede it.     This method was

particularly useful for calculations involving non-decimal monetary        and quantity


                                              14
systems. For example, monetary units based upon the Roman system used denari, soldi,

and lira, with 12 denari to the soldo and 20 soldi to the lira. In this notation, the units of

each denomination can be preserved in the fraction -- a price of five lira, six soldi and

                                              4 6
four denari can be represented as                  5.      Units of weight and measure can be even
                                             12 20

more complex.          According to Leonardo,

                           Pisan hundredweights … have in themselves one
                    hundred parts each of which is called a roll, and each roll
                    contains 12 ounces, and each of which weighs ½ 39
                    pennyweights; and each pennyweight contains 6 carobs and
                    a carob is 4 grains of corn.25


           Chapters 8 is entitled “on Finding the Value of Merchandise by the Principal

Method,” and it begins the application of the new mathematics to commercial problems.

The first problem he addresses is how to determine an unknown price from a given

quantity of merchandise when the price per unit is known -- suppose a 100 rolls costs 40

lira, how much would five rolls cost?                   He offers the solution through a diagram

     40 100
            and the solution as (40 * 5)/100.
      ?  5

           This simple solution is generally called “The Rule of Three,” and is one of the

oldest algebraic tools in mathematics.             The Rule of Three appears in the Āryabhatīya,

and is extended and elaborated upon in Bhāskara’s commentaries, in which he applies it

to problems quite similar to those analyzed by Leonardo.26

           Leonardo uses the Rule of Three with increasingly complex quantities and

currencies, applying it to examples drawn from trade around the Mediterranean. Goods

include hundredweights of hides, hundredpounds of pepper, tons of Pisan cheese, rools

of saffron, nutmeg and cinnamon, meters of oil, sestario of corn, canes of cloth, oil from

Constantinople. Currencies include denari, massamutini, bezants, tareni. Leonardo

colorfully describes transactions in Sicily, the Barbary Coast, Syria, Alexandria,

Florence, Genoa, Messina and Barcelona. The prosaic nature of each of these problems

speaks of the practical import and the likely appeal of the book to merchants.          For

example, for a Pisan cloth merchant who trades perhaps in Syrian damask, and competes

with a Genoese merchant, it would have been useful to be able to translate across three

different units of length:

                     A Pisan cane is 10 palms or four arms however a Genoese
                     cane is said to be 9 palms. And furthermore the canes of
                     Provence and Sicily and Syria and Constantinople are the
                     same measure.27


            Or for traders of raw cotton here is a useful problem:

                              One has near Sicily a certain ship laden with 11
                     hundreweights and 47 rolls of cotton, and one wishes to
                     convert them to packs; because 1/3 1 hundredweights of
                     cotton … is one pack, then four hundredweight of cotton
                     are 3 packs and for rolls of cotton are 3 rolls of a pack; you
                     write down in the problem the 11 hundredweights and 47
                     rolls , that is 1147 rolls below the 4 rolls of cotton and you
                     will multiply the 1147 by three and you divide by the 4;
                     the quotient will be ¼ 860 rolls of a pack.28


            Following this basic technology, Fibonacci then extends the problems to those of

exchange between two goods – for example:

                            It is proposed that 7 rolls of pepper are worth 4
                     bezants and 9 pounds of saffron are worth 11 bezants, and

Showing how to multiply 23 * 4 * 9 and divide by the diagonal elements 7*11 to arrive at

the solution. This pattern can thus be applied to any longer sequence of intermediate

trades to establish no-arbitrage relationships among commodities in a market. This

solution is essentially the application of the “Rule of Five” that Bhāskara and later Indian

mathematicians developed for expressing price/quantity          relationships across several

goods. Sarma (2002) points out that the horizontal expression of The Rule of Five in

Western algorisms is orthogonal to the vertical orientation of the Indian application of the

rule.31 Thus, either an intermediate Arabic manuscript changed the algorithm, or the

solution method was transmitted West conceptually, without a written Indian model.

         Although the mathematics of the Rules of Three and Five are trivial to us 800

years later, they were unquestionably a vital quantitative tool of the arbitrageur of the

13th Century. Italian merchants were buying saffron and pepper from their Arab counter-

parties, who were the primary intermediaries in the spice trade. Merchants who could not

calculate the relative value of saffron and pepper in the market – or perhaps could only do

so approximately, or with some difficulty -- were at an extreme disadvantage in trade

and negotiation. Just as today’s hedge funds use sophisticated, quantitative models to

rapidly calculate the relative price of two mortgage-backed securities, and then use these

calculations to establish a long or a short position if they detect a mispricing, so must 13th

Century Pisan merchants, bartering in a Damascus suk with spice traders, have used a

rapid series of arithmetic calculations to detect and exploit deviations from price parity

and barter their way towards profit. It is thus not surprising that the knowledge of the

Rule of Three extended in antiquity along trade routes.



Foreign Exchange and Coinage

        Leonardo also applies the Rules of Three and Five to problems of currency

exchange. Here, the practical demand for a guide to monetary conversions must have

been considerable. Peter Spufford charts the evolution of an extraordinary patchwork of

currencies in Medieval Europe around Leonardo’s time [See Figure 1].32 Italy had the

highest concentration of different currencies with 28 different cites at one time or other

issuing coins in the Middle Ages -- 7 in Tuscany alone. Most, but not all, of them were

based on the Roman system of “d,s,l” denari, soldi, lire – familiar to English readers as

the pounds, shilling and pence system.              However their relative value and metallic

composition varied considerably through time and across space. The varieties of currency

created business for money changers, “Banche Del Giro,” where monetary systems

came into contact, and these money changers and their customers needed tools for

calculation. Before Fibonacci, the common method for exchange arithmetic was the

abacus, or versions based on moving markers in grooves or along scored lines on a table.

As such, the algorithmic solution to an exchange problem was separated from the written

expression of the problem – Arabic numerals allowed the solution to be calculated on

paper based upon the written statement of the problem. This almost certainly altered and

                                                  18
improved the way money changers could model and analyze relative values of multiple

currencies rapidly.    It is one thing to be able to accurately calculate a sequence of

monetary exchanges one at a time – it is another thing to be able to set up a series of

equations of relative value, and to place algebraic bounds on how much any currency is

worth in terms of another.         Reading Liber Abaci one has the sense that Italian

merchants of the 13th century operated in a world of complete relativism. With no central

government, no dominant currency, and even competing faiths and heresies, value is

expressed quite abstractly only in a set of relative relations to other items. While many

of Leonardo’s examples use money as a unit of calculation, the currencies vary arbitrarily

from example to example – almost as if to stress the flexibility and broad applicability of

his algebraic approach.

       Indeed, money of his day was not quite money in the way we currently think of it.

Transactions might be expressed in a certain currency, or unit of account, but the quantity

of physical coinage corresponding to that unit could vary through time, as governments

regularly debased and re-valued their currencies. One of the attractive things about a

pure gold coin, like the Florentine florin first minted in 1252, is that it could serve

simultaneously as a unit of account and of transaction, with a 1:1 numeric

correspondence. Most silver coinage of the time had at least some level of debasement

with copper that caused its value relative to bullion to fluctuate through time.   It is thus

not surprising that Leonardo’s monetary analysis goes beyond currency conversions into

problems of minting and alloying of money. An entire chapter is devoted to the methods

for minting coins of silver and copper.




                                             19
        Certain cities – including Pisa -- had imperial rights to coin money, and mints in

these cities operated by striking coins from bullion brought to them from the public and

the private sector. A merchant who wished to turn a quantity of metal (perhaps even old

coins) into currency would pay a seigniorage fee to the mint for the production of coin.

During much of Leonardo’s lifetime, the Pisan penny was pegged to the value of the

Lucchese penny and together they became the standard monetary unit in Tuscany, with

little evidence of debasement or changes in the metallic composition.              In contrast, also

during Leonardo’s lifetime, the currency of Northern Italy underwent a revolution --

cites began to mint large silver coins called grossi. In the late 1220’s (around the time of

the second edition of Liber Abaci) Lucca introduced a coin with a high silver content

worth 12 denari.33 This followed the introduction of grossi by Genoa in 1172 and by

Venice in 1192. Leonardo does not specifically address the relative value of grossi and

denari on his chapter on minting of coin, instead abstracting away from particular

currencies to the general methods of calculation and evaluation of relative proportions of

silver and copper in coins. Presumably the methodology developed in Liber Abaci was

useful not only to the master of the Pisa mint, but perhaps to merchants who brought

metal to be coined, and paid the seignorage.



III. Finance and Interest Rate Problems

        Most of the pure finance problems in Liber Abaci are in the twelfth chapter – as is

the famous “Fibonacci series” example. The finance in this chapter is of four general

types. The first type concerns how the profits from joint business ventures should be

                                                 20
fairly split when contributions are unequal and are made at different points in time, and in

different currencies or goods and in cases in which business partners borrow from each

other. The second type concerns the calculation of the profits from a sequence of business

trips in which profit and expense or withdrawal of capital occurs at each stop. The third is

the calculation of future values from investments made with banking houses. The fourth

is present value analysis as we now think of it, including specifically the difference

between annual and quarterly compound interest.



Division of Profits

           The mathematics of dividing profits from business joint ventures was obviously

relevant to Italian merchants of the 13th Century. The basic business unit used to finance

many of the trade ventures in Northern Italy in the Middle Ages was the commenda

contract between an investor and his               traveling partner – the former (commedator)

investing capital and the latter (tractator) investing labor. John H. Pryor’s (1977) study of

commeda from the 12th Century describes two basic types – a unilateral and a bi-lateral

contract – the former providing limited liability but smaller profit to the tractator and the

latter sharing the potential losses equally between the contracting parties.34                     In the

standard, uni-lateral commenda, the commendator would transfer capital to the tractator

for the duration of the voyage (or term of the contract) and would take ¾ of the profit.

Much of what is known about commeda has been gleaned from studies of notarial

documents in Italian and French archives, and Pisan records are among the oldest. Pisa’s

Constitutum Usus (1156) is the earliest surviving municipal document specifying the

conditions of the commeda contract. 35            The unilateral commeda in Pisa was very much

like the contract described by Leonardo in a problem of division of profits, writing 44

years after the statues. The problem “On Companies,” is worth quoting at length:

                     Whenever … any profit of an association is divided among
                     its members we must show how the same must be done
                     according to the abovewritten method of negotiation …We
                     then propose this of a certain company which has in its
                     association 152 pounds, for which the profit is 56 pounds,
                     and is sought how much of the same profit each of its
                     members must be paid in pounds. First, indeed, according
                     to Pisan custom, we must put aside one fourth of the
                     abovewritten profit [apparently for the tractator] ; after this
                     is dealt with, there remain 42 pounds. Truly if you wish to
                     find this according to the popular method, you will find the
                     rule of 152, that is 18 190 ; you divide the profit, namely the 42
                     pounds; by 8; the quotient will be 5 pounds and 5 soldi
                     which are 105 soldi, which you divide by the 19; the

Fibonacci’s problem provides a fascinating example of how commenda were used.

Although the tractator profits were divided according to Pisan custom, the commendator

shares could be divided among several investors, whose association is termed a societas.

Fibonacci thus develops a general approach to dividing the profits from a societas

                                                    22
according to the proportion of contributed capital. His approach is the now familiar

definition of a rate of return on a unit of capital which is then scaled by the amount

invested. Robert Lopez argues that societas and the commenda contracts were the

original European forms of business association from which modern partnership and

corporations ultimately developed. Consequently, the commenda example, and related

problems addressed by Fibonacci in Liber Abaci, were significant early contributions to

“pre-corporate” financial economics.



Traveling Merchant Problems

           The second type of financial problem is a set of “traveling merchant” examples,

akin to accounting calculations for profits obtained in a series of trips to trading cities.

The first example is:

                     A certain man proceeded to Lucca on business to make a
                     profit doubled his money, and he spent there 12 denari. He
                     then left and went through Florence; he there doubled his
                     money, and spent 12 denari. Then he returned to Pisa,
                     doubled his money and it is proposed that he had nothing
                     left. It is sought how much he had at the beginning.37


Leonardo proposes an ingenious solution method. Since capital doubles at each stop, the

discount factor for the third cash flow (in Pisa) is ½ ½ ½ . He multiplies the periodic

cash flow of 12 denari times a discount factor that is the sum of the individual discount

                                     1 1 1
factors for each trip i.e.            + + .   The solution is 10½ denari. The discount factor
                                     2 4 8

effectively reduces the individual cash flows back to the point before the man reached

Lucca.        Notice that this approach can be generalized to allow for different cash flows at

different stages of the trip, a longer sequence of trips, different rates of return at each

stop, or a terminal cash flow. In the twenty examples that follow the Lucca-Florence-

Pisa problem, Leonardo presents and solves increasingly complex versions with various

unknown elements. For example, one version of the problem specifies the beginning

value and requires that the number of trips to be found – e.g. “A certain man had 13

bezants, and with it made trips, I know not how many, and in each trip he made double

and he spent 14 bezants. It is sought how many were his trips.”38              This and other

problems demonstrate the versatility of his discounting method. They also provide a

framework for the explicit introduction of the dimension of time, and the foundation for

what we now consider finance.



Interest Rate and Banking Problems

            Immediately following the trip problems, Fibonacci poses and solves a series of

banking problems. Each of these follows the pattern established by the trips example –

the capital increases by some percentage at each stage, and some amount is deducted.

For example:

                     A man placed 100 pounds at a certain [banking] house for
                     4 denari per pound per month interest and he took back
                     each year a payment of 30 pounds. One must compute in
                     each year the 30 pounds reduction of capital and the profit
                     on the said 30 pounds. It is sought how many years,
                     months, days and hours he will hold money in the
                     house....39


Fibonacci explains that the solution is found by using the same techniques developed in

the trips section. Intervals of time replace the sequence of towns visited and thus a time-

series of returns and cash draw-downs can be evaluated. Once the method of trips has

been mastered, then it is straightforward to construct a multiperiod discount factor and

apply it to the periodic payment of 30 pounds – although in this problem the trick is to

determine the number of time periods used to construct the factor. Now we might use

logarithms to address the problem of the nth root for an unknown n, but Fibonacci lived

long before the invention of logarithms. Instead, he solves it by brute force over the

space of three pages, working forward from one period to two periods etc. until he finds

                                    13
the answer of 6 years, 8 days and      5 hours. The level of sophistication represented by
                                    29

this problem alone is unmatched in the history of financial analysis. Although the

mathematics of interest rates had a 3,000 year history before Fibonacci, his remarkable

exposition and development of multi-period discounting is a quantum leap above his

predecessors.

       Eleven banking house problems follow this initial mathematical tour de force.

Each of them has some value of the problem that is unknown – either the future value, the

present value, the rate of interest, the duration of the loan, or the periodic dividend that is

withdrawn. Fibonacci provides model solutions to each unknown, basing all of them on

the previously introduced “trips” paradigm.

       It is a bit surprising to find such an overt description of the charging of interest by

bankers in the 13th Century, given the ecclesiastical proscription against usury. John

Munro has argued convincingly that, while Church doctrine had long forbidden usury,

vigorous institutional attacks on the charging of interest began in earnest in the early 13th

century and were a major impetus for          the development of census and rentes and

perpetual bond contracts – all of which circumvented the ecclesiastical definition of


                                              25
loans.40    Liber Abaci       was written just before the formation of the Franciscan and

Dominican orders (1206 and 1216 respectively) who were at the vanguard of the fight

against usury. The Church’s attack on the charging of interest was in fact an attack on

just the operations described and analyzed in Leonardo’s book.41



Present Value Analysis

         The most sophisticated of Fibonacci’s interest rate problems is “On a Soldier

Receiving Three Hundred Bezants for his Fief.” In it, a soldier is granted an annuity by

the king of 300 bezants per year, paid in quarterly installments of 75 bezants. The king

alters the payment schedule to an annual year-end payment of 300. The soldier is able to

earn 2 bezants on one hundred per month (over each quarter) on his investment. How

much is his effective compensation after the terms of the annuity have changed? To

solve this, Fibonacci explains

                  First indeed you strive to reduce this problem to the method
                  of trips and it is reduced thus… because there are 4
                  payments, 4 trips are similarly carried, and because each
                  payment is 75 bezants, this is had for the expense of each

Negotiability', The International History Review, 25(3) September, pp. 505-62.
          41
             There is some evidence in Liber Abaci that Fibonacci’s financial analysis may have roots in the
ancient Near East. Consider this problem: “A certain man gave one denaro at interest so that in five years
he must receive double the denari, and in another five he must have double two of the denari and thus
forever from 5 to 5 years the capital and interest are doubled. It is sought how many denari from this one
denaro he must have in 100 years.” Compare this to the problem from the Old Babylonian tablet 8528 in
the Berlin museum published by Otto Neugebauer (1935). It asks: “If I lent one mina of silver at the rate of
12 shekels (a shekel is equal to 1/60 of a mina) per year, and I received in repayment, one talent (60 minas)
and 4 minas. How long did the money accumulate?” [Sigler, 2002, Op.cit. p. 437] The solution is found
by capitalizing interest only when the outstanding principal doubles. At 20%, the principal doubles every
five years. Thus, the answer is that it would take 30 years for the debt to grow to 64 minae. The doubling
over five year intervals seems a striking parallel, particularly given the fact that an annual compound rate
that yields that result is not a round number – it is something less than 15%.

                     trip. Next because 53 is made from 50, you put           for
                                                                           53

The product of these ratios is used to discount a payment by four periods (or trips).

Notice that Fibonacci’s novel fraction expression allows each term to be successively

discounted by one more period. The discounted annual value of the 300 bezants paid in

the last period is 259 and change. As before, Fibonacci explains how to construct a

multi-period discount factor from the product of the reciprocals of the periodic growth

rate of an investment, using the model developed from mercantile trips in which a

percentage profit is realized at each city.       In this problem, he explicitly quantifies the

difference in the value of two contracts due to the timing of the cash flows alone. As

such, this particular example marks the discovery of one of the most important tools in

the mathematics of Finance – an analysis explicitly ranking different cash flow streams

based upon their present value.



Institutional and Commercial Context

           The soldier’s present value problem above testifies to the fact that the

mathematics of time-value discounting was apparently important 1202 when Liber Abaci

was written. However, over the next few centuries its significance to governmental and

commercial transactions grew tremendously.              With the growth of international trade --

and warfare – in the late Middle Ages, the need for long-distance monetary transfers

increased.        Chinese merchants had solved this problem centuries earlier with the use of

feichan “flying money” remittance certificates issued by government institutions in

42
     Sigler (2002) Op.cit, p. 392.


                                                 27
provincial capitals. Arab merchants in Fibonacci’s time used an instrument much like a

modern personal check for paper remittance. Neither of these explicitly involved a

discount for the time-value of money. Early European money transfers -- bills of

exchange -- did. Any distant remittance involved a time interval due to travel, and

compensation for the use of the money over that period is natural, so bills of exchange

were typically discounted to compensate for forgone interest revenue – essentially as in

the example of “The Soldier Receiving Three Hundred Bezants for his Fief.” Thus, bills

of exchange were also interest rate instruments. Ashtor (1983) published the earliest

known bill of exchange which appears to date from 1220.43 Sivéry (1983) identifies an

Italian discount contract with an implicit interest rate of around 11% from the year

1252.44    Both the early 13th century date and the Levantine origin of Medieval bills of

exchange form an interesting parallel to the publication date and Eastern influences of

Liber Abaci. Were the mathematical tools for present value imported to Italy along with

bills of exchange and Arabic numerals? Or did the technological innovation of using

bills of exchange as debt securities (called “dry-exchange” by Medieval practitioners),

stimulate mathematical work on the time value of money? In all likelihood, it was a

fertile interplay between commerce and mathematical advancement, and Leonardo of

Pisa was at its geographical and intellectual center.

                 Another key innovation occurred in northern Italy around Fibonacci’s

lifetime – the creation of long-term government debt. Venice and Genoa both began to

issue forced loans to her wealthy citizens in the late 12th Century. In 1171, for example,

Venice issued a mandatory 5% loan to all citizens of the Republic to finance the

construction of a fleet to fight Byzantium.45 Out of this and successive loans called

prestiti a regular market for government debt developed in Venice by the mid-13th

century. The consolidation of the Venetian debt by decree in 1262 institutionalized the

funding of municipal debt, and gave birth to the now widespread modern practice of

financing the government through a national debt.

        The roots of this debt revolution can be found in the financial records of Pisa

itself. Pisa in Leonardo’s time regularly made long-term debt commitments to creditors,

promising the perpetual flow of revenues from specific sources to amortize a debt.

Favier (1971) reports just such a contract with a creditor of the commune in 1173.46

Historian David Herlihy points out that the public finances of the commune became

increasingly complex through the course of the 13th Century. Pisan governors – podesta -

- began to raise money through capitalization of taxation and monopoly rights.47                  The

economic decision to alienate a stream of future cash flows in return for a current lump-

sum payment is essentially a present value consideration. There is no doubt that the

mathematical techniques in Liber Abaci would have allowed the podesta to quantify these

decisions in a manner not feasible before Fibonacci’s work. In fact, the annuity settled

on Fibonacci late in his life for service to the state suggests that he may have had a hand

in advising on precisely these financial contracts.

          The technology of present value in Liber Abaci would also have served the

analysis of private commercial transactions.             Consider, for example, the extraordinary

futures contracts quoted in neighboring Pistoia from at least the beginning of the 13th

Century. From 1201 to 1210, contracts for delivery of perpetual delivery of a staio of

wheat sold for a median price of 2.80 lira – a period in which, according to Herlihy, the

“spot” price of a staio sold for ¼ of a lira.                Without a mathematical method for

discounting future deliveries, how did market participants determine the present value of

such contract?48 How were speculators able to arbitrage the relative prices of farmland

and futures contracts?          Indeed, did the capacity to discount future values exist in

Northern Italy before Fibonacci or did his mathematics make futures and complex fixed

income contracts possible?             Ultimately, It is difficult to disentangle the causal

relationship between the commercial problems of the day and the mathematical methods

for solving them. Almost certainly, as is true today, there was a dynamic relationship

between the analytical framework and the market. Mathematicians then, as now, must

have been motivated by problems in the world around them, and in turn, their solutions

engendered new advances in financial engineering.



Did Finance Influence the Mathematics of Infinite Series’ or Vice-Versa?

          The famous Fibonacci series problem is posed late in Chapter 12 – not as part of a

series of related problems, but included after a problem on finding numbers equal to the

sum of their factors, and before an algebra problem about four men with money.                         Is

there any connection between the famous series and the commercial problems in the

chapter? Certainly Chapter 12 is full of examples of compound growth from period to

period – in particular, proportional increases in capital. The arithmetic of constructing a

sequence of future values establishes a basis for considering a number of other, curious,

infinite series.’ One particularly interesting example of this sort in Chapter 12 is about

the problem of doubling grains of wheat on a chessboard and summing the result –

starting with only two grains, and doubling them through a chessboard of 64 squares

leads to a quantity that is so great that “The number of ships [required to carry it] is

effectively infinite and uncountable…”49 Fibonacci marvels at how a simple growth

algorithm applied to the well-known and finite pattern of a chessboard leads to imagining

a vast, nearly infinite magnitude.      This example suggests that Fibonacci’s study of

infinite series’ may actually have developed as an extension of his analyses of

compounding rates of return in finance problems.



After Liber Abaci

            No matter how revolutionary, Leonardo’s book did not suddenly advance Pisa to

the economic forefront of competing Tuscan communes in the 13th Century. Although

Pisa grew significantly during this period, she gradually lost out to other cites in the

competition for the Levantine trade. Pisan merchants increasingly turned toward the

North African colonies and trade with France and Spain, leaving trade with

Constantinople and the Holy Land to her rivals Venice and Genoa. Larger political

forces trumped any commercial or technological advantage potentially enjoyed as a result

of Leonardo’s writing and teaching.

            One enduring aspect of Fibonacci’s legacy is business education. Van Egmond

(1980) documents a dramatic increase in the number of commercial arithmetic books in
49
     Sigler (2002), Op.cit. p. 437.


                                             31
Italy during the centuries following the writing of Liber Abaci and Natalie Zemon Davis

(1960) does the same for France.50 Hundreds of hand-written and printed arithmetic

books have survived from the European Renaissance, and many of them draw directly or

indirectly from Leonardo’s Liber Abaci. Undoubtedly beginning with Leonardo’s own

efforts to educate the citizens of Pisa in the 13th Century, Italian businessmen learned

techniques of valuation and discounting according to his methods. When 15th century

Florentine bankers extended their lending operations throughout Europe, they already had

a centuries-long Italian tradition of financial mathematics upon which to draw.51 To see

how the mathematics of Finance developed after Fibonacci, let us consider two of the

most important examples of his legacy of arithmetic writing and education: one from

the 15th Century and another from the 16th Century.

         The earliest extant printed commercial arithmetic is the Treviso Arithmetic of

1478, a volume of commercial problems written in the Venetian dialect, apparently used
                                                                             52
widely as a text for Renaissance Italian “Reckoning” schools.                      Liber Abaci and the

Treviso are clearly written in the same style – with an introduction to arithmetic

operations, followed by chapters devoted to such topics as partnerships and division of

profits, applications of ratios to trade and exchange, and metallurgy and coinage.

Lacking in the Treviso, however are interest-rate problems and methods of discount. –

perhaps reflecting the influence of usury laws in the preceding centuries curtailed their

explicit role in mathematical education.53 We know Italians were using discounting

technology widely at this time, but apparently it would not do to include such examples

in a published book.

         By contrast, a book published a century later in Lyons draws heavily on the

financial technology        of Liber Abaci, and in fact demonstrates the fundamental role in

European finance played by present value analysis.                   L’ Arithmetique written by Jean

Trenchant in 1558 follows the general structure of earlier and contemporary arithmetics.

However, unlike the the author of the Treviso, Trenchant also devotes a major section of

his book to interest rate and present value problems.                 Trenchant poses one problem in

particular that clearly builds on Fibonacci’s work, but is an actual “case” rather than

simply an illustrative example.



                  In the year 1555, King Henry, to conduct the war, took
                  money from bankers at the rate of 4% per fair. That is
                  better terms for them than 16% per year. In this same year
                  before the fair of Toussaints, he received by the hands of
                  certain bankers the sum of 3,945,941 ecus and more, which
                  they called “Le Grand Party” on the condition that he will
                  pay interest at 5% per fair for 41 fairs after which he will
                  be finished. Which of these conditions is better for the
                  bankers?54


The question is posed whether Henry’s perpetuity at 4% per quarter is worth more or less

than his 5% per quarter annuity for 41 quarters. Here, three and a half centuries after

Leonardo, mathematicians are using methods developed in Liber Abaci to finance the

struggle for control of Europe.               Trenchant, in fact, may have been one of the

mathematicians consulted in the structuring and valuation of these loans – he lived in

Lyons where the financing took place.

       Trenchant’s solution is an elegant one.    Rather than calculating the present value

of the annuity and the perpetuity separately and comparing the two, he takes the

incremental cash flow generated by the annuity over the 41 quarters and calculates the

future value of that steam, under the assumption that each extra 1% payment per quarter

is loaned at interest until the end of the period. He observes that, if the future value of

this cumulated residual is less than the value of a perpetuity 41 quarters hence, then the

4% perpetuity is worth more than the annuity.

       Earlier in his book he develops methods for calculating geometric progressions.

He uses these methods to calculate a sequence of 41 numbers representing the future

value of the 41 incremental cash flows due from the annuity, and then sums them and

scales the value to the initial investment, allowing a comparison in percentage terms to

any given initial investment in the perpetuity. He finds that the annuity is only worth

99.2% of the perpetuity, and thus concludes that the first deal is a better one for the

bankers than the second.

       Trenchant’s analysis is noteworthy in that it demonstrates how important present

value analysis had become in Europe by the 16th Century. Over the centuries following

Leonardo, the present value method evolved from being the tool of an Italian commune

seeking to reduce its pension expenses, to a critical factor in the financing of the defense

of France. Unlike Leonardo who relied upon the analogy to trips, but who made a major

contribution to the mathematics of infinite series’, Trenchant’s exposition of present

value analysis was based directly upon solutions to geometric series. In fact, Trenchant

is interesting is his own right.         His development of present value analysis is more

complete than that of Fibonacci – considering as it does the difference between an

annuity and a perpetuity. Among other things, his book was the first to publish a table of

discount factors for present value calculation.



East and West Revisited

        Returning to the broader theme of the contrast between Europe and the Far East

during the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, it is curious that the interplay between

mathematics and financial contracts witnessed in Europe from 1200 to 1700 was not

matched in China, despite the advancement of both the Chinese financial system and

Chinese mathematics – and indeed despite the cultural ties that linked China, India and

the Middle East fostered by religious and commercial intercourse.                       Although the

fragmentation of European monetary systems, the complexity of Mediterranean trade and

the proscription again usury may also have been stimulating factors in the joint

development of increasingly sophisticated financial tools and analytical methods, the

largest institutional factor differentiating Europe and China in this period is public

finance. James Tracy (1985) shows that, beginning around the turn of the 12th Century,

cities like Venice, Genoa, Sienna and Florence in the South, and Douai, Valias and Ghent

in Northern Europe all began to rely increasingly upon a variety of forms of debt

financing.55 In the North, cities sold long-term life-rent contracts to citizens, both

perpetual and fixed term, creating a rentier class in the Late Middle Ages. In the South,

cities issued callable bonds, non-callable bonds -- even bonds callable by lottery.56 The

assignability of these contracts led to active public securities trading – most spectacularly

in 13th Century Venice near the Rialto bridge, where the first bond market was born. 57

        Even in the Middle Ages, public finance and private commerce relied upon an

analytical system of valuation, and Fibonacci’s book is the earliest historical evidence of

such a system in Europe. While earlier evidence of such calculation may not have

survived, the internal textual evidence in Liber Abaci, in particular the endogenous

development of discounting methods from the analogy to trips, suggests that his

contribution to the financial mathematics of the time was original.

        History proceeds by processes of broad cultural trends, salient political and

military events and population movements, as well as by discoveries and contributions

by individuals. In China, there is little question that wars during the Song era stimulated

a desperate need for innovations in governmental finance. Indeed, these pressures led to

the invention in China of paper money, and the “discovery” of inflation – but not,

interestingly enough, to state borrowing and deficit finance. Is this because China had

no previous tradition of census contracts, or was it because of the diverging technological

development of Finance and Financial Economics in the West, a development that

eventually culminated in the far-flung capitalist empires of the late 19th Century? Had
