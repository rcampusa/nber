                                          ABSTRACT

Post-crisis stress tests have altered banks’ credit supply to small business. Banks affected by
stress tests reduce credit supply and raise interest rates on small business loans. Banks price the
implied increase in capital requirements from stress tests where they have local knowledge, and
exit markets where they do not, as quantities fall most in markets where stress-tested banks do not
own branches near borrowers, and prices rise mainly where they do. These reductions in supply
are concentrated among risky borrowers. Stress tests do not, however, reduce aggregate credit.
Small banks increase their share in geographies formerly reliant on stress-tested lenders.

I.      Introduction

           Credit to all classes of borrowers grew sharply during the run-up to the Great

Recession, including loans to large and small businesses. During the early years of the crisis,

bank originations of business loans fell by as much as 40% (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Lending to

large businesses has bounced back since the Great Recession: in 2016, total real C&I loans on

bank balance sheets were more than 50% higher than in 2007. The recovery of small business

lending, however, continues to be slow. In 2016, small business loans on bank balance sheets

remained lower than in 2007 (Figure 2). What explains the slow recovery in small business

lending? One of the most prominent explanations has been increased regulation, including stress

testing. The extant literature suggests that banks facing regulatory capital constraints cut their

lending supply, and stress tests create a direct link from bank lending risk to capital. 1

           This paper provides new evidence that stress tests conducted by the Federal Reserve led

to a decrease in affected banks’ small business credit supply. 2 Banks more affected by stress tests

reduce their supply of small business loans. They do so by increasing interest rates and by

rebalancing their loan portfolios toward less risky loans. This reduction in supply by stress-test-

affected banks, however, does not lead to aggregate declines in small business loan originations.

The decline is largely absorbed by banks not subject to the stress tests. These small(er) banks

increase their loan originations and claim larger market share in geographies formerly reliant on


1
  The Clearinghouse Association, an advocate for banks, points specifically to the stress tests as imposing unduly
harsh (implicit) capital requirements on small business loans and on residential mortgages (Clearinghouse, 2017 and
Covas, 2017). More generally, a large academic literature on bank “capital crunches” documents that shocks to
bank equity capital have large contractionary effects on the supply of lending (Bernanke, 1983; Bernanke and Lown,
1991; Kashyap and Stein, 1995, 2000; Houston, James, and Marcus, 1997; Peek and Rosengren, 1997, 2000;
Campello, 2002; Calomiris and Mason, 2003; Calomiris and Wilson, 2004; Cetorelli and Goldberg, 2012).

  Whether the Federal Reserve’s stress-testing model implicitly imposes higher capital requirements on small
business lending than on other types of lending is beyond the scope of this paper. Answering this question
empirically is challenging as the Federal Reserve does not disclose the details of its models.




                                                        1
stress-tested lenders. Overall, our evidence does not support the notion that stress tests

contributed to a slower recovery of small business lending.

           Our empirical strategy exploits the heterogeneity in large banks’ exposure to stress

tests. Comparing stress-tested banks with non-tested banks is problematic because large stress-

tested banks differ from small banks in many ways. We therefore focus most of our tests on the

group of 32 stress-tested BHCs (and their subsidiary banks) and use a new measure – stress-test

exposure – to capture cross-sectional variation in exposure to the test. Our stress-test exposure

measure captures a potential decline in banks’ capital under stress and equals the difference

between the BHC’s current capital ratio and the lowest implied capital ratio expected under the

severely adverse stress-test scenario. 3

           Stress tests provide a systematic measure of how much a bank might lose during a

hypothetical severe economic downturn, which then gets translated into a forecast of its

regulatory capital ratios conditional on various stress scenarios. Larger projected declines in

capital under stress scenarios (large values of stress-test exposure) are likely to incentivize

affected banks to reduce their current loan portfolio risks or to improve their capital ratios (e.g.,

by reducing planned dividend distributions and/or share repurchases). We utilize the publicly

available data on the stress-testing results in 2012 through 2016 to build the stress-test exposure

variables based on three capital ratios: the Tier 1 capital ratio, the total risk-based capital ratio,

and the Tier 1 leverage ratio, although our results are similar across all three measures.




3
  The Federal Reserve specifies three scenarios – baseline, adverse and severely adverse – and estimates the path of
each bank’s capital under each scenario over a nine-quarter planning horizon. We focus on the results from the
severely adverse scenario, as it is most likely to constrain a bank’s capital planning.




                                                         2
           To strengthen identification and mitigate potential unobserved heterogeneity, we

exploit heterogeneity in terms of loan risk and banks’ access to local information. 4 Facing larger

stress-test exposure, banks have an incentive to rebalance their loan portfolios toward less risky

loans and to raise the interest rates on risky ones. Risk matters for several reasons. First, there is

a direct link between the outcome of the stress tests and loan portfolio risk. By reducing the risk

of their loans, banks can loosen their capital requirement. Second, by requiring banks to hold

more capital, the stress tests may also reduce the moral hazard incentives to engage in excessive

risk-taking stemming from underpriced deposit insurance or too-big-to-fail protections (e.g.,

Feldman and Stern, 2004; Strahan, 2013; Acharya, Mehran, and Thakor, 2016). Consequently,

we expect the effect of banks’ stress-test exposure to be more pronounced among riskier

borrowers and/or riskier local markets.

           Access to local information also affects how banks might respond to stress-test

exposure. If small business loans are just commodities, then all of the variation in credit supply

at the individual bank level would manifest in quantities rather than prices. Yet a large literature

argues that small business lending often relies on soft information, which requires lenders to

know and develop long-lasting relationships with their borrowers. 5 A number of papers in this

literature use distance (whether a bank owns a branch near the borrower) to proxy access to local

information. Physical proximity both improves information production at the outset of lending

relationships and allows for better loan monitoring over the course of that relationship.

Relationship lending, however, also creates hold-up problems that allow informed banks to

4
  For example, one can argue, that banks more inclined to grow their (relatively riskier) C&I lending would
experience larger stress-induced declines in capital and hence higher stress-test exposure values. This would induce
an upward bias in our coefficient of interest.

extract higher rents from borrowers (Rajan, 1992). In our setting, banks exposed to larger stress-

test exposures thus might increase loan interest rates instead of reducing quantities in

geographies where they have a physical branch.

             To test these ideas, we first evaluate annual small business loan origination volumes

using data collected under the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). These data capture growth

in small business lending at the bank-county-year level. The granularity of the data allows us to

absorb potential demand-side confounds with granular county-time fixed effects. We then build a

county-level measure of local economy risk based on the sensitivity of local employment to

overall national employment (similar to market beta). Using this new measure, we document that

relative to less affected banks, those more affected by the stress tests reduce the quantity of

lending to small businesses in risky markets (counties) relative to safe markets. The results are

economically significant. A one-standard-deviation increase in stress-test exposure, for example,

leads riskier markets (those in the top quartile of the employment beta distribution) to experience

2% greater declines in small business loan originations than safer markets. 6 The declines in

quantities, however, only occur where banks do not have branches (and thus lack the

informational advantage to price in the higher risk). 7

             To investigate loan interest rates, we turn to the Survey of Terms of Business Lending

(STBL). These data provide loan-level price and non-price terms at quarterly frequency for a

sample of randomly selected banks’ lending to businesses. Specifically, the STBL collects data

on new loan originations during a full business week each quarter from each bank in the survey.

6
    These magnitudes are roughly twice as large using the leverage ratio.
7
  It is possible that CRA requirements limit banks’ willingness to reduce small business credit in CRA assessment
areas (those with bank branches). However, we also show that the effects of a local branch presence affect loan
pricing, and that these effects are concentrated among risky loans. It is hard to explain the pricing results by an
economic mechanism different from the informational advantage.




                                                            4
Since the STBL skews its sampling procedures toward large banks/BHCs, it captures loans

originated by banks owned by 26 out of 32 stress-tested BHCs. The STBL data offer a number of

advantages. First, the STBL provides detailed data on loan conditions such as the interest rate,

the commitment amount, maturity, collateral, etc. Second, each bank reports its internal

assessment of loan risk on a 1-4 scale, which we exploit in our tests. In contrast to the CRA data,

which reflect all of a bank’s new lending within each county, the STBL offers data on individual

loans originated by a subset of banks during a full business week window in each quarter and

only offers state-level location of a borrower.

         Using the STBL data, we document that banks more affected by the stress tests charge

higher interest rates on their loans to small businesses, consistent with an inward shift in credit

supply from the tests. The result is quantitatively important. A one-standard-deviation increase in

a bank’s stress-test exposure leads to about a 40-basis-point increase in the interest rate charged

on their small business loans, which is large relative to the overall variation in loan interest rates

(standard deviation = 127 basis points). The size of our estimated effect increases when we

control for other loan terms such as loan maturity and collateralization. This occurs because

non-price terms also tighten with stress-test exposure. As we show, a one-standard-deviation

increase in exposure leads to a decline in loan maturity of about 17%. The effect on interest

rates is significantly stronger in areas where banks have a local branch presence (local markets)

and hence possess an informational advantage. A one standard deviation increase in a bank’s

stress-test exposure leads to about a 55-basis-point interest rate increase in a bank’s local

markets, whereas it leads to just a 15-basis-point increase in non-local markets.

         We next contrast the effect of exposure to stress tests on risky versus safe loans. We

find that the effect of stress-test exposure on the pricing of safe loans is near zero or perhaps




                                                  5
even slightly negative, reflecting exposed banks’ desire to supply more low-risk credit. In

contrast, stress-test exposure leads to higher interest rates for small business loans in the two

highest loan risk categories. The effect is largest for riskier loans originated within banks’ branch

domains. Among these risky “local” loans, a one-standard deviation increase in a bank’s stress-

test exposure leads loan interest rates to increase by approximately 70 basis points. Consistent

with these pricing patterns, the share of loans originated to safe borrowers increases with

exposure to the stress tests. And this shift toward safe loans happens largely in non-local

markets (i.e., those outside banks’ branch domains). The effects of stress tests on the pricing of

risky loans is therefore strongest where banks have a local information advantage, while its

effects on quantities are strongest where they do not.

         Overall, our evidence suggests that banks more affected by stress tests reduce quantity

and raise interest rates on small business loans. The reductions in supply are concentrated in

volatile markets and among risky borrowers. Furthermore, banks more affected by stress tests

tend to exit the markets where they do not have branches and thus possess limited local

knowledge; in contrast, interest rate increases are concentrated where banks do have branches.

Effectively, banks price the implied increase in capital requirements from stress tests where they

have a local informational advantage, and exit markets where they do not.

         Do the reductions in supply at the individual bank level lead to aggregate declines in

small business credit supply? To evaluate this question, we analyze county-level small business

loan originations. Despite reduced supply by some stress-tested lenders, we find no evidence that

overall credit origination at the market level declines owing to stress tests. Growth in small

business lending is not lower in markets (counties) with more stress-test-affected lenders.

Instead, we show that banks unaffected by stress tests make up the difference, as small banks




                                                 6
increase their loan origination volumes and grow their small business market share significantly

in markets where banks with high stress-test exposure had previously been important lenders.

The result suggests that stress tests lead to reallocation of the small business credit supply away

from the large systemic banks and toward more local sources of credit.

         This paper contributes to a few strands of the literature. First, and foremost, it links the

stress-test exposure to a decline in large banks’ willingness to supply small business loans

following the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession. Acharya, Berger and Roman

(forthcoming) document that stress-tested banks reduce large corporate loan supply and increase

prices particularly for riskier borrowers, while Bassett and Berrospide (2017) do not find any

negative impact of stress tests on bank loan growth in general. Chen et al. (2017) show a sharp

decline in lending at the largest banks and offer evidence that this decline has hurt local

economies more exposed to these large banks. We add to this literature by documenting the

adverse effect of banks’ stress-test exposure and their willingness to supply small business credit.

Yet we go one step further and show that this stress-test-induced reduction in small business

credit supply does not lead to the aggregate decline in small business loan originations. Small

banks fill in the gap and increase their market share in geographies formerly reliant on stress-

tested lenders.

         Second, existing research suggests that small businesses have better access to credit if

their local market contains more small banks and that this effect has gotten larger during the

post-crisis period (e.g., Berger et al., 2017). Yet the banking industry continues to evolve toward

one dominated by large banks and by banks relying heavily on non-traditional funding sources

like securitization. Not surprisingly, the share of bank assets in the largest banks has grown

steadily over time, as has their share of small business loans. Our results suggest that the stress




                                                 7
tests have had the effect of pushing back against this overall trend in the banking system, as more

small business loans are now provided by small, local banks.


II.    The Stress Tests

         The 2008 Financial Crisis led to dramatic changes in regulation and supervision of

financial institutions, and many of these changes have arisen from compliance with measures

laid down by the Dodd-Frank Act (DFA). The DFA requires the Federal Reserve to conduct

annual stress tests of a select group of large bank holding companies (BHCs) and non-bank

financial institutions designated for stress testing by the Financial Stability Oversight Council

(FSOC). Prior to passage of the DFA in 2010, the 2009 Supervisory Capital Assessment Program

(SCAP) represented the first stress-testing effort. SCAP aimed to ensure that banks had sufficient

capital coming out of the crisis to absorb losses under poor economic conditions but continue to

be able to supply credit to the economy, thereby short-circuiting a negative feedback loop

between real shocks and financial shocks.

         Under SCAP, the Federal Reserve assessed the level of regulatory capital for the 19

largest BHCs under three potential paths of the economy. Nine BHCs “passed” the SCAP stress

tests and continued operating without needing to raise new equity capital. Of the remaining ones,

all but one succeeded in raising sufficient capital in private markets to meet their required capital

ratio. The remaining institution came into government conservatorship and was later privatized.

SCAP induced rapid recapitalization, which was widely seen as a successful turnaround of bank

financial conditions coming out of the crisis.

         Following the success of SCAP, the Federal Reserve continued to implement

supervisory stress tests, renamed as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR).

CCAR called for annual tests to see whether large BHCs have sufficient capital to absorb a



                                                 8
substantial economic and financial downturn, yet continue to be able to provide credit. CCAR

began in 2011 with the same large BHCs as SCAP, those with total assets in excess of $100

billion. In 2012, however, the Federal Reserve expanded the set to the 32 BHCs with assets

above $50 billion. Starting in 2013, the Fed began implementing dual stress tests: one based on

the supervisory CCAR process, and the other based on compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act

(DFAST). The key difference is that under CCAR, each BHC’s proposed capital distribution

plan is incorporated into the stress test; under DFAST, the assumed capital distribution is held at

its current level. The tests are disclosed in March of each year. 8 In 2016, the report date for the

stress-test disclosure was moved to June.

             The stress tests forecast three possible scenarios for each BHC’s regulatory capital

ratios nine quarters into the future (“baseline,” “adverse,” and “severely adverse”). The scenarios

capture possible paths for aggregate economic variables. The 2017 Federal Reserve Supervisory

Scenarios for Annual Stress Tests Requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing Rules

and the Capital Plan Rules requires modelling “(s)ix measures of economic activity and prices:

percent changes (at an annual rate) in real and nominal gross domestic product (GDP); the

unemployment rate of the civilian non-institutional population aged 16 years and over; percent

changes (at an annual rate) in real and nominal disposable personal income; and the percent

change (at an annual rate) in the Consumer Price Index.” 9 Thus, the scenarios focus on aggregate

rather than idiosyncratic risks of banks. This approach helps minimize the macro-prudential risk

of banks becoming capital constrained collectively during broad economic downturns. The

8
  In 2014, the stress-test process was expanded to banks with total assets between $10 and $50 billion through the
Dodd-Frank Act stress tests. However, stress tests of banks with assets between $10 billion and $50 billion are not
disclosed. In other words, only the results from the CCAR BHCs are disclosed each year; hence, banks owned by
CCAR-BHCs constitute our sample.

Federal Reserve also develops a model to map the effects of the hypothetical economic and

financial variables on each BHC’s capital ratio over the forecast.

           Alongside the scenarios and models provided by the Federal Reserve, the stress testing

also requires data on individual BHC positions and exposures to various risk factors. Thus, the

results of the stress tests reflect common scenarios and a common model (i.e., the one developed

by the Federal Reserve), but they reflect differences in asset composition. The results are closely

watched, not only by regulators but also by bank managers, analysts, and investors, as they might

lead to forced reductions in a BHC’s planned capital distributions, as well as other operating

changes if the simulated decline in capital is sufficiently large.


Measuring Exposure to Stress Tests

           We construct three measures of stress-test exposure for each tested BHC, based on

stress test results disclosed publicly by the Federal Reserve for the years 2012-2016. These data

offer the implied (modeled) capital ratios BHCs would experience under the most adverse stress

scenario. Specifically, the Federal Reserve reports the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-

based capital ratio, and Tier 1 leverage ratio expected over the forward-looking nine-quarter

planning horizon for each of the annual tests. 10 An implied minimum capital ratio significantly

below the current capital ratio would indicate that the bank’s losses would impair its equity

position and hence threaten its ability to extend credit. The bigger the expected decline in a

bank’s equity capital, the more likely the regulatory authority is to interfere and pressure the

bank, either with regard to its capital planning or the risks in its portfolio of assets.


10
  The banks also report similar results from their own models. These results, however, are less stringent than those
based on the Federal Reserve’s proprietary models about 75% of the time. Hence, we focus on the results from the
Federal Reserve model, as it generally reflects the most binding constraint faced by banks.




                                                        10
          In line with this intuition, our measure of stress-test exposure equals the difference

between the starting value of the capital ratio at the outset of the test and the lowest capital ratio

implied by the severely adverse stress scenario. Our measure reflects only changes in the value

of BHC portfolios, not the effect of the capital distribution plan, as this variation would not be

directly affected by lending decisions. 11 BHCs whose specific portfolios have the greatest

downside risk under the test will have the largest value of stress-test exposure. These are the

banks likely to face pressure from the regulators, either to reduce risk or improve their current

capital ratios (e.g., by reducing planned dividend distributions and/or share repurchases). The

measure is unlikely to be endogenous to banks’ small business lending as it is driven by a bank’s

entire loan portfolio of which small business constitutes only a very small fraction. 12

          Panel A of Table 1 reports the summary statistics. The three measures of stress-test

exposure average between 2.6 and 3.4 percentage points (or 2.3 to 3.1, at the median). These

capture how much the typical bank’s capital ratio would be expected to decline over the stress

scenario. These modelled declines are economically significant, as they are similar in magnitude

to a one-standard-deviation change in the corresponding capital ratio. Stress-test exposure varies

substantially across banks as well, with a standard deviation of 1.3 to 1.7 percentage points,

depending on the capital ratio. The stress-test exposure is also positively correlated with the

level of the corresponding capital ratio at the start of the tests, with a correlation between 0.38




11
  Our data for 2012 are taken from the Fed’s CCAR disclosure, but we use the series of results that do not include
the bank’s capital plan. Data from 2013-2016 are taken from the disclosure under the Dodd-Frank Act. In other
words, our sample includes only the CCAR banks, but the measure of exposure is the one used for compliance with
Dodd Frank, which does not incorporate the bank’s capital distribution plan.
12
  For example, among banks with assets over $50 billion, small business loans outstanding averages less than 5% of
their total assets (less than 3.5% since 2011). Hence, there is little possibility of reverse causality.




                                                       11
and 0.48. This is consistent with a notion that banks with riskier loan portfolios and hence larger

stress-test exposure tend to maintain higher levels of capital ex-ante. 13

           Figure 3 plots the distribution of our three exposure measures year by year in a box

plot. The figure shows that most of the variation reflects the cross-section; in contrast, the

distribution of stress-test exposures exhibits very little time-series variation. There is slightly

less cross-sectional variation in the last test in our sample (2016), but overall, there does not

appear to be a strong trend in either the level or the variation in outcomes across banking

companies.


Stress Test Related Literature

           A number of studies have tried to assess the utility of stress tests in addressing some of

the deficiencies in capital requirements and bank supervision that emerged in the wake of the

financial crisis. One stream of the literature focuses on stress tests’s efficacy. Hirtle et al. (2009)

offer an early discussion of ways to use stress testing to improve bank supervision. Schuermann

(2016) broadens the discussion of policy by contrasting its use during good times versus bad

times. Frame et al. (2015) offer some empirical evidence calling into doubt the utility of stress

tests by analyzing pre-crisis stress tests done by the regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

           Other work evaluates the implications of public disclosure of stress-test results.

Goldstein and Leitner (2017) analyze theoretically the tradeoffs faced by regulators regarding

disclosure of stress-test results. Several papers have studied market reactions to U.S. or European

stress test announcements, with mixed evidence on whether banking firms experience significant

abnormal average stock returns when supervisory stress-test results are disclosed (Peristiani et

13
   Note that our results do not change substantially whether or not we include the initial capital ratio as a control
variable.



                                                         12
al., 2010; Petrella and Resti, 2013; Candelon and Sy, 2015; Bird et al., 2015; and Fernandes,

Igan and Pinheiro, 2015). Flannery et al. (2016) argue that stress-test disclosures reveal

information to market participants, both negative and positive, thereby explaining the mixed

results from directional event studies. They show that price volatility and volume increase

reliably around disclosure dates.

         Finally, a line of studies evaluate how bank exposure to stress tests affects their risk-

taking and other operating decisions. These studies are closest to ours. Acharya, Berger and

Roman (forthcoming), for example, document that stress-tested banks reduce large corporate

loan supply and increase prices, particularly for riskier borrowers. Bassett and Berrospide (2017)

evaluate banks’ balance sheet loan volumes and do not find a negative effect of stress tests on

bank loan growth in general. Calem, Correa, and Lee (2016) offer similar evidence in the market

for jumbo mortgages. Cornett et al. (2016) study adjustments to bank dividends and overall

measures of investment from Call Report data, finding that stress-tested banks are more likely to

cut dividends and reduce lending. We add to this literature by documenting the effect of stress-

test exposures on small business loans and documenting the heterogeneity in these effects across

intensive and extensive margins.


III.   Empirical Tests and Results

         In this section, we describe our empirical strategy, followed by the presentation and

interpretation of results. To alleviate the identification problem stemming from stress-tested

banks being different from non-stress-tested banks in many ways that extend well beyond the

effect of CCAR regulation, we abstain from comparing lending of stress-tested and inherently

different non-stress-tested banks. Rather, we focus solely on the group of banks owned by the 32




                                               13
stress-tested BHCs. We start by evaluating the effects of stress-test exposure on small business

loan quantities, followed by an analysis of the effect on loan pricing.


III.A. Stress Tests and Small Business Loan Quantities

              To capture the response of small business loan quantities to stress-test exposure, we

exploit CRA data on loan originations from 2012-2015, collected by the Federal Financial

Institutions Examination Council at the subsidiary-bank level. 14,                  15
                                                                                         The CRA focuses on loans

with commitment amounts below $1 million originated by financial institutions with more than

$1 billion in assets. 16 Under the CRA, banks report small business loans at a granular,

community (county) level. Consequently, CRA data provide us with a complete record of new

lending quantities by subsidiary banks of the stress-tested BHCs at the county-year level.

              We use CRA data to build the annual growth rate of new loan originations under $1

million, which we interpret as loans to small businesses. The purpose of the CRA is to

“encourage ensured depository institutions to help meet the credit needs of the communities

where they are chartered.” Individual subsidiary banks within stress-tested BHCs will have

different incentives and obligations to “meet the credit needs” of the communities they serve.

Consequently, we do not aggregate CRA data to the BHC level, but rather build the growth

measures for subsidiary banks and map in stress-test exposure for each bank’s BHC owner. In

the regressions, we also control for these subsidiary banks’ financial characteristics provided by

the Call Report data. The resulting sample covers banks owned by 28 out of 32 stress-tested

     The asset-size threshold for CRA data reporting was $250 million before 2005 and raised to $1 billion in 2005.

entities, since some of the stress-tested institutions did not conduct any lending that fell under

CRA guidelines.

           To mitigate the effect of outliers (e.g., due to a small denominator) we normalize the

year-to-year change in lending volume by the mid-point of originations between the two years,

as follows:

                                              Loan Originations𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 − Loan Originations𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡−1
                   Loan Growth𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 = (Loan Originations                                                       (1)
                                                                 𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 + Loan Originations𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡−1 )/2


where 𝑖𝑖 represents the bank, 𝑐𝑐 represents the county, and 𝑡𝑡 represents the year. With this

definition, the variable is bounded above (+2) and below (-2). Furthermore, to eliminate noise

stemming from counties with insignificant amounts of loans originated by a given bank, we

restrict our sample to markets where a given bank made at least five loans in period 𝑡𝑡 − 1.

           We then match the CRA small business loan-growth data and stress-test exposure data

by mapping the annual origination data of subsidiary banks to stress-tested BHCs and then to the

stress-test results. The stress tests are typically conducted over a three- to six-month period, with

the final report published in March. 17 This timing inhibits our ability to perfectly capture the

consequences of the stress tests in annual CRA data. In our matching procedure, we assume that

the majority of the effect from the stress-test exposure is likely to manifest within the next nine

months of the year in which the stress-test results are disclosed. In line with this assumption, we

match, for example, CRA loan growth from December 2013 to December 2014 to the stress-test

results reported in March 2014.

           Panel B of Table 1 provides summary statistics of the financial characteristics of

subsidiary banks. The sample covers a set of relatively large banks with average total assets of


17
 In 2016, the Federal Reserve started publishing the stress-test results in June. Yet this shift does not apply to our
CRA results, as our CRA data only cover the 2012-2015 period.




                                                           15
$260 billion. The traditional financial characteristics are in line with those in other studies

exploring large banks. Notably, while in the aggregate small business lending grew post-2008

(slowly but it grew) as evident from Figure 1, the banks in our sample on average experience an

annual decline of 8.3% in small business loan originations.

          To evaluate the effect of stress tests on small business loans, we implement the

following regression analysis:

      Loan Growth𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆-𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸ℎ,𝑡𝑡 + Bank Controls𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡   (2)

where we evaluate the annual growth in loan originations by subsidiary bank 𝑖𝑖 of BHC ℎ in

county 𝑐𝑐 in year 𝑡𝑡. The set of (subsidiary) bank controls includes log of total assets, share of C&I

loans in a bank total loan portfolio, share of non-performing loans in total loans, return on assets,

share of deposits in total liabilities, and a bank’s liquidity captured by the ratio of cash and

marketable securities to assets. We also control for the BHC-level initial capital ratio

corresponding to the stress-test capital measure. All bank control variables are as of the

beginning of the year to avoid reverse causality concerns. As discussed earlier, we use the Stress-

test exposure variable in the same year t since the stress tests are conducted early in the year and,

hence, affect bank-lending behavior through the rest of the CRA period. We cluster the standard

errors by BHC-year, as this is the level of variation for our core variable of interest.

          We expect that more severe stress-test exposures are associated with declines in small

business lending (𝛽𝛽1 < 0). We reduce the potential for credit demand to drive our results by

incorporating high granularity county-year fixed effects (𝛾𝛾𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 ), which help capture local economic

conditions ultimately affecting small business credit demand. Effectively, we compare banks

operating in similar markets (and serving similar borrowers), but facing different stress-test

exposures.



                                                             16
         One can argue, however, that the CRA loan growth response to stress-test exposures

might also be subject to an unobserved heterogeneity bias. Banks more inclined to grow their

(relatively riskier) C&I lending would experience larger stress-induced declines in capital and

hence higher stress-test exposure values. This would induce an upward bias in our coefficient of

interest. To mitigate this identification challenge, we exploit heterogeneous predictions based on

risk and access to information. If, in response to a stress-test exposure, a bank attempts to reduce

the riskiness of its loan portfolio, then we should observe more severe declines in small business

lending to riskier borrowers or in riskier markets. Conversely, in markets where banks have

access to local information, they can raise interest rates on risky loans, while in markets without

such pricing power, adjustments in loan volumes ought to be larger.

         Since CRA data do not provide information about individual borrower characteristics

(e.g., borrower risk), we build an alternative risk measure. Specifically, we develop a new proxy

that captures variation in risk at the county level, rather than at the borrower level. Using county

employment data, we construct the “employment beta.” Similar to a stock beta, our proxy

captures the sensitivity of a county’s employment growth to changes in national employment

growth. We first estimate a set of time-invariant, industry-level employment betas from time-

series regressions of aggregate industry-level employment growth on economy-wide

employment growth, using quarterly data from 1992 through 2015. We then compute county-

year-level employment beta as a weighted average of industry-level betas, based on the share of

different industries in each local economy:

                      Employment Beta𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 = ∑ ω𝑐𝑐,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 × Employment Beta𝑗𝑗                     (3)




                                                17
where Employment Betaj is the time-invariant estimate of industry 𝑗𝑗’s Employment Beta and

ω𝑐𝑐,𝑗𝑗,𝑡𝑡 is the share of jobs provided by industry 𝑗𝑗 in county 𝑐𝑐 at time 𝑡𝑡. Intuitively, the county

employment beta is an industry portfolio beta of a given county at a given point in time.

        Appendix Table A1 reports the industry-level betas used as the building blocks in

Equation (3). The patterns appear economically sensible. Most of the sectors have positive

betas, meaning that employment in the industry varies pro-cyclically. The major exceptions are

Education Services and Public Administration, which exhibit much faster employment growth

during economic downturns.           Among the pro-cyclical industries, such as Construction and

Entertainment, betas are well above one, as employment in these sectors grows sharply in booms

(and vice versa in busts). To mitigate the effect of outliers, we winsorize the industry-level betas

before constructing the county weighted averages. Overall these county-level employment betas

mesh well with the intent of the stress test scenarios, which typically contemplate bad outcomes

for economic and financial aggregates such as U.S. GDP growth and changes in the overall

unemployment rate. Hence, counties whose economies move in lock-step with the overall

economy will have greater effects on the results of stress tests. 18

          Armed with a granular measure of local economic risk, we evaluate the response of

small business lending volumes to stress-test exposures using the following model:




18
  We have also tested other measure of county-level risk, such as one based on the decline in housing prices
experienced during the post-boom crash and one based on industry-level beta built from stock prices. Neither of
these risk metrics is significantly related to credit growth.

         Table 2 reports the results with Panels A, B and C exploiting the stress-test exposures

based on the Tier 1 capital ratio, the Total risk-based capital ratio, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio,

respectively. Column (1) reports the results from simple models without the interaction term.

The coefficients 𝛽𝛽1 are not statistically significant, potentially reflecting the upward bias

discussed earlier. Column (2) reports the results from equation (4). The coefficient 𝛽𝛽2 is negative

and statistically significant in all three cases. The results suggest that stress-test exposure leads

affected banks to reduce small business lending more in risky local markets than in safer ones.

         In column (3) of Table 2, we absorb all sources of bank-level heterogeneity by

introducing bank-year fixed effects. In this setting, the direct effect of the stress-test exposure is

fully absorbed, so we focus on the differential across market types. This approach is appealing in

this setting because, although we lose identification on 𝛽𝛽1, we can still identify the interaction

term (𝛽𝛽2) while absorbing possible confounding effects at the bank-year level. The results are

similar to those reported in column (2) and suggest that banks more exposed to stress tests are

more likely to exit risky markets. Despite a dramatic increase in R2 stemming from adding bank-

year fixed effects, the interaction term coefficients retain their economic magnitude and

statistical significance. The estimate reported in column (3) of Panel A suggests that in response

to a one-standard-deviation increase in stress-test exposure in Tier 1 capital (1.7%), markets in

top quartile of the employment beta distribution (beta = 1.36) would see 2.0% greater decline in

small business loan originations than those in the bottom beta quartile (beta = 0.96). 19

              In Table 3, we augment this analysis to evaluate whether we would observe a

differential effect of stress-testing on lending quantities in markets where banks have an

informational advantage through a branch presence. Columns (1) and (2) report the results where

the data are confined to counties where subsidiary banks have at least one branch. Columns (3)

and (4) evaluate the small business lending sensitivity to stress-test exposures in counties where

subsidiary banks do not have branches. We find that the adverse effect of stress-test exposure on

loan quantities is pronounced in non-local markets, yet virtually non-existent (statistically and

economically) in local markets where banks have branches.

              Overall, the evidence provided in Tables 2 and 3 offers a direct link between declines in

small business loan originations and stress-test exposures. Moreover, the effect on quantities of

loans supplied is more pronounced in riskier markets and in markets where banks lack local

knowledge.


III.B. The Effect of Stress Tests on Small Business Loan Interest Rates

              While the previous section evaluates the effect of stress-test exposure on small business

loan quantities, this section offers complementary analysis of loan prices (interest rates) based on

the confidential Q1-2013 to Q4-2016 Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL) data.


The STBL Data

              To obtain timely information on the business lending environment, the Federal Reserve

has instituted the STBL. The STBL collects data on loans originated by a random sample of
19
     The calculation equals the interaction term’s coefficient multiplied by (1.7*(1.36-0.96)).




                                                            20
banks during a full business week every three months (February, May, August and November).

The selection of banks is conducted in a way that creates a representative sample of C&I loans.

Consequently, the large banks are more likely to be surveyed. The STBL data cover 26 out of 32

stress-tested BHCs.

          The STBL provides detailed loan characteristics including loan size, the nominal

interest rate, maturity, whether the loan comes with a pre-payment penalty, collateral status,

whether these loans reflect a drawdown on a pre-arranged line of credit, the state of the

borrower, etc. Given our focus on small business loans, we consider only originations with

commitment amounts under $1 million. Furthermore, to focus on new credit creation, we exclude

from consideration the drawdowns on existing lines of credit.

          In addition to these characteristics, the STBL reports the lender’s internal risk rating for

each loan. The rating that we use ranges from 1 to 4, with 1 representing loans with the lowest

risk level and 4 representing those with the highest risk. 20 While the risk ratings are reported by

the banks independently, the Federal Reserve provides instructions on how to make the ratings

consistent across institutions. It is still possible, however, that risk ratings are not fully

compatible across banks.

          Similar to the CRA, the STBL collects data at the subsidiary-bank level because the

regulatory authority evaluates lending at the individual bank level rather than at the parent

financial institution level. Hence, similar to the CRA analysis, we track subsidiary bank financial

characteristics potentially affecting lending decisions based on quarterly Call Reports.

Specifically, we use the nearest Call Report date prior to each STBL survey date. For example,


20
   The STBL also includes loans with a “0” rating, which indicates unrated loans, and loans rated “5” which
indicates defaulted loans. We drop these two categories.




                                                    21
we merge the June 2013 Call Report data into the STBL survey taken in August 2013. We then

merge the quarterly subsidiary-bank-level STBL data with the annual BHC-level Stress-test

exposures on a rolling basis. Since we want the stress-test exposure to be pre-determined with

respect to our outcomes from the STBL, we map the most recent data from a given stress test

disclosure into the next four STBL quarterly surveys. So, for example, we map the March 2013

value of Stress-test exposure into STBL data from May 2013, August 2013, November 2013, and

February 2014. We map the March 2014 value into the subsequent four STBL survey dates

similarly, and so on. 21

              Panel C of Table 1 provides summary statistics for loan characteristics reported in the

STBL data. An average (log of) loan size in our sample is about 11.14 (~$133,000), with

maturity of about 15 months and an interest rate of 3.3%. 22 About one-third of these loans are

originated in the riskiest loan category (risk rating = 4). Consistent with relatively low interest

rates, 81% of these loans are secured. Most of the loans are also made by local banks, with 66%

originated within a bank’s branch domain (i.e., the bank has a branch in the state of the

borrower). 23


Evidence on Loan Pricing

              We use the STBL data to evaluate the effect of stress-test exposures on small business

loan pricing. Our loan pricing regressions take the following form:




21
   The change in stress test timing in 2016 from March to June leads us to map the 2015 stress-test exposure data
into the next five (rather than four) STBL surveys.
22
     We winsorize the interest rate at the 1st and 99th percentiles.
23
   About 13% of the loans are syndicated, which means that the originating bank shares the loan risk with other
lenders. Hence, we have estimated all of our tests without these loans and find that they do not change materially.




                                                              22

where the dependent variable equals the nominal interest rate on loan 𝑙𝑙 originated by subsidiary

bank 𝑖𝑖 within BHC ℎ in state 𝑠𝑠 at time 𝑡𝑡. 24 The state-quarter fixed effects help remove

unobserved heterogeneity such as variation in loan demand due to (state-specific) business

conditions.

            On the loan side, we control for the (log of) loan size and the bank’s assessment of

borrower risk, which varies from 1 to 4 (with 4 being the highest risk category). On the

subsidiary-bank side, we control for the time-varying subsidiary-bank size (log of assets), as well

as an indicator variable set to one if the bank has a branch in the borrower’s state (Local Lender).

Our coefficient of interest depends on a BHC-level exposure, consequently we cluster the

standard errors at the BHC-quarter level.

            We further augment the model with other (possibly endogenous) loan-level variables.

These include the log of maturity, an indicator for loans secured by collateral, an indicator for

loans that are syndicated, an indicator for floating rate loans, an indicator for loans guaranteed by

the Small Business Administration (SBA), and an indicator for loans with pre-payment penalties.

We do not include bank fixed effects in the model because doing so would remove the vast

majority of the relevant variation in the stress-test exposure. This is true both because our time

series is short and also because stress-test exposure is quite persistent (recall Figure 3). Hence,

we are explicitly getting identification from cross-sectional variation. In our view, this approach

is the only reasonable one to take, but we recognize that leaving out bank fixed effects requires


24
   Note that the STBL does not contain a borrower identifier, which renders capturing borrower heterogeneity with
fixed effects impossible.




                                                              23
us to establish robustness to potentially omitted bank-level heterogeneity. Hence, we

demonstrate that our coefficients of interest are not sensitive to including a large set of bank

characteristics (beyond size).

         Table 4 reports our first set of pricing results and utilizes all three measures of the

stress-test exposure defined above. In the baseline specifications (columns 1, 4, and 7) we only

control for subsidiary-bank size, borrower risk rating, the local lender indicator, log of loan size,

and year-quarter fixed effects. We intentionally do not control for other (possibly endogenous)

non-price loan terms. In the second set of specifications we saturate the model with state-quarter

fixed effects (columns 2, 5, and 8); in the last set of specifications (columns 3, 6, and 9), we

control for the non-price loan terms. By adding loan terms to the regressions, we lose about 1/3

of the sample.

         The coefficient on stress-test exposure is positive and significant across all

specifications, with magnitudes ranging from 0.15 to 0.57. Magnitudes are not sensitive to

adding more granular fixed effects, but they consistently increase sharply in the models that

control for other loan terms. Column (1) implies that a one-standard-deviation increase in stress-

test exposure (=1.7) would lead to an increase in the loan rate of 37 basis points (=1.7 x 0.218 x

100). This effect increases to about 53 basis points in the models with the full set of loan

controls. The coefficients are larger in columns (7) through (9), which use the Tier 1 leverage

ratio, but the economic impact is similar because this measure has lower cross-bank variation

(standard deviation = 1.3).

         The coefficients on the non-price terms are consistent with those in existing empirical

studies of loan interest rates. Larger loans have lower interest rates and loans rated riskier by the

lender carry higher interest rates, longer maturity loans have higher interest rates and loans




                                                 24
secured by collateral have lower interest rates. 25 The safest loans (risk category 1) tend to have

interest rates about 100 basis points (=0.34 x (4-1)) lower than the interest rate on the riskiest

loans (risk category 4). The coefficients on the Local Lender indicator variable suggest that

interest rates on loans within subsidiary-bank branch domains are 25 to 50 basis points lower

than interest rates on loans outside of the branch domain.                         The economic and statistical

significance on the Local Lender indicator disappears, however, once we control for non-price

loan terms. 26

             As noted, adding the non-price terms to our regressions increases the coefficient on

stress-test exposure sharply, by about 50% to 100% depending on the measure. This suggests

that banks respond to the stress tests not only by raising loan interest rates, but also by

simultaneously tightening other terms such as shorter maturity, more and/or better collateral, and

more restrictive covenants. Data limitations prevent us from analyzing the full set of non-price

terms, but Table 5 provides strong evidence of this conjecture using one that is easily measured,

loan maturity. We find that banks with higher stress-test exposure shorten (log) maturity. 27 The

economic effect is substantial, as a one-standard-deviation increase in stress-test exposure (=1.7)

reduces loan maturity by about 17% (column 1).

             Table 6 offers additional robustness tests and solidifies evidence on the effect of stress-

test exposure on loan interest rates. Here we augment the set of control variables utilized in

Table 4 to include subsidiary-bank, time-varying financial characteristics. We include a set of

backward-looking variables from Call Report data, and we also include a market-based measure
25
     On small business loans, see Berger and Udell (1990). For large loans, see Strahan (1999).
26
   These comparisons are difficult to interpret because a much larger fraction of non-local loans have missing values
along the non-price dimensions.
27
  Our data contain a flag for whether or not the loan is secured by collateral but not details on the quality or quantity
of the collateral. Since almost all of the loans have some kind of collateral, we are not able to explore this
dimension in our regressions.

of risk, the stock-return volatility, as a more forward-looking measure. Each of these measures

comes from the same quarter as the outcome. For brevity, Table 6 only reports models based on

Tier 1 capital. The unreported analysis based on the remaining two stress-test exposure measures

produces economically and statistically similar results. Controlling for the subsidiary-bank

financial characteristics has little effect on the statistical significance and economic magnitudes

of our coefficient of interest, which varies from 0.12 to 0.22 (relative to 0.19 in the comparable

model from Table 4, column 2). Overall, the results suggest that in response to Stress-test

exposures, banks increase interest rates on small business loans.


Loan Pricing in Local Markets

               Table 7 advances the analysis by evaluating whether local presence and the associated

local informational advantage affect banks’ pricing response to stress-test exposure. Here we add

the interaction between local lender and stress-test exposure to our core models:

𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 =                                                                                                    (6)

                           +𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 + 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 × 𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 + 𝜀𝜀𝑙𝑙,𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡

where 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is an indicator variable equal to one when bank 𝑖𝑖 of BHC ℎ has a branch in

state 𝑠𝑠.

            The results suggest that stress tests affect loan pricing more in markets where banks have

a local branch presence. In markets with branches, an increase in stress-test exposure of one

standard deviation (=1.7) would lead to an increase in the loan interest rate of about 55 basis

points (=1.7 x (0.089+0.233) x 100), using the coefficients from column (1). In contrast, interest

rates increase by only about 15 basis points where banks do not have branches (=1.7 x 0.089).

Similar patterns emerge using Stress-test exposure from the other capital metrics. The results are


                                                                          26
consistent with the notion that banks with local knowledge are more able to increase prices when

they can extract rents from borrowers due to their informational advantage. 28


Loan Interest Rates and Borrower Risk

           To capture heterogeneity in pricing responses based on the riskiness of a borrower,

Table 8 reports estimates of Equation (6) for three sub-samples broken out by borrower risk.

Panel A reports the regression results for safe loans, those rated 1 or 2. 29 Panel B reports results

for medium-risk loans, those rated 3. Panel C reports results for the highest risk loans, those

rated 4.

           The pricing of low-risk loans (Panel A) does not increase with a bank’s stress-test

exposure. If anything, the results suggest a small negative effect of exposure to the stress tests on

rates for safe loans that are local (summing the direct and interactive terms). This result provides

suggestive evidence that banks that are expected to lose a lot of equity capital under stressed

scenarios skew their credit provision toward safer borrowers by lowering rates.

           Interest rates of medium-risk (rated “3”) and high-risk loans (rated “4”), however, do

increase robustly with increases in a bank’s stress-test exposure. The effect on rates in these two

categories is also larger in areas where banks have a local branch presence. Moreover, the

marginal effect of stress-test exposure on loan rates is greatest for the high-risk loans in local

markets. For example, using the Tier 1 capital measure, an increase in stress-test exposure of one

standard deviation would lead to an increase in the loan rate of about 70 basis points (=1.7 x


28
  This differential response of prices can also be shown by splitting the sample based on whether or not a bank has a
branch in the borrower’s state. This latter approach is a bit less constrained, in that it allows all of the coefficients in
the regression to vary across the two samples.
29
  We combine these two categories because the frequency of loans in the safest category is low (around 3% of the
sample).




                                                            27
(0.166+0.242) x 100) for high-risk local loans (Panel C, column 1); a similar increase in Stress-

test exposure would lead to an increase in the loan rate of about 53 basis points (=1.7 x

(0.068+0.242) x 100) for medium-risk local loans (Panel B, column 1). Banks exposed to stress-

test exposures increase the pricing of relatively high-risk loans in markets where they have an

informational advantage.


The STBL-based Evidence on Loan Portfolio Composition

              So far, we have documented that banks more affected by stress tests increase rates on

risky, local loans. In contrast, they seem to decrease rates on low-risk loans. These findings

therefore suggest that loan supply shifts toward safer borrowers because of the stress tests.

Because banks are less able to raise rates on high-risk loans where they have little access to local

information than where they do, we would expect a greater shift toward safety in these non-local

markets. To test this notion, we model the relative quantities of loans in different risk categories

as a function of the stress-test exposures. We construct a new outcome variable - Risky Share -

equal to the share of loans in the STBL originated in the riskiest category (risk rating = 4) at the

bank-state level. If the observed rate increases really come from a supply shift, then we ought to

observe Risky Share decrease with stress-test exposure. If banks are unable to price risks in

markets where they do not have information (i.e., in non-local markets), this shift ought to be

larger.

              To empirically investigate this, we estimate the following regression:

𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 = 𝛽𝛽1 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆- 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸ℎ,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆-𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸ℎ,𝑡𝑡−1 × 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡

              +Avg Loan Controls𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 + Bank Controls𝑖𝑖,𝑡𝑡−1 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 × 𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄𝑄 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡                                     (7)




                                                                          28
where 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑖𝑖,𝑠𝑠,𝑡𝑡 is the volume share of loans in the highest loan risk category originated

by bank 𝑖𝑖 in state 𝑠𝑠 in quarter 𝑡𝑡. Since these regressions are implemented at the bank-state level,

we control for averages of the non-price terms across loans made in each bank-state group for

each survey date. As before, standard errors are clustered at the BHC-year level.

         Table 9 reports the results following the regression in equation (7). As before, we report

each specification with and without non-price loan terms. The results strongly support the supply

interpretation of the pricing results. For states where banks do not have branches, the coefficient

on stress-test exposure is negative and significant, both statistically and economically. A one-

standard-deviation increase in stress-test exposure is associated with a 6 to 10 percentage point

decline in risky share. This represents an economically large decline relative to the average risky

share of about 34% of the portfolio (recall Table 1). The effect, however, is smaller – and close

to zero― in markets where banks have branches. For example, the F-test on the sum of the two

coefficients (stress-test exposure and its interaction with the local lender indicator) is not

statistically significant in any of the models (although it does sign negatively). 30 Hence, the

ability to raise prices on risky loans allows banks to continue to provide credit, even when facing

large losses under the stress test.

           These results are unlikely to reflect reverse causality – a connection running from bank

loan supply to its outcome in the stress tests – for a number of reasons. First, the stress-test

results are affected by the whole bank portfolio, and small business lending is a small component

of the overall portfolios of large banks. Second, we use lagged values of the stress tests to allay

concern about timing; for example, we merge stress-test results disclosed in March 2013 to the


30
  These conclusions are similar based on models in which we separate the sample by whether or not the bank has
branches in the state of the borrower. This latter approach allows all of the coefficients to vary with local lender.




                                                         29
four subsequent quarters of STBL data (starting in May 2013). Third, any reverse causality

would predict exactly the opposite of what we find. That is, reverse causality would predict that

banks supplying more risky loans would be more affected by the stress test, which is the opposite

of what we find. Our results are also unlikely to be related to credit demand. Our empirical

strategy helps remove potential market-specific shocks at annual/quarterly frequency that might

reflect demand conditions, yet whether or not we include these effects matters little to the size of

our main coefficient. 31


IV.         Aggregate Effects on Credit Supply

              Our results indicate that in markets where banks have relatively strong bargaining

power with respect to their borrowers, due to things like location and access to private

information, they tend to raise rates in response to the stress-test exposure. In markets where

banks’ small business loans are more like a commodity – one, for example, that could be made

by any lender irrespective of having a local physical presence – we see a very strong effect on

quantities but not on loan rates. Bottom line: banks affected by stress-test exposure reduce credit

origination in markets where their comparative advantage is small, and raise rates where it is

large. 32

              These results strongly suggest that individual banks’ credit supply was affected by the

stress tests, but leave the question: do stress tests constrain overall credit production? As we

have documented, even stress-test-affected banks price in their higher cost of capital in markets

where they have branches, thereby continuing to lend. Furthermore, other lenders, such as
31
     Including these effects, rather than just time effects, increases R2 by about 60%.
32
  One can argue that the positive correlation between stress-test exposure and loan rates for risky loans might be
due to the gaming of risk ratings. For example, if affected banks strategically reassign loans to lower-risk bins (to
game the test), this would leave only the riskiest loans in the highest-risk category. This argument, however, does
not explain the differences that we observe based on bank ownership of local branches.




                                                             30
small(er) banks not affected by stress tests, may have stepped in and continued to lend to

displaced risky borrowers formerly served by stress-tested banks.


             To test whether such substitution has occurred, we re-visit the CRA quantity data, but

we now evaluate aggregate annual origination volumes in different markets (counties) and

implement the following regression analysis:


𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺ℎ𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 =                                                                                                                    (8)

          = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠-𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁-𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠-𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 +

where 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺ℎ𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 are growth rates in small business loan originations at the county 𝑐𝑐 and

year 𝑡𝑡 level (rather than the bank-county-year level). Given that local and non-local banks

respond differently to stress-test exposure, we construct two county-level measures of exposure.

The first, Local banks' stress-test exposurec,t, equals the average stress-test exposure for banks

with branches in county c in year t, weighted by their local loan share in 2010 (before the first

year of our sample). The second, Non-local banks' stress-test exposurec,t, equals the average

stress-test exposure for banks without branches in county c in year t, also weighted by their local

loan share in 2010. We capture overall economic conditions at the county level with county and

year fixed effects, as well as local time-varying drivers of loan demand (housing price growth,

employment growth, and income growth).

             Panel A of Table 10 reports the results from the county-level regressions of the growth

in loan originations. We find no difference in aggregate credit origination across markets,

regardless of local market reliance on small business lending from local and/or non-local stress-

tested banks. Neither Local banks' stress-test exposure nor Non-local banks' stress-test exposure

enters with a significant coefficient.


                                                                         31
             One possible explanation for this result is that non-tested (small) banks fill in the gap

and lend to businesses stress-tested banks no longer serve. To verify this conjecture, we examine

the relationship between stress-test exposures and the share of loans originated by local banks

unaffected by stress tests: banks with assets below $10 billion.33 We evaluate whether small,

local banks increase their credit origination via the following regression analysis:

𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑆𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 =                                                                                                            (9)

          = 𝛽𝛽1 𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠-𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 + 𝛽𝛽2 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁-𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠- 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 +

             Panel B of Table 10 documents that Small Bank Share increases significantly in

counties where non-local lenders faced high exposure to the stress tests. 34 In a county with 50%

of small business credit provided by non-local stress-tested banks, a one-percentage-point

increase in the stress-test exposure of non-local lenders leads to about one-percentage-point

increase in the market share of small local banks. 35 Taken together, the results of Table 10, along

with the earlier results, suggest that small banks unaffected by stress testing substitute in for

large non-local banks.

             Figure 4 illustrates the regression result by comparing market share changes for the

stress-tested banks without local branches (labeled “CCAR Banks, Non-Local”) to market share

changes for small banks with local branches (labeled “Small Banks, Local”). The market share

changes are reported separately for markets with above-median v. below-median Non-local

33
  Banks with assets between $10 and $50 billion are intermediate because these banks began to be subject to stress
testing under the Dodd-Frank Act starting in 2014.
34
  Although our bank-county-level analysis suggests that stress-test-exposed banks exit high-systemic-risk markets
more than lower risk ones, we do not find a significant interaction between the market-risk (employment) beta and
the response of small bank market share to stress-test exposure.
35
  The calculation is 50% * 1 * 0.0186=0.93%, where 0.0186 is the coefficient on Non-local banks' Stress-test
exposure in column 1 of Panel B of Table 9.




                                                                         32
banks' stress-test exposure. The figure shows a striking difference in reallocation patterns. In

markets with high exposure to the stress tests, the market share of non-local CCAR banks falls

by about 8 percentage points; in contrast, their market share rises slightly in the less affected

markets. We see the opposite patterns among the small local banks, whose share rises in markets

heavily exposed to the stress tests and falls in other markets.


V.     Conclusion and Policy Implications

          Our results suggest that banks more affected by stress tests reduce their willingness to

supply loans to small business, and this reduction has been concentrated among relatively riskier

small-business borrowers. Quantities fall to a bigger extent in markets where stress-tested banks

do not own branches near borrowers, and prices rise predominantly where they do. Aggregate

credit has been reallocated away from the largest banks – especially those without a local

presence – and toward small local lenders.

          Policy implications are hard to assess fully. If large banks were taking too much risk

before the financial crisis and extending too much credit, perhaps due to ineffective capital

requirements, then the advent of stress testing likely improved efficiency in the credit markets.

Moral hazard incentives from deposit insurance and “too big to fail” expectations are well known

to potentially induce banks to supply too much risky credit. Regulations that accurately tie loan

risk to required capital can help alleviate this distortion; hence, the stress tests may be achieving

this objective. Moreover, the movement of credit supply from large non-local lenders toward

smaller banks with more local knowledge may help enhance both financial stability and the

efficiency of credit allocation.

         On the other hand, advocates for large banks have argued that stress tests raise the

implicit capital requirement on small business lending excessively – beyond the level justified by



                                                 33
the risk. This would also be consistent with many of our findings, but with very different

normative implications. Without better information on the details of the models used to assess

lending risk across market segments, we hesitate to take a firm stand on these policy debates.

                   Figure 1: Total Small Business Lending Originations
The figure shows the total volume of small business loans originated by the Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA) reporting banks in the USA, originated between 1997 and 2015.
The data are aggregated to the national level from the CRA institution-level Disclosure
Reports covering the lending activity of all institutions subject to the CRA reported to the
Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC).
                         Figure 2: Total Outstanding C&I Loans
The figure shows the total amount of outstanding commercial and industrial (C&I) loans
split by loan size between 1997 and 2016, indexed to 1997, in 2007 US dollars. The data are
from the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income (Call Reports), reported in June of
each year. Non-commercial banks, foreign-controlled banks (with foreign ownership larger
than 25%) and banks with missing data for assets, loans, equity, and deposits are excluded.
                       Figure 3: Distribution of Stress Test Exposure
This figure shows the cross-sectional distribution of the three stress-test exposure variables
for each year between 2012 and 2016. The stress-test exposure for a BHC equals the
difference between the BHC’s capital ratio at the start of the stress testing and the lowest
capital ratio expected by the Federal Reserve under the severely adverse scenario. Panels
A, B, and C present the box plots of Tier 1 capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, and
Tier 1 leverage ratio stress-test exposure measures, respectively. An “*” marks an outlier.
Figure 4: Changes in Shares of Small Business Loan Origination by Non-Local Banks’ Stress-
Test Exposure
This figure shows changes in market shares of small business loan originations between
2011 and 2015 for non-local CCAR and small local banks in markets (counties) with
above-median and below-median Stress-Test Exposure of Non-Local Banks; these markets
are labeled High Exposure Markets and Low Exposure Markets, respectively. The Stress-Test
Exposure of Non-Local Banks is measured in two steps. First, in each year we calculate the
average county-level Stress-Test Exposure for banks without local branches weighted by their
small business loan share in 2010. Then, for each county we calculate the average of this
measure over 2012-2016 and split all counties in our sample into those with above-average
or below-average Stress-Test Exposure of Non-Local Banks. The bars on the left show the
average changes (across counties) in small business lending market shares for stress-tested
banks without local branches (Non-Local CCAR Banks) and the bars on the right show the
average changes in small business lending market shares for small non-CCAR, banks with
local branches (Small Local Banks).

This table reports summary statistics for the stress-test exposures, bank characterisitcs, Community
Reinvestment Act (CRA) small business loan originations, and small business lending loan terms. Data
sources are public release of the stress-test results by the Federal Reserve, Consolidated Report of
Condition and Income (Call Reports), CRA, and Survey of Terms of Business Lending (STBL),
respectively. STBL data covers the period between 2013Q1 and 2016Q4, Call Reports and CRA data
cover 2012-2015.

                  Table 2: The Effect of Stress Tests on Loan Growth by Market (CRA Data)
This table reports the results from the OLS regressions following equation (2). The dependent variable is the
growth in small business loan originations by bank i in county c at time t , as reported by the CRA data and defined
in equation (1). Stress-Test Exposure equals the difference between the starting value of the capital ratio at the
outset of the stress test and the lowest capital ratio implied by the severely adverse stress scenario. County-year-
level Employment Beta is calculated as the weighted average of industry betas based on the shares of different
industries in a county (equation (3)). Bank-level controls are log of total assets, share of C&I loans in a bank's total
loan portfolio, share of non-performing loans in total loans, return on assets, share of deposits in total liabilities,
and a bank’s liquidity captured by the ratio of cash and marketable securities to assets. In all specifications we
control for county times year fixed effects. In column (3) we replace all bank-level controls with bank times year
fixed effects. The sample covers the period between 2012 and 2015. Standard errors are clustered by BHC-year.

This table reports the results from the OLS regressions following equations (2) and (4), split by whether or not the bank
has a branch in the market. The dependent variable is the growth in small business loan originations by bank i in county
c at time t , as reported by the CRA data and defined in equation (1). Stress-Test Exposure equals the difference between
the starting value of the capital ratio at the outset of the stress test and the lowest capital ratio implied by the severely
adverse stress scenario. County-year-level Employment Beta is calculated as the weighted average of industry betas
based on the shares of different industries in a county (equation (3)). We classify a county as a bank's local market if the
bank has a branch in that county. Bank-level controls are log of total assets, share of C&I loans in a bank's total loan
portfolio, share of non-performing loans in total loans, return on assets, share of deposits in total liabilities, and a bank’s
liquidity captured by the ratio of cash and marketable securities to assets. In all specifications we control for county
times year fixed effects. In columns (2) and (4) we replace all bank-level controls with bank times year fixed effects.

                          Table 6: The Effect of Stress Tests on Loan Interest Rates, Robustness to Other Bank Characteristics
This table reports the results from the OLS regressions following equation (5). The dependent variable is the individual-level interest rate for each small business loan
reported in the STBL. Stress-Test-Exposure equals the difference between the starting value of the capital ratio at the outset of the test and the lowest capital ratio implied
by the severely adverse stress scenario. Other control variables are listed in the left column. Sample covers the time between 2013Q1 and 2016Q4. In all specifications we
control for state times year-quarter fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by bank-year.

             Table 7: The Effect of Stress Tests on Local Branch Loan Interest Rates
This table reports the results from the OLS regressions following equation (6). The dependent variable is the
individual-level interest rate for each small business loan reported in the STBL. Stress-Test Exposure equals the
difference between the starting value of the capital ratio at the outset of the test and the lowest capital ratio implied
by the severely adverse stress scenario. The Stress-Test-Exposure is based on the Tier 1 Capital in columns (1) and
(2), total risk-based capital in columns (3) and (4), and the leverage ratio in columns (5) and (6). Other control
variables are listed in the left column. Sample covers the time between 2013Q1 and 2016Q4. In all specifications
we control for state times year-quarter fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by bank-year.

This table reports the results from the OLS regressions following equation (6). The dependent variable is the individual-level
interest rate for each small business loan reported in the STBL. Stress-Test Exposure equals the difference between the starting
value of the capital ratio at the outset of the test and the lowest capital ratio implied by the severely adverse stress scenario. We split
our sample by the loan risk rating groups, where a rating equal to one represents the lowest loan risk. Risk ratings are assigned by
each bank for its indivual loans and are mapped to a scale from the Federal Reserve for better comparison across banks. The Stress-
Test Exposure is based on the Tier 1 capital in columns (1) and (2), total risk-based capital in columns (3) and (4), and the leverage
ratio in columns (5) and (6). Other control variables are listed in the left column. Sample covers the time between 2013Q1 and
2016Q4. In all specifications we control for state times year-quarter fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by bank-year.

                                      Table 9: Share of High-Risk Loans
This table reports the results from the OLS regressions following equation (7). The dependent variable is risky share,
which is defined as the share of high-risk (rating = 4) loans originated by bank i in state s during year t as reported in
the STBL. Stress-Test Exposure equals the difference between the starting value of the capital ratio at the outset of the
test and the lowest capital ratio implied by the severely adverse stress scenario. The Stress-Test Exposure is based on
the Tier 1 capital in columns (1) and (2), total risk-based capital in columns (3) and (4), and the leverage ratio in
columns (5) and (6). Other control variables are listed in the left column. Sample covers the time between 2013Q1 and
2016Q4. In all specifications we control for state times year-quarter fixed effects.

                   Table 10: The Effect of Stress Tests on Overall Loan Growth (CRA Data)
This table reports county-year level regressions of growth in small business loans (SBL) in Panel A and market
share of banks with under $10 billion in assets, both as functions of the market-level average exposure to the
stress tests, as in Equations (8) and (9). Local banks' stress-test exposure equals the average stress-test
exposure for banks with branches lending to the market, weighted by their loan share before the first stress test
(2010). Non-local banks' stress-tests exposure equals the average stress-test exposure for banks without
branches, also weighted by their loan shares in 2010. (Banks not part of stress tests (non-CCAR) receive zero
weight in both calculations.) In all specifications we control for county and year fixed effects. Standard errors
are clustered by county.
