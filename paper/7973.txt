                                         I. INTRODUCTION

        Poverty in the United States has become increasingly concentrated in high poverty areas. For

example, between 1970 and 1990, the percentage of poor persons in metropolitan areas living in

census tracts with a poverty rate of 40 percent or more increased from 12 percent to 18 percent

[Jargowsky 1997].      Federal housing policies which funded large high-rise public housing

developments in central cities during the 1950s and 1960s [Von Hoffman 1996] and which in the

1980s targeted assistance on the poorest eligible households [Epp 1996] are likely to have contributed

to this trend.

        The concentration of poverty in inner cities, along with recent increases in residential

segregation by family income and the persistence of residential segregation by race in U.S.

metropolitan areas [Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor 1999; Jargowsky 1996], has potentially disturbing

implications because of evidence that residential neighborhoods are associated with both the current

well-being and future opportunities of residents. In particular, children who grow up in poor

neighborhoods fare substantially worse on a wide variety of outcomes than those who grow up with

more affluent neighbors even in studies that include detailed controls for family income and

background characteristics [e.g., Brooks-Gunn et al. 1993].

        Many analysts conclude from such findings that residential location greatly affects access to

opportunity through peer influences on youth behavior and through a variety of neighborhood

characteristics correlated with neighborhood wealth -- such as school quality and safety from crime.

The willingness of families to pay substantial house price and rental premia to move to wealthier

neighborhoods and gain access to better schools strongly suggests that typical citizens believe that
neighborhood and school social composition affect their children’s life prospects.1 Furthermore,

assumptions of causal neighborhood and peer effects are central to theories of social capital [Coleman

1988] and to models of human capital externalities and growth [Benabou 1993; Lucas 1988], and are

often used to justify government provision of housing assistance rather than unrestricted cash grants

for low income families [Quigley 1980].

         Although existing empirical studies and the perceptions and actions of parents are suggestive

of the importance of neighborhoods, the estimation of the causal effects of neighborhoods is fraught

with difficulties.2 Observed differences in youth outcomes by type of neighborhood could reflect

unmeasured differences in family background. The reduction in the magnitude of estimated

neighborhood effects when detailed controls for family background are included suggests that with

even better controls estimates of neighborhood effects might be further reduced [Corcoran et al.

1992].3 But the difficulty of measuring neighborhood attributes and of defining appropriate peer

groups may lead to underestimates of neighborhood and peer influences.




         1
           Black [1999] provides convincing evidence of parents’ willingness to pay for higher public school quality by
comparing house prices for comparable homes in the same neighborhoods on different sides of the borders between adjacent
elementary school attendance districts for suburban areas in Massachusetts.
         2
           See Duncan, Connell, and Klebanov [1997], Jencks and Mayer [1990], and Manski [1993] for detailed
discussions of conceptual and practical issues in the estimation of neighborhood effects.
         3
           Recent research has attempted to better control for family background and to better address the issue of selectivity
of residential location within a metropolitan area (MSA). Aaronson [1998] examines families that relocate and compares
siblings that grow up in different neighborhoods. Aaronson finds substantial negative effects of neighborhood high-school
dropout rates on individual dropout rates in sibling difference models. But differences in sibling outcomes could reflect
changes in family circumstances driving residential moves. Cutler and Glaeser [1997] compare outcomes for black and white
youths across MSAs by the extent of racial residential segregation without conditioning on residential location within an
MSA and find substantially lower relative socioeconomic outcomes for black youth in more segregated MSAs. Currie and
Yelowitz [2000] argue that the correlation between living in a public housing project and poor outcomes may be spurious.
They use an instrumental variables estimation strategy (where some families are quasi-randomly entitled to a larger unit
based on the sex composition of their children) and find that boys in project households are less likely to have been held back
in school.

                                                              2
          These estimation problems would be greatly reduced if we could compare the outcomes of

children from truly comparable families growing up in different types of neighborhoods. The ideal

evaluation design would be the random assignment of families of interest to different neighborhoods.

Housing mobility programs in which some low-income inner-city families are given assistance in

moving to less-segregated, wealthier, and/or suburban locations can approximate such a design if

access to such assistance is randomly assigned. The Gautreaux program, which has operated in the

Chicago metropolitan area since 1976, is suggestive of the potential of learning about neighborhood

influences from housing mobility programs.4 Quasi-experimental comparisons of the household heads

and the children of a sample of suburban and urban movers in the program suggest that moving to

the suburbs greatly increased youth educational attainment and labor market outcomes and modestly

improved mothers’ employment rates relative to moving to other parts of the city [Rosenbaum

1995].5

          The promising findings from the Gautreaux program helped motivate the development by

HUD of an experimental housing mobility program that explicitly uses random assignment. This

Moving to Opportunity (MTO) demonstration has been operating in five cities — Baltimore, Boston,

Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York — since the fall of 1994. Families were eligible for




          4
          The Gautreaux program resulted from a Supreme Court consent decree in a racial discrimination lawsuit against
the Chicago Housing Authority and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) filed on behalf of
Chicago public housing residents. It provided low-income blacks originally residing in Chicago public housing with special
housing certificates and assistance to move to neighborhoods in which the black population has a share of less than 30
percent, both in the suburbs and in other parts of the city of Chicago.
          5
            Although the Gautreaux findings are quite suggestive, they are far from definitive. First, it remains unclear the
extent to which the residential locations (suburban vs. urban) of Gautreaux participants approximated random assignment.
It is possible that substantial unobserved differences in the families moving to the suburbs and to other parts of central city
Chicago could bias the findings. And the very small sample of Gautreaux families who are interviewed by survey researchers
some years later may be unrepresentative in ways that could have influenced research findings.

                                                              3
participation in the demonstration if they had children and resided in public housing or project-based

Section 8 assisted housing in census tracts with a 1990 poverty rate of 40 percent or more.

       Interested eligible families who completed an application and survey were then selected from

a waiting list and randomly assigned to one of three program groups: the Experimental group, the

Section 8 Comparison group, and the Control group [Feins et al. 1994]. Families in the Experimental

group received a restricted housing voucher that could be used to help pay for rental housing from

private landlords, but only in a low poverty area (a census tract with under a 10 percent poverty rate

in 1990). The Experimental group families also received counseling assistance from a local nonprofit

organization to help them search for an apartment and adjust to a new neighborhood. Section 8

Comparison group members received a geographically unrestricted housing voucher and no

counseling assistance. The Control group families did not receive rental assistance vouchers,

although their eligibility for continued project-based assistance was unaffected. The Experimental

and Section 8 Comparison group members were given four to six months to submit a request for

approval of an eligible apartment they wanted to lease using a housing voucher, and the apartment

then had to pass a quality inspection.

       By randomly assigning assistance in moving to wealthier neighborhoods, the MTO

demonstration provides a unique opportunity both to assess the effectiveness of using housing

mobility programs to move families to these neighborhoods and to measure the causal impacts of

neighborhood attributes on family and youth outcomes for poor families. It also provides for a direct

comparison of the two major forms of housing assistance for U.S. low-income families: project-based

assistance and tenant-based assistance.

       In this paper, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the early impacts of the MTO

demonstration on family well-being at the Boston site (measured about 2 years after program entry).

                                                  4
We exploit the random-assignment design to produce these estimates through comparisons of the

outcomes of the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison groups with those of the Control group.

Our analysis combines information from field observations of the program, qualitative interviews with

participants, baseline survey responses, responses to a follow-up survey of 520 MTO-Boston

participants, data on Census tract characteristics linked to geocoded initial and current addresses of

participants, and Massachusetts administrative data on earnings and public assistance receipt.

         We begin in section II by discussing the mechanisms through which changes in residential

neighborhoods may affect human capital accumulation, economic self-sufficiency, and current family

well-being.      In section III, we provide a more detailed description of the operation of MTO in

Boston. We find that fear of crime was the primary reason participants wanted to move out of public

housing at all five MTO sites.6 In section IV we present our econometric framework for analyzing

neighborhood effects, and discuss the interpretation of parameters that can be estimated from the

MTO experiment. In section V we analyze mobility outcomes for the Boston families. We find that

approximately 48 percent of the MTO group moved to private housing using the MTO vouchers as

compared to 62 percent of the Section 8 Comparison group. Although the Experimental and Section

8 groups experienced similarly large positive effects on average neighborhood quality as measured

by many census-tract characteristics, these averages mask important differences in the mobility

patterns between the two treatment groups. Fewer Experimental group families managed to move

out of their high-poverty origin neighborhoods, but those that did were much more likely than families

in the Section 8 group to end up in suburban, low-poverty neighborhoods.


         6
           Our qualitative interviews with Boston participants strongly reinforce this conclusion and indicate substantial
concerns of these public housing residents with protecting themselves and their children from possibly arbitrary outbursts
of violence. Kling, Liebman, and Katz [1996] provides a more detailed presentation of the findings from our qualitative
interviews on participants perceptions of their neighborhoods.

                                                            5
        We present our main substantive findings in three groupings. In section VI, we analyze the

impact of the program on children’s human capital development as proxied by measures of child

behavior and health. We find that the program led to a decline in behavior problems among boys in

both the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison groups, but has no discernable impact on girls’

behavior problems. The Experimental group children also experienced fewer injuries and asthma

attacks.   In section VII, we examine adult economic self-sufficiency using data on welfare

participation and employment, and find insignificant differences between the three MTO groups.

Finally, in section VIII we examine other factors affecting family quality of life, including safety,

adult health, and adult social interactions. We find large improvements in neighborhood safety and

in adult health for both MTO treatment groups. Section IX concludes.



                                   II. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND

        The MTO demonstration facilitates moves by members of the treatment groups out of public

housing to areas with more affluent neighbors and a lower incidence of many social problems. We

are particularly interested in the impacts of such residential moves on child human capital

accumulation and adult economic outcomes. In addition, we examine impacts of moves on safety and

adult mental health both because these variables are likely to have long-run effects on child outcomes

and because they are components of current family well-being.

        Neighborhoods may affect the human capital accumulation of children through peer

influences, adult influences, and community resources [Jencks and Mayer 1990]. Many child

behaviors -- including educational choices, crime, and other delinquent behavior -- are likely to exhibit

positive social interactions in which the net private benefits from pursuing an activity rise with the

share of one’s peers who pursue the activity. Positive social interactions (or contagion effects) can

                                                   6
arise from learning from peers, pure preference externalities (individuals enjoy imitating their peers),

stigma effects (the negative signal from delinquent behaviors declines when more people do them),

and physical externalities (e.g. higher crime rates reduce the chances of getting arrested because of

congestion effects in law enforcement).7 Adults in a neighborhood may also influence young people

who are not their children through human capital externalities [Borjas 1995] and by acting as role

models or enforcers of public order [Wilson 1987]. The higher-quality schools, better labor market

opportunities, and greater community resources (e.g., recreational activities) of more affluent

neighborhoods may increase the perceived returns to educational investments relative to delinquent

behaviors. These theories suggest that moves to more affluent communities through MTO have the

potential to enhance human capital development and reduce child problem behaviors.8

         Adult economic self-sufficiency -- employment and welfare participation -- may also be

affected by residential location. Spatial mismatch models [Kain 1968] suggest that moves from inner-

city neighborhoods to suburban neighborhoods should increase access to employment opportunities

leading to higher adult employment rates and lower welfare usage. Community norms in low-poverty

areas are likely to be more supportive of work and less accepting of welfare than those in public

housing projects. But relocations could -- at least in the short run -- disrupt social support networks

that are important sources of informal child care, job referrals, and other labor market information.

          Relative deprivation models in which children judge their success or failure by comparing themselves to others
around them have the opposite prediction. Poor children competing against more affluent and academically better-prepared
peers may become frustrated, reduce effort in school, and become more likely to engage in deviant behaviors.

The overall effect of moves to low-poverty areas on employment is ambiguous in the short-run but

likely to become more positive over time as movers form new social networks; similarly, the impact

of the program on welfare usage might be expected to rise over time.

         Moves to new locations may result in important direct improvements in quality of life.

Families moving out of high-poverty public housing to more affluent areas should experience

improved neighborhood safety and possibly improved housing conditions. Our field work strongly

suggests such changes are likely to be associated with reductions in parental stress and anxiety.9

Effects on mental health from improvements in safety could be offset, however, by social isolation

in a new location.



                                                III. MTO IN BOSTON

         The MTO demonstration program presents an exciting opportunity to identify credibly the

causal effects of a housing mobility program (and of neighborhoods) on a wide range of outcomes.

Nonetheless, it is important to be explicit about the nature of the specific interventions that occurred

at the Boston MTO site.



A. The Program

         Each household assigned to the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison groups was issued

a housing voucher that they could use to help pay the rent for an apartment in the private market.10


         9
          Moreover, improvements in safety and in mother’s mental health may have positive effects on child human capital
accumulation. In fact, a large literature suggests positive impacts of maternal mental health on parenting and child outcomes
[Weissman et al. 1984; Gelfand et al. 1990].
         10
              Note that we use the term “housing voucher” as a generic term for the subsidies offered through MTO. One
third of these subsidies were Section 8 certificates, where recipients made a fixed contribution (usually 30 percent of their
adjusted income, or .3AI) towards their rent, and the local housing authority paid the difference between this contribution

                                                             8
The average value of this voucher was approximately $700 per month. Both treatment groups

received briefings from HUD staff about program rules and about how to look for an apartment at

the time of voucher issuance. The net cost of counseling in the Experimental group was $1827 per

household [Goering et al. 1999].

         The Experimental group members were also assigned a counselor from a local nonprofit (the

Metropolitan Boston Housing Partnership, or MBHP). The counselors made home visits to review

housing search strategies, explained which neighborhoods the vouchers could be used in (providing

a map marked with low-poverty Census tracts), helped program participants clear up bad credit

histories, found apartment listings in newspapers, provided references to landlords, and sometimes

drove participants to see promising apartments. Thus, the counselors played a very large role in

determining the destination communities of the Experimental group members.11

         The impact of this complex treatment may also have been affected by features of the Boston

housing and labor markets during the period of study and by some changes in government policies

that impacted the participating families. In particular, both housing vacancy rates and unemployment



and the unit rent up to a pre-specified payment standard (PS). Two thirds were Section 8 vouchers, where the housing
authority set the subsidy size (usually PS - .3AI) and allowed recipients to choose their rental payment within a range. These
two subsidy types were eventually merged in 1999. The PS varied by bedroom size, and were based on a percentile (lowered
from the 45th to the 40th in 1995) of the rent level in the metropolitan area; the Boston metropolitan area included most
of the city and suburban residential locations of MTO-Boston program moves, while separate rent levels were calculated
for Brockton, Lowell, and other surrounding cities. Use of a housing voucher required that a unit pass inspection. Material
distributed to MTO families described the inspector’s job was to “make sure that the apartment has enough windows, electric
lights, and electrical outlets; is well ventilated; has enough space for the people who will be living there; has two ways of
to get in and out; and is in good condition.” In general, households can retain this voucher as long as they demonstrate good
conduct and their income is sufficiently low. For example, the voucher would be terminated if.3AI > PS for six consecutive
months.
         11
            Participants were urged to assemble recommendations from past landlords and from neighbors saying that the
participants were good tenants and that their children were not trouble makers. In some cases, MBHP provided small grants
to households to enable them to purchase furniture or appliances for the new apartment. The counselors made at least one
home visit in the year after the move to each family that leased up. Counselors sometimes resolved problems that arose for
the participants in their new neighborhoods. For example, they mediated disputes between the participants and their
landlords, and on a few occasions helped families deal with incidents of racial discrimination.

                                                              9
rates in the Boston area were very low (and falling) during the period of the study. In our qualitative

interviews, we found that actual and potential changes to welfare rules and to Section 8 produced

substantial anxiety among the MTO population. There was also a major change to Section 8 in the

middle of MTO. For the first time, Section 8 landlords were permitted to require security deposits

from prospective tenants. There were also major improvements during the study in the safety of some

of the developments from which MTO families came.



B. The Data

         Qualitative fieldwork. Our field work included observing the administration of the baseline

survey, attending intake sessions for families after randomization, accompanying counselors on home

visits, and interviewing program staff. We also held 12 ninety-minute open-ended interviews with

MTO household heads in the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison groups. The interviews

covered the participants’ experiences with the program, and their perceptions of their old and new

(if they moved) neighborhoods.12 This information was gathered to help understand what was going

on inside the “black box” of the MTO treatments and to generate new hypotheses.

         Surveys. We use data from two surveys. First, each household head completed a survey prior

to enrollment in the MTO program, which we refer to as the “MTO Baseline Survey,” which is

available for households at all five MTO sites. Second, we conducted our own survey, which we

refer to as the “MTO-Boston Follow-up Survey.” The main sampling frame for the data used in this

study consisted of household heads randomly assigned in the MTO program in Boston between

October 1994 and May 1996. Over these 20 months, 540 families were enrolled; new cohorts were


         12
           The qualitative interviews took place in the respondents’ homes, and were tape recorded. Interviews in English
were jointly conducted by Kling and Liebman. Interviews in Spanish were conducted by Liebman and Yvonne Gastelum.

                                                          10
assigned approximately once a month, for an average of 27 families per month. During June and July

of 1997, we completed 340 interviews by telephone. Between November 1997 and April 1998, we

completed an additional 180 interviews in person, for an overall survey response rate of 96.3

percent.13 Although MTO continued to enroll families in Boston throughout 1996-97, we limited our

sample to families who had had up to 120 days to find a new residence and then at least nine months

to have lived in the new residence at the time our interviews began. The monthly enrollments of new

families and the different survey completion dates yield an average time between random assignment

and the MTO-Boston Follow-up Survey of 2.2 years, with a range from 1 to 3.5 years. Survey data

on residential addresses were geocoded and merged them with the STF files of the 1990 Census of

Population to describe the attributes of the neighborhoods of MTO families.

         Administrative records. Our primary source of information for assessing welfare and

employment impacts in the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison groups are extracts from the

Massachusetts Department of Revenue’s Longitudinal Data Base. The data on monthly welfare

(AFDC/TANF) receipt from 1991-98 originated with the Massachusetts Department of Transitional

Assistance. Quarterly earnings data is based on information from employer filings with the

Massachusetts Department of Revenue.14 An advantage of these data sources in comparison to our


         13
            The survey was written by our research team and administered in mixed modes (by telephone and in-person)
by Westat Inc. The survey was administered in both Spanish and English. The interviewers were not told about the
treatment group assignment of individuals. The complete survey is available at http://www.wws.princeton.edu/~kling. We
were unable to complete interviews with 20 household heads. In 13 of these cases, we located the household, but were
unable to complete an interview because the sample member was deceased, avoided our interviewer, or refused to be
interviewed. In 7 cases, we did not locate the household head, although in five of those cases we were in touch with friends
or family members of the household head, and might ultimately have been able to locate the household head or other
members of the MTO household with additional efforts.
         14
            Note that these data from tax records included reports from all employers in the state, which is broader coverage
than the Unemployment Insurance records often used in research. By definition, administrative records do not capture “off-
the-books” or illegal earnings. However, some research has shown that the under-measurement appears to be symmetric
across treatment and control groups in the national JTPA evaluation [Kornfeld and Bloom 1999], suggesting that differences
between MTO groups may not be biased by this omission.

                                                            11
survey is that we can construct a panel of quarterly observations from the beginning of 1992 through

the third quarter of 1998.15



C. Characteristics of MTO Families

         As shown in Table I, the participants in all five MTO sites are largely female-headed

households. The participants in Baltimore and Chicago are almost entirely African-American. The

Boston, Los Angeles, and New York sites have more ethnically diverse groups of participants with

over 40 percent Hispanics. According to the Baseline Survey at the time of program enrollment, the

main reason a majority of families (53 percent) wanted to move is fear of crime (“to get away from

drugs and gangs”). Table I also reports that improvements in housing (“to get a bigger or better

apartment”) and school quality (“better schools for my children”) were the next most important

factors motivating moves. Employment concerns (“to get a job” or “to be near my job”) were listed

as the main reason to move by less than 2 percent of all participants. In contrast to the emphasis on

crime as a motivation for wanting to move among current public housing residents in high poverty

areas, participants in the Gautreaux housing mobility program in the late 1970s (Peroff et al. 1979,

p. 114) indicated that good schools (34 percent) and quality of housing (26 percent) were more

important considerations than crime (23 percent). The increased concern about crime among inner-

city public housing residents likely reflects the increase in violent crime rates that occurred in many

urban areas over this time period. The concern about crime may also have been the direct result of

having been victimized recently. Across all five sites, 24 percent of the household heads indicated

that someone who lives with them had been beaten or assaulted in the past six months, and 11 percent

         15
           This was constructed by primarily by matching on Social Security Number (SSN). Names and birth dates were
also used to find additional matches and validate the SSN matches; this refinement affected less than one percent of the
quarterly observations.

                                                          12
had had someone stabbed or shot. The reported victimization rates of MTO families are about four

times higher than those computed from a recent national survey of public housing households in

family developments reported in Zelon et al.[1994].16

         In comparison to other tenants in the same public housing development in which the MTO

families lived, Goering et al. [1999] found that MTO and non-MTO households were very similar in

household size and in number of children under 18. MTO households (pooling across all five sites)

were more likely to be female-headed (93 percent vs. 78 percent), receiving AFDC (75 percent vs.

51 percent), not working (88 percent vs. 70 percent), and younger (median age 33 vs. 39).

         Table II presents a list of characteristics of the 540 Boston households that are the focus of

our analysis, as reported by the household head in the Baseline Survey. The majority of these families

are headed by a single mother who receives public assistance. 27 percent of the household heads

were employed at the time of the baseline survey, and 22 percent own an automobile. These patterns

are not surprising given that eligibility for the program was restricted to families with children living

in public housing (or project-based assisted housing) in high poverty, inner-city census tracts.

         Under random assignment to one of three groups in MTO, the Baseline Survey characteristics

should be the same on average across the groups except for variation due to sampling. Using the 24

characteristics in panel A of Table II, we find that only two of the 48 differences between the control

group and the two treatment groups has a p-value of less than .05; this pattern is quite consistent with

a successful implementation of random assignment.17 One additional factor when comparing groups


         16
           Victimization rates may be somewhat exaggerated in the Baseline Survey. Despite instructions that the survey
was being conducted by outside researchers and that the housing authority would not receive copies of individual responses,
our fieldwork revealed that some respondents assumed their answers could influence program acceptance.
         17
            A test of the joint significance of the 48 differences has an F-statistic of 1.2 with a p-value of .21, indicating no
significant differences between the groups. Means of baseline characteristics for each of the three MTO groups are presented
in Table 1 of Katz, Kling, and Liebman [2000].

                                                              13
is that the randomization proportions were changed after the first 450 households were randomly

assigned; all statistics we report are therefore weighted to account for this change.18



                                        IV. ECONOMETRIC FRAMEWORK

         The theories of neighborhood effects discussed in section II posit a relationship between

neighborhood characteristics (such as school quality or role models) and outcomes (such as

educational achievement). In a simple regression framework , the most direct test of these theories

would be to examine the coefficient vector (*1) in a regression of the outcome of interest (Y) on a

set of neighborhood characteristics (W), conditioning on controls for individual background variables

(X) with i indexing households:



(1)      Yi = Wi*1 + Xi$1 + g1i



There are two reasons, however, why estimates of equation (1) on standard non-experimental cross-

section (and panel) data sets are unlikely to provide convincing tests of theories of neighborhood

effects. First, the selection problem arising from the systematic sorting of individuals among

neighborhoods on the basis of important unobserved determinants of socioeconomic outcomes may

bias results from equation (1). Second, it can be quite difficult to measure the characteristics of


         18
           For the computation of all descriptive statistics and econometric estimates in this paper, the data are weighted.
For the earlier 450 sample households, the Exp:Sec8:Control random assignment ratio was 225:85:140. For the later 90
households, after March 1996, the ratio was 15:35:40. The randomization proportions were adjusted after it became
apparent that more Experimental families and fewer Section 8 Comparison families were taking-up the offered voucher than
had been projected. We weight the data under these two randomization proportions to reflect the overall sample ratio of
240:120:180, or 4:2:3. For example, there are relatively fewer Control households in the earlier period than in the overall
sample, so these observations are upweighted by (180/540)/(140/450) .1.07. Thus, using the weights allow us to abstract
from this change and address the counterfactual question of what our results would look like if the randomization
probabilities had remained constant throughout our time period at the overall sample ratio.

                                                            14
neighborhoods that theories suggest should be important, potentially leading to attenuation biases

from measurement error. For example, data on peer influences are difficult to collect and the

neighborhood variables in standard data sets (usually at the census tract or block group level) may

not correspond to the relevant neighborhood concept.             These measurement problems are

compounded since many neighborhood characteristics are highly correlated with each other, making

it difficult to parse out their separate contributions.

        To identify the causal effect of residential location on an outcome of interest, we must

compare people living in different locations who would have experienced the same outcome, at least

on average, if they had lived in the same location. Since people cannot be located in two places at

once, this comparison necessarily involves a counterfactual that cannot be directly observed. In our

analysis of the MTO program, we study safety, health, and other outcomes for families originally

living in public housing who were offered a housing voucher to defray their rental payments in a

privately owned apartment. We then compare the average outcomes of these treatment-group

families to a Control group originally living in the same public housing projects, but who were not

offered the voucher. The key to this analysis is that the offer of the voucher is randomly assigned by

lottery. Thus, the Control group is used to identify the average outcomes corresponding to the

counterfactual state that would have occurred for families in the treatment group if they had not been

offered a housing voucher through the lottery. This analysis does not allow us to identify the specific

neighborhood characteristics that produce the change in outcome. Instead, it measures the average

causal effect of moves to neighborhoods with entire bundles of different characteristics than the

public housing projects of origin.

        To formalize our analysis, let D be an indicator variable for use of a housing voucher to move

through the MTO program, or treatment take-up. Let Z (with coefficient B2) be an indicator variable

                                                   15
for being eligible for an MTO program voucher, or treatment group assignment. Let 0 be the other

determinants of voucher use, which is determined as in equation (2).



(2)     Di = ZiB2 + 02i



        The difference in outcomes between the treatment and control group are known as “Intent-

To-Treat” (ITT) effect, and is captured by the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimate of the coefficient

B3 in a regression of the outcome (Y) on an indicator for assignment (Z) to a treatment or control

group as in equation (3):



(3)     Yi = ZiB3 + g3i



ITT is an average of the causal effects for those who take-up the treatment and those who do not.

        The characteristics known prior to randomization (X) should have the same distribution within

the treatment and control groups because they are statistically independent of group assignment.

Thus, including them in a regression like (3) will not change the coefficient B3 (unless X happens to

differ between groups due to the variability in a small sample). Xs may still be included to improve

the precision of the treatment effect estimates, however, if they are related to Y and thereby reduce

residual variation in the regression, as in equation (4).



(4)     Yi = ZiB4 +Xi$4 + g4i




                                                  16
The ITT estimate tells us the impact of being offered the opportunity to move with a MTO voucher.

From the perspective of a policy maker designing a policy that would offer a similar voucher to a

similar population, this parameter is directly of interest.

         However, from the perspective of the neighborhood effects literature, it is also desirable to

have an estimate of the impact of actually moving to a new neighborhood, rather than simply of being

offered the opportunity to move. Under several assumptions (treatment group assignment is random;

Control group members are prohibited from receiving program voucher assistance; the effect on

outcomes of treatment assignment works entirely through making a subsidized move through the

program19), we can use treatment assignment as an instrumental variable to estimate the parameter

commonly known as “the effect of Treatment-On-Treated” (TOT). The TOT parameter measures

the average effect of the treatment on those in the treatment group who actually receive the treatment

(i.e., who actually move using a Section 8 rental voucher provided by the MTO program). One

estimate of TOT is B3/B2, or the ITT divided by the proportion receiving the treatment.20 We use an

alternative estimate, the parameter (5 from a two stage least squares (2SLS) regression of Y on D

with Z used as an instrumental variable for D, as in equation (5).




         19
             This assumption says that those who did not accept the treatment offer had no average treatment effect in
comparison to those who would not have accepted the treatment if it had been offered to them. For the Experimental group,
this assumption implies that the later outcomes of households who met with a housing mobility counselor were not affected
by the counselor if that household did not make a subsidized move through the MTO program. For both treatment groups,
this assumption implies that the experience of housing search induced by assignment to a treatment group did not affect later
outcomes if that household did not make a subsidized program move. We believe that this assumption is not strictly true,
but we also believe that effects of mobility counselors and of housing search on outcomes such as child behavior,
victimization, or health for those who did not make a subsidized move through the program are likely to be an order of
magnitude smaller than the effects of moving to a new residential location.
         20
          The use of this deflator based on the proportion in the treatment group who actually received the treatment was
introduced in the program evaluation context by Bloom [1984]; see Heckman, LaLonde, and Smith [1999] for a
comprehensive discussion of alternative parameters of interest in the evaluation of social programs.

                                                            17
(5)      Yi = Di(5 +Xi$5 + g5i



The 2SLS estimate of (5 in (5) is a regression-adjusted estimate of TOT, using the information in X

to obtain additional statistical precision, and is asymptotically equivalent to the unadjusted indirect

least squares estimate of TOT, B3/B2.

         There are two treatment groups in this application, so we will compute separate estimates for

both the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison groups by making D and Z matrices of two

indicator variables for these groups. In this research we will stack data for all three MTO groups and

present regression-adjusted ITT and TOT estimates based, respectively, on OLS estimates of (4) and

on 2SLS estimates of (5), using treatment group assignments as instrumental variables for housing

voucher use through the program.

         Conceptually, the TOT is the estimated difference in outcomes between those who actually

use the rental voucher through the program and those in the Control group who would have used the

voucher if it had been offered to them. Among those assigned to a treatment group, we refer those

who decide to take-up the offered voucher as “compliers” and those who decide not to take-up the

offered voucher as “never takers,” following a literature on treatment effect estimation.21 Table III

summarizes the relationship between compliers and never takers in the treatment and control groups.

As before, let Y be an outcome, let D be an indicator of program voucher use, and let Z be an

indicator of treatment group assignment by lottery. Now, let C refer to potential compliance with

the treatment. Potential compliance is observed in the treatment group (C=D when Z=1), but not

observed in the control group. Thus, “Control Compliers” (C=1,Z=0) do not receive the treatment,


         21
             For example, see Angrist, Imbens and Rubin [1996]. In their terminology, there are no “always takers” or
“defiers” in this application because no one in the Control group is offered a voucher through the MTO program.

                                                         18
but they would have accepted the treatment had it been offered to them. Similarly, “Control Never

Takers” (C=0,Z=0) would not have accepted the treatment if it had been offered to them.

       Using this notation, we can more precisely define the Intent-To-Treat (ITT) and Treatment-

On-Treated effects (TOT). ITT is E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0]. TOT is E[Y|C=1,Z=1] - E[Y|C=1,Z=0].

To assess the magnitude of the TOT effect in relative as well as absolute terms, it is useful to have

a benchmark level of the outcome in the absence of treatment for comparison. In equation (6), we

use the mean outcome for treated compliers and the TOT difference to impute the Control Complier

Mean outcome (CCM).



(6)    CCM = E[Y|C=1,Z=0]

               = E[Y|C=1,Z=1] - {E[Y|C=1,Z=1] - E[Y|C=1,Z=0]}

               = E[Y|C=1,Z=1] - TOT



Although E[Y|C=1,Z=0] is not directly observable, E[Y|C=1,Z=1] and TOT can be estimated. With

a mean outcome for treated compliers of .40 and a TOT effect of .10, for example, the mean outcome

level among the “Control Compliers” who would have taken-up a voucher had it been offered to them

would be .30, and the change in the outcome for compliers relative to the level of the outcome in the

absence of the treatment would be 33 percent.



                      V. MOBILITY AND NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS

       As intended, the MTO program had a substantial impact on the residential location of

households offered vouchers to live in a private market apartment. The share of MTO-Boston

families in our sample who used a program voucher to move from their original location (which we

                                                 19
refer to as the “take-up rate”) was .48 for the Experimental group and .62 for the Section 8

Comparison group, as reported in the first row of Panel A of Table IV.22 The lower take-up rate for

Experimental group families resulted from two ways in which the treatment they received differed

from the treatment received by Comparison group families. On the one hand, the restriction imposed

on Experimental group families limiting them to apartments in census tracts with poverty rates below

10 percent could have reduced their take-up of the program, both because it was more difficult to find

apartments further outside the city and because of possible perceived disamenities associated with

moves to low-poverty neighborhoods such as greater transportation costs or social isolation. On the

other hand, the extensive housing search counseling provided to Experimental group families

presumably increased their take-up rate. The restriction on eligible census tracts appears to have been

more important than the counseling leading to lower take-up for the Experimental group.

         In analyses not reported in the tables, we have examined the determinants of take-up for both

the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison groups. To distill the vast number of variables in

Baseline Survey that are possibly relevant predictors of take-up into a parsimonious (and

interpretable) specification, we created several indices of questions on the same or highly correlated

topics. We find that indices of Confident Attitudes and Dangerous Living Conditions are highly

significant predictors of take-up, while Social Involvement in the Community and Public Assistance

Receipt are not significant.23 A possible interpretation of these findings is that households with

         22
             This pattern of lower take-up rates for the Experimental group than for the Section 8 Comparison group is found
at all five MTO sites. Goering et al. [1999] report that the final take-up rates across all the MTO sites were 47 percent for
the Experimentals and 60 percent for the Section 8 Comparison group.
         23
            These indices were constructed to be the proportion of households answering affirmatively to related questions.
Confident Attitudes refers to the proportion that were “very sure” about their ability to handle a move (6 questions) and that
would not feel bad about living in a white, higher-income neighborhood (4 questions). Dangerous Living Conditions refers
to the proportion reporting personal victimization of a householder (5 questions); unsafe neighborhood conditions (4
questions); big neighborhood problems with litter, graffiti, drinking, drug dealing, and abandoned buildings (6 questions);
and apartment problems with paint, plumbing, rodents, locks, windows, wiring, heating, and space (8 questions). Social

                                                             20
greater (perceived) net benefits from a move -- because of their better ability to handle life in a new

neighborhood and a worse safety situation in their public housing project -- are more likely to take

advantage of vouchers providing an opportunity to move out of public housing. We also examined

the relationship between take-up and an index of behavior problems among children identified in the

Baseline Survey.24 The main finding of this analysis is a large and significant gender asymmetry;

behavior problems among boys are positively related to take-up, problems among girls are negatively

related to take-up.

         The two MTO treatments also led to differing distributions of destination neighborhoods. In

the second row of Panel A, we find that at the time of the Follow-up Survey few Control (.05) and

Section 8 Comparison (.12) households were living outside the city of Boston, while the Experimental

group (.28) households were much more likely to live outside the city limits.25 During the 1-3.5 years

that elapsed by the time of the Follow-up Survey, a substantial share (.27) of Control households had



Involvement in the Community refers to the proportion reporting interactions with neighbors (8 questions), friends or family
in the neighborhood (2 questions), and use of services such as buses, churches, and clinics within 15 minutes of home (5
questions). Public Assistance Receipt use refers to the proportion reporting receipt of AFDC, Food Stamps, SSI, WIC or
other public assistance payments (9 questions).
           An increase in the proportion of Confident Attitudes responses from .2 to .7 (10th to 90th percentile) is associated
with a 19 percentage point increase in take-up. An increase in the proportion of Dangerous Living Conditions responses
from .18 to .72 (10th to 90th percentile) is associated with a 14 percentage point increase in take-up. These results are from
a linear probability model of take-up controlling for the covariates in Table II (not included themselves in the indices), using
pooled data on the 360 Experimental and Section 8 Comparison group households. The effects of background characteristics
on take-up are similar across the two treatment groups, but the limited sample sizes make it difficult to rule out large
differences in the determinants of take-up for the Experimental and Comparison treatments.
         24
             This index was the proportion of behavior problems reported about the child from the six listed in panel B of
Table II. An increase in the proportion of boys behavior problems from 0 to .5 (to 90th percentile) was associated with an
11 percentage point increase in take-up (p-value .24). An increase for girls from 0 to .33 (to 90th percentile) was associated
with a 22 percentage point decrease in take-up (p-value .002). These results are from a linear probability model of take-up
controlling for a main effect of gender and the covariates in Table II (not interacted with gender), using pooled data on the
388 children in the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison group households.
         25
           Nearly all of those outside the city limits were living in Boston’s surrounding communities, although there were
six Experimental and two Control households who moved out to other states. In addition, there were three Section 8
Comparison households living in Puerto Rico with whom we completed interviews but from whom were unable to obtain
street addresses that could be matched to Census tracts; these household are therefore not included in Table IV.

                                                              21
moved out of their origin housing project or other Census block group from the time of the Baseline

Survey. Among the Experimental group, 60 percent of households had moved out of their original

location (48 percent through MTO and 12 percent independently). Among the Section 8 Comparison

group, 68 percent had moved (62 percent through MTO and 6 percent independently).26

         To assess the differences in residential locations of program participants, we present the mean

characteristics of neighborhoods based on 1990 Census tract data. Panel B of Table IV shows that

the local areas in which Experimental and Section 8 Comparison households were living at the time

of the Follow-up Survey were significantly different on average from the Control households across

many different dimensions, including a lower poverty rate, lower welfare receipt, and higher

education levels.27 The Section 8 Comparison group had smaller differences relative to the control

group in racial composition and fraction speaking almost no English.

         Panel C provides information about the peers children are exposed to in school. It displays

the average reading and math test score percentiles for the schools that MTO children were attending

at the time of the Follow-up Survey. These percentiles are calculated by taking the average test score

for the students in the school from a statewide test and then determining the fraction of Massachusetts

students who attend schools with average test scores below the average score for students in the




         26
               Although some Section 8 Comparison families had moved independently of the MTO program, they did not
necessarily stop receiving some form of project-based or tenant-based housing assistance. In the Follow-up Survey, 98
percent reported receiving government housing assistance, a significantly higher rate of receipt than the 93 percent in the
Experimental group and the 90 percent in the Control group. Thus, the treatment increased housing assistance receipt
(relative to the counterfactual of being in the Control group) for 8 percent of Section 8 Comparison families in addition to
influencing residential location for 62 percent in that group.
         27
            We have also replicated these analyses of neighborhood characteristics with Census block group data, and the
results are quite similar. The mean poverty rates for block groups are: Exp .250; Sec8 .275; and Control .388.

                                                            22
school that the MTO child attends.28 The Control group children attend schools that on average have

reading test scores in the eighth percentile and math test scores in the tenth percentile of the school

test score distribution. The Experimental group experienced an eight percentile point increase in

school average reading scores, and a six percentile point increase in average math scores. The results

for both reading and math test scores indicate that even though many families are moving through

MTO to neighborhoods with substantially less poverty than their origin neighborhoods, the schools

MTO children are attending have test scores that are still well below the state average. Indeed, over

85 percent of children in Experimental households that made program moves still attend schools with

average test scores below the state median. The Section 8 group experienced smaller and statistically

insignificant increases in school quality as measured by test scores. The small changes for the Section

8 group are not surprising since many of the households remain in the city of Boston with many of

their children staying in their original schools.

         The similarity in the mean characteristics of the neighborhoods of the Experimental and

Section 8 Comparison groups does not convey the differences in the distribution of tract

characteristics. Data on the distribution of tract poverty rates is presented for the three MTO groups

in columns 1-3 of Table V. Although many families in both the Experimental and Section 8 groups

moved to lower poverty neighborhoods, members of the Section 8 Comparison group were the least

likely to remain in a tract with a poverty rate of greater than 40 percent.




         28
               The test scores come from the 1996 Massachusetts Educational Assessment Program (MEAP). The test was
administered to students in grades 4, 8, and 10. For schools that contained two tested grades, we counted the grade closest
to the grade of the MTO child. Our overall response rate for school test score variable was only 67% (as compared to about
93% for most child outcomes) because of difficulties matching the school name that was provided to us by the MTO parent
to our list of all schools in Massachusetts. The MEAP was not administered to students in private schools or charter schools.
We did not find noticeable differences in the fraction of students attending private or charter schools across the three groups.

                                                              23
         Columns 3-5 show the distribution of Census tract poverty rates for households who did not

make a subsidized move through the MTO program. The mean poverty rates for the three groups are

within one percentage point of each other and the distributions are quite similar. Under the

assumption that the program had no impact on families that did not lease-up through the program,

this implies that the mean poverty rates are essentially the same within the Control group for those

who would have taken a program rental voucher if offered (Control Compliers) and those who would

not have taken it (Control Never Takers).29 In other words, those in the Control group who would

have utilized the rental voucher if offered were no more likely move to a lower poverty neighborhood

on their own in the absence of a voucher than those who would not have utilized the voucher.

         The Census tract poverty rate distribution for households who did make a subsidized move

through the MTO program, the Treatment Compliers, is shown in columns 6-7 of Table V. Nearly

all of the Experimental movers initially moved to a Census tract with a poverty rate of less than 10

percent as prescribed by program rules, but by the time of the Follow-up Survey (1-3.5 years after

random assignment) only 72 percent were living in tracts with less than a ten percent poverty rate

because some had made subsequent moves to higher poverty tracts.30 Among Section 8 Comparison

group members who moved through the MTO program, only 18 percent were living in a tract with

a poverty rate less than ten percent. We also find that among those in both groups who initially made

a subsidized move outside the Boston city limits, 14 percent had returned to live within Boston at the



         29
            As discussed in Section IV, the Overall Control mean is a weighted average of the Control Complier mean and
the Control Never Taker mean: E[Y|Z=0]=E[Y|C=1,Z=0]Pr[C=1,Z=0]+E[Y|C=0,Z=0](1-Pr[C=1,Z=0]). Under the
identifying assumptions in section III, the difference between the Control Complier mean and the Control Never Taker mean
is equivalent to: (E[Y|Z=0]-E[Y|D=0,Z=1])/Pr[D=1,Z=1]. Throughout this paper, we estimate the statistical significance
of this difference without covariates for simplicity.
         30
          Families using a program voucher were free to move again after one year while continuing to receive the rental
voucher, and Experimental group families were no longer restricted to low poverty areas in choosing their location.

                                                          24
time of the Follow-up Survey. But for both groups of movers, there were no families living in a tract

with a poverty rate of greater than forty percent, in comparison to an overall share of 60 percent in

columns 3-5 among those who did not make a subsidized move.

       In summary, about three quarters of the Experimental Compliers moved and remained in

neighborhoods with a poverty rate below 10 percent, while about three quarters of Section 8

Comparison Compliers ended up in neighborhoods with poverty rates between 10 and 40 percent.

However, because take-up was higher in the Section 8 group, fewer Section 8 families remained in

Census tracts with poverty rates above 40 percent.



                   VI. CHILDREN’S HUMAN CAPITAL: BEHAVIOR AND HEALTH

       This section presents results of the impacts of the MTO treatments on child behavior and

mental and physical health. These outcomes are of interest both as key short-term measures of child

well-being and as potentially important inputs into the human capital production function. Models

of neighborhood effects suggest that moves to safer and more affluent neighborhoods are likely to

be associated with reductions in child problem behaviors. Furthermore, the medical literature

documents an association in clinical settings between chronic exposure to violence and patterns of

child health and behaviors, such as difficulty concentrating because of fatigue due to sleep

disturbances or images of traumatic events, fearfulness of being alone, and aggressiveness due to

behavior imitation or self-protection [Augustyn et al. 1995, Groves et al. 1993].

       In our qualitative fieldwork, we also developed a hypothesis that the fear and anxiety of living

in a violent neighborhood may cause emotional and behavioral problems that may adversely affect

the mental health of children. This hypothesis is encapsulated in the comments of one woman who

described to us why she had used an MTO voucher to move to a suburban location.

                                                 25
         As long as the kids is safe, that what my main concern was. ... They can’t grow up normally
         in an atmosphere of fear. They can’t play games and stuff. So I had to do it. And that was
         the best chance when they said we had to move in the suburbs. Living in the same area, that’s
         not good. Even the elderly people, they living in fear, captive in their own homes. My
         mother lives like that. It’s terrible. ... In the ‘hood -- my kids, they had friends. But I
         wouldn’t let them go out, because I was afraid. Bullets don’t got no name.


This same woman described to us a visit she took to her old neighborhood with her four year old

daughter: “Even now, we can’t drive up the street. My baby, she so scared that she start cryin’. ‘No-

no-no.’ She don’t even want to go near there. It’s amazing how little kids remember that stuff.”

         To assess the impact of residential location on the mental health of children, we asked

household heads in the Follow-up Survey if their children had exhibited various behavior problems

during the past three months. The questions we administered in the Follow-up Survey were items

fielded previously in the National Health Interview Survey and the National Longitudinal Survey of

Youth Children’s Supplement (NLSY-CS). From those instruments we selected seven questions that

focused on types of behaviors that the mothers could observe directly, as opposed to questions

generically about behavior problems or questions requiring intuition about how their child was feeling.

The behaviors we asked about were: trouble getting along with teachers, disobedience at home,

disobedience at school, hanging around with troublemakers, bullying others, inability to sit still, and

depression. To summarize the responses to the seven behavior problem questions, we created an

index that is the fraction of the problems that were “sometimes” or “often” true of the child, as

opposed to “not true.”31


         31
            Using the data on the children from ages 8 to 14 in the NLSY-CS, we find that this index of seven behavior
problems and some of its components (especially the measure of trouble getting along with teachers) are statistically
significant predictors of socioeconomic outcomes (alcohol use, drug use, criminal involvement, and school enrollment)
measured 4 to 8 years later. Thus, child behavior problems may provide a good indicator for human capital development.
MTO treatment effect estimates for individual components of the behavior problems index are available in Katz, Kling, and
Liebman [2000].

                                                          26
         We present results on behavior problems in Table VI separately for boys and girls. Since we

use the same table structure for a variety of outcomes, we explain it here in some detail. Each row

of Table VI corresponds to a different outcome from the Follow-up Survey. In the first row, the

outcome is the household head’s report of the proportion of behavior problems displayed by her male

child. We find in column 1 that the average fraction of the seven behavior problems in the Control

group was .33.32 In comparison, the Experimental group had a fraction of behavior problems 9

percentage points lower than the Control group, based on the ITT estimates reported in column 2.

Assuming that only those who made a subsidized move through the MTO program had a non-zero

average treatment effect, the TOT effect for the Experimental group was an 18 percentage point

reduction in behavior problems, reported in column 3. As we discussed in Section IV, it is also

possible to estimate the average level of the outcome for those in the Control group who would have

used an MTO voucher if it had been offered to them. This Control Complier mean is reported in

column 4. Thus, the Experimental group compliers experienced a change in behavior problems of

-.18 from a mean .44, a relative decrease of 42 percent. Columns 5-8 show a similarly large decrease

in behavior problems for boys in the Section 8 Comparison group.

         Both the ITT and TOT estimates are regression adjusted, controlling for the Baseline Survey

household variables summarized in panel A of Table II (age, race, sex, marital status, family structure,

disability, welfare receipt, education, employment, car ownership, mobility history, social contact,

victimization, and neighborhood poverty rate) and the Baseline Survey child behavior variables in


         32
            For context, we examined behavior problems a sample of children ages 6-14 from the 1998 NLSY-CS, whose
mothers have roughly the same median age as the MTO sample. Weights to adjust the national sample to reflect MTO
demographics were based on indicators for age, sex, and gender of the child, and indicators for head of household having
12 years of education, or more than 12 years. These variables were used to predict the odds of participating in MTO versus
being a national survey sample respondent, based on the exponentiated latent index of a logit model of participation estimated
from stacked MTO and national survey data. The demographically adjusted mean of the behavior problems index was .35
for boys and .25 for girls, slightly higher than the .33 for boys and .20 for girls ages 6-14 among MTO Controls.

                                                             27
Panel B of Table II. These regressions adjust for differences in Baseline Survey characteristics that

may have occurred by chance, and absorb residual variation to improve the efficiency of estimation.33

         Among girls in row 2, the ITT estimates show only modest reductions in behavior problems

for both treatment groups, and the estimates are not statistically distinguishable from zero. Notably,

this concentration of the effects in reduction of behavior problems among boys and not girls was also

found in the recent evaluation of the New Hope employment assistance demonstration in Milwaukee

[Bos et al. 1999]. Leventhal and Brooks-Gunn [2000] report evidence that suggests a behavior

problem reduction among children ages 8-18 at the New York MTO site, although results are not

reported by gender. The generally high level of behavior problems among Control Complier boys

suggests that households who had boys with behavior problems were more likely to accept an MTO

program voucher if one was offered to them, a hypothesis that is consistent with our earlier result that

households with a boy with behavior problems were more likely to take-up an offered voucher.

         One mechanism through which the gender differences may be occurring is social contact with

other children. Girls in Control Complier households were particularly likely to have had at least one

friend in the neighborhood, but girls in Complier households from both treatment groups each had

a significant relative decline of about 30 percent in their chance of having a friend in the

neighborhood.34 We speculate that these socialization difficulties for girls may offset some of the

benefits for mental health of living in a different neighborhood.



         33
            Because of the random assignment, the Baseline Survey Characteristics are essentially orthogonal to the treatment
indicators, so the magnitudes of the point estimates do not change substantively when we include of covariates. For example,
the simple difference in means of the Experimental and Control groups in behavior problems for boys is -.098, versus the
regression adjusted ITT estimate of -.090.
         34
             For analysis of binary outcomes throughout this paper, we use linear probability models for simplicity in
computing 2SLS estimates, and correct the standard errors for heteroscedasticity. In general our results do not appear to
be sensitive to whether we use linear probability models or probit estimates.

                                                            28
         Regarding physical health, a substantial medical literature shows that living in the inner-city

is associated with detrimental child health outcomes with urban children having higher rates of

accidents, injuries [Quinlan 1996], and asthma [Weiss et al. 1992]. Our fieldwork reinforced the idea

that there were other important types of danger associated living in a public housing project. For

example, one woman described how the park at which they played in the projects was built on

cement. “The place was not safe for the children to play. They had swings on concrete. Everything

was on concrete. And that’s where most of the accidents happened.”

         In the Follow-up Survey, we asked specifically about any injuries, accidents, or poisonings

that a child may have been involved in during the past six months. Most injuries were related to a

dangerous environmental factor (such as a used needle), were falls during “horsing around” and other

play among children, or were sports-related (cycling, skating, ball-playing). In row 5 of Table VI we

report results for injuries and accidents. There was a relative decrease among Experimental

Compliers of 74 percent from a Control Complier mean of .160. The effect for the Section 8

Comparison group was about half as large and not statistically significant. For a comparison, we

estimated the six month prevalence of injuries, accidents, and poisonings in a national sample that we

weighted to be demographically similar to MTO children. Our estimate of .029 is lower than all of

the MTO groups including the Experimental Compliers.35

         Asthma attacks are thought to be triggered in part by environmental factors, including

crowding [Weitzman et al. 1992], poor air quality [Thurston 1997], stress [Wright 1998], lack of

heat, and exposure to allergens from cockroaches, dust mites, mice, and rats [Gelber et al. 1993,

         35
           The estimate of .029 is based on the 1988 National Health Interview Survey Child Supplement (NHIS-CS) data,
weighted to reflect MTO demographics. Because the NHIS-CS uses a 12-month recall period instead of our 6 month recall
period, we then deflate the NHIS-CH estimates for comparison to the MTO-Boston results. Our deflator of .68 (instead of
a simple .50) is derived from research on NHIS-CH recall effects [Harel et al. 1994] and accounts for the fact the
respondents appear to be less likely to report injuries if they occurred many months ago in the recall period.

                                                         29
Sharfstein et al. 1998]. Stress could come from exposure to violence, and many of the environmental

irritants could result from poor housing. In the Baseline Survey, for instance, we found that 32

percent of MTO families reported that rats and mice were “a big problem”, and 9 percent reported

that the heating system was a big problem. Our field work suggested that a move out of a housing

project apartment might remove a child from many of these environmental irritants. In row 6 of Table

VI, we report a relative decline of 65 percent in the probability of an asthma attack requiring medical

attention among Experimental Compliers (TOT p-value .083), from a Control Complier mean of

.16.36 There was essentially no effect for the Section 8 Comparison group.

         An obvious concern regarding the injury and asthma results is the qualification that the events

were defined to “require medical attention.” We had included this qualification for comparability to

national data, and to establish a threshold of severity. However, medical care may have been less

accessible in the locations to which the Experimental Compliers moved. We attempted to measure

this accessibility by asking whether the child had been to the doctor for a regular checkup. In row

7 of Table VI we find that the Section 8 Comparison group actually had a larger point estimate

reduction in regular doctors’ visits than the Experimental group, although both effects are statistically

insignificant. Based on this evidence, if access to medical care was the sole mechanism driving

changes in reported injuries and asthma attacks, we would have expected any access-driven effects

to have been at least as large in the Section 8 Comparison group as in the Experimental group.




         36
           The 1997 NHIS shows that only .06 of a sample demographically similar to MTO children were reported to have
had an asthma attack in the past year, while .13 were reported to have ever had asthma. The proportion of MTO children
ages 6-15 in the Control group reported to have had an asthma attack in the past six months was .10, and the proportion
reported to currently have asthma was .25.

                                                         30
                                 VII. ADULT ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY

         A primary motivation for the MTO demonstration is to measure the impacts of residential

neighborhoods on the welfare receipt and employment of low-income families. Many central cities

have higher rates of joblessness and slower rates of job growth than their surrounding areas. This

pattern suggests that providing low-income city residents with better access to jobs in the suburbs

may improve their labor market outcomes. The Experimental treatment might be expected to reduce

welfare use and increase employment by moving participants closer to suburban job centers. But

moves to new suburban neighborhoods might disrupt pre-existing social networks that are an

important source of labor market information and connections. It may take a significant amount of

time in new neighborhoods to develop new networks. Thus, the theoretical predictions about the

short-run effects of MTO on welfare and employment are ambiguous.

         To the extent that families in the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison groups are able to

move to safer neighborhoods with more plentiful after-school activities for children, parents may have

child supervision constraints relaxed and be freer to enter the labor market and to work longer hours.

Indeed, Rosenbaum and Popkin’s [1991] analysis of a survey of female household heads in the

Gautreaux program in Chicago found substantially higher employment rates (14 percentage points)

for those who moved to the suburbs than for those who moved to other parts of the central city.37

         The most striking facts in the MTO data are the changes over time for all three groups.

Welfare receipt has fallen sharply, from 71 percent in the third quarter of 1994 (prior to any random

assignment) to 38 percent in the third quarter of 1998. The employment rate, as measured by the

fraction with positive earnings in a quarter, has also increased dramatically over time for all three

         37
            The differential survey response rates of 60% for the suburban movers and 88% among city movers are a source
of concern in assessing this evidence, especially if the more successful suburban movers were more likely to have remained
in their suburban location and been reached by and responded to the survey mailed to them.

                                                           31
MTO groups. Over four years, the employment rate rose from 29 percent in the third quarter of 1994

to 48 percent in the third quarter of 1998.

         In Table VII, we show the results comparing MTO groups based on this data for our main

sample of 540 household heads. In the first row, we pool data for the first three quarters after

random assignment, and find no significant differences between MTO groups in rates of welfare

receipt. The results are essentially the same for later periods, 4-6 quarters and 7-9 quarters after

random assignment.38 The results for employment similarly show no significant between-group

differences. In results not shown in the table, we found no differences between MTO groups in

quarterly earnings in constant 1999 dollars (including zeros for those with no reported earnings) for

these periods. Although these administrative data cover only earnings in the state of Massachusetts,

we did confirm that over 95 percent of our sample was still living in Massachusetts in 1997 in the

Follow-up Survey. Thus, even the most extreme assumptions about location and welfare or

employment status of the remaining 5 percent would not generate significant differences in these

between-group results.39

         The overall lack of impact is consistent with the finding reported in section III that only two

percent of households in the Baseline Survey reported employment as one of the main reasons for

wanting to participate in MTO. Similar results have been found for other MTO sites. Research from



         38
            Measured in calendar time rather than time since random assignment, there is some modest evidence of a decline
in welfare usage among treatment group members in 1998. Pooling all four 1998 quarters, the overall control mean is .425.
The Experimental group ITT estimate is -.025 (.031) and the Section 8 group ITT estimate is -.064(.034).
         39
              We have also extended this analysis to the complete sample of all 961 household heads randomly assigned
through MTO in Boston. Although these additional households were assigned later and therefore we can follow the complete
sample for only seven quarters beyond random assignment, the results for welfare, employment and earnings are unchanged
by this extension of the sample. In addition, our MTO-Boston Follow-up Survey asked about welfare receipt and a standard
set of questions from the Current Population Survey on current labor market status (employment, unemployment, not in labor
force), usual hours of work, and usual weekly earnings, as well as some supplemental questions on fringe benefits. Again,
we find no evidence of significant differences between groups on any of these dimensions.

                                                           32
the Baltimore site using administrative data finds no significant effects in employment during the first

four years after randomization [Ludwig, Duncan, and Pinkston, 2000], although their analysis does

suggest a decline in welfare receipt for the Experimental group. A household survey of early

enrollees in the Los Angeles site finds no significant employment effects, but it does show modest

evidence of increases in hours of work and weekly earnings for Experimental and Section 8

Comparison group household heads relative to those in the control group [Hanratty, McLanahan, and

Pettit, 1998].



                                   VIII. FAMILY QUALITY OF LIFE

       At the time of the baseline survey, 55 percent of household heads in our Boston sample

reported that the main reason they wanted to move was “to get away from drugs and gangs.” Our

qualitative interviews confirmed that fear for the safety of their children was the most powerful

motive for most families in deciding to apply for MTO, and that this fear was greatly reduced among

families that moved to new neighborhoods.

       We initially hypothesized that improvements in safety may be associated with improvements

in adult mental health and perhaps overall health, because of reduced stress. To take one example,

a middle-aged Black woman who had lived in public housing for twenty-five years gave the following

description of her experience:

       When you go outside, you don’t know what’s flying around the corner. You gotta look both
       ways when you open the front door. You had to constantly look behind you to make sure
       nothing’s comin’ around you. ... It was like living in prison. I was afraid to get in my own
       car and go some place, and come back home and not know if your house would be shot out
       or what ...




                                                  33
After enrolling in MTO in 1994, she moved to a demographically older and more racially mixed part

of Boston. “It’s so beautiful. So nice. The neighbors are very friendly. ... I like the peace and quiet.

I have peace of mind.” In other qualitative interviews we also observed that adults who were living

in public housing appeared to be in much more emotional distress than those who had moved out of

public housing. One mediating factor influencing mental health that we speculated would potentially

offset increased safety among MTO program movers and was difficulty in maintaining or establishing

social contact with friends and relatives in new locations.      To assess these hypotheses more

systematically, we asked a number of related questions in the MTO-Boston Follow-up Survey. This

section presents the results on aspects of family safety, adult health, and adult social interactions that

may have substantial impacts on family quality of life.



A. Family Safety

        We find strong evidence that the MTO program has led to significant improvements in the

perceived safety of treatment group families, declines in exposure to violence, and reduced rates of

criminal victimization. While we had a sharp hypothesis that the treatment groups would be in

neighborhoods with fewer drugs and guns, we had competing hypotheses regarding victimization

since families moving into new neighborhoods may be particular targets of crime, especially among

children who at least initially may get into more fights or be more likely to have items stolen. The

results demonstrate that the program has led to both lower exposure to violence and reduced

victimization, improving well-being along the dimension that was most important to program

participants. Moreover, improved safety may be an important contributor to reductions in child

behavior problems and improvements in adult mental health.



                                                   34
           We summarize the effects of the MTO treatments on self-reported measures of safety in

Table VIII. The estimates in rows 1 and 2 show a large and statistically significant improvement in

perceived neighborhood safety and children’s exposure to weapons for the Experimental group

relative to the Control group. The analogous results are reported in columns 5-7 for the Section 8

Comparison group, whose members also reported a lower prevalence of feeling unsafe and exposure

to weapons -- but this difference is not statistically distinguishable from zero. The next two rows of

Table VIII presents results on whether family members have been exposed to drugs or gunfire.

Families in both treatment groups experienced substantial declines in exposure to these neighborhood

problems, with those in the MTO Experimental Group experiencing the largest declines. Overall, the

Control Complier means for exposure to weapons gunfire, and drugs are generally higher than the

overall Control means for both treatment groups, which is consistent with a decision process in which

the families who take-up an MTO voucher were those who would have been living in a more unsafe

neighborhood in the absence of an MTO voucher offer.

         We asked MTO household heads in our Boston Follow-up Survey about victimization of

themselves and their children during the past six months. Our measures of victimization were

modeled on the redesigned National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS).40 Overall, one quarter of

Control group households in the Follow-up Survey in the Control group reported at least one crime


         40
            For details on the NCVS redesign, see the Bureau of Justice Statistics [1994] overview. Our Follow-up Survey
included selected NCVS cues about people, places and things intended to assist respondents in recalling events, such as theft
(of a purse, wallet, or jewelry), assault (involving a neighbor, friend, relative, or someone at work or school), or attacks with
a weapon (such as a frying pan, scissors, rock, bottle, knife, or gun). In another attempt to improve upon the Baseline Survey
victimization measures, we asked specifically about the dates of incidents in order to exclude those occurring more than six
months prior to the interview.
          Following the NCVS, we classified reported incidents into property and personal crimes. Our property crimes
include household burglary and attempted entry, vandalism, and theft not directly from a person. Our personal crimes include
physical attacks, threats of attack, and theft directly from a person. We further classified personal crimes as principally
involving the household head, at least one child, or involving both -- where involvement was defined as being present at the
incident and being the person threatened, robbed, or attacked. Since our information on children’s victimization is obtained
from the household head, we probably underestimate actual victimization of children.

                                                              35
during the previous six months, and 12 percent had a head or child who was physically assaulted or

robbed.

         The results in rows 5-7 of Table 8 report the proportion of households with one or more

incidents of crimes of various types.41 Thirteen percent of Control households were victims of

personal crimes during the past six months is which at least one child was involved. Over two-thirds

of these personal crimes among children involved direct contact with the offender, such as mugging,

fighting, punching, kicking, spitting, shoving, throwing of rocks, or “getting jumped” by a gang. The

remainder involved attempted assault or verbal threats of violence. Experimental households had a

prevalence 6 percentage points lower than the Control group (p-value .06). The difference for the

Section 8 Comparison group is negative, but insignificant.

         Household heads in the Section 8 Comparison groups have a lower prevalence of any personal

crimes in the past six months, but the proportion is insignificantly different from the level in the

Control group. The difference for the Experimental group is essentially zero. For property crimes,

both treatment groups show lower prevalence of any incidents within the past six months.



B. Adult Health

         As a comprehensive measure of overall health, we report results in row 1 of Table IX from

a standard question on general health (“In general would you say that your health is excellent, very

good, good, fair, or poor?”). In the Control Group 58 percent of heads reported health that was




         41
          In results not reported in the table, we analyzed the average number of incidents, as opposed to the proportion
of households with any incident. The results for the average number of incidents are qualitatively similar to the results for
the proportion with one or more incidents.

                                                            36
good or better.42 The Experimental TOT effect is .24; the relative change from the Control Complier

mean of .46 is a 52 percent increase in the share with health that was good or better. Similarly, the

Section 8 Comparison TOT effect is .26; the relative change from the Control Complier mean of .52

is a 51 percent increase. The Control Complier Mean is significantly lower than the Control Never

Taker mean in the Experimental group, suggesting that those with poorer health were more likely to

accept the voucher if offered.

         To explore aspects of mental health, we asked two questions about calmness and happiness

used to assess positive affect in the evaluation of the RAND Health Insurance Experiment [Ware et

al. 1994]. In the second row of Table IX, we find large treatment effects in reports of household

heads feeling “calm and peaceful” during the past four weeks.43                        The relative increase for

Experimental Compliers was 58 percent from a Control Complier mean of .39, and the relative

increase for Section 8 Comparison Compliers was 53 percent from a Control Complier mean of .43.

The large increase is particularly notable for Experimental group members, since they are more likely

to be in a neighborhood with few members of the same socioeconomic or racial/ethnic group as

themselves, and this could increase social isolation and introduce countervailing distress. The relative

changes for feeling “happy” were also positive, but smaller in magnitude and not statistically

significant.

         To work with a clear definition of a mental health problem, we focused on symptoms of a

particular psychiatric condition, major depressive episode (MDE), using a series of questions from


         42
            A sample from the 1997 NHIS, weighted to reflect the demographic composition of the MTO participants (using
race, sex, age, and education), was substantially more likely to report good or better health (.87).
         43
          We examined a demographically adjusted sample from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES),
and found them more likely to be calm and peaceful a good bit of the time or more (.57) than the MTO Controls (.47).
Experimental Compliers (.62) and Section 8 Comparison Compliers (.66) are more similar to the general population ages
18-64 (.66).

                                                          37
the Composite Diagnostic Interview Short Form (CIDI-SF) [Kessler et al. 1998]. Based on their

work with the more comprehensive National Comorbidity Survey, Nelson, Kessler, and Mroczek

[1998] develop a rule for predicted MDE cases by assigning a probability to respondents with a

particular number of symptoms. The MTO sample appears to have a much higher prevalence of

MDE symptoms than a national population of similar age, race, education, and sex, but may be fairly

typical of very low-income single mothers.44 For the outcome of predicted MDE in Table IX, row

4, we find that the point estimates suggest a decline in depression among the treatment groups, but

the differences are not quite statistically significant at conventional levels. We note that the estimated

magnitude of the relative declines of 29 percent for Experimental Compliers and 43 percent for

Section 8 Comparison Compliers are quite large, which implies that our sample size is simply not big

enough to reliably detect changes of large magnitude for this outcome.



C. Adult Social Interactions

         To assess differences in social interactions caused by participation in the MTO program, we

asked several questions in the Boston Follow-up Survey, and results are reported in rows 5-7 of

Table IX. First, respondents were asked about the number of times they had visited in person with

friends and family in the past month. The point estimates of the ITT effects suggest that Section 8

Comparison and Experimental families are less likely to have visits to their home and more likely to

make visits to the homes of others, but all of these differences are statistically insignificant. To assess

social isolation, we examined whether a respondent reported any visits in the past month, either to

         44
           In tabulations from the CIDI-SF administered in the 1997 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse weighted
to reflect the demographics of the MTO sample, the predicted MDE probability was .12 as opposed to .25 in the MTO
Control group. In the general population of adults ages 18-64 with children, predicted MDE was .07. In the 1997 Women’s
Employment Survey in Michigan [Danziger et al. 1999], however, a population of single mothers receiving cash assistance
was found to have a predicted MDE of .27, within sampling error of the .25 mean for the MTO Control group.

                                                         38
their own home or to the homes of friends or family. 90 percent of the households in all three groups

had at least one visit, and there were essentially no differences between the groups. Overall, our

conclusion is that the contact with friends and relatives among the MTO participants is fairly similar

to the general population and to a demographically similar national sample.

         As an alternative measure of social relations that might influence mental health, we also

examined an indicator of social trust based on agreement with the statement “Most people can be

trusted” as opposed to “You can’t be too careful in dealing with people.” Answers to this question

appear to be highly correlated with various aspects of social engagement, such as membership in civic

organizations, voting, and spending time with neighbors [Putnam 1995].45 Only 8 percent of Control

group household heads report that most people can be trusted. We find that the Experimental group

exhibits more social trust than the Control group, with a TOT difference of .11 from a Control

Complier Mean of .04, but the statistical significance of this TOT estimate is marginal (p-value .11).46



                                                  IX. CONCLUSION

         This paper provides early estimates of the impacts of the MTO housing mobility

demonstration on families originally residing in high-poverty housing projects in inner-city Boston.

The Experimental treatment is more successful than regular Section 8 in relocating poor families into

low-poverty and suburban neighborhoods. Regular Section 8 assistance is more effective in getting

a larger share of families out of the most distressed communities.


         45
            Recent experimental work by Glaeser et al. [2000] suggests that this question predicts the trustworthiness of
a person’s own behavior, but not their trust in the expected behavior of others.
         46
           In contrast to the previous indicators of social relations, the MTO sample differs substantially from the general
population of adults with children, of whom 31 percent report that most people can be trusted in the General Social Survey
(GSS) from 1990-96. This difference is largely due to demographic factors. Weighting the GSS by the sex, race, education,
and age of the MTO sample, only 8 percent report that most people can be trusted.

                                                            39
          Table X highlights our main findings concerning the short-run impacts of MTO on measures

of child health and behavior problems, adult economic self-sufficiency, family safety, and adult heath

(with outcomes defined such that negative changes correspond to improvements). We find that

children in both the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison groups exhibit fewer behavior problems,

and that Experimental group children have lower prevalence of injuries, asthma attacks, and personal

crimes.        In contrast, the changes in neighborhoods induced by MTO have not affected the

employment rates, earnings, or welfare usage by a statistically detectable amount for household heads.

However, there do appear to be significant improvements in the general health status and mental

health of household heads. Table X further illustrates that the magnitudes of the estimated relative

changes in child and adult health outcomes among treatment compliers are very substantial.

          We believe that one of the principal reasons that our results provide credible evidence of

improvements in outcomes, particularly in the domain of health, is the consistent direction of the

results for a variety of outcomes. Throughout this paper, we have considered each outcome

separately, but in assessing the joint significance of the results it is of course important to note that

all the outcomes are measured in the same sample, and also that both treatment groups use the same

control group. Estimates of the joint probability of such a consistent pattern of results indicate that

such a pattern is extremely unlikely to be due to chance.47



          47
            Specifically, we estimated the odds that all eight health-related outcomes in panels A and D for both treatment
groups shown in Table X would indicate health improvements simply due to sampling variability. To compute these odds,
we simulated the null hypothesis of no true difference between the Experimental, Section 8 Comparison, and Control groups,
accounting for the covariance structure within households among outcomes, drawing 100,000 random samples with
replacement of 520 households from the Control group in the MTO-Boston Follow-up Survey. These households were then
randomly designated as treatment or control groups of the same sample sizes as the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison
groups. For each sample, we then computed the between group differences and recorded the signs of the differences. Note
that these are all of the health outcomes on which we collected data, so there is no issue of presenting only the significant
outcomes. These results show that under the null hypothesis of no difference, the odds were 617 to 1 of randomly obtaining
16 improvements in health-related outcomes for children and adults in the Experimental and Section 8 Comparison groups
(p-value .00162).

                                                            40
         Although the eventual long-term effects of MTO on the children of participating families

remains a crucial open research issue, the short-term impacts on adult and child circumstances are of

substantial independent importance and may be harbingers of the long-run effects of changes in

neighborhood environments.48 From the perspective of housing policy, our results clearly indicate

that offering housing vouchers to the residents of distressed inner-city housing projects improves the

well-being of those residents interested in moving out of public housing.49 If the (long-run) benefits

from moving to new neighborhoods are particularly large for children and if parents don’t fully

internalize these impacts, housing vouchers for low-income families may generate positive

intergenerational externalities relative to other income transfer mechanisms [Lazear 1983].50

However, we do not know what the impact of MTO was on other families left behind in the housing

projects when MTO families left or on the neighbors of MTO families in the new neighborhoods.

         In summary, the lack of significant short-run impacts of the MTO Experimental treatment on

adult employment and welfare participation suggests that reductions in spatial mismatch alone may

not be sufficient to overcome the labor market disadvantages of inner-city, single mothers. The

reductions in child problem behaviors (especially for boys) and improvements in child health

associated with access to more-affluent neighborhoods through MTO are consistent with models of

neighborhood effects emphasizing positive peer social interactions and the impacts of adult role


         48
              We attempted to include interactions with time since enrollment in MTO in order to study differences in
treatment effects by length of exposure to new neighborhoods. Unfortunately, this analysis did not have sufficient statistical
power to detect even large differences.
         49
            Our findings do not necessarily translate into positive effects for other public housing residents of a switch from
project-based housing assistance to vouchers. Those volunteering for the MTO lottery (and especially the MTO movers)
are likely to be public housing residents with particularly high expected returns from relocating. In fact, a recent study by
Jacob [2000] finds no mean gains in educational outcomes (at least in the short run) for children leaving high-rise public
housing in Chicago because of demolitions relative to those remaining in public housing.
         50
          In this case, housing vouchers may serve as a commitment device to ensure that the transfer is disproportionately
used to generate improvements in child well-being valued by society-at-large.

                                                             41
models and community resources on human capital accumulation. The large improvements in family

safety and adult mental health brought about by moves out of public housing through MTO may have

been an important mechanism in bringing about these health and behavior changes among children.

Note: Intent-To-Treat Difference is based on equation (3). Standard errors are reported in parentheses, adjusted for
household level clustering; * = p-value <.1; ** = p-value < .05. Data in Panels A and B are from the 1990 Census. In
Panel C, percentiles are weighted to represent fraction of Massachusetts students in schools with average test score
below average score of school child attends, based on the 1994 Massachusetts Educational Assessment Program data
from the Massachusetts Department of Education. Sample size is 525 households (Exp: 236; Sec8: 113; Control: 176)
for Panels A and B, and 408 children ages 6-15 for Panel C.

Note: Intent-To-Treat (ITT) Difference in columns 2 and 5 is based on equation (4), using OLS to control for the 24 household Baseline Survey characteristics and the 7 child
behavior and learning issues from Table II, and indicators for child’s year of age as of 9/1/97. Treatment-On-Treated (TOT) estimates in columns 3 and 6 use 2SLS (with same
controls as ITT), and instrument treatment compliance with treatment assignment as in equation (5). Implied means for Control Compliers (who would have moved through the
program if they had been assigned to a treatment group) are computed in columns 4 and 7 as the difference of the unconditional means of Treatment Compliers (who did move
through the program) and the TOT estimates using 2SLS. Robust standard errors adjusted for household clustering are reported in parentheses; * = p-value <.1; ** = p-value <
.05. The sample sizes for rows 1-7 respectively are 274, 300, 272, 295, 569, 570, and 566.

Note: Intent-To-Treat Difference uses OLS to control for the 24 household Baseline Survey characteristics from Table II, as well as indicators for calendar quarter and quarter
since random assignment. Estimates of the Treatment-On-Treated Difference and the Control Complier Mean are computed as described in Table VI. Robust standard errors
adjusted for household clustering are reported in parentheses. Sample size is 540 individuals, and four quarters per individual (except row 3 in which two quarters are
available). Welfare data are from the Massachusetts Department of Transitional Assistance. Earnings data are from the Massachusetts Department of Revenue.
