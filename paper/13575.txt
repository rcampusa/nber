                                              ABSTRACT

This chapter for the Handbook of Law and Economics provides an economic perspective of environmental
law and policy. We examine the ends of environmental policy, that is, the setting of goals and targets,
beginning with normative issues, notably the Kaldor-Hicks criterion and the related method of assessment
known as benefit-cost analysis. We examine this analytical method in detail, including its theoretical
foundations and empirical methods of estimation of compliance costs and environmental benefits.
We review critiques of benefit-cost analysis, and examine alternative approaches to analyzing the
goals of environmental policies. We examine the means of environmental policy, that is, the choice
of specific policy instruments, beginning with an examination of potential criteria for assessing alternative
instruments, with particular focus on cost-effectiveness. The theoretical foundations and experiential
highlights of individual instruments are reviewed, including conventional, command-and-control mechanisms,
market-based instruments, and liability rules. Three cross-cutting issues receive attention: uncertainty;
technological change; and distributional considerations. We identify normative lessons in regard to
design, implementation, and the identification of new applications, and we examine positive issues:
the historical dominance of command-and-control; the prevalence in new proposals of tradeable permits
allocated without charge; and the relatively recent increase in attention given to market-based instruments.
We also examine the question of how environmental responsibility is and should be allocated among
the various levels of government. We provide a positive review of the responsibilities of Federal,
state, and local levels of government in the environmental realm, plus a normative assessment of this
allocation of regulatory responsibility. We focus on three arguments that have been made for Federal
environmental regulation: competition among political jurisdictions and the race to the bottom; transboundary
environmental problems; and public choice and systematic bias.

        An economic perspective can provide clarity regarding the causes and consequences of
environmental degradation, and thereby provide insights regarding public policies intended to
protect the environment. This is true both with regard to normative and positive assessments of
environmental policies. Despite this value, an economic perspective is by no means a perfect
substitute for other legitimate perspectives on environmental law and policy, whether from the
natural sciences, from ethics, or from other disciplines. Rather, an economic perspective is a
valuable complement to such views. Indeed, over the past several decades, as the attention given
to environmental issues in the United States has grown, greater consideration has also been given
to the efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and distributional equity of laws and regulations intended to
protect the environment.1

       In an effort to be rigorous in our review while keeping the treatment to reasonable length,
we have imposed limits on the scope of our coverage. First, we focus on pollution control, and do
not consider natural resource management, despite the fact that these two areas are closely related.
Second, we concentrate our attention on environmental protection efforts at the federal level in the
United States, and do not examine state, local, or international regulatory efforts.

        We begin with the core question of whether and why environmental regulation is needed,
considering the fact that under many conditions unconstrained markets produce socially desirable
outcomes. What about in the environmental sphere? Under what specific circumstances will
governmental intervention be appropriate? The fundamental theoretical argument for government
activity in the environmental realm is that pollution is a classic example of an externality — an
unintended consequence of market decisions, which affects individuals other than the decision
maker. Because firm-level decisions do not take into account full social costs, pollutant emissions

 We follow the standard definition of an efficient environmental policy as being one that involves a target – such as a
50 percent reduction in sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions – that maximizes the difference between social benefits and social
costs, i.e., a target level at which marginal benefits and marginal costs are equated. By cost-effective policies, we refer
to those that take (possibly inefficient) targets as given by the political process, but achieve those targets with policy
instruments – such as a tradeable permit system in the SO2 case – that minimize aggregate costs. Assessments of the
distributional implications of environmental policies include analyses of the incidence of costs and of benefits.

tend to be higher than socially efficient levels. As environmental quality is thus naturally under-
provided by competitive markets, a possible role arises for government regulation. The traditional
theoretical solution to the externality problem was long thought to be to force private actors to
“internalize” the full costs of their actions. The primary advocate of this view was Arthur Pigou,
who in The Economics of Welfare (1920) proposed that the government should impose a tax on
emissions equal to the cost of the related damages at the efficient level of control.

         A critical response to the Pigovian perspective was provided by Ronald Coase in his seminal
article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960). Coase made three key points. First, he argued that even
if A’s actions inflict harm on B, it is not the case that A’s actions should necessarily be restrained,
because A’s harm of B is really “a problem of a reciprocal nature” which arises because of the
simultaneous presence of two parties. For example, the problem of a factory that emits fumes that
harm a nearby laundry is not caused solely by the factory. Protecting the laundry by enjoining the
fumes would impose harm on the factory, just as protecting the factory by not enjoining its actions
would impose harm on the laundry.

        Second, Coase demonstrated that in a bargaining environment without transaction costs,
parties will reach socially desirable agreements; and third, that the overall amount of pollution will
be independent of the legal rules (assignment of property rights) chosen to structure their
relationship. For example, if the legal regime enjoined pollution, but the harm to the factory were
greater than the harm that the laundry would have suffered in the absence of such an injunction, the
parties will enter into a contract under which, in return for a payment, the laundry will agree not to
exercise its right to seek an injunction. Conversely, if the legal regime allows the pollution but the
resulting harm to the laundry is greater than the harm that the injunction would impose on the
factory, the parties will enter into a contract under which, again in return for a payment, the factory
would agree not to pollute. Thus, regardless of the initial legal rule, bargaining will produce two
results: (1) it will lead to the same amount of pollution; and (2) it will lead to the maximization of
social welfare. Of course, the choice of legal rules can determine which party makes payments and
which party receives them, a distributional concern, though not one of efficiency.

        These three points are jointly characterized as the Coase Theorem. The Theorem may be
said to hold if there are no transaction costs,2 no wealth or income effects,3 private rather than public
goods, and no third-party impacts (i.e., all affected parties participate in the negotiation). At least
some of these conditions are unlikely to hold in the case of most environmental problems. Hence,
private negotiation will not — in general — fully internalize environmental externalities. And when
market transactions — including Coasian bargaining — do not generate socially efficient allocations
of resources, government regulation may be necessary to improve environmental quality.

environmental quality when market transactions fail to generate socially efficient allocations of

resources, such regulation is by no means sufficient to improve welfare or even environmental
quality. This is because government regulation itself may not be efficient, that is, government may
under-regulate or over-regulate, and/or it may regulate in ways that require unnecessarily large costs
of compliance.4

        We continue in Section 2 of this chapter with an examination of the ends of environmental
policy, that is, the setting of goals and targets. We begin with an examination of normative issues,
notably the Kaldor-Hicks criterion and the related method of benefit-cost analysis. We examine this
analytical method in detail, including its theoretical foundations and various approaches to the
estimation of compliance costs and environmental benefits. We include a review of critiques of
benefit-cost analysis, and examine alternative approaches to analyzing the goals of environmental
policies. The section closes with a positive survey of the efforts of the Federal governmental to use
these analytical methods.

         In Section 3, we turn to the means of environmental policy, that is, the choice of specific
policy instruments. We begin with normative issues, and examine potential criteria for assessing
alternative instruments, with particular focus on cost-effectiveness. The theoretical foundations and
experiential highlights of individual instruments are reviewed, beginning with conventional,
command-and-control, and then turning to economic incentive or market-based instruments. In the
latter category, we consider pollution charges, tradeable permit systems, market friction reductions,
and government subsidy reductions. We also consider the role of liability rules. Three cross-cutting
issues merit particular attention: implications of uncertainty for instrument choice; effects of
instrument choice on technological change; and distributional considerations. From this review, we
identify a set of normative lessons in regard to design, implementation, and the identification of new
applications. The section closes with an examination of positive issues, including three phenomena
we seek to explain: the historical dominance of command-and-control; the prevalence in new
proposals of tradeable permits allocated without charge; and the relatively recent increase in
attention given to market-based instruments.

        In Section 4, we turn to the question of how environmental responsibility is and should be
allocated among the levels of government. We offer a positive review of the responsibilities of
Federal, state, and local levels of government in the environmental realm, plus a normative
assessment of this allocation of regulatory responsibility. We examine three arguments that have
been made for federal environmental regulation: competition among political jurisdictions and the
“race to the bottom;” transboundary environmental problems; and public choice problems. In
Section 5, we conclude.


    2. SETTING GOALS AND TARGETS: THE ENDS OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

       If it is deemed appropriate for government to become involved in environmental protection,
how intensive should that activity be? In real-world environmental policy, this question becomes
how stringent should our environmental goals and targets be? For example, should we cut back

 The public choice literature in economics suggests specific reasons for “government failure,” analogous to market
failure. See our application of the economic theory of politics in section 3.2, for example.

sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by 10 million tons, or would a 12 million ton reduction be better?
In general, how clean is clean enough? How safe is safe enough?

2.1 Normative Issues and Analysis

        Most economists would argue that economic efficiency — achieved when the difference
between benefits and costs is maximized — ought to be one of the fundamental criteria for
evaluating environmental protection efforts. Because society has limited resources to spend, benefit-
cost analysis can help illuminate the trade-offs involved in making different kinds of social
investments. In practice, there are significant challenges, in large part because of inherent
difficulties in measuring benefits and costs. In addition, concerns about fairness and process merit
consideration, because public policies inevitably involve winners and losers, even when aggregate
benefits exceed aggregate costs.

2.1.1 Criteria for Environmental Policy Evaluation

        More than 100 years ago, Vilfredo Pareto enunciated the well-known normative criterion for
judging whether a social change — possibly induced by public policy — makes the world better off:
a change is Pareto efficient if at least one person is made better off, and no one is made worse off
(1896). This criterion has considerable normative appeal, but virtually no public policies meet the
test of being true Pareto improvements, since there are inevitably some in society who are made
worse off by any conceivable change. Nearly fifty years later, Nicholas Kaldor (1939) and John
Hicks (1939) postulated a more pragmatic criterion that seeks to identify “potential Pareto
improvements:” a change is defined as welfare-improving if those who gain from the change could
— in principle — fully compensate the losers, with (at least) one gainer still being better off.

        The Kaldor-Hicks criterion — a test of whether total social benefits exceed total social costs
— is the theoretical foundation for the use of the analytical device known as benefit-cost (or net
present value) analysis. Neither the Pareto efficiency criterion nor the Kaldor-Hicks criterion calls
for support for any policy for which benefits are greater than costs. Rather, the key is to identify the
policy for which the positive difference between benefits and costs is greatest; otherwise it would
be possible to identify another policy that would represent a further (potential) Pareto improvement.

        If the objective is to maximize the difference between benefits and costs (net benefits), then
the related level of environmental protection (pollution abatement) is defined as the efficient level
of protection:

                                           N
                                 max
                                  { qi }
                                           ∑ [ B (q ) − C (q )]
                                           i =1
                                                  i   i       i   i   → qi*                              (1)


where qi is abatement by source i (i = 1 to N), Bi(·) is the benefit function for source i, Ci(·) is the cost
function for the source, and qi* is the efficient level of protection (pollution abatement). The key
necessary condition that emerges from the maximization problem of equation (1) is that marginal
benefits be equated with marginal costs.



                                                          4
        The Kaldor-Hicks criterion is clearly more practical than the strict Pareto criterion,5 but its
normative standing is less solid and has been attacked from various quarters. Although basic
economic (utility) theory posits that individual well-being is a function of the satisfaction of
individual preferences, this notion has been debated in other disciplines, including psychology and
philosophy.6 In addition, questions have been raised about whether social gains and losses can be
expressed through the simple aggregation of welfare changes of individuals. Some have argued that
other factors should be considered in a measure of social well-being, and that criteria such as
distributional equity should trump efficiency considerations in some collective decisions (Kelman
1981a; Sagoff 1993).7 Many economists do not disagree with this assertion, and indeed have noted
that the Kaldor-Hicks criterion should be considered neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition
for public policy (Arrow et al. 1996b).

         At the heart of the claim that the Kaldor-Hicks criterion lacks normative standing for public
decision making is the lack of any guarantee that compensation can or will be paid. Gains and losses
to individuals can be aggregated in a variety of ways, but the standard method of aggregation is a
simple sum, an approach that can be problematic if there is diminishing marginal utility of income
or individual utility is dependent on the overall societal distribution of income. Under such
conditions, policies can pass a potential Pareto improvement test, but decrease overall societal well-
being, or vice-versa. Thus, some of the debate may be understood as focusing on the compatibility
of the efficiency and distributional equity criteria.8 The general view from economics is that other
criteria in addition to efficiency can and should be employed by policy makers, but that the existence
of such criteria does not invalidate the efficiency criterion, which should remain part of social
decision-making (Arrow et al. 1996b; Kopp, Krupnick, and Toman 1997).9

        Many proposed and implemented environmental policies involve real trade-offs between
equity and efficiency, and both international and national policy bodies have demonstrated concern
for ensuring that groups such as low-income citizens, ethnic minorities, and future generations do




5
 If a proposal fails the (weaker) Kaldor-Hicks test, it cannot pass the Pareto test. Hence, at a minimum, the Kaldor-
Hicks criterion can be used to weed out the worst policies, that is, those that cannot make the world better off in the
Pareto efficiency sense.

See, for example, Scanlon (1991) for a philosophical critique, and Kopp (1993) for a response. More broadly, see
Adler and Posner (2001).
7
 For a contrasting view, see Kaplow and Shavell (2001, 2002a), who argue that any policy assessment that accords
importance to non-utility criteria violates the Pareto principle and, thus, is subject to powerful criticism. See the
discussion in section 3.1.3.3, below, of distributional considerations.

 Data limitations sometimes reduce the reliability of economic benefit estimates, thus reducing the efficacy of benefit-
cost analysis and the operational content of the efficiency criterion. Economics can still aid in decision making through
the cost-effectiveness criterion, where an environmental target is taken as given, and the least-cost means of achieving
that target are identified. We consider cost-effectiveness analysis later, in the context of normative analysis of policy
instrument choice.

not bear “disproportionate” shares of the costs of environmentally related actions.10 While it is
conceivable to combine the goals of equity and efficiency using a social welfare function to arrive
at a single metric (Bergson 1938; Jorgenson 1997), the information constraints and collective choice
caveats have been acknowledged (Arrow 1963; Sen 1970; Arrow 1977). The consensus, at least
within the realm of environmental policy, is that efficiency and equity ought to be evaluated
separately (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2000a), but there is no consensus on specific
criteria that might be used to rank alternatives from an equity perspective.11

         In recent years, there has been much debate among economists, and between economists and
nearly everyone else regarding the meaning of the frequently employed concept of “sustainability.”
Ecologists and many others outside the economics profession have taken sustainability to be the
unique and comprehensive criterion that can and should guide global development. In contrast,
economists have tended to define sustainability as being purely about intertemporal distribution, that
is, intergenerational equity.12 As such, most economists have viewed sustainability as no more than
one element of a desirable development path.

        A broader notion of sustainability, with considerable appeal outside of economics, combines
two components — dynamic efficiency and intergenerational equity (Stavins, Wagner, and Wagner
2003). Thus, a sustainable path is one that is both efficient and non-decreasing in utility over time.
Much as a potential Pareto-improvement in the Kaldor-Hicks sense can yield Pareto optimality when
combined with appropriate compensation of losers by winners, so too can dynamic efficiency lead
to the ambitious goal of sustainability when combined with appropriate intergenerational transfers.
The implication is that much as practical economic analyses often resort to seeking potential Pareto-
improvements (see the following section), so too might intertemporal economic analyses focus on
dynamic efficiency, leading to the possibility, at least, of sustainability.




10
 Executive Order 12898 (1994) provides a mandate for Federal agencies to make “environmental justice” part of their
missions by considering possible negative effects of proposed policies on minority and low-income populations
(Council on Environmental Quality 1997). In the international realm, as early as 1987, the Brundtland Commission
defined development as sustainable “when it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet theirs” (World Commission on Environment and Development 1987).
11
  In the intertemporal realm, Rawls’ (1971) cognitive device of a “veil of ignorance” is insightful, but not operational.
Farrow (1998) proposed a modified benefit-cost test for intergenerational equity that emphasized actual compensation
rather than potential improvement.
12
  For example, Arrow et al. (2004) make a clear distinction between “optimality,” defined as the maximized discounted
present value of future well being, and sustainability, defined as “the maintenance or improvement of well being over
time.” One exception is provided by Asheim, Buchholz and Tungodden (2001), who impose so-called efficiency and
equity axioms and show that if social preferences fulfill these two axioms, any optimal path will lead to an efficient and
non-decreasing path, thus implicitly including dynamic efficiency in the definition of sustainability. For a broader
discussion of sustainability and optimality, see Pezzey (1992) and Weitzman (2003), and for a review of the major issues
involved, see Pezzey and Toman (2001, 2002).

2.1.2 Benefit-Cost Analysis of Environmental Regulations

        While conceptually straightforward, the soundness of empirical benefit-cost analysis rests
upon the availability of reliable estimates of social benefits and costs,13 including estimates of the
social discount rate.

2.1.2.1 Discounting

        Decisions made today typically have impacts both now and in the future. In the
environmental realm, many of the future impacts are from policy-induced improvements, and so in
this context, future benefits (as well as costs) of policies are discounted (Goulder and Stavins 2002).
The present value of net benefits (PVNB) is defined as:

                                                   T

                                   PVNB =        ∑      {( B t − C t ) ⋅ (1 + r ) }
                                                                                   −t
                                                                                                                          (2)
                                                  t=0



where Bt are benefits at time t, Ct are costs at time t, r is the discount rate, and T is the terminal year
of the analysis. A positive PVNB means that the policy or project has the potential to yield a Pareto
improvement (meets the Kaldor-Hicks criterion).14 Thus, carrying out benefit-cost or “net present
value” (NPV) analysis requires discounting to translate future impacts into equivalent values that
can be compared. In essence, the Kaldor-Hicks criterion provides the rationale both for benefit-cost
analysis and for discounting.

        Choosing the discount rate to be employed in an analysis can be difficult, particularly where
impacts are spread across a large number of years involving more than a single generation.15 The
rate chosen can have a significant effect if there are large differences among policies in the timing
of benefits and costs. In general, benefits and costs should be discounted at the social discount rate
— the relative valuation placed by society on future consumption presently sacrificed. In theory,
the social discount rate could be derived by aggregating the individual time preference rates of all
parties affected by a policy. Under idealized conditions, the market interest rate would reflect the
marginal rate of time preference of individuals, but the presence of taxes, risk, liquidity constraints,



13
  Early volumes on benefit-cost analysis include those by Mishan (1976) and Stokey and Zeckhauser (1978); and a
recent text is by Boardman et al. (2001). One of the earliest applications to environmental and natural resource policy
was by Eckstein (1958).
14
  Neither benefit/cost ratios (dividing benefits by costs) nor internal rates of return (the interest rate that results in the
present value of benefits being equal to the present value of costs) provide satisfactory alternatives to the net present
value criterion, because — among other reasons — neither takes into account scale, and hence both can fail to make
proper comparisons among policies using the Kaldor-Hicks criterion. Benefit-cost ratios have the additional problem
that the ranking of projects is sensitive to the fundamentally arbitrary judgment of whether an environmental externality
is considered to be an increment to costs or a decrement to benefits.
15
 Useful surveys include Lind (1982) and Portney and Weyant (1999). An important distinction is whether a publically-
mandated policy or project calls for public or private spending. On the effects of this distinction on the choice of
discount rate, see, for example: Scheraga and Sussman (1998).

                                                              7
limited information, and other imperfections means that the social discount rate is not reflected by
any particular market rate (Newell and Pizer 2004).

        Alternatives to constant exponential discounting have received consideration. Evidence from
market behavior and from experimental economics indicates that individuals may employ lower
discount rates for impacts of larger magnitude, higher discount rates for gains than for losses, and
rates that decline with the time span being considered (Cropper, Aydede, and Portney 1994; Cropper
and Laibson 1999). In particular, there has been both empirical and theoretical support for the use
of hyperbolic discounting and similar approaches with declining discount rates over time (Ainslie
1991; Weitzman 1994, 1998), but most of these approaches suffer from the problem that they would
imply inconsistent decisions over time. Declining discount rates based on uncertainty in future rates,
however, need not suffer from the time-inconsistency problem (Newell and Pizer 2003a).

         The choice of discount rate can be particularly important in the case of environmental
problems with very long time horizons, such as global climate change, radioactive waste disposal,
groundwater pollution, and biodiversity preservation (Revesz 1999). Choosing an intergenerational
rate is difficult, because the preferences of future generations are unknowable, and ethical questions
arise about trading off the well-being of future generations. Approaches to intergenerational
discounting have been considered in two conceptual categories. One relies on a social planner
approach, which seeks to maximize the utilities of present and future generations, based on a social
welfare function (Lind 1995; Schelling 1995; Arrow et al. 1996a). A second approach is based on
the preferences of existing individuals, and assumes that one of the allocation decisions these
individuals must make is about the welfare of future generations (Shefrin and Thaler 1988; Cropper,
Aydede and Portney 1992; Rothenberg 1993; Schelling 1995).

         What discount rates are actually employed by government agencies? The general answer
is a “large range.” For many years, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) required the
use of a 7 percent real rate for Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs), despite the fact that this seems
high compared with advice from economists regarding the social discount rate, which would place
it in the range of 2 to 3 percent. Why did this persist? One possible rationale was that OMB
believed that agencies want their policies, programs, and projects to go forward, and so will tend to
exaggerate benefits relative to costs, and that OMB tried to counteract this effect by using a higher
discount rate.16 In any event, reforms put in place by OMB in September of 2003 included the use
of a 3 percent real discount rate for intragenerational analyses and lower, unspecified rates for
intergenerational contexts (U.S. Office of Management and Budget 2003).

         Several general principles are worth noting. First, it is generally appropriate to employ the
same discount rate for benefits and costs. Second, if private capital investments will be displaced
by public projects, this should be taken into account in estimates of future benefits and costs prior
to discounting. Third, estimates of future benefits and costs that may be uncertain or involve risk
should be adjusted accordingly (such as through the use of certainty-equivalents), but the discount
rate itself should not be changed to account for risk or uncertainty. Fourth, sensitivity analysis using
alternative discount rates should be carried out.


16
 This rationale assumes that the policies in question have the time profile of typical investments, that is, up-front costs
and delayed benefits.

                                                            8
2.1.2.2 Benefit Concepts and Taxonomies

        If an environmental change matters to any person — now or in the future — then it should,
in principle, show up in an economic assessment.17 Thus, the economic concept of environmental
benefits is considerably broader than most non-economists would think.18 The environment can be
viewed as a form of natural asset that provides service flows used by people in the production of
goods and services, such as agricultural output, human health, recreation, and more amorphous
goods such as quality of life. This effect is analogous to the manner in which real physical capital
assets provide service flows used in manufacturing. As with real physical capital, a deterioration
in the natural environment (as a productive asset) reduces the flow of services the environment is
capable of providing.

        Protecting the environment usually involves active employment of capital, labor, and other
scarce resources. Using these resources to protect the environment means they are not available to
be used for other purposes. Hence, the economic concept of the value or benefit of environmental
goods and services is couched in terms of society's willingness to make trade-offs between
competing uses of limited resources, and in terms of aggregating over individuals' willingness to
make these trade-offs. Thus, the benefits of an environmental policy are defined as the collection
of individuals’ willingness to pay (WTP) for the reduction or prevention of environmental damages
or individuals’ willingness to accept (WTA) compensation to tolerate such environmental damages.
In theory, which measure of value is appropriate for assessing a particular policy depends upon the
related assignment of property rights, the nature of the status quo, and whether the change being
measured is a gain or a loss, but under a variety of conditions, the difference between the two
measures may be expected to be relatively small (Willig 1976).19 Empirical evidence suggests larger
than expected differences between willingness to pay and willingness to accept (Cummings,
Brookshire and Schulze 1986; Fisher, McClelland and Schulze 1988). Theoretical explanations
include psychological aversion to loss and poor substitutes for environmental amenities. In
particular, Hanemann (1991) demonstrated that for quantity changes, the less perfect the substitutes
that are available for a public good, the greater the expected disparity between WTP and WTA.

       The benefits people derive from environmental protection are numerous and diverse. From
a biophysical perspective, such benefits can be categorized as being related to human health



17
 This reflects the anthropocentric view employed in economics, which does not include welfare incurred by other living
creatures, unless it (indirectly) affects humans. For a recent argument involving non-anthropocentric values, see
Ariansen (1998).
18
 For a summary of myths that non-economists seem to have regarding economics in the environmental realm, and a
set of responses thereto, see: Fullerton and Stavins (1998).
19
  The difference depends on the magnitude of the impact, as well as the related income elasticity of demand.
Consumers’ surplus, derived from the observed Marshallian demand curve, provides a close approximation for
equivalent and compensating variations (Willig 1976). Willig’s analysis is of price changes, but Randall and Stoll
(1980) showed that similar results hold for quantity changes. For reviews of empirical studies of willingness-to-pay
and willingness-to-accept measures, see: Horowitz and McConnell (2002, 2003). For examinations of the relationship
between Willig’s conditions and weak complementarity, see: Bockstael and McConnell (1993); Palmquist (2004): and
Smith and Banzhaf (2004).

(mortality and morbidity), ecological impacts (both market and non-market),20 or materials damage.
From an economic perspective, a critical distinction is between use value and non-use value. In
addition to the direct benefits (use value) people receive through protection of their health or through
use of a natural resource, people also derive passive or non-use value from environmental quality,
particularly in the ecological domain. For example, an individual may value a change in an
environmental good because she wants to preserve the option of consuming it in the future (option
value) or because she desires to preserve the good for her heirs (bequest value). Still other people
may envision no current or future use by themselves or their heirs, but still wish to protect the good
because they believe it should be protected or because they derive satisfaction from simply knowing
it exists (existence value).21

2.1.2.3 Cost Concepts and Taxonomies

         In the environment context, the economist's notion of cost, or more precisely, opportunity
cost, is a measure of the value of whatever must be sacrificed to prevent or reduce the risk of an
environmental impact. Hence, the costs of environmental policies are the forgone social benefits
due to employing scarce resources for environmental policy purposes, instead of putting those
resources to their next best use.22

        A taxonomy of environmental costs can be developed, beginning with the most obvious and
moving towards the least direct (Jaffe et al. 1995). First, many policy makers and much of the
general public identify the on-budget costs to government of administering (monitoring and
enforcing) environmental laws and regulations as the cost of environmental regulation. This meets
the notion of opportunity cost, since administering environmental rules involves the employment
of resources (labor and capital) that could otherwise be used elsewhere. But economic analysts also
include as costs the capital and operating expenditures associated with regulatory compliance.
Indeed, these typically represent a substantial portion of the overall costs of regulation, although a
considerable share of compliance costs for some regulations falls on governments rather than private
firms.23 Additional direct costs include legal and other transaction costs, the effects of refocused
management attention, and the possibility of disrupted production.


20
  It is important to distinguish between ecosystem functions (for example, photosynthesis) and the environmental
services produced by ecosystems that are valued by humans (Freeman 1997). The range of these services is great,
including obvious environmental products such as food and fiber, and services such as flood protection, but also
including the quality of recreational experiences, the aesthetics of the landscape, and such desires (for whatever reasons)
as the protection of marine mammals.
21
  Option value and existence value should not be thought of as being additive, since option value is defined from a
framework that holds expected utility constant; this is not the case with existence (and bequest) value. The
contemporary concept of non-use value relates to what was previously most often characterized as existence value. See:
Graham (1981); Bishop (1982); and Smith (1987).
22
 Costs and benefits are thus two sides of the same coin. The cost of an environmental-protection measure may be
defined as the gross decrease in benefits (consumer and producer surpluses) associated with the measure and with any
price and/or income changes that may result (Cropper and Oates 1992).
23
 One example in the United States is the federal regulation of contaminants in drinking water, the cost of which is borne
primarily by municipal governments.

                                                           10
        Next, there are what have sometimes been called “negative costs” of environmental
regulation, including the beneficial productivity impacts of a cleaner environment and the potential
innovation-stimulating effects of regulation.24 General equilibrium or multi-market effects
associated with discouraged investment25 and retarded innovation constitute another important layer
of costs, as do the transition costs of real-world economies responding over time to regulatory
changes.26

2.1.2.4 Cost Estimation Methods

        The merits of alternative empirical cost estimation methods are related to the magnitude of
the various categories of costs outlined above. Methods of direct compliance cost estimation, which
measure the costs to firms of purchasing and maintaining pollution-abatement equipment plus costs
to government of administering a policy, are acceptable when behavioral responses, transitional
costs, and indirect costs are small. Partial and general equilibrium analysis allow for the
incorporation of behavioral responses to changes in public policy. Partial equilibrium analysis of
compliance costs incorporates behavioral responses by modeling supply and/or demand in major
affected markets, but assumes that the effects of a regulation are confined to one or a few markets.
This may be satisfactory if the markets affected by the policy are small in relation to the overall
economy, but if an environmental policy is expected to have large consequences for the economy,
general equilibrium analysis is required.

        General equilibrium cost estimation methods include both input-output models and
computable general equilibrium models. Input-output analysis quantifies the flow of goods and
services in an economy using fixed-coefficient relationships (Leontief 1966, 1970), and is limited
in its usefulness by restrictive assumptions of constant returns to scale, fixed prices, and fixed
producer and consumer behavior. Computable general equilibrium (CGE) models relax these
assumptions at the cost of greater data requirements.27 The potential importance of tax-interaction
effects (Goulder, Perry, and Burtraw 1997), described below in Section 3.1.3.3, highlight the value
of employing CGE models for comprehensive cost analysis.

       How well have cost estimation methods performed in practice? In a retrospective
examination of 28 environmental and occupational safety regulations, Harrington, Morgenstern, and
Nelson (2000) found that fourteen had produced ex ante cost estimates that exceeded actual ex post




24
  The notion that environmental regulation can foster economic growth is a controversial one among economists. For
a debate on this proposition, see: Porter and van der Linde (1995); and Palmer, Oates, and Portney (1995).
25
 For example, if a firm chooses to close a plant because of a new regulation (rather than installing expensive control
equipment), this would be counted as zero cost in narrow compliance-cost estimates, but it is obviously a real cost.
26
  If a policy will result in only small changes in consumer and producer behavior, real resource and regulatory costs will
represent the bulk of costs. But when behavioral responses are expected to be sizeable, social welfare costs associated
with losses in consumer and producer surplus due to a rise in prices or a decrease in output can be significant.

 For a recent survey of computable general equilibrium models, see Conrad (2002), and for an application of CGE
modeling to estimate the costs of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts, see Hazilla and Kopp (1990).

costs.28 But these errors were mainly due to overestimates of the quantity of emissions reduction
that would occur. In terms of per-unit abatement costs, overestimation and underestimation were
equally common, although for regulations that used economic incentives, per-unit costs were
consistently overestimated. Harrington, Morgenstern, and Nelson (2000) attributed this to
technological innovation which was stimulated by these market-based instruments, and which
thereby reduced abatement costs.29

2.1.2.5 Benefit Estimation Methods

        Empirical methods of economic valuation were originally developed in the context of
changes in individuals’ incomes and in prices faced in the market. Over the past thirty years, these
methods have been extended to accommodate changes in the qualities of goods, to public goods that
are shared by individuals, and to other non-market services such as environmental quality and
human health.30 With markets, consumers’ decisions about how much of a good to purchase at
different prices reveal useful information regarding the surplus consumers gain. With non-market
environmental goods, it is necessary to infer this willingness to trade off other goods (or monetary
amounts) for environmental services using other methods. A repertoire of techniques has been
developed in two broad categories: revealed preference (indirect measurement) and stated
preference (direct questioning).

2.1.2.5.1 Revealed Preference Methods

         Whenever possible, it is preferable to measure trade-offs by observing actual decisions made
by consumers in real markets. In limited situations, researchers can observe relationships that exist
between a non-marketed, environmental good and some good that has a market price. In this case,
individuals' decisions to avert or mitigate the consequences of environmental deterioration can shed
light on how people value environmental quality (averting behavior estimates). In other cases,
individuals reveal their preferences for environmental goods in the housing market (hedonic
property value methods), or for related health risks in labor markets (hedonic wage methods). In
still other cases, individuals reveal their demand for recreational amenities through their decisions
to travel to specific locations (Hotelling-Clawson-Knetsch and related recreation-demand methods).
In addition, empirical evidence of environmental benefits may be obtained when individuals express
their willingness to pay for a privately-traded option to use a freely-available public good. This set
of
  revealed preference methods can be used to estimate the trade-offs that are at the heart of
environmental valuation, but — as explained below — the scope of potential application of these
methods is limited.

       The averting behavior method, in which values of willingness to pay are inferred from
observations of people’s behavioral responses to changes in environmental quality, is grounded in

28
  Three of the ex ante cost analysis were underestimates; the other eleven were approximately correct.

  On this, also see: Hammitt (2000).

 For an intellectual history of developments in this area, see Cropper (2000), and for a survey of theoretical
underpinnings and empirical issues associated with alternative benefit estimation methods, see Freeman (2003).

the household production function framework.31 People sometimes take actions to reduce the risk
(averting behavior) or lessen the impacts (mitigating behavior) of environmental damages, for
example, by purchasing water filters or bottled water. In theory, people’s perceptions of the cost
of averting behavior and its effectiveness should be measured (Cropper and Freeman 1991), but in
practice actual expenditures on averting and mitigating behaviors are typically employed, with the
results sometimes interpreted as constituting a lower bound on willingness to pay. Such an
interpretation, however, can be misleading (Shogren and Crocker 1991, 1999). An additional
challenge is posed by the necessity of disentangling attributes of the market good or service. For
example, bottled water may be safer, taste better, and be more convenient. In this case, willingness
to pay for safer water might be overestimated by an averting behavior approach. On the other hand,
since bicycle helmets are uncomfortable, expenditures on such equipment could lead to an
underestimate of willingness to pay for risk reduction.

        Hedonic pricing methods are founded on the proposition that people value goods in terms
of the bundles of attributes that constitute those goods. In theory, the value of the environmental
component of a particular good can be extracted by statistically decomposing the value of the total
good into willingness to pay for multiple attributes.32 In the environmental sphere, hedonic methods
have been applied to property values and to wages.

        Hedonic property value methods employ data on residential property values and home
characteristics, including structural, neighborhood, and environmental quality attributes.33 By
regressing the property value on key attributes, the hedonic price function is estimated:

                                             P = f ( x, z, e)                                                     (3)
                                                      
where P = housing price (includes land);
      x = vector of structural attributes;
      z = vector of neighborhood attributes; and
      e = environmental attribute of concern.



31
  See Becker (1965) for the early development of the household production method, and Bockstael and McConnell
(1983) for the conditions under which the benefits of a public good can be inferred from the demand function for a
related private, market good. Mäler’s (1985) theoretical explication builds upon a proposal by Ridker (1967). For an
early application to human health, see Grossman (1972), and for a complete theoretical exposition, see Courant and
Porter (1981).
32
  The hedonic pricing method was originated by Waugh (1928), but it was Court (1939) who developed the method
using multiple regression techniques. Hedonic pricing was revived and further developed econometrically by Griliches
(1961). Most applications in the environmental realm stem from Rosen (1974). For an examination of the conditions
under which the results from the hedonic price function can be used for benefit estimation, see: Bartik (1988a). More
recent treatments include those by Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2002, 2004), which reflect on the identification
issues originally addressed by Brown and Rosen (1982). Surveys are provided by Palmquist (1991) and Taylor (2003).

(1987); and Palmquist (2005).

        From the estimated hedonic price function of equation (3), the marginal implicit price of any
attribute, including environmental quality, can be calculated as the partial derivative of the housing
price with respect to the given attribute:

                                      ∂P        ∂ f (⋅)
                                            =             = Pe                                       (4)
                                      ∂e          ∂e

        This marginal implicit price, Pe, measures the aggregate marginal willingness to pay for the
attribute in question, and it may be interesting in and of itself. For purposes of benefit estimation,
however, the demand function for the attribute is required, and so it becomes necessary to examine
how the marginal implicit price of the environmental attribute calculated from equation (4) varies
with changes in the quantity of the attribute and other relevant variables. If the hedonic price
equation (3) is non-linear, then fitted values of Pe can be calculated as e is varied, and a second-stage
equation can be estimated:

                                           ^
                                           Pe = g ( e, y )                                           (5)
                                                       
         ^
where    Pe = the fitted value of the marginal implicit price of e from the first-stage equation; and
         y = a vector of factors that affect marginal willingness to pay for e, including buyer
         
                characteristics.

Equation (5), above, has been interpreted as the demand function for the environmental attribute —
from which benefits (consumers surplus) can be estimated in the ususal way — but there are several
important issues and problems.

        Most important among the problems confronting the use of the hedonic property method for
environmental benefit estimation is the question of whether a demand function has actually been
estimated, since environmental quality may affect both the demand for housing and the supply of
housing. Thus, the classic identification problem of econometrics arises. In addition, hedonic
property value methods build upon a model of the housing market that is in equilibrium for all
attributes, with buyers and sellers having full information. Informational asymmetries may distort
the analysis, particularly if perceptions about environmental attributes are different from scientific
measurements of these values. That is, if individuals’ perceptions of environmental attributes do
not correspond to actual measurement of attributes, then estimated marginal implicit prices will be
biased (possibly upward, possibly downward, depending upon the nature of perceptions).

       Because the hedonic property method is based on analysis of marginal changes, it should not
be applied to analysis of policies with large anticipated effects, and because the method’s data
requirements are considerable, omitted variable bias may be a problem. Finally, although the
method seems very well suited for some environmental attributes, including noise abatement and
proximity to waste sites, many other environmental amenities do not lend themselves to this type
of analysis.



                                                   14
        A related benefit-estimation method frequently employed in the environmental policy
domain is the hedonic wage method, which is based on the empirical reality that individuals in well
functioning labor markets make trade-offs between wages and risk of on-the-job injuries (or death).
In a hedonic context, a job is a bundle of characteristics, including its wage, responsibilities, and
risk, among others factors.34 Two jobs that require the same skill level but have different risks of
on-the-job mortality will pay different wages. On the labor supply side, employees tend to require
extra compensation to accept jobs with greater risks; and on the labor demand side, employers are
willing to offer higher wages to attract workers to riskier jobs. Hence, labor market data on wages
and job characteristics can be used to estimate econometrically people’s marginal implicit price of
risk, that is, their valuation of risk. By regressing the wage on key attributes, the hedonic price
function is estimated:

                                                W = h ( x, r )                                               (6)
                                                        
where W = wage (in annual terms);
      x = vector of worker and job characteristics; and
      r = mortality risk of job.

       The marginal implicit price of risk is calculated as the partial derivative of the annual wage
with respect to the measured mortality risk:

                                          ∂W          ∂ h (⋅)
                                                  =             = Wr                                          (7)
                                           ∂r          ∂r

Note that the marginal implicit price of risk is the average annual income necessary to compensate
a worker for a marginal change in risk throughout the year. This marginal implicit price varies with
the level of risk.

         Many of the issues that arise with the hedonic property value method have parallels here.
First, there is the possibility of simultaneity: causality between risk and wages can run in both
directions. For example, higher ambient air pollution might lead to higher compensating wages, but
higher wages and incomes in an area may lead to more automobiles and hence more air pollution.
Also, if individuals’ perceptions of risk do not correspond with actual risks, then the marginal
implicit price of risk calculated from a hedonic wage study will be biased, although, as before, the
direction of the bias is not obvious. Imperfections in labor markets (less than perfect mobility) can
cause problems, but more important are the significant data requirements that can lead to omitted
variable bias.35




34
  For a detailed treatment of the hedonic wage model, see Viscusi (1992, 1993).
35
 If individuals change jobs and homes simultaneously — not an unreasonable expectation in some cases — then the
observed marginal willingness to pay will reflect both the labor and property markets. On this, see: Rosen (1979);
Roback (1982); and Bartik and Smith (1987).

                                                        15
        Direct applications of the method in the environmental realm would appear to be severely
limited. Indeed, direct application is limited to occupational, as opposed to environmental exposures
and risks. Yet hedonic wage methods are of considerable importance in the environmental policy
realm, because the results from hedonic wage studies have frequently been used through “benefit
transfer” to infer the value of a statistical life (VSL), as we discuss below in section 2.1.2.5.5.

        Recreational activities represent a potentially large class of benefits that are particularly
important in assessing policies affecting the use of public lands. The models used to estimate
recreation demand fall within the class of household production models, discussed above. First,
travel cost models (or Hotelling-Clawson-Knetsch models) use information about time and money
spent visiting a site to infer the value of that recreational resource. The simplest version of the
method involves one site and uses data from surveys of users from various geographic origins,
together with estimates of the cost of travel and opportunity cost of time to infer a demand function
relating the number of trips to the site as a function of people’s willingness to pay for the
experience.36

        The most significant limitation of the simplest travel-cost model is the omission of potential
substitute sites. Although one obvious approach is to include the price (travel and opportunity cost)
of substitute sites as additional independent variables, better approaches involve multi-site travel
cost models or the use of random utility models. Random utility models explicitly model the
consumer’s decision to choose a particular site from alternative recreation locations, assessing the
probability of visiting each location. The most important attribute of random utility models is that
they can be used to value changes in environmental quality by comparing decisions to visit
alternative sites.37

         All recreation demand models share a set of limitations. First, the valuation of costs depends
critically on empirical estimates of the opportunity cost of (leisure) time, which is notoriously
difficult to estimate. Also, most trips to a recreation site are part of a multi-purpose experience. If
this is ignored, willingness to pay will be over-estimated. In addition, random utility models rely
on people’s perceptions of environmental quality changes, and so changes that are difficult to
observe may be valued “incorrectly.” Finally, like all revealed-preference approaches, recreation
demand models can be used to estimate use value only; non-use value cannot be examined.38

         An alternative approach to assessing people’s willingness to pay for recreational experiences
is to draw on evidence from private options to use public goods. This approach also fits within the
household production framework, and is based upon the notion of estimating the derived demand


36
 The conceptual approach was proposed by Harold Hotelling in a 1954 letter to the Director of the U.S. National Park
Service, and the method was subsequently developed and applied by Davis (1963) and Clawson and Knetsch (1966).
For a survey of travel cost models, see Bockstael (1996); and for a recent survey of recreation demand models, see
Phaneuf and Smith (2005).

 On the possibility of using corner-solution models of recreational behavior to estimate non-use values (employing
important assumptions along the way), see: Herriges, Kling, and Phaneuf (2004).

for a privately traded option to utilize a freely-available public good. In particular, the demand for
state fishing licenses has been used to infer the benefits of recreational fishing (Snyder, Stavins, and
Wagner 2003). Using panel data on state fishing license sales and prices for the continental United
States over a fifteen-year period, combined with data on substitute prices and demographic variables,
a license demand function was estimated, from which the expected benefits of a recreational fishing
day were derived.

        In summary, revealed-preference methods of environmental benefit estimation are based
upon sound theoretical foundations and can be empirically effective. If well executed, these
methods can produce relatively accurate (that is, unbiased) and relatively precise (that is, low
variance) estimates. These approaches are therefore strongly favored by economists, both on
theoretical and empirical grounds. But revealed preference methods are severely limited in the
scope of their direct applicability. In many situations, it is simply not possible to observe behavior
that reveals people’s valuations of changes in environmental goods and services. This is particularly
true with non-use values. With no standard market trade-offs to observe, economists must resort to
surveys in which they construct hypothetical markets, employing stated preference, as opposed to
revealed preference methods.

2.1.2.5.2 Stated Preference Methods

        In the best known stated preference method, contingent valuation, survey respondents are
presented with scenarios that require them to trade-off, hypothetically, something for a change in
the environmental good or service in question. Stated preference methods depend on directly
questioning individuals about their valuation of changes in environmental quality. While
controversial because of the potential for biased answers, based on intentions rather than actions,
stated preference methods are the only way to estimate non-use values for environmental goods.

         Contingent valuation (CV) presents survey subjects with a hypothetical increase or decrease
in environmental quality and asks how much they would be willing to pay or accept to enact or
prevent such changes. The essential steps in carrying out a CV study are: clearly defining the good
or service and the policy-induced change in the good or service to be valued; identifying the
geographical scope of the “market;” conducting focus groups on components of the survey;
pretesting the survey instrument; administering the survey to a random sample of the market; testing
the results for reliability (bias) and validity (theoretical correspondence); and possibly using the
elicited willingness-to-pay data for various quantities of the good/service to construct a demand
function, and estimate benefits.39

       The CV survey instrument itself is used to: collect information on the consumer’s past,
present, and expected future use of the environmental good (or service); collect information on the
respondent’s socioeconomic characteristics; present a hypothetical scenario describing a change in
the good to be valued; present a specific hypothetical payment vehicle, which is both plausible and
understandable (examples include taxes, user fees, and product prices); and elicit the respondent’s
willingness to pay, reminding the respondent of the existence of substitutes.


39
 For a comprehensive treatment of contingent valuation methods, see Mitchell and Carson (1989). For more recent
surveys, see: Brown (2003); and Boyle (2003).

                                                      17
         Elicitation methods have been of four principal types. First, the simplest approach is to ask
people for their maximum willingness to pay, but there are few real markets in which individuals
are actually asked to generate their reservation prices, and so this method is considered unreliable.
Second, in a bidding game, the researcher begins by stating a willingness-to-pay number, asks for
a yes-no response, and then increases or decreases the amount until indifference is achieved. The
problem with this approach is the inevitable introduction of significant starting-point bias. Third,
a related approach is the use of a payment card to be shown to the respondent, but the problem here
is that the range of WTP on the card may still introduce bias, and the approach cannot be used with
telephone surveys. Fourth and finally, the referendum (discrete choice) approach is favored by
researchers. Here, each respondent is offered a different WTP number, to which a simple yes-no
response is solicited. This approach minimizes bias, but requires considerably more observations.

         The primary advantage of contingent valuation is that it can be applied to a wide range of
situations, including use as well as non-use value, but potential problems remain. First, respondents
may not understand what they are being asked to value. This may introduce greater variance, if not
bias in responses. Likewise, respondents may not take the hypothetical market seriously, because
no budget constraint is actually imposed. This can increase variance and bias. On the other hand,
if the scenario is “too realistic,” strategic bias may be expected to show up in responses. Finally,
the “warm glow effect” may plague some stated preference surveys: people may purchase moral
satisfaction with large, but unreal statements of their willingness-to-pay (Andreoni 1995). For
example, in one CV study, it was found that 63 percent of respondents indicated they were willing
to pay $30 to a specific leading Norwegian environmental organization to protect resources. But
when the same organization followed up with mail solicitations to the same sample, fewer than 10
percent of the original respondents contributed anything (Seip and Strand 1992).

         The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound off the coast of Alaska led to
massive litigation, and — as a consequence — resulted in the most prominent use ever of the
concept of non-use value and the method of contingent valuation for its estimation.40 The result was
a symposium sponsored by Exxon attacking the CV method (Hausman 1993), and the creation of
a government panel — established by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA) and chaired by two Nobel laureates in economics — to assess the scientific validity of the
CV method (Arrow et al. 1993). The NOAA panel concluded that “CV studies can produce
estimates reliable enough to be the starting point of a judicial process of damage assessment,
including lost passive (non-use) values” (Arrow et al. 1993, p. 4610). The panel offered its approval
of CV methods subject to a set of best-practice guidelines. Since that time, economists have
continued to seek ways to improve CV methods and to verify reliability through: replication of CV
results; comparison of CV results with other estimates (Hanemann 1994); and — where possible —
comparison of CV results with actual behavior. Nevertheless, some economists remain highly
skeptical of this method.41


40
 The CV study carried out to estimate non-use value lost as a result of the Exxon Valdez oil spill was eventually
published (Carson et al. 2003).
41
  See Portney (1994) for an overview of the debate, Diamond and Hausman (1994) for a skeptical view, and Hanemann
(1994) for a defense of CV methods. More recent contributions include: Carson, Flores, and Hanemann (1998);
Cameron et al. (2002); and Champ, Boyle, and Brown (2003).

2.1.2.5.3 Fallacious Methods of “Benefit Estimation”

        It is important to distinguish the averting behavior method, described above, from so-called
“avoided-cost measures of benefits” in general, which are attempts to substitute for real measures
of benefits the cost of the next most costly means of achieving some goal. Unless individuals have
demonstrated their willingness to undertake voluntarily the alternative activities — as in the case
of averting behavior methods — using costs as proxies for benefits is illegitimate; it simply converts
what would be a benefit-cost comparison into a cost-cost (that is, cost-effectiveness) comparison.
By applying “avoided-cost measures of benefits,” any proposed project can be made to appear
desirable. By taking the next most costly approach of achieving an objective and calling that the
project’s benefits, one will always find that “benefits” — so measured — exceed costs.

        Related to attempts to substitute costs for true measure of benefits is the so-called “societal
revealed preference” (SRP) approach, whereby analysts seek to infer the benefits of a proposed
policy from the costs of previous regulatory actions. Of course, true revealed preference benefit
estimation methods require that individuals or groups voluntarily undertake actions and pay the costs
of undertaking those actions. The SRP method fails this test. Only if the previous regulation itself
passed a benefit-cost test could the costs of that regulation possibly be assumed to have any
particular relation to its benefits. The SRP method is not a revealed-preference method, and indeed
is not a benefit-estimation method at all, but — at most — a cost-effectiveness comparison. The
purpose of a benefit-cost analysis is to assess policies by contrasting their benefits and their costs;
the SRP approach reverses this, taking the fact that a policy exists as evidence that its benefits
exceed its costs (and therefore that its benefits can be proxied by its costs, at a minimum). The use
of such approaches would stand the very process of regulatory impact analysis on its head.

        Finally, an approach frequently used by government agencies and others in attempts to value
changes in morbidity (non-fatal health effects) is the so-called cost of illness method (U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency 2002). This approach does not provide a theoretically correct
measure of willingness to pay or willingness to accept, but instead measures explicit market costs
resulting from changes in the incidence of illness. Direct and indirect medical costs are included,
where direct costs refer to diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation, and indirect costs refer to the loss
of productivity attributable to illness. “Pain and suffering” and averting behavior are not included.
Cost-of-illness estimates have therefore been interpreted as providing a lower bound on willingness
to pay (Harrington and Portney 1987), but this may not be the case because the reality of individuals
passing costs on to third parties (insurers, hospitals, and employers) means that costs incurred may
overstate true individual willingness to pay.

2.1.2.5.4 Benefit Transfer

        Because of the considerable time and cost of both revealed-preference and stated-preference
valuation methods, government agencies — including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
— frequently rely on the transfer of existing estimates from previous research (the “study case”) to
new contexts (the “policy case”). Such benefit-transfers are very inexpensive compared with
original research, but the estimates are far less accurate and reliable, and inevitably introduce
arbitrary elements of judgment into the analysis.



                                                   19
        Three principal benefit transfer methods have been employed. First, point estimates involve
the simple adoption of a benefit number from a previous study. This approach is generally
considered unacceptable. Second, a benefit function may be adopted from the study case, plus
values of exogenous variables from the policy case; then benefits can be estimated. Third, if such
benefit functions are not available from previous research, a meta-analysis may be carried out,
combining values from a variety of previous studies, estimating a statistical relationship of the
factors affecting benefits, and then employing values of exogenous variable from the policy case in
order to estimate (the fitted value of) benefits (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1993, 2000a).

        Two major criteria are useful for judging benefit-transfer exercises (Desvousges, Johnson
and Banzhaf 1998). The first criterion is soundness — was the study-case analysis itself of
sufficient quality? The second criterion is similarity. The basic commodities analyzed in the study
case and the policy case should be essentially equivalent; the baselines and the degrees of change
in the environmental good or service should be similar; and the affected populations should be
similar. This is particularly challenging in the natural resources context, because values tend to be
highly dependent upon location, suggesting the infeasibility of meeting the similarity condition
(Rosenberger and Loomis 2003).

2.1.2.5.5 Valuing Mortality Risk Reductions

        How much would individuals sacrifice to achieve a small reduction in the probability of
death during a given period of time? How much compensation would individuals require to accept
a small increase in that probability? These are reasonable economic questions, given the fact that
most environmental regulatory programs result in small changes in individuals’ mortality risks.
Empirical methods, considered above, including hedonic wages studies, averted behavior, and
contingent valuation, can provide estimates of marginal willingness to pay or willingness to accept
for small changes in mortality risk. For purposes of benefit transfer, such estimates have been
normalized into measures of the “value of a statistical life” (VSL).42

      The VSL is not the value of an individual life — neither in ethical terms, nor in technical,
economic terms. Rather it is simply a convention:43

                                  MWTP or MWTA ( from hedonic wage or CV )
                        VSL =                                                                                       (8)
                                                  Small Risk Change




42
  For comprehensive surveys of the VSL literature, see: Fisher, Chestnut and Violette (1989), Miller (1989), and Viscusi
(1993).
43
 The “convention” is to express the marginal willingness to pay for a small reduction in mortality risk or marginal
willingness to accept compensation for a small increase in mortality risk, normalized for a risk change of 1.0. It is
critical to understand that the convention could just as easily be for a risk change of one in a million. Indeed, if that
were the convention, the usefulness of the device for benefit analysis would not be affected in the least, the unfortunate
and misleading name of “value of a statistical life” would be avoided, and much of the ensuing controversy might not
have arisen. Unfortunately, we are stuck with the normalization and the name, or at least the abbreviation, VSL.

                                                           20
where MWTP and MWTA, respectively, refer to marginal willingness to pay and marginal
willingness to accept. For example, if people are willing, on average, to pay $12 for a risk reduction
from 5 in 500,000 to 4 in 500,000, equation (8) would yield:

                                                 $12
                                    VSL =                 = $6, 000, 000                                        (9)
                                              0.000002

Thus, VSL quantifies the aggregate amount that a group of individuals are willing to pay for small
reductions in risk, standardized (extrapolated) for a risk change of 1.0.44 It is not the economic value
of an individual life. The VSL calculation above does not signify that an individual would pay $6
million to avoid (certain) death this year, or accept (certain) death this year in exchange for $6
million. It does imply that 100,000 similar people would together pay $6 million to eliminate the
risk that is expected to kill one of them randomly this year.45

        There has been considerable debate regarding whether and how VSLs should be adjusted for
risk characteristics, including the latency periods of pre-mortality illness, the dread associated with
some forms of mortality, and the difference between voluntary and involuntary risk. Discounting
has been the usual way of handling any latency period prior to mortality, but this may oversimplify
how individuals value future impacts (Horowitz and Carson 1990; Rowlatt et al. 1998).46 The dread
and pain associated with some forms of mortality is clearly relevant, but is properly considered as
a morbidity, not a mortality, effect. Since VSLs draw largely upon hedonic wage studies (see
above), they reflect valuations of voluntary risk, but their application to environmental policy
assessment is related to involuntary risk.

         It is also reasonable to ask whether VSLs should be adjusted for population characteristics.
Although there is consistent evidence that mortality risk valuation and income (wealth) are highly
correlated, evidence on correlation of valuations and health status is mixed.47 Perhaps most
important, it is expected that people’s willingness to pay for small changes in risk varies over the
course of their lives. But the relationship between age and risk valuation is complicated. Standard
economic theory would suggest that younger people would have higher values for risk reduction
because they have a longer expected life remaining before them and thus a higher expected lifetime
utility (Moore and Viscusi 1988, Cropper and Sussman 1990). On the other hand, some models and
empirical evidence suggest that older people may in fact have a higher demand for reducing
mortality risks than younger people, and that the value of a life may follow an “inverted-U” shape


44
  The first formal development of the concept of willingness to pay for mortality risk reductions was by Jones-Lee
(1974).
45
  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency employs a VSL of $6.2 million in Regulatory Impact Analyses. This is
the average of 26 (21 hedonic wage and 5 CV) studies upon which EPA draws for its calculation (U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency 2000a).
46
  Revesz (1999) argues that discounting is ethically unjustified when considering harm to future generations. Cropper
and Sussman 1990 identify an alternate method that is more theoretically sound than simple discount rates, but data-
intensive. Slovic (1987) provides a review of risk perception issues.
47
  See, for example, Desvousges et al. 1996.

                                                        21
over the life-cycle, with its peak during mid-life (Shepard and Zeckhauser 1982; Jones-Lee,
Hammerton and Philips 1985; Ehrlich and Chuma 1990; Krupnick et al. 2002; Mrozek and Taylor
2002; Viscusi and Aldy 2003; Alberini et al. 2004).

        Valuations of non-fatal health effects (morbidity) are also required for many benefit-cost
analyses in the environmental realm. The theoretically appropriate measure is aggregate
willingness-to-pay to reduce the risk of a given health effect, but — as indicated above — cost-of-
illness measurements have been used in administrative and judicial contexts when better estimates
were not available. Measuring morbidity effects can be more difficult than estimating mortality
impacts because of variations in health endpoints.48

2.1.2.6 Critiques of Benefit-Cost Analysis

        In addition to criticism (discussed above in section 2.1.1) of the Kaldor-Hicks criterion as
a decision rule, there has been considerable criticism of the use of benefit-cost analysis in the
environmental realm, both on conceptual and empirical grounds.49 The most common conceptual
objection to benefit-cost analysis from non-economists is that monetary estimates of environmental
quality are impossible and/or unethical. Some have argued that the environment has an intrinsic
value that cannot be quantified numerically, or that attaching a monetary value to environmental
quality is ethically wrong because environmental quality should be treated as a basic right that must
be protected, regardless of whether the benefits outweigh the costs (Kelman 1981a). Of course,
economic value has a very specific definition: it is a measure of those things that people would be
willing to give up to have environmental quality, whether or not it is traded in markets. The
implementation of all rights, including those held to be fundamental, requires real resources and
imposes real costs. Adding information to the process through benefit-cost analysis can serve to
improve decision-making.50

         More recently, some critics have questioned the empirical methods used for valuing marginal
willingness to pay to avoid and willingness to accept compensation to endure incremental changes
in risk of mortality (and morbidity). Unfortunately, some of the most prominent critiques have been
premised upon fundamental misunderstanding of those same theories and empirical methods, and
have been based upon misleading straw-man caricatures of the positions of economists (Heinzerling
1998; Ackerman and Heinzerling 2002).

       In this context, although formal benefit-cost analysis should not be viewed as either
necessary or sufficient for designing sensible public policy, it can provide an exceptionally useful


48
 For general references concerned with valuing morbidity, including published estimates of the valuation of many
specific effects, see: Tolley, Kenkel and Fabian (1994), Johansson (1995), Cropper (2000), and U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (2000b, 2002).
49
  See Adler and Posner (2001) for a collection of critiques of benefit-cost analysis and responses to the critiques. Sen
(2000) provides a detailed discussion of the full set of conceptual assumptions required for benefit-cost analysis. Also
see Kaplow and Shavell (2002a) and the discussion in section 3.1.3.3, below.
50
 A brief and pragmatic defense of the use of benefit-cost analysis is provided by Arrow et al. 1996b. Replies to
Kelman’s (1981a) critique are provided by DeLong (1981) and Solow (1981).

                                                          22
framework for consistently organizing disparate information, and in this way, it can greatly improve
the process and hence the outcome of policy analysis (Arrow et al. 1996b). Economists share
concerns about the empirical reliability of benefit-cost estimation methods in specific applications,
as highlighted throughout our discussion above. More broadly, economists recognize that while
benefit-cost analysis can be very helpful to decision makers, it ought to be considered as an aid to
decision makers, not a substitute for decision making.

2.1.3 Other Approaches to Analyzing the Goals of Environmental Policies

         Decision-makers and scholars have proposed other evaluation criteria with which
environmental policies might be assessed. One approach, reflected in prevailing interpretations of
the Clean Air Act and some other environmental laws, has been to claim to rely solely on
biophysical (that is, natural science) information to identify policies that eliminate environmental
risks altogether or reduce them to levels deemed acceptable. The Clean Air Act, for example, has
been construed to adopt this approach, directing EPA to set its ambient air quality standards at levels
that will protect public health with an adequate margin of safety (see section 2.2.2, below). Some
legal scholars have defended this view (Heinzerling 2001), but since many environmental pollutants
fail to exhibit clear thresholds below which they pose no health effects, such an approach is
unworkable as a normative basis for setting environmental standards. More fundamentally, natural
science alone cannot provide a normative basis for setting environmental standards (Coglianese and
Marchant 2004), despite the fact that input from the natural sciences is necessary for implementing
economic or most other criteria.

         Another problem with a simple risk-elimination approach is that environmental policies can
increase certain risks at the same time as they reduce other risks. This motivated the development
of risk-risk analysis (Lave 1981), in which health outcomes of alternative policies are calculated and
presented directly, without monetary valuation. An important aspect of the analysis is taking into
account both the positive, intended effects on health of the policy under consideration and the
negative effects that the policy may bring about. Thus, the analysis compares risk reductions caused
by a policy with risks created by the policy. For example, a policy that requires power plants to
install pollution abatement equipment may reduce the risk of illness due to environmental pollutants,
but increase the risk of on the job injury because of construction needed to meet the standards (Lave
1981).

         Clearly risk-risk analysis cannot be used to ascertain whether a policy fulfills the efficiency
criteria, because the only costs counted are other health risks; the real resource costs and opportunity
costs of implementing the program are ignored. Furthermore, without a common numeraire, policy-
makers have no clear standard for comparing different types of health impacts, and so policies
cannot be ranked.51 It has been argued that risk-risk analysis is also flawed because it focuses on
negative secondary effects of regulation (ancillary risks), ignoring ancillary benefits (Rascoff and
Revesz 2002). Risk-risk analysis has seen only limited use.

       Health-health analysis goes one step further by attempting to quantify resource and
opportunity costs, premised on the notion that spending for regulatory programs diverts resources


51
  See Viscusi, Magat and Huber (1991), and Graham and Wiener (1995).

                                                     23
from individuals, causing them to spend less on safety and healthcare, and thereby increasing their
morbidity and/or mortality risks.52 Thus, the public health benefits of a program are contrasted with
the negative health effects of the program. A common accounting unit is required, typically the
number of fatalities. Health-health analysis provides a measure of “net benefits” (lives saved), but
this analytical method suffers from a number of severe limitations (Portney and Stavins 1994): it
does not include other benefits besides saved fatalities; the relatively small cost of environmental
regulation as a percentage of individual budgets means that there may be no observable effects on
individual health expenditures; and accurate analysis depends on the difficult task of estimating the
complex empirical relationship between marginal income changes and health risks.

        Distributional analysis provides another approach to analyzing the goals of environmental
policies in economic terms. Benefit-cost analysis focuses exclusively on aggregate net benefits, and
does not take into account the distributional consequences of policies. Distributional issues arise,
however, on both the benefit and cost sides of the ledger, and appear along a number of dimensions,
including: cross-sectional (such as geographic, income, race, sector, and firm characteristics) and
intertemporal (such as seasonal, annual, long term, and inter-generational). Distributional equity
may be an important societal consideration, particularly in regard to impacts on people of different
incomes, and two possible approaches to this issue deserve mention: distributionally weighted
benefit-cost analysis and separate distributional analyses.

        It is at least theoretically possible to incorporate distributional considerations into benefit-
cost analysis by using a system of distributional weights,53 whereby greater attention is given in the
analysis to the dollars received or expended by various groups in a benefit-cost analysis. This
requires the specification of a set of weights, and there is neither a theoretical nor a political
consensus on an appropriate set of weights.54 Most economists, however, do not advocate
attempting to incorporate distributional considerations into benefit-cost analysis (such as via
distributional weights), but recommend using separate distributional analysis as a supplement to
standard benefit-cost analysis.55 Such distributional analysis can examine impacts on sub-groups
of the population, as well as on the national distribution of income or wealth. Sub-populations that
are frequently considered in policy contexts include economic sectors, government, consumers, the
elderly, and children. Distributional analysis may also report on potential changes in profitability
of firms, changes in employment, plant closures, changes in government revenues, and industry
competitiveness.



52
 Wildavsky (1980) was one of the first to describe the relationship between regulation and increased morbidity or
mortality due to loss of disposable income. For empirical analysis, see Keeney (1990, 1997). Lutter and Morrall (1994)
provide a theoretical development and a review of the literature. Hahn, Lutter, and Viscusi (2000) provide an empirical
evaluation of several regulations using health-health analysis.
53
  For an early treatment of the difficulty of using distributional weights to compare allocations, see Harberger (1978).
54
 Some analyses have used weights based on political behavior such as tax rates. This method was suggested by
Eckstein (1961). Applications include Haveman (1965) and Nwaneri (1970).
55
  Examples of applications of distributional analysis to toxic waste contamination include Hird (1993), and Coates, Heid
and Munger (1994), and to air pollution include Gianessi, Peskin and Wolff (1979) and Bingham, Anderson and Cooley
(1987).

2.2 Positive Issues and Analysis

       Given the welfare improvements that employment of the efficiency criterion and the related
assessment method of benefit-cost analysis could presumably bring to environmental policy, it is
reasonable to ask what the reception has been within the three branches of the federal government
— executive, legislative, and judicial — to the use of these analytical tools.

2.2.1 Executive Orders

        At the dawn of the modern environmental movement during the Nixon Administration in the
1970s, the Federal government “placed a high premium on immediate responses to long-neglected
problems; emphasized the existence of problems rather than their magnitude; and often based its
judgments on moral indignation directed at the behavior of those who created pollution and other
risks to safety and health” (Sunstein 2002). But, subsequently Presidents Carter, Reagan, Bush,
Clinton, and Bush all introduced formal processes for reviewing economic implications of major
environmental, health, and safety regulations, using Regulatory Impact Analysis. Apparently the
Executive Branch, charged with designing and implementing regulations, has seen considerable need
to develop a yardstick against which the efficiency of regulatory proposals can be assessed, and
benefit-cost analysis has been the yardstick of choice.56

        President Reagan’s Executive Order 12,291 directed executive agencies to submit any major
proposed rule to the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) along with a statement
assessing its regulatory impact. The order further directed that, “to the extent permitted by law,”
administrative agencies were not to regulate if the costs of their regulation outweighed the benefits.
Supporters of the approach emphasized that it would help achieve least-cost solutions to policy
problems by bringing consistency and rationality to the administrative state, while critics contended
that OMB review and benefit-cost analysis were intended not to promote efficient regulation, but
simply to roll back regulation (Pildes and Sunstein 1995).

       Throughout the Reagan and Bush Administrations, Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs) were
required under Reagan Executive Orders 12291 and 12498.57 President George H. W. Bush created
a Council on Competitiveness, chaired by Vice President Quayle, which reviewed the impact on
industry of selected regulations.


56
 On the other hand, it should be recognized that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (in the U.S. Office
of Management and Budget), which reviews draft regulations and manages the process of receiving Regulatory Impact
Analyses from the departments and agencies, was itself established by the Congress (through the Paperwork Reduction
Act of 1980).
57
  Executive Order (EO) 12291 required agencies to conduct a regulatory impact analysis for all proposed and final rules
that were anticipated to have an effect on the national economy in excess of $100 million. Executive Order 12498
required, in addition, a risk assessment for all proposed and final environmental health and safety regulations. EO
12291 has been called the “foremost development in administrative law of the 1980s” (Morgenstern 1997). The Reagan
EOs were not the first presidential effort at regulatory efficiency, however. President Nixon required a “Quality of Life”
review of selected regulations in 1971, and President Ford formalized this process in EO 11281 in 1974. President
Carter’s EO 12044 required analysis of proposed rules and centralized review by the Regulatory Analysis Review
Group. The Administration of President George W. Bush has continued to enforce the RIA requirements of Clinton’s
EO 12866, rather than issuing a new EO (Graham 2001).

                                                           25
        The Clinton Administration, like its two immediate predecessors, issued an Executive Order
requiring benefit-cost analysis of all Federal regulations with expected annual costs greater than
$100 million.58 Shortly after taking office in 1993, Clinton abolished the Council on
Competitiveness and revoked both of the Reagan orders, replacing them with EO 12866, Regulatory
Planning and Review.59 The Clinton EO was substantively and administratively similar to the
Reagan orders. It was qualitatively different in tone, however, signaling a less strict efficiency test.
While the Reagan orders required that benefits outweigh costs, the Clinton order required only that
benefits justify costs. The Clinton EO allowed that: (1) not all regulatory benefits and costs can be
monetized; and (2) non-monetary consequences should be influential in regulatory analysis (Viscusi
1996). In other ways, the Clinton EO broadened the scope of RIAs to include “distributive impacts”
and “equity” in assessing the costs and benefits of particular regulations.60

         President George W. Bush kept Clinton’s executive order in place, further cementing what
was already apparent: that the use of benefit-cost analysis in the executive branch has strong
bipartisan support. This is not to say, however, that benefit-cost analysis has become a ubiquitous
part of all agency decision making. There is evidence that many federal agencies have not complied
with the executive orders to engage in meaningful benefit-cost analysis, and the requirements for
Regulatory Impact Analysis have not necessarily improved the efficiency of individual Federal
environmental rules (Hahn and Dudley 2004). Further, regulatory impact analysis is required only
for major rules, a small fraction of all rules issued by EPA and other agencies. Rules that do not
meet this threshold pass under the efficiency radar.

2.2.2 Legislative Enactments

        Over the years, Congress has sent mixed signals regarding the use of benefit-cost analysis
in policy evaluation. Some statutes actually require the use of benefit-cost analysis,61 whereas others
have been interpreted to effectively preclude the consideration of benefits and costs in the




58
 The threshold is not indexed for inflation and has not been modified over time. We refer to year 2000 dollars, unless
we indicate otherwise.
59
 In discussing Clinton’s EO 12866, many analysts also mention EO 12875, Enhancing the Intergovernmental
Partnership, which limited “unfunded mandates”. While EO 12875 was part of the Administration’s regulatory reform
agenda, it did not refer to the efficiency or cost-effectiveness of environmental regulations.
60
  “Costs and benefits shall be understood to include both quantifiable measures (to the fullest extent that these can be
usefully estimated) and qualitative measures of costs and benefits that are difficult to quantify, but nevertheless essential
to consider. Further, in choosing among alternative regulatory approaches, agencies should select those approaches that
maximize net benefits (including potential economic, environmental, public health and safety, and other advantages;
distributive impacts; and equity), unless a statute requires another regulatory approach.” Executive Order 12866.
61
  Parts of the Clean Water Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Federal
Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act explicitly allow or require regulators to
consider benefits and costs.

                                                            26
development of certain regulations.62 But this has not prevented regulatory agencies from
considering the benefits and costs of their regulatory proposals.63 The problem with such informal,
implicit benefit-cost analysis is that it can be unsystematic, not subject to peer review, and carried
out behind closed doors, with access limited to the particular friends of the administration. Thus,
concerns arise about this approach not only on technical grounds (poor analysis), but on process
grounds — it is fundamentally undemocratic.

        Despite such arguments, formal benefit-cost analysis has only infrequently been used to help
set the stringency of environmental standards. The body politic has favored a very different set of
approaches to setting standards, such as that embraced by the Clean Air Act: set the standard to
“protect the most sensitive member of the population with an adequate margin of safety.”
Economists and some legal scholars have spent a great deal of time arguing that such criteria are
neither reasonable nor well defined, but little change has occurred.64

        In the 104th Congress, a major part of the Republicans’ “Contract with America” was a
regulatory reform bill that would have made meeting a benefit-cost test a necessary condition for
a broad set of regulatory actions. That bill was narrowly defeated in the Senate, and would have
faced a certain Presidential veto, in any case (Sunstein 1996).65 Subsequently, Congress considered
but did not enact legislation (introduced by former Senator Fred Thompson and Senator Carl Levin)
which would have required agencies to conduct (non-binding) benefit-cost analyses of new
regulations and periodically of existing ones.66 While this bill never became law, the 106th Congress
did pass a major piece of regulatory reform legislation, the Truth in Regulating Act (TIRA), which
was signed into law by President Clinton in October 2000. The TIRA established a three-year pilot
project beginning in early 2001, which required GAO to review RIAs to evaluate agencies’ benefit
estimates, cost estimates, and analysis of alternative approaches, upon request by Congress. Because
funding was never provided, however, TIRA was not implemented.


62
  Statutes that have been interpreted (in part, at least) to restrict the ability of regulators to consider benefits and costs
include: the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; health standards under the Occupational Safety and Health Act;
safety regulations from National Highway and Transportation Safety Agency; the Clean Air Act; the Clean Water Act;
the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act.
63
 There is rigorous, empirical evidence that agencies do take into account benefits and costs of regulatory decisions, even
when governing statutes do not encourage or allow such analysis to affect decisions. See, for example: Cropper et al.
1992.
64
  The significant and well known heterogeneity of costs per life saved under existing statutes (Table 1) suggests that
in the absence of a benefit-cost test aimed at achieving efficiency, much could be accomplished through greater attention
to simple cost-effectiveness, that is, achieving given goals or standards at minimum cost. See: Tengs et al. 1995.
65
  But President Clinton did sign the Small Business Regulatory Reform Act of 1996, which provides an opportunity for
the Congress to pass legislation that nullifies a regulation that does not pass a benefit-cost test (the nullification itself
is then subject to possible Presidential veto, like any act of Congress).
66
 Proposals for the use of a benefit-cost test for setting environmental standards have found a more receptive audience
among the states. As of 1996, some 25 of 35 states surveyed reported significant environmental regulatory reform
efforts, defined as including the establishment of benefit-cost criteria for promulgation of regulations (Graham and
Loevzel 1997).

                                                             27
        In addition to these attempts at cross-cutting regulatory reform, the Congresses of the Clinton
years pursued efficiency within specific environmental statutes.67 In general, Congress was not
successful during the 1990s at reforming individual environmental statutes, although important
exceptions were the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) amendments and the partial reform of
pesticide permitting under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA).

        The 1996 SDWA Amendments include the most far-reaching requirement for benefit-cost
analysis in any environmental statute. The Amendments focus EPA regulatory efforts on
contaminants that pose the greatest health risks by: (1) requiring benefit-cost analysis of new rules;
(2) removing the mandate that EPA regulate 25 new contaminants every three years; (3) allowing
EPA to use cost information to adjust its “feasibility standards” for water system reduction of
contaminants; and (4) requiring the Administrator to balance risks among contaminants to minimize
the overall risk of adverse health effects (Tiemann 1999). While the Amendments require EPA to
determine whether the benefits of each new drinking water maximum contaminant level (MCL)
regulation justify the costs, they also allow the Agency to adopt more stringent standards than those
that maximize net benefits, explaining the reasons for not selecting the efficient standard.68

        The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 amends both the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide,
and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the FFDCA, removing pesticide residues on processed food from
the group of Delaney “zero-risk standard” substances. The Delaney standard has long been a target
of economic criticism on the grounds that it often leads to associated costs that greatly exceed
benefits.69 While the standard continues to apply to non-pesticide food additives, the Food Quality
Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the distinction between pesticide residues on raw foods (which
had been regulated under FFDCA section 408) and processed foods (which had been regulated under
FFDCA section 409 – the Delaney Clause).

        It is also important to recognize several failed attempts at changes in individual statutes.
Two of the environmental statutes most frequently criticized on efficiency grounds — Superfund
(CERCLA) and the Clean Water Act (CWA) — remained relatively untouched by Congress in the
1990s, despite its focus on regulatory reform. Superfund’s critics have focused on the low benefits
and high costs of achieving the statute’s standards (Viscusi 1992, Breyer 1993, Hamilton and
Viscusi 1999). Reauthorization and reform were considered during the 105th Congress, but no
legislation was passed. Rather than efficiency, distributional aspects of liability issues and questions
of how to finance Superfund were the major foci of legislative discussions.70 The 104th Congress
pursued efficiency-oriented reform of the Clean Water Act through the reauthorization process, but

67
  During the 1990s, the Congress also pursued reforms of non-environmental statutes that affect environmental
regulation. For example, the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996 (104th Congress) requires the
Secretary of Transportation to issue pipeline safety regulations only upon justification that benefits exceed costs.
68
 See Safe Drinking Water Act §300g-1 (4)(C). The Amendments do not allow old standards to be subjected to an ex-
post benefit-cost analysis.
69
  The so-called Delaney clause had the effect of forcing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to ban substances
from human food supplies that had tested positive as animal carcinogens.
70
 The taxes that support the Superfund trust fund (primarily excise taxes on petroleum and specified chemical feedstocks
and a corporate environmental income tax) expired in 1995 and have not been reinstated.

                                                         28
the effort failed in the Senate. During the 104th Congress, the House passed a comprehensive Clean
Water Act reauthorization (H.R. 961) that would have been more flexible and less prescriptive than
the current statute, but the Senate did not take up the bill.

        Finally, it is important to note the limited effects of the legislative changes described above.
The cross-cutting legislative regulatory reform measures passed in the 1990s and the efficiency-
related changes to specific environmental statutes had only limited effects on regulation. This is in
part due to differences between the Administration and the Congress in the acceptance of efficiency
as an appropriate criterion for managing the environment and natural resources. An additional
explanation is the existing statutory bias against benefit-cost analysis in some cases, particularly
under the Clean Air Act. In such cases, substantial movement toward efficiency in regulation cannot
be expected without substantial changes in the authorizing legislation.

        The SDWA Amendments of 1996 incorporated a strong benefit-cost criterion, in comparison
with other environmental statutes. However, the decisions made on MCLs since the SDWA
Amendments have not placed great weight on the results of required benefit-cost analyses. Two
major rules proposed since the 1996 Amendments were those regulating allowable levels of arsenic
and radon in drinking water.71 EPA’s benefit-cost analyses for the radon and arsenic MCLs can be
interpreted as indicating that monetized costs exceed monetized benefits for both rules, but EPA
maintained that the benefits of both rules justify their costs when unquantified benefits are included
(U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1999).

        Likewise, the regulatory reform initiatives passed by Congress in the 1990s apparently did
not influence EPA’s issuance of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ambient
ozone and particulate matter in July, 1997. Due to their high potential compliance costs, the revised
standards were immediately controversial; both the decision to tighten the standards and the quality
of the research used to support the new standards came under fire. EPA’s cost estimates for the
ozone standard were singled out for criticism (Shogren 1998, Lutter 1999). On the other hand, the
particulate standard exhibited expected benefits that could well exceed costs by a considerable
margin.

         The regulated community challenged the new NAAQS in court, and the case reached the
U.S. Supreme Court in October, 2000. Under the Clean Air Act, EPA is required to set health-based
standards for specified pollutants without consideration of abatement costs. The Supreme Court
ruled unanimously in February, 2001, that the Clean Air Act does not allow EPA to consider costs
in setting NAAQS for the air pollutants in question (and that the statute’s mandate that the NAAQS
protect the public health with “an adequate margin of safety” allows an acceptable scope of
discretion to EPA).

      Overall, the differences in opinion between Congress and the executive branch (especially
EPA) on the usefulness of efficiency analysis have resulted in an effective stalemate. Even where


71
  The arsenic rule was finalized on January 22, 2001, but implementation was delayed while the rule was taken under
review by the George W. Bush Administration, citing concerns about the rule’s costs and benefits. After an expedited
review by the National Academy of Sciences, in October, 2001, EPA Administrator Whitman announced the Agency’s
intention to enforce the Clinton arsenic standard.

                                                        29
statutes have been explicitly altered to require benefit-cost analysis, as was the case for the setting
of MCLs under the Safe Drinking Water Act, rules promulgated during the 1990s were not any more
or less efficient than rules promulgated during earlier decades. On the other hand, Congressional
efforts at generic “regulatory reform” are unlikely to disappear from the policy landscape, and there
will continue to be attempts — sometimes successful — to introduce benefit-cost tests into
individual environmental statutes.

2.2.3 Judicial Recognition

         The Federal judiciary also plays a key role in furthering the use of analytical methodologies
to assist agency decision making. As Sunstein (2002) notes, over the years courts have implemented
a series of benefit-cost “default rules” to deal with Congressional silences and ambiguities. These
default rules, while not part of administrative law doctrine, impute to Congressional silence an intent
to permit (and perhaps even require) administrative agencies to consider regulatory costs when
issuing regulations. The default rules reflect a widespread judicial acceptance of benefit-cost
analysis in regulatory rulemaking.72

       Notably, Justice Stephen Breyer of the U.S. Supreme Court has advocated for more
aggressive background rules with respect to risk-risk analysis. In the seminal case of American
Trucking v. Whitman,73 referenced above, Justice Breyer argued for a general presumption requiring
agencies to engage in benefit-cost analyses when regulating, noting that these analyses would also
necessarily involve assessments of risk tradeoffs. In this, he joined ranks with economists and legal
scholars who have argued for a judicial presumption in favor of benefit-cost and risk-tradeoff
analyses. Breyer’s concurrence marks the arrival of risk tradeoff analysis — and health-health
tradeoff analysis, in particular — in the Supreme Court and paves the way for future challenges
based on such tradeoffs (Rascoff and Revesz 2002).

2.2.4 A Political Economy Perspective on How Standards Are Set

        Granting the merits and relatively widespread acceptance of analytical methods for assessing
the tradeoffs inherent in environmental regulation, why has the use of analytical techniques not
become more common in environmental policy? Why instead has Congress continued to legislate
frequently without regard to benefits and costs? This section reviews positive political economy
accounts of how environmental standards are set.

         First, some regulations permit established firms to extract rents and establish barriers to entry
that convey to them a competitive advantage (Keohane, Revesz and Stavins 1998). This is
consistent with the empirical reality that the impetus for regulation often comes, either explicitly or
implicitly, from regulated firms themselves. For example, a command-and-control standard that
limits a firm's aggregate emissions may cause firms to reduce their output to meet the environmental
requirement. This output restriction can push the price of a firm's product above its average cost, and
as a result, the firm can earn rents. Vigorous competition would dissipate this rent, but


72
  See: Corrosion Proof Fittings v. EPA, 947 F. 2d. 1201 (1991).
73
  531 U.S. 457 (2001).

                                                        30
environmental regulations often create barriers to entry by imposing stringent pollution standards
on new sources, thus giving a significant competitive advantage to established polluters (Maloney
and McCormick 1982).

        Second, some industries enjoy strong economies of scale and prefer uniform federal
regulation to a patchwork of potentially more efficient state standards. Indeed, having to
manufacture different products for sale in different states can destroy the advantages related to
economies of scale. National uniformity can come at the expense of regulations more narrowly
tailored to achieve optimal outcomes.

        Third, even if environmental regulation does not raise the profits of an entire industry, it can
benefit certain firms within an industry (Keohane, Revesz and Stavins 1998). Firms within an
industry likely will incur different costs in the regulatory requirements, because some firms will be
able to adjust their production processes more easily than others. These relative beneficiaries of
government regulation are thus likely to oppose relaxing regulatory requirements, and may even
favor extending them.

         Fourth, the impetus for regulation sometimes comes from manufacturers of pollution control
equipment, environmentally friendly technologies, or inputs to production processes favored by the
regulatory regime. For example, firms specializing in the cleanup of hazardous waste sites emerged
in response to the Federal Superfund statute. Similarly, the ethanol industry has strongly supported
stricter regulation of gasoline. As a result of its efforts, the Clean Air Act's clean fuels program
provides strong incentives for the use of ethanol, and the Federal government has provided large
subsidies to ethanol producers.

        Fifth, environmental regulation often imposes disproportionate costs on some regions of the
country. Regions that incur lower than average costs from regulation become comparatively more
attractive to mobile capital, which may bring economic benefits such as jobs and tax revenues. Such
regions sometimes push for Federal regulation that will impose disproportionate costs on other
regions (Pashigian 1985).


   3. CHOOSING INSTRUMENTS: THE MEANS OF ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY

        Environmental policies typically combine the identification of a goal with some means to
achieve that goal. In section 2 of this chapter, we examined the criteria and methods that economics
can bring to bear on the choice of targets. In this section, we examine the means — the instruments
— that can be employed by governments to achieve given policy objectives. We begin with
normative issues and then turn to positive analysis.

3.1 Normative Issues and Analysis

        Even if the goals and targets of environmental policies are taken as given, economic analysis
can bring valuable insights to the assessment and design of environmental policies. We begin by
considering criteria that can be brought to bear on the search for better policy instruments, and then
turn to an enumeration of major categories of environmental policy instruments, including both


                                                  31
conventional, command-and-control and the newer breed of market-based instruments. Cross-
cutting issues are considered, including uncertainty, technological change, and distributional issues.
We examine lessons that emerge from research and experience.

3.1.1 Potential Criteria for Choosing Among Policy Instruments

        A variety of criteria have been posited as relevant for choosing environmental policy
instruments, including: (1) will the policy instrument achieve the stated goal or standard; (2) will
it do so at the lowest possible cost, including both private-sector compliance and public-sector
monitoring and enforcement; (3) will it provide government with the information it needs to
implement the policy; (4) will the instrument be flexible in the face of changes in tastes and
technology; (5) will the instrument provide dynamic incentives for research, development, and
adoption of better pollution-abatement technologies; (6) will the implementation of the policy
instrument result in an equitable distribution of the benefits and costs of environmental protection;
and (7) will the policy be politically feasible in terms of enactment and implementation? Items (1)
through (5) together refer to a comprehensive notion of the criterion of cost-effectiveness, while item
(6) refers to distributional equity, and item (7) refers to political feasibility.74

        First, to be more precise, by cost-effectiveness we mean that allocation of control among
sources that results in the aggregate target being achieved at the lowest possible cost, that is, the
allocation which satisfies the following cost-minimization problem:

                                                                        N
                                               min C =
                                                   { ri }
                                                                    ∑ c (r )
                                                                    i =1
                                                                            i   i                                (10)


                                                            N                       _
                                            s.t.            ∑ [ui − ri ] ≤ E
                                                            i =1
                                                                                                                 (11)


                                               and 0 ≤ ri ≤ ui                                                   (12)

where ri = reductions in emissions (abatement or control) by source i (i = 1 to N);
   ci(ri) = cost function for source i;
      C = aggregate cost of control;
      ui = uncontrolled emissions by source i; and
      Ē = the aggregate emissions target imposed by the regulatory authority.




74
 This list originated with Bohm and Russell (1985). As indicated above, we include the first potential criterion —
environmental effectiveness — in a comprehensive definition of cost-effectiveness, but it can also be considered on its
own. For example, it has been argued that in some cases the use of market-based instruments has made it politically
and/or economically feasible to achieve more stringent goals than otherwise possible (Ellerman et al. 2000; Ellerman
2003; Harrison 2003).

                                                                   32
        If the cost functions are convex, then necessary and sufficient conditions for satisfaction of
the constrained optimization problem posed by equations (10) through (12) are the following, among
others (Kuhn and Tucker 1951):

                                                ∂ci ( ri )
                                                           −λ ≥ 0                                                    (13)
                                                  ∂ri

                                                   ∂ci (ri )
                                                     ⎡            ⎤
                                                 r ⋅
                                                     ⎢
                                                  i ⎢⎢
                                                             − λ ⎥⎥ = 0                                              (14)
                                                    ∂ri           ⎥
                                                     ⎢⎣           ⎥⎦


Equations (13) and (14) together imply the crucial condition for cost-effectiveness that all sources
(that exercise some degree of control) experience the same marginal abatement costs (Baumol and
Oates 1988). Thus, when examining alternatives types of environmental policy instruments, a key
question is whether particular instruments are likely to result in marginal abatement costs being
equated across sources.75

3.1.2 Alternative Policy Instruments

        The most frequently employed delineation of environmental policy instruments is that of
command-and-control versus market-based approaches. Conventional approaches to regulating the
environment — frequently characterized as command-and-control76 — allow relatively little
flexibility in the means of achieving goals. Such policy instruments tend to force firms to take on
similar shares of the pollution-control burden, regardless of the cost, sometimes by setting uniform
standards for firms, the most prevalent of which are technology- and performance-based standards.77

        Market-based instruments encourage behavior through market signals, rather than through
explicit directives regarding pollution control levels or methods. These policy instruments can




75
  For purposes of clarity, the model of cost-effectiveness, above, and subsequent models of specific policy instruments
refer to uniformly-mixed flow pollutants. Little additional insight is gained but much is sacrificed in terms of
transparency and tractability by modeling more complex non-uniformly mixed stock pollutants. Where the results are
not robust to this simplification, we recognize the complexities in the text.
76
  The phrase “command-and-control” is by far the most commonly employed characterization for conventional
environmental policy instruments, including uniform performance and technology standards. Admittedly, the phrase
has an inescapable negative stigma associated with it, and so a better, more neutral description of this category of policy
approaches might be “prescriptive instruments.” But because “command-and-control” is the generally accepted name
for this category, we employ it in this chapter.
77
  Note that uniform standards can specify the amount of pollution that can be released into the environment (emission
standard) or the permissible concentration of pollution in the air, water, or soil (ambient standard). The cost-effective
allocation consistent with ambient standards requires equalization of the marginal costs to reduce a unit of ambient
concentration, rather than emission.

                                                           33
reasonably be described as “harnessing market forces,”78 because if they are well designed and
properly implemented, they encourage firms or individuals to undertake pollution control efforts that
are in their own interests and that collectively meet policy goals. Market-based instruments fall
within four categories: pollution charges, tradeable permits, market-friction reductions, and
government subsidy reductions. Liability rules can also be thought of as a market-based instrument,
because they provide incentives for firms to take into account the potential environmental damages
of their decisions, allowing full flexibility in technology and control practices (Revesz 1997c).79

3.1.2.1 Command-and-Control versus Market-Based Instruments

        Market-based instruments offer the potential for dynamic cost-effectiveness, but problems
may arise in translating theory into practice (Hahn and Axtell 1995), and it has been difficult to
measure the magnitude of the gains of moving from command-and-control to incentive-based
mechanisms. One frequently-cited survey of eleven empirical studies of air pollution control found
that the ratio of actual, aggregate costs of the conventional (command-and-control) approach to the
aggregate costs of least-cost benchmarks ranged from 1.07 for sulfate emissions in the Los Angeles
area to 22.0 for hydrocarbon emissions at all domestic DuPont plants (Tietenberg 1985). It is
important not to misinterpret these numbers, however, since actual, command-and-control
instruments were essentially contrasted with theoretical benchmarks of cost-effectiveness, that is,
what a perfectly functioning market-based instrument would achieve in theory.80 A more useful
comparison among policy instruments might involve either idealized versions of both market-based
systems and alternatives, or — better yet — realistic versions of both (Hahn and Stavins 1992).81

        Where there is significant heterogeneity of costs, command-and-control methods will not be
cost-effective. Holding all firms to the same target will be unduly expensive, because it fails to
recognize abatement cost heterogeneity. In reality, costs can vary enormously due to production
design, physical configuration, age of assets, and other factors. For example, the marginal costs of
controlling lead emissions have been estimated to range from $13 to $56,000 per ton (Hartman,
Wheeler, and Singh 1994; Morgenstern 2000). But where costs are similar among sources,
command-and-control instruments may perform equivalent to (or better than) market-based
instruments, depending on transactions costs, administrative costs, possibilities for strategic
behavior, political costs, and the nature of the pollutants (Newell and Stavins 2003).82



78
  See: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (1989, 1991, 1998); and U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency (1991, 1992, 2001). Another strain of literature — known as “free market environmentalism” —
focuses on the role of private property rights in achieving environmental protection (Anderson and Leal 1991).
79
 Other taxonomies of regulatory instruments are possible, and some take a more inclusive view, including — for
example — contractual approaches. On this, see Menell (2002).
80
 In other cases, researchers have contrasted hypothetical costs of a CAC program with the actual compliance costs
associated with the use of a market-based instrument (Keohane 2003).
81
 Harrington and Morgenstern (2003) attempt to do this by comparing actual experiences in Europe and the United
States with market-based and conventional policy instruments.
82
  Also see: Atkinson and Lewis (1974); Spofford (1984); and Maloney and Yandle (1984).

                                                       34
        In theory, if properly designed and implemented, market-based instruments allow any desired
level of pollution cleanup to be realized at the lowest overall cost to society, by providing incentives
for the greatest reductions in pollution by those firms that can achieve the reductions most cheaply.
Rather than equalizing pollution levels among firms, market-based instruments equalize their
marginal abatement costs (Montgomery 1972; Baumol and Oates 1988; Tietenberg 1995).
Command-and-control approaches could — in theory — achieve this cost-effective solution, but this
would require that different standards be set for each pollution source, and, consequently, that policy
makers obtain detailed information about the compliance costs each firm faces. Such information
is simply not available to government. By contrast, market-based instruments provide for a cost-
effective allocation of the pollution control burden among sources without requiring the government
to have this information.

        In addition, market-based instruments have the potential to bring down abatement costs over
time (that is, to be dynamically cost effective) by providing incentives for companies to adopt
cheaper and better pollution-control technologies. This is because with market-based instruments,
most clearly with emission taxes, it pays firms to clean up a bit more if a sufficiently low-cost
method (technology or process) of doing so can be identified and adopted (Downing and White
1986; Ellerman 2003; Malueg 1989; Milliman and Prince 1989; Jaffe and Stavins 1995; Carlson et
al. 2000; Popp 2002; Keohane 2001; Tietenberg 2003). However, the ranking among policy
instruments, in terms of their respective impacts on technology innovation and diffusion, is not
unequivocal (Jaffe, Newell, and Stavins 2003).

3.1.2.2 Pollution Charges

       Pollution charge systems assess a fee or tax on the amount of pollution that firms or sources
generate (Pigou 1920). Consequently, it is worthwhile for firms to reduce emissions to the point
where their marginal abatement costs are equal to the common tax rate.83 By definition, actual
emissions are equal to unconstrained emissions minus emissions reductions, that is, ei = ui - ri. A
source’s cost minimization problem in the presence of an emissions tax, t, is given by:

                                         min [ ci ( ri ) + t ⋅ (ui − ri )]                                    (15)
                                          { ri }



                                                     s.t. ri ≥ 0                                              (16)

The result for each source is:

                                                   ∂ci ( ri )
                                                              −t ≥ 0                                          (17)
                                                     ∂ri

Oates (1992).

Equations (17) and (18) imply that each source (that exercises a positive level of control) will carry
out abatement up to the point where its marginal control costs are equal to the tax rate. Hence,
marginal abatement costs will be equated across sources, satisfying the condition for cost-
effectiveness specified by equations (13) and (14).

        A challenge with charge systems is identifying the appropriate tax rate. For social efficiency,
it should be set equal to the marginal benefits of cleanup at the efficient level of cleanup, but policy
makers are more likely to think in terms of a desired level of cleanup, and they do not know
beforehand how firms will respond to a given level of taxation. An additional problem posed by
pollution taxes is associated with their distributional consequences for regulated sources. Despite
the fact that such systems minimize aggregate social costs, these systems may be more costly than
comparable command-and-control instruments for regulated firms. This is because with the tax
approach, firms pay both their abatement costs plus taxes on their residual emissions. For the
calculation of aggregate costs in a social benefit-cost or cost-effectiveness analysis, tax payments
are simply transfers, and so are excluded from the calculations.

         The conventional wisdom is that charge systems have been ignored in the United States, but
this is not really correct. If one defines charge systems broadly, a significant number of applications
can be identified (Stavins 2003). The closest that any U.S. charge systems come to operating as true
Pigovian taxes may be the increasingly common unit-charge systems for financing municipal solid
waste collection, where households and businesses are charged the incremental costs of collection
and disposal. So-called “pay-as-you-throw” policies, where users pay in proportion to the volume
of their waste, are now used in well over one thousand jurisdictions. The collective experience
provides evidence that unit charges have been successful in reducing the volume of household waste
generated.84

        Another important set of charge systems implemented in the United States has been deposit
refund systems, whereby consumers pay a surcharge when purchasing potentially polluting products,
and receive a refund when returning the product to an approved center for recycling or proper
disposal. A number of states have implemented this approach through “bottle bills” to control litter
from beverage containers and to reduce the flow of solid waste to landfills (Bohm 1981; Menell
1990), and the concept has also been applied to lead-acid batteries (Table 2).

        In addition, there has been considerable use of environmental user charges in the United
States, through which specific environmentally related services are funded (Table 3). Examples
include insurance premium taxes (Table 4), such as those formerly used to fund partially the clean-
up of hazardous waste sites through the Superfund program (Barthold 1994).85 Another set of

 The taxes that previously supported the Superfund trust fund — primarily excise taxes on petroleum and specified
chemical feedstocks and a corporate environmental income tax — expired in 1995, and have not been reinstated.

environmental charges are sales taxes on motor fuels, ozone-depleting chemicals, agricultural inputs,
and low-mileage motor vehicles (Table 5). Finally, tax differentiation has become part of a
considerable number of Federal and state attempts to encourage the use of renewable energy sources
(Table 6).

3.1.2.3 Tradeable Permit Systems

        Tradeable permits — in theory — can achieve the same cost-minimizing allocation of the
control burden as a charge system,86 while avoiding the problems of uncertain responses by firms
and the distributional consequences of taxes.87 Under a tradable permit system, an allowable overall
level of pollution, Ē, is established, and allocated among firms in the form of permits. Firms that
keep their emission levels below their allotted level may sell their surplus permits to other firms or
use them to offset excess emissions in other parts of their operations.88 Let q0i be the initial
allocation of emission permits to source i, such that:

                                                      N

                                                     ∑q
                                                     i =1
                                                            0i   =E                                                 (19)


Then, if p is the market-determined price of tradeable permits, a single firm’s cost minimization
problem is given by:

                                           min[ci(ri ) + p⋅(ui −ri −q0i )]                                          (20)
                                            {ri}


                                                    s.t. ri ≥ 0                                                     (21)

The result for each source is:


86
  Thirty years ago, Crocker (1966) and Dales (1968) independently developed the idea of using transferable discharge
permits to allocate the pollution-control burden among sources. Montgomery (1972) provided the first rigorous proof
that such a system could provide a cost-effective policy instrument. A sizeable literature has followed, much of it
stemming from Hahn and Noll (1982). Early surveys were provided by Tietenberg (1980, 1985). Much of the literature
may be traced to Coase’s (1960) treatment of negotiated solutions to externality problems. As indicated previously, the
simple model posited above, as well as the prior model of emission taxes, assumes the existence of a uniformly-mixed
pollutant, in which case the focus of regulation can be exclusively on emissions, as opposed to ambient concentrations.
There is a sizable literature that explores tradeable permit and other policy instruments in the context of non-uniformly-
mixed pollution problems. See, for example: Montgomery (1972); and Nash and Revesz (2001).
87
  This assumes that the allocation is made without charge, but it could also be through sale or auction, in which case
the distributional implications of a comparable tradeable permit program are similar to the emission tax previously
described. Likewise, a revenue-neutral emissions tax, in which revenues are refunded to regulated firms (but not in
proportion to their emissions levels), can resemble — in distributional terms — a comparable tradeable permit program
in which the permits are allocated without charge.
88
  The simple program described above is a“cap-and-trade” system, but some systems operate as “credit programs,”
where permits or credits are assigned only when a source reduces emissions below what is required by source-specific
limits.

Equations (22) and (23) together imply that each source (that exercises a positive level of control)
will carry out abatement up to the point where its marginal control costs are equal to the market-
determined permit price. Hence, the environmental constraint, Ē, is satisfied, and marginal
abatement costs are equated across sources, satisfying the condition for cost-effectiveness. Note that
the unique cost-effective equilibrium is achieved independent of the initial allocation of permits
(Montgomery 1972).89 This is of great importance politically, as we discuss below in section 3.2.

       In theory, a number of factors can adversely affect the performance of a tradeable permit
system, including: concentration in the permit market (Hahn 1984; Misolek and Elder 1989);
concentration in the product market (Malueg 1990); transaction costs (Stavins 1995); non-profit
maximizing behavior, such as sales or staff maximization (Tschirhart 1984); the preexisting
regulatory environment (Bohi and Burtraw 1992); and the degree of monitoring and enforcement
(Keeler 1991; and Montero 2003).

        Tradeable permits have been the most frequently used market-based system in the United
States (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2000a; Tietenberg 1997a). A selection of programs
is summarized in Table 7. The U.S. EPA first experimented with emissions trading in 1974, as part
of the Clean Air Act’s program for improving local air quality, and later codified these initiatives
in its Emissions Trading Program in 1986 (Tietenberg 1985; Hahn 1989; Foster and Hahn 1995).
Significant applications include: EPA’s emissions trading program (Tietenberg 1985; Hahn 1989);
the leaded gasoline phasedown; water quality permit trading (Hahn 1989; Stephenson, Norris, and
Shabman 1998); CFC trading (Hahn and McGartland 1989); the sulfur dioxide (SO2) allowance
trading system for acid rain control; the RECLAIM program in the Los Angeles metropolitan region
(Harrison 1999); and tradeable development rights for land use.90 At least two of these programs
— lead trading and the SO2 allowance system — merit further comment.

        The purpose of the lead trading program, developed in the 1980s, was to allow gasoline
refiners greater flexibility in meeting emission standards at a time when the lead-content of gasoline
was reduced to 10 percent of its previous level. In 1982, EPA authorized inter-refinery trading of


89
  This is true unless particularly perverse types of transactions costs are present (Stavins 1995).
90
  In addition, the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 established Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards for automobiles and light trucks, requiring manufacturers to meet minimum sales-weighted average fuel
efficiency for their fleets sold in the United States. A penalty is charged per car sold per unit of average fuel efficiency
below the standard. The program operates like an intra-firm tradeable permit system, since manufacturers can undertake
efficiency improvements wherever they are cheapest within their fleets. For reviews of the program’s costs relative to
“equivalent” gasoline taxes, see: Crandall et al. (1986); Goldberg (1998); and National Research Council (2002). Light
trucks, which are defined by the Federal government to include “sport utility vehicles,” face weaker CAFE standards.

                                                            38
lead credits, a major purpose of which was to lessen the financial burden on smaller refineries,
which were believed to have significantly higher compliance costs. If refiners produced gasoline
with a lower lead content than was required, they earned lead credits. In 1985, EPA initiated a
program allowing refineries to bank lead credits, and subsequently firms made extensive use of this
option. In each year of the program, more than 60 percent of the lead added to gasoline was
associated with traded lead credits (Hahn and Hester 1989), until the program was terminated at the
end of 1987, when the lead phasedown was completed.

        The lead program was successful in meeting its environmental targets, although it may have
produced some temporary geographic shifts in use patterns (Anderson, Hofmann and Rusin 1990).
Although the benefits of the trading scheme are more difficult to assess, the level of trading activity
and the rate at which refiners reduced their production of leaded gasoline suggest that the program
was relatively cost-effective (Kerr and Maré 1997; Nichols 1997). The high level of trading among
firms far surpassed levels observed in earlier environmental markets. EPA estimated savings from
the lead trading program of approximately 20 percent below alternative programs that did not
provide for lead banking, a cost savings of about $250 million per year (U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, Office of Policy Analysis 1985). Furthermore, the program appears to have
provided measurable incentives for cost-saving technology diffusion (Kerr and Newell 2003).

        The most important application made to date of a market-based instrument for environmental
protection has been the SO2 allowance trading program for acid rain control, established under the
Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, and intended to reduce SO2 emissions by 10 million tons below
1980 levels (Ferrall 1991). A robust market of bilateral SO2 permit trading gradually emerged,
resulting in cost savings on the order of $1 billion annually, compared with the costs under some
command-and-control regulatory alternatives (Carlson et al. 2000).91 Although the program had low
levels of trading in its early years (Burtraw 1996), trading increased significantly over time
(Schmalensee et al. 1998; Stavins 1998; Burtraw and Mansur 1999; Ellerman et al. 2000).

        Concerns were expressed early on that state regulatory authorities would hamper trading in
order to protect their domestic coal industries, and some research indicates that state public utility
commission cost-recovery rules provided poor guidance for compliance activities (Rose 1997; Bohi
1994). Other analysis suggests that this was not a major problem (Bailey 1996). Similarly, in
contrast to early assertions that the structure of EPA’s small permit auction market would cause
problems (Cason 1995), the evidence now indicates that this had little or no effect on the vastly more
important bilateral trading market (Joskow, Schmalensee, and Bailey 1998).

         The reduction of emissions through the allowance trading program apparently has had
exceptionally positive welfare effects, with benefits being as much as six times greater than costs
(Burtraw et al. 1998). The large benefits of the program are due mainly to the positive human health
impacts of decreased local SO2 and particulate concentrations, not the ecological impacts of reduced
long-distance transport of acid deposition. This contrasts with what was understood and assumed
at the time of the program’s enactment in 1990.


91
  The choice of counterfactual for purposes of comparison in such estimates of cost savings is important. The estimate
above represents a cost savings of about 30 percent. Employing a different counterfactual for comparison, Keohane
(2003) estimates cost savings between 15 and 25 percent.

                                                         39
3.1.2.4 Market Friction Reduction

        Market friction reduction can also serve as a policy instrument for environmental protection.
Market creation establishes markets for inputs or outputs associated with environmental quality.
Finally, since well-functioning markets depend on the existence of well-informed producers and
consumers, information programs can help foster market-oriented solutions to environmental
problems. Product labeling requirements can improve the information set available to consumers,
as can various types of reporting requirements.

        One prominent example of market creation is provided by measures that facilitate the
voluntary exchange of water rights and thus promote more efficient allocation and use of scarce
water supplies (Stavins 1983; Howe 1997), and policies that facilitate the restructuring of electricity
generation and transmission. The western United States has long been plagued by inefficient use
and allocation of its scarce water supplies, largely because users do not have incentives to take
actions consistent with economic and environmental values. Economists have noted that federal and
state water policies aggravate rather than improve these problems (Anderson 1983; Frederick 1986;
El-Ashry and Gibbons 1986; Wahl 1989). The disparity in water prices over short geographic
distances indicates that markets could play a role in solving increasing urban demands for water
without the need for new, environmentally-disruptive dams and reservoirs. Reforms have allowed
markets in water rights to develop and voluntary exchanges have developed in several states. For
example, an agreement was reached to transfer 100,000 acre-feet of water per year from the farmers
of the Imperial Irrigation District in southern California to the Metropolitan Water District in the Los
Angeles area. Transactions have emerged elsewhere in California, and in Colorado, New Mexico,
Arizona, Nevada, and Utah (MacDonnell 1990).

         Since well-functioning markets depend, in part, on the existence of well-informed producers
and consumers, information programs can help foster market-oriented solutions to environmental
problems (Table 8).92 These programs have been of two types. Product labeling requirements have
been implemented to improve information sets available to consumers. For example, the U.S.
Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975 specifies that certain appliances and equipment carry
labels with information on products’ energy efficiency and estimated energy costs (U.S. Congress,
Office of Technology Assessment 1992). More recently, EPA and the U.S. Department of Energy
developed the Energy Star program, in which energy efficient products can display an EnergyStar
label. And since 1976, the Department of Energy has provided no-cost energy assessments to small
and medium-sized manufacturers through its university-based Industrial Assessment Centers (IAC)
program. There has been relatively little analysis of the efficacy of such programs, but limited
empirical (econometric) evidence suggests that energy-efficiency product labeling has had
significant impacts on efficiency improvements, essentially by making consumers and therefore
producers more sensitive to energy price changes (Newell, Jaffe, and Stavins 1999). Also, about
half of the projects recommended by assessment teams in the IAC program were subsequently
adopted, with firms applying a one to two-year payback period (or about a 50 to 100 percent hurdle
rate) to the decisions (Anderson and Newell 2004).



92
 For a comprehensive review of information programs and their apparent efficacy, see Tietenberg (1997b), and for an
overview of international experience with “eco-labels,” see Morris and Scarlett (1996). Also see Menell (2002).

                                                        40
      Another set of information programs has involved reporting requirements. A prominent
example is the U.S. Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), established in 1986, which requires firms to
make available to the public information on use, storage, and release of specific hazardous
chemicals. Such information reporting may increase public awareness of firms’ actions, and
consequent public scrutiny may encourage firms to alter their behavior, although the evidence on
outcomes is mixed (U.S. General Accounting Office 1992; Hamilton 1995; Konar and Cohen 1997;
Ananathanarayanan 1998; Hamilton and Viscusi 1999).

3.1.2.5 Government Subsidy Reduction

        Government subsidy reduction constitutes another category of market-based instruments.
Subsidies are the mirror image of taxes and, in theory, can provide incentives to address
environmental problems. Although subsidies can advance environmental quality (see, for example,
Jaffe and Stavins 1995), it is also true that subsidies, in general, have important disadvantages
relatives to taxes (Dewees and Sims 1976; Baumol and Oates 1988). Because subsidies increase
profits in an industry, they encourage entry, and can thereby increase industry size and pollution
output (Mestelman 1982, Kohn 1985).

        In practice, rather than internalizing externalities, many subsidies promote economically
inefficient and environmentally unsound practices. In such cases, reducing subsidies can increase
efficiency and improve environmental quality. For example, because of concerns about global
climate change, increased attention has been given to federal subsidies and other programs that
promote the use of fossil fuels. An EPA study indicates that eliminating these subsidies would have
a significant effect on reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions (Shelby et al. 1997). The Federal
government is involved in the energy sector through the tax system and through a range of
individual agency programs. One study indicates that these activities together cost the government
$17 billion annually (Alliance to Save Energy 1993). A substantial share of these U.S. subsidies and
programs were enacted during the “oil crises” to encourage the development of domestic energy
sources and reduce reliance on imported petroleum. They favor energy supply over energy
efficiency.93 Although there is an economic argument for government policies that encourage new
technologies that have particularly high risk or long term payoffs, mature and conventional
technologies currently receive nearly 90 percent of the subsidies.94

3.1.2.6 Liability Rules

        Liability rules have been most frequently employed for acute hazards, particularly for toxic
waste sites and for the spill of hazardous materials (Menell 1991). One important example is the
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, which
established retroactive liability for companies that are found responsible for the existence of a site
requiring clean up. Governments can collect cleanup costs and damages from waste producers,


93
 The Alliance to Save Energy study (1993) claims that end-use efficiency receives $1 from a wide variety of implicit
and explicit federal subsidies for every $35 received by energy supply.
94
  On the other hand, federal user charges and insurance premium taxes include significant levies on fossil fuels, and
federal tax differentiation has tended to favor renewable energy sources and non-conventional fossil fuels.

                                                         41
waste transporters, handlers, and current and past owners and operators of a site.95 Similarly, the
Oil Pollution Act makes firms liable for cleanup costs, natural resource damages, and third party
damages caused by oil spills onto surface waters; and the Clean Water Act makes responsible parties
liable for cleanup costs for spills of hazardous substances.

        In an ex post regulatory scheme,96 private polluters can be held liable for damages to remedy
the harms they cause to an affected individual or group. In theory, the full costs of their polluting
activities will thus be internalized, and polluters will reduce the expected harm of their activity up
to the point at which further reductions become more costly than the expected liability they face.97

        The effectiveness of liability rules depends in part on the ability of victims of pollution to
bring actions to recover damages. There are five potential problems. First, environmental harms
may be widely dispersed, and so the expected payoff may not justify the cost to an individual victim
of bringing a lawsuit (Cropper and Oates 1992). This collective-action problem can partially be
addressed by permitting individuals to bring class actions on behalf of all those harmed by polluters.
Second, frequently there are many sources of a given pollutant, and hence the aggrieved party (or
parties) may not be able to identify the actual source of the damages. Third, many pollution harms
have long latency periods, meaning that by the time the harm has manifested itself, actions are
barred because of statutes of limitations. In some jurisdictions, however, such statutes begin to run
only with the discovery of the harm, not the imposition of the risk. Fourth, many environmental
impacts, such as induced disease, are stochastic by nature, that is, environmental exposure increases
the probability of morbidity or mortality. In such cases, it is difficult or impossible to determine
with certainty the source of environmental harm. Evidentiary rules that require “a preponderance
of the evidence” showing that the plaintiff caused the defendant’s harm would not allow recovery
under these circumstances. Fifth, a polluter may not have sufficient solvency to pay a large damage
award, and the difference between the polluter’s total solvency and the full damages will be
externalized onto the public.98

        Nevertheless, liability rules have a central role to play in environmental regulation, because
other regulatory tools give rise to their own sets of problems. There are important choices that need
to be made in designing liability rules, however. Should polluters be held jointly and severally liable
for the harm they cause? Non-jointly liable? Is a negligence rule preferable to a strict liability rule,


95
 For economic analyses of the Superfund program, see, for example: Hamilton (1993); Gupta,Van Houtven, and
Cropper (1996); and Hamilton and Viscusi (1999).
96
  Ex post and ex ante legal regimes transmit different incentives to private actors. Shavell (1984) argued that the choice
between the two regimes should be considered in light of four factors. First, a liability regime might be preferable if
private parties have better information than a regulating authority regarding the risks of productive activities. Second,
the greater the likelihood that a private party will not be able to pay fully for a harm, the more attractive is a regulatory
regime. Third, the greater the chance that private parties will not face the threat of a lawsuit, the more should regulation
be favored. Fourth, the administrative costs associated with the two regimes generally weigh in favor of a liability
scheme. Also see: Kolstad, Ulen, and Johnson (1990).
97
  This section draws upon Kornhauser and Revesz (2000).
98
 Further, a liability scheme may give private actors an incentive to shed their solvency (through dividends to their
shareholders, for example) in order to avoid paying large awards (Kornhauser and Revesz 1990).

                                                            42
or vice-versa? Moreover, which parties should be held liable? Polluters? Site owners? Alternative
liability regimes transmit different sets of incentives to private actors and can have dramatically
different effects.

3.1.2.6.1 Joint and Several versus Non-Joint Liability

         When a plaintiff’s injury results from the actions of multiple parties, the choice between joint
and several and non-joint liability arises. Under joint and several liability, the plaintiff can recover
the full amount of damages from any one of the defendants who share responsibility for the damage.
Under a system of non-joint liability, a plaintiff can only recover from a defendant the share of
damages attributable to that defendant.

         Several choices must be made with respect to any joint and several liability regime. First,
joint and several liability regimes may or may not allow for contribution, whereby a defendant that
has paid a disproportionately large share of a particular damage award will be compensated by
parties that have paid disproportionately small shares of that award. Second, contribution shares can
be determined either by reference to comparative fault or on a pro rata basis. Third, in the event
that a plaintiff settles with one defendant, the regime must specify by how much the total damage
award against the remaining defendants ought to be reduced (“set-off”). Under a “pro tanto set-off
rule,” the plaintiff’s claim against the non-settling defendant is reduced by the amount of the
settlement. In contrast, under an apportioned or proportional share set-off rule, the plaintiff’s claim
against the non-settling defendant is reduced by the share of the liability attributable to the settling
defendant. Fourth, when one defendant settles and another defendant litigates and loses, the regime
must specify whether, under the pro tanto set-off rule, the settling defendant is protected against
contribution actions. Fifth, the legal regime must also indicate whether settling defendants can bring
actions for contribution against defendants who settle for less than their share of liability.

        Sixth, joint-and-several regimes sometimes protect non-settling defendants from a plaintiff’s
inadequately low settlements with other defendants through a “good faith” hearing on the
settlement’s adequacy. And seventh, the regime must specify whether a sued defendant can join a
third-party defendant that the plaintiff has declined to name. These choices among rules can have
significant impacts on deterrence (Kornhauser and Revesz 1989, 1990), as well as on the likelihood
of inducing settlements.99

3.1.2.6.2 Liability Extension

        On whom is liability imposed? Assume that there are two groups of actors: waste generators
and disposal site owners. One or both could potentially be held liable for problems associated with
the disposal of waste. What liability scheme would be preferable on the grounds of efficiency and
deterrence?

        A legal regime might impose liability solely on the owner of a hazardous waste site and
refuse to extend liability to the generators of that waste. Site owners will, under this regime, bear


99
 The impact of the possibility of settlement on the choice-of-regime analysis is analyzed in Kornhauser and Revesz
1994a, 1994b.

                                                       43
the full costs of the hazardous waste they receive. In a competitive market, disposal site owners will
tend to charge generators the marginal cost of disposal. Site owners will have incentives to accept
only waste that can properly be disposed of, based on geologic conditions of the site, possible
interactions between different types of waste, and other relevant factors. To reduce their disposal
costs, generators may seek to reduce the quantity of hazardous waste they produce, and will send
their hazardous waste to sites that can process the wastes most effectively — and hence to the sites
where wastes will cause the least harm.

         While theoretically sound, such full internalization of the site owner’s costs is unlikely in
practice. Cleanup costs for hazardous waste sites can be extraordinarily large,100 and site owners
will likely not be sufficiently solvent to pay total cleanup costs in the event of a high-cost problem.
If the probability of such an event occurring is not zero, if the site owner’s solvency is less than the
full costs associated with that event, and if the site owner does not fully insure against the risk, then
the site owner will not bear the full cost, and will charge a price that will not reflect the full cost of
remediation (Shavell 1997; Pitchford 1995).

        There are two possible solutions to the problem of insolvency (Shavell 1995). First, polluters
could be asked to post a bond equal to possible remediation costs. Given the large costs of
environmental clean-up, however, such bonds may drive potential polluters out of the market.
Second, polluters can be required to carry insurance for potential liabilities.101 Because insurance
companies’ monitoring costs are likely to be high, however, they will only be able to issue insurance
based on easily observable factors unrelated to whether the polluter is taking due care to reduce its
pollution. Hence, the polluter’s premiums will not be reduced if it takes due care, and a significant
moral hazard problem arises. Insurance may therefore be unavailable in the environmental context
(Abraham 1988). Moreover, minimum asset requirements could have socially undesirable effects
by banning from the activity actors that derive benefits that are higher than the harms they imposed,
even in light of their reduced incentives to take care caused by their limited solvency (Shavell 2005).

         As an alternative, liability could be extended only to the generators of hazardous waste, so
that the generators bear the full cleanup costs associated with their waste production. In this case,
generators could achieve efficient disposal costs in one of two ways. First, generators could shift
liability onto site owners by offering them a payment in exchange for an indemnification agreement.
This solution is, as discussed above, hampered by the problem of insolvency. Alternatively, to
coordinate efficiently and keep their liability to a minimum, generators could contract among
themselves to dispose of specified waste at specified locations. There are two difficulties with this
approach. First, transaction costs are likely to be prohibitively large, and generators are therefore
likely to act in a non-cooperative manner (Kornhauser and Revesz 1994a). Moreover, whether
generators are subject to either joint and several or non-joint liability, a strict liability regime applied
to a group of generators produces under-deterrence (Kornhauser and Revesz 1989, 1995).



100
 The average cleanup cost for a site on the Superfund National Priorities List is $30 million, with many exceeding $100
million.
101
  A voluntary insurance program will prove inadequate because low-solvency polluters will have no incentive to
purchase insurance for a cost they will never bear.

                                                         44
        The second problem relates, again, to solvency. Low-solvency generators have less incentive
than high-solvency generators to produce an optimal amount of waste. One would expect that high-
solvency generators will thus refuse to contract with their low-solvency counterparts, particularly
under joint and several liability regimes, where high-solvency generators may be held liable for the
full amount of damages caused by low-solvency generators. This distortion of the contracting
patterns can reduce welfare (Boyd and Ingberman 1997). A non-joint liability regime produces the
same result if the damages at the site are allocated among generators proportionally to the amount
of waste dumped, and the damage function is convex. In that scenario, one generator’s decision to
dump more than the optimal amount results in higher liability for the other generators (Kornhauser
and Revesz 1989).

         Finally, given that extending liability solely to site owners or solely to generators results in
inefficiencies, liability regimes that target a larger set of parties can achieve two goals. First, such
a regime can transmit proper incentives to a larger group of actors. Thus, even if a site owner should
become insolvent, generators will have an incentive to continue monitoring. Second, dividing
liability between a number of actors can decrease the likelihood of insolvency.

3.1.3 Cross-Cutting Issues

        Three cross-cutting issues stand out in the normative analysis of environmental policy
instrument choice: the implications of uncertainty; effects on technological change; and
distributional considerations.

3.1.3.1 Implications of Uncertainty for Instrument Choice

        The dual task facing policy makers of choosing environmental goals and selecting policy
instruments to achieve those goals must be carried out in the presence of the significant uncertainty
that affects the benefits and the costs of environmental protection. Since Weitzman's (1974) classic
paper on "Prices vs. Quantities," it has been generally acknowledged that benefit uncertainty on its
own has no effect on the identity of the efficient control instrument, but that cost uncertainty can
have significant effects, depending upon the relative slopes of the marginal benefit (damage) and
marginal cost functions. In particular, if uncertainty about marginal abatement costs is significant,
and if marginal abatement costs are flat relative to marginal benefits, then a quantity instrument is
more efficient than a price instrument.102

        We rarely encounter situations in which there is exclusively either benefit uncertainty or cost
uncertainty. On the contrary, in the environmental arena, we typically find that the two are present
simultaneously, and more often than not, it is benefit uncertainty that is of substantially greater
magnitude. When marginal benefits are positively correlated with marginal costs (which, it turns out,
is not uncommon), then there is an additional argument in favor of the relative efficiency of quantity
instruments (Stavins 1996). On the other hand, the regulation of stock pollutants will often favor
price instruments, because the marginal benefit function — linked with the stock of pollution — will
tend to be relatively flat, compared with the marginal cost function — linked with the flow of
pollution (Newell and Pizer 2003b).


102
   For an early empirical application in the environmental realm, see: Kolstad (1986).

                                                         45
        In theory, there would be considerable efficiency advantages in the presence of uncertainty
of hybrid systems — for example, quotas combined with taxes — or non-linear taxes103 (Roberts and
Spence 1976; Weitzman 1978; Kaplow and Shavell 2002b; Pizer 2002), but such systems have not
been adopted.

3.1.3.2 Effects of Instrument Choice on Technological Change

        Environmental policy interventions foster constraints and incentives that affect the process
of technological change (Kneese and Schultze 1975; Orr 1976). To be dynamically cost-effective,
instruments need to foster rather than inhibit technological invention, innovation, and diffusion
(Kemp and Soete 1990). Both command-and-control and market-based instruments have the
potential for forcing or inducing technological change, by requiring firms to alter their behavior.
Technology and performance standards can be used to stimulate innovation by setting ambitious
targets, beyond the reach of current technologies. But it is impossible to know whether a given
target will be feasible or not, and so such policies run substantial risk of failure (Freeman and
Haveman 1972). Technology standards are particularly problematic, because they tend to freeze the
development of technologies that might otherwise result in greater levels of control.

       Much of the economic research on technological invention and innovation
(commercialization) has focused on incentives for firm-level decisions to incur costs of research and
development in the face of uncertain outcomes. The earliest relevant work was by Magat (1978;
1979), who compared taxes, subsidies, permits, effluent standards, and technology standards, and
showed that all but technology standards would induce innovation biased toward emissions
reduction. More recent theoretical attempts to rank policy instruments according to their innovation-
stimulating effects (Fischer, Parry and Pizer 2003) conclude that an unambiguous rating of
instruments is not possible. The ranking of instruments depends on the innovator’s ability to
appropriate spillover benefits of new technologies to other firms, the costs of innovation,
environmental benefit functions, and the number of firms producing emissions (Carraro and
Soubeyran 1996; Katsoulacos and Xepapadeas 1996; Montero 2002).

         Turning to technological diffusion (adoption), several theoretical studies have found that the
incentive for the adoption of new technologies is greater under market-based instruments than under
direct regulation (Zerbe 1970; Downing and White 1986; Milliman and Prince 1989), but theoretical
comparisons among market-based instruments have produced only limited agreement (Milliman and
Prince 1989; Marin 1991; Milliman and Prince 1992; Jung, Krutilla and Boyd 1996; Parry 1998;
Denicolò 1999; Keohane 1999.) One overall result seems to be that auctioned permits are inferior
in their diffusion incentives to emissions tax systems (but both are superior to command-and-control
instruments).104




103
  In addition to the efficiency advantages of non-linear taxes, they also have the attribute of reducing the total (although
not the marginal) tax burden of the regulated sector, relative to an ordinary linear tax, which is potentially important
in a political economy context.
104
  For a detailed review of analyses of the effects of instrument choice on technological innovation and diffusion, see
Jaffe, Newell, and Stavins (2002).

                                                            46
         Closely related to the effects of instrument choice on technological change are the effects
of vintage-differentiated regulation on the rate of capital turnover, and thereby on pollution
abatement costs and environmental performance. Such vintage-differentiated regulation is a
common feature of many environmental and other regulatory policies in the United States, wherein
the standard for regulated units is fixed in terms of their date of entry, with later vintages facing
more stringent regulation. In the most common application, commonly referred to as
“grandfathering,” units produced prior to a specific date are exempted from a new regulation or face
less stringent requirements.

        While this approach has long appealed to many participants in the policy community,
economists have frequently noted that vintage-differentiated regulations can be expected — on the
basis of standard investment theory — to retard turnover in the capital stock, and thereby to reduce
the cost-effectiveness of regulation, compared with equivalent undifferentiated regulations.
Furthermore, under some conditions the result can be higher levels of pollutant emissions than
would occur in the absence of regulation. Such economic and environmental consequences are not
only predictions from theory (Gruenspecht 1981; Maloney and Brady 1988); both types of
consequences have been validated empirically in the context of specific regulations (Hartman,
Bazdogan, and Nadkarni 1979; Gruenspecht 1982; Nelson, Tietenberg, Donihue 1993).

3.1.3.3 Distributional Considerations

        Alternative policy instruments can have significantly different impacts on the distribution
of benefits and costs. First with regard to benefits, taxes or tradeable permits can lead to localized
"hot spots" with relatively high levels of ambient pollution. This is a significant distributional issue,
and it can also become an efficiency issue if damages are non-linearly related to pollutant
concentrations (Mendelsohn 1986). The problem can be addressed, in theory, through the use of
“ambient permits”105 or through charge systems that are keyed to changes in ambient conditions at
specified locations (Revesz 1996), or through trading schemes that are simply constrained by the
requirement that ambient standards not be violated.106 Despite the theoretical literature on ambient
systems going back to Montgomery (1972), they have never been implemented,107 with the partial
exception of a two-zone trading system under Los Angeles’ RECLAIM program.108




105
  Ambient permits entitle the owner to increase the concentration at a certain receptor site by a specified amount, rather
than permitting some quantity of emissions.
106
  In theory, the locus of regulation can range from input levels (for example, through the use of a permit linked to the
carbon content of fossil fuels), to emissions, to ambient concentrations, to exposure levels, to — ultimately — risk
levels.
107
   Such systems can be difficult to implement. If there are many significant receptor sties, the implementation of
tradeable permits will require separate markets for each type of permit. For a review of ambient permit approaches, see
Tietenberg (1995).
108
  In the case of RECLAIM, empirical analysis indicated that a substantial share of the relevant heterogeneity in
concentrations would be captured by employing just two zones (Johnson and Pekelney 1996).

                                                           47
         Turning to the cost side, taxes and auctioned tradeable permits can raise revenue for the
government.109 Revenue recycling (that is, using tax or permit revenues to reduce other,
distortionary taxes) can significantly lower the costs of pollution control, relative to what the costs
would be without such recycling (Jorgenson and Wilcoxen 1994; Goulder 1995b). It has been
suggested by some that all of the abatement costs associated with a pollution tax can be eliminated
through revenue recycling (Repetto, et al. 1992), but environmental taxes can exacerbate distortions
associated with remaining taxes on investment or labor, and research indicates that these distortions
are at least as great as those from labor taxes (Bovenberg and de Mooij 1994; Goulder 1995a; Parry
1995; Bovenberg and Goulder 1996; Goulder, Perry, and Burtraw 1997; Goulder et al. 1999).

        Although distribution affects social welfare, an important strand of the theoretical literature
suggests that distribution should not matter in choosing policy instruments. Hylland and Zeckhauser
(1979) argue that given optimal taxation achieved by benefit-offsetting tax adjustments, maximizing
net benefits should be the sole criterion for policy choice.110 Despite its limitations, the income tax
system is, in theory, best suited for redistributing income, with attempts at redistribution through
other means causing inefficiencies that are at least as great as those encountered with income taxes.
Moreover, Kaplow and Shavell (2001) demonstrate that any policy assessment that accords
importance to non-utility criteria (including societal concerns for distribution) violates the Pareto
principle, suggesting that environmental issues should be addressed ideally through a pair of
policies: an efficient environmental policy instrument chosen solely on the basis of maximizing net
benefits, and an income tax adjustment to offset possible undesirable distributional impacts.111

        Political economy considerations may run counter to such theoretical arguments, since it is
difficult to combine every environmental policy rule with a change in the income tax system. It may
also be politically infeasible to adopt environmental policies that do not themselves address
distributional concerns. Indeed, Arrow et al. (1996b) argue that the Kaldor-Hicks criterion should
be considered as neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for public policy.112

        A policy’s political feasibility is influenced strongly by its distributional implications.
Auctioned permit systems or effluent charges can be more costly than comparable command-and-
control instruments from the perspective of regulated firms. Tradeable permit systems, on the other
hand, have the important attribute that in the absence of decreasing marginal transactions costs
(essentially volume discounts), the equilibrium allocation and hence aggregate abatement costs of
a tradeable permit system are independent of initial allocations (Stavins 1995). Hence, the allocation
decision can be left to politicians, with limited normative concerns about the potential effects of the
chosen allocation on overall cost-effectiveness. In other words, cost-effectiveness or efficiency can


109
  While an allocation of permits made through sale or auction will have similar distributional consequences to a tax,
a revenue-neutral emissions tax, in which revenues are refunded to regulated firms (but not in proportion to their
emissions levels), can resemble — in distributional terms — a comparable tradeable permit program in which the
permits are allocated without charge.
110
   Shavell (1981) and Kaplow and Shavell (1994) extended this result to legal rulemaking.
111
   See: Kaplow 1996 and 2004. For a broader discussion of the underlying issues, see Kaplow and Shavell (2002a).

be achieved, while distributional equity is simultaneously addressed with the same policy
instrument.113

3.1.4 Normative Lessons

       Although there has been considerable experience in the United States with market-based
instruments for environmental protection, this relatively new set of policy approaches has not
replaced nor come anywhere close to replacing conventional, command-and-control policies. When
and where these approaches have been used in their purest form and with some success, they have
not always performed as anticipated. We review briefly the normative lessons that can be learned
from research and experience.

3.1.4.1 Design and Implementation

       The performance to date of market-based instruments for environmental protection provides
evidence that these approaches can achieve major cost savings while accomplishing their
environmental objectives. The performance of these systems also offers lessons about the
importance of flexibility, simplicity, and the capabilities of the private sector.

        In regard to flexibility, allowing flexible timing and intertemporal trading of permits — that
is, banking allowances for future use — played a very important role in the SO2 allowance trading
program's performance (Ellerman et al. 1997), much as it did in the U.S. lead rights trading program
a decade earlier (Kerr and Maré 1997).114 One of the most significant benefits of using market-based
instruments may simply be that technology standards are thereby avoided. Less flexible systems
would not have led to the technological change that may have been induced by market-based
instruments (Burtraw 1996; Ellerman and Montero 1998; Bohi and Burtraw 1997; Keohane 2001),
nor the induced process innovations that have resulted (Doucet and Strauss 1994).

        In regard to simplicity, transparent formulae — whether for permit allocation or tax
computation — are difficult to contest or manipulate. Requiring prior government approval of
individual trades may increase uncertainty and transaction costs, thereby discouraging trading; these
negative effects should be balanced against any anticipated benefits due to requiring prior
government approval. Such requirements hampered EPA's Emissions Trading Program in the 1970s,
while the lack of such requirements was an important factor in the success of lead trading (Hahn and
Hester 1989). In the case of SO2 trading, the absence of requirements for prior approval reduced
uncertainty for utilities and administrative costs for government, and contributed to low transactions
costs (Rico 1995).


113
   This is one of the reasons why an international tradeable permit mechanism has been considered to be particularly
attractive for addressing global climate change. Allocation mechanisms can be developed that address equity concerns
of developing countries, and thus increase the political base for support, without jeopardizing the overall
cost-effectiveness of the system. See, for example, Frankel (1999). It should be recognized, however, that in practice
tradeable permits have typically not been allocated to achieve goals of distributional equity per se, but to achieve
political feasibility (Joskow and Schmalensee 1998).
114
  In theory, a fully cost-effective permit trading program must allow for both banking and borrowing (Rubin 1996;
Kling and Rubin 1997).

                                                         49
         One potentially important cause of the mixed performance of implemented market-based
instruments is that many firms are simply not well equipped to make the decisions necessary to fully
utilize these instruments. The focus of environmental, health, and safety departments in private
firms has been primarily on problem avoidance and risk management, rather than on the creation
of opportunities made possible by market-based instruments. Since market-based instruments have
been used on a limited basis only, and firms are not certain that these instruments will be a lasting
component on the regulatory landscape, it is not surprising that most companies have not
reorganized their internal structure to fully exploit the cost savings these instruments offer
(Reinhardt 2000). Rather, most firms continue to have organizations that are experienced in
minimizing the costs of complying with command-and-control regulations, not in making the
strategic decisions allowed by market-based instruments.115

3.1.4.2 Identifying New Applications

       Market-based policy instruments are considered today for nearly every environmental
problem that is raised, ranging from endangered species preservation to global climate change.116
Where the cost of abating pollution differs widely among sources, a market-based system is likely
to have greater gains, relative to conventional, command-and-control regulations (Newell and
Stavins 2003). For example, it was clear early on that SO2 abatement cost heterogeneity was great,
because of differences in ages of plants and their proximity to sources of low-sulfur coal. But where
abatement costs are more uniform across sources, the political costs of enacting an allowance trading
approach are less likely to be justifiable.

        The choice of market-based instrument should depend on the characteristics of the pollutant,
the degree of uncertainty, expected changes in the economic environment, ability to induce
technological change, potential transactions costs, and other significant interacting factors. Finally,
considerations of political feasibility point to the wisdom (more likely success) of proposing market-
based instruments when they can be used to facilitate a cost-effective, aggregate emissions reduction
(as in the case of the SO2 allowance trading program in 1990), as opposed to a cost-effective
reallocation of the status quo burden.

3.2 Positive Issues and Analysis

        A set of positive political economy questions are raised by the increasing use of market-
based instruments for environmental protection.117 First, why was there so little use of market-based
instruments in the United States, relative to command-and-control instruments, over the 30-year
period of major environmental regulation that began in 1970, despite the apparent advantages these


115
   There are, of course, exceptions. See: Hockenstein, Stavins, and Whitehead (1997). There is anecdotal evidence
which may suggest that the existence of tradeable permit programs is changing the way firms evaluate environmental
risk (Hartridge 2003; Tientenberg 2003).
116
  See, for example, Goldstein (1991) on species protection, and Fisher et al. (1996); Hahn and Stavins (1995);
Schmalensee (1998); and Stavins (1997) on applications to global climate change. More broadly, see: Ayres (2000).
117
  This section of the chapter draws upon: Keohane, Revesz and Stavins (1998); Hahn and Stavins (1991); and Stavins
(1998).

                                                       50
instruments offer? Second, when market-based instruments have been adopted, why has there been
such great reliance on tradeable permits allocated without charge, despite the availability of a much
broader set of incentive-based instruments? Third, why has the political attention given to market-
based environmental policy instruments increased dramatically in recent years?

        To examine these questions, we employ a “political market” metaphor (Keohane, Revesz,
and Stavins 1998). The commodity being supplied is legislators’ support for a given policy
instrument, and the currency is resources that can be used for re-election — contributions,
endorsements, votes, and other forms of support. Demand for legislative outcomes comes from
interest groups, including environmental advocacy organizations, private firms, industry
associations, organized labor, and consumers. Ultimately, the choice of environmental policy
instrument is determined by the equilibrium between demand by interest groups and supply by
legislators and regulators.

3.2.1 Historical Dominance of Command-and-Control

        On the regulatory demand side, affected firms and their trade associations prefer instruments
that have lower aggregate costs for their industry, or that increase aggregate profits by creating rents
or barriers to entry. An individual firm may actually prefer regulation to the status quo if that
regulation gives the firm a competitive advantage over rivals.118 Command-and-control standards
have the potential to generate rents for existing firms in an industry, increasing aggregate profits.
Regulations that establish long-term barriers to entry can sustain these profits indefinitely and will
be strongly preferred by industry groups (Buchanan and Tullock 1975; Maloney and McCormick
1982). Command-and-control standards are inevitably set up with extensive input from industry,
and frequently contain more stringent requirements for new sources and other effective barriers to
entry (Stigler 1971; Rasmusen and Zupan 1991). Firms also tend to favor command-and-control
regulation or grandfathered permits over pollution taxes or auctioned permits because they shift less
of the distributional burden onto private industry (Arnold 1995; Crandall 1983; Hahn and Noll
1990). Auctioned permits and pollution taxes require firms to pay not only abatement costs, but also
regulatory costs in the form of permit purchases or tax payments.

        Environmental advocacy groups are also on the demand side of the market for legislative
support. Such groups seek to maximize their utility, which depends on both their organizational
well-being and the level of environmental quality. For a long time, nearly all environmental
advocacy groups were actively hostile towards market-based instruments. One reason was
philosophical: environmentalists frequently perceived pollution taxes and tradeable permits as
“licenses to pollute.” Although such ethical objections to the use of market-based environmental
strategies have greatly diminished, they have not disappeared completely (Sandel 1997).119 A


118
  There are other possible explanations for firms’ preferences, including the possibility that existing agents tend to
support the status quo for fear that their expertise will be devalued under new regimes. There is also the possibility that
market-based instruments were opposed simply because they were not well understood (Kelman 1981b).
119
  Sandel (1997) argues that emissions trading will foster “immoral” behavior by giving firms a “license to pollute,”
despite the fact that pollution taxes and tradeable permits create incentives for firms to decrease pollution. See Shavell,
Stavins, Gaines, and Maskin (1997) for replies to Sandel’s arguments. For a broader examination of the ethical
limitations of markets in other arenas, see Sandel (1998).

                                                           51
second concern was that damages from pollution were difficult or impossible to quantify and
monetize, and thus could not be summed up in a marginal damage function or captured by a
Pigovian tax rate (Kelman 1981a). Third, environmental organizations have opposed market-based
schemes for strategic reasons, particularly the fear that permit levels and tax rates — once
implemented — would be more difficult to tighten over time than command-and-control standards.
For example, if permits are given the status of “property rights,” then any subsequent attempt by
government to reduce pollution levels further could meet with demands for compensation.120
Finally, environmental organizations have objected to decentralized instruments on the technical
grounds that even if emission taxes or tradeable permits reduce overall levels of emissions, they can
— in theory — lead to localized "hot spots" with relatively high levels of ambient pollution.

        The final influential group demanding support from legislators is organized labor. Labor
groups can be expected to seek protection for jobs, and they may oppose instruments that are likely
to lead to plant closings or major industrial dislocations. For example, labor might oppose a
tradeable permit scheme in which firms would tend to close factories in heavily polluted areas, sell
permits, and relocate to less polluted areas where permits are cheaper (Hahn and Noll 1990). In the
case of restrictions on clean air, organized labor has taken the side of the United Mine Workers,
whose members are heavily concentrated in eastern mines that produce higher-sulfur coal, and had
therefore opposed pollution-control measures that would increase incentives for using low-sulfur
coal from the largely non-unionized (and less labor-intensive) mines in Wyoming's and Montana’s
Powder River Basin. In the 1977 debates over amendments to the Clean Air Act, organized labor
fought to include a command-and-control standard that effectively required scrubbing, thereby
seeking to discourage switching to cleaner western coal (Ackerman and Hassler 1981). Likewise,
the United Mine Workers opposed the SO2 allowance trading system in 1990, because of a fear that
it would encourage a shift to western low-sulfur coal from non-unionized mines.

        Turning to the supply side of environmental regulation, legislators may be thought of as
providing support as a function of the opportunity cost of supporting a given instrument, the
psychological cost associated with their ideological preferences, and the losses or gains of
constituency support as a result of an action (Keohane, Revesz and Stavins 1998). Legislators have
had a number of reasons to find command-and-control standards attractive. First, many legislators
and their staffs are trained in law, which may predispose them to favor conventional regulatory
approaches and lead to a status quo bias in favor of command-and-control approaches (Kneese and
Schulze 1975). Second, standards tend to help hide the costs of pollution control (McCubbins and
Sullivan 1984; Hahn 1987), while market-based instruments generally impose those costs more
directly. Third, standards offer greater opportunities for symbolic politics, because strict standards
— strong statements of support for environmental protection — can readily be combined with less
visible exemptions or with lax enforcement measures.




120
  This concern was alleviated in the SO2 provisions of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 by an explicit statutory
provision that permits do not represent property rights.

                                                        52
         Fourth, if politicians are risk averse, they will prefer instruments that involve more certain
         121
effects.      The flexibility inherent in market-based instruments creates uncertainty about
distributional impacts. Typically, legislators in a representative democracy are more concerned with
the geographic distribution of costs and benefits than with comparisons of total benefits and costs.
Hence, aggregate cost-effectiveness — the major advantage of market-based instruments — is less
likely to play a significant role in the legislative calculus than whether a politician is getting a good
deal for his or her constituents (Shepsle and Weingast 1984).

       Finally, legislators are wary of enacting programs that are likely to be undermined by
bureaucrats in their implementation. And bureaucrats are less likely to undermine legislative
decisions if their own preferences over policy instruments are accommodated. Bureaucratic
preferences — at least in the past — were not supportive of market-based instruments. Government
bureaucrats — like their counterparts in environmental advocacy groups and trade associations —
opposed market-based instruments to prevent their expertise from becoming obsolete, that is, to
preserve their human capital (Hahn and Stavins 1991).122

3.2.2 Prevalence of Tradeable Permits Allocated Without Charge

        Economic theory suggests that the choice among tradeable permits, pollution taxes, and other
market-based instruments should be based upon case-specific factors, but major applications in the
United States have nearly always taken the form of tradeable permits allocated without charge,
rather than through auctions,123 despite the apparent economic superiority of the latter mechanism
in terms of economic efficiency. Many participants in the policy process have reasons to favor
tradeable permits allocated without charge over other market-based instruments.

        On the regulatory demand side, existing firms favor tradeable permits allocated without
charge because such permits convey rents to firms. Moreover, like stringent command-and-control
standards for new sources, but unlike auctioned permits or taxes, permits allocated without charge
give rise to entry barriers, since new entrants must purchase permits from existing holders. Thus,
the rents conveyed to the private sector by tradeable permits allocated without charge are, in effect,
sustainable.

        Environmental advocacy groups have generally supported command-and-control approaches,
but given the choice between tradeable permits and emission taxes, these groups strongly prefer the
former. Environmental advocates have a strong incentive to avoid policy instruments that make the
costs of environmental protection highly visible to consumers and voters; and taxes make those costs


121
  Legislators are likely to behave as if they are risk averse, even if they are personally risk neutral, if their constituents
punish unpredictable policy choices or their reelection probability is nearly unity (McCubbins, Noll, and Weingast,
1989).
122
   Subsequently, this same incentive led EPA staff involved in the acid rain program to become strong proponents of
trading for a variety of other pollution problems.
123
   The EPA does have an annual (revenue-neutral) auction of SO2 allowances, but this represents less than 2 percent of
the total allocation (Bailey 1996). While the EPA auctions may have helped in establishing the market for SO2
allowances, they are a trivial part of the overall program (Joskow, Schmalensee, and Bailey 1998).

                                                             53
more explicit than permits. Also, environmental advocates prefer permit schemes because they
specify the quantity of pollution reduction that will be achieved, in contrast with the indirect effect
of pollution taxes. Overall, some environmental groups have come to endorse the tradeable permits
approach because it promises the cost savings of pollution taxes, but without the drawbacks that
environmentalists associate with tax instruments.

        Tradeable permits allocated without charge are easier for legislators to supply than taxes or
auctioned permits, again because the costs imposed on industry are less visible and less burdensome,
since no money is exchanged at the time of the initial permit allocation. Also, permits allocated
without charge offer a much greater degree of political control over the distributional effects of
regulation, facilitating the formation of majority coalitions. Joskow and Schmalensee (1998)
examined the political process of allocating SO2 allowances in the 1990 amendments, and found that
allocating permits on the basis of prior emissions can produce fairly clear winners and losers among
firms and states. An auction allows no such political maneuvering.

3.2.3 Increased Attention to Market-Based Instruments

        Interest in and use of incentive-based instruments has increased at both the Federal and state
levels in recent years (Hahn 2000). Given the historical lack of receptiveness by the political
process to market-based approaches to environmental protection, why has there been this rise in the
use of these approaches? It would be gratifying to believe that increased understanding of market-
based instruments had played a large part in fostering their increased political acceptance, but how
important has this really been?

        In 1981, Kelman surveyed Congressional staff members, and found that support and
opposition to market-based environmental policy instruments was based largely on ideological
grounds: Republicans, who supported the concept of economic-incentive approaches, offered as a
reason the assertion that “the free market works,” or “less government intervention” is desirable,
without any real awareness or understanding of the economic arguments for market-based programs.
Likewise, Democratic opposition was largely based upon ideological factors, with little or no
apparent understanding of the real advantages or disadvantages of the various instruments (Kelman
1981b). What would happen if we were to replicate Kelman’s survey today? Our refutable
hypothesis is that we would find increased support from Republicans, greatly increased support from
Democrats, but insufficient improvements in understanding to explain these changes.124 So what
else has mattered?

        First, one factor has surely been increased pollution control costs, which have led to greater
interest from all parties in cost-effective instruments. By the late 1980’s, even political liberals and
environmentalists were beginning to question whether conventional regulations could produce
further gains in environmental quality. During the previous twenty years, pollution abatement costs
had continually increased, as stricter standards moved the private sector up the marginal abatement-
cost function. By 1990, U.S. pollution control costs had reached $125 billion annually, nearly a


124
  But there has been some increased understanding of market-based approaches among policy makers. This has partly
been due to increased understanding by their staffs, a function — to some degree — of the economics training that is
now common in law schools, and of the proliferation of schools of public policy (Hahn and Stavins 1991).

                                                        54
300% increase in real terms from 1972 levels (U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 1990; Jaffe
et al. 1995). Market-based instruments represent an effective way to reduce aggregate abatement
costs.

        Second, a factor that became important in the late 1980’s was strong and vocal support from
some segments of the environmental community. By supporting tradeable permits for acid rain
control, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) seized a market niche in the environmental
movement, and successfully distinguished itself from other groups.125 Related to this, a third factor
was that the SO2 allowance trading program, the leaded gasoline phasedown, and the CFC phaseout
were all designed to reduce emissions, not simply to reallocate them cost-effectively among sources.
Market-based instruments are most likely to be politically acceptable when proposed to achieve
environmental improvements that would not otherwise be feasible (politically or economically).

        Fourth, deliberations regarding the SO2 allowance system, the lead system, and CFC trading
differed from previous attempts by economists to influence environmental policy in an important
way: the separation of ends from means, i.e. the separation of consideration of goals and targets
from the policy instruments used to achieve those targets. By accepting the politically identified
(and potentially inefficient) goal, the ten-million ton reduction of SO2 emissions, for example,
economists were able to focus successfully on the importance of adopting a cost-effective means of
achieving that goal. Fifth, acid rain was an unregulated problem until the SO2 allowance trading
program of 1990; and the same can be said for leaded gasoline and CFC’s. Hence, there were no
existing constituencies — in the private sector, the environmental advocacy community, or
government — for the status quo approach, because there was no status quo approach.

        Sixth, by the late 1980’s, there had already been a perceptible shift of the political center
toward a more favorable view of using markets to solve social problems. The George H. W. Bush
Administration, which proposed the SO2 allowance trading program and then championed it through
an initially resistant Democratic Congress, was (at least in its first two years) “moderate
Republican;” and phrases such as “fiscally responsible environmental protection” and “harnessing
market forces to protect the environment” do have the sound of quintessential moderate Republican
issues.126 But, beyond this, support for market-oriented solutions to various social problems had
been increasing across the political spectrum for the previous fifteen years, as was evidenced by
deliberations on deregulation of the airline, telecommunications, trucking, railroad, and banking
industries. Indeed, by the mid-1990s, the concept (or at least the phrase), “market-based
environmental policy,” had evolved from being politically problematic to politically attractive.




125
  When the memberships (and financial resources) of other environmental advocacy groups subsequently declined with
the election of the environmentally-friendly Clinton-Gore Administration, EDF continued to prosper and grow (Lowry
1993). EDF has since renamed itself “Environmental Defense.”
126
  The Reagan Administration enthusiastically embraced a market-oriented ideology, but demonstrated little interest in
employing actual market-based policies in the environmental area. From the Bush Administration through the Clinton
Administration, interest and activity regarding market-based instruments — particularly tradeable permit systems —
continued to increase, although the pace of activity in terms of newly implemented programs declined during the Clinton
years, when a considerable part of the related focus was on global climate policy (Hahn, Olmstead, and Stavins 2003).

      4. ALLOCATION OF RESPONSIBILITY ACROSS LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT

       Throughout most of U.S. history, state and local governments have had primary
responsibility for health-and-safety regulation, including environmental protection,127 but since 1970,
the Federal government has played an increasingly important role in environmental regulation
(Revesz 2001a). What regulatory advantages or disadvantages does the Federal government have,
compared with state governments? What does this suggest about how regulatory responsibility
should be allocated?

4.1 Positive Review of Responsibility of Levels of Government

        Before 1970, Congress largely left environmental regulation to the states. As the modern
environmental movement gained political force, however, the Federal government began assembling
its regulatory framework. Congress’s first major effort came in 1969 with the passage of the
National Environmental Policy Act,128 which laid out broad environmental goals and required
Federal agencies to assess the environmental impacts of their programmatic actions.

        A set of laws passed over the subsequent two decades marked the federal government’s new-
found commitment to environmental regulation. Three statutes formed the backbone of the federal
scheme: the Clean Air Act of 1970,129 the Clean Water Act of 1972,130 and the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976,131 all of which have been amended numerous times since
their adoption. These laws, characterized by their command-and-control approaches to regulation,
granted wide discretion to the newly-created Environmental Protection Agency to set tolerance
levels for various pollutants. In addition, Congress protected endangered species,132set limits on
contaminants allowed in drinking water,133and created a system of strict joint-and-several liability
for parties responsible for abandoned hazardous waste sites.134

       Federal environmental laws typically (but with important exceptions) establish minimum
environmental standards while leaving states free to adopt more stringent standards. Many states
have done exactly that. Some have adopted tighter thresholds for automobile emissions; others have
created their own “Superfund” programs; and others have implemented their own state-based

environmental protection acts (Revesz 2001a). States also remain free to regulate in areas the
federal government has opted not to, such as wetlands preservation or groundwater quality.

4.2 Normative Review of Allocation of Regulatory Responsibility

        A rebuttable presumption in favor of decentralized authority over environmental regulation
may be posited for three reasons. First, in a large and diverse country, different regions will likely
have different environmental preferences. Second, the benefits of environmental protection vary
throughout the country. For example, a stringent air quality standard may benefit many people in
densely populated areas but only a few elsewhere. Third, the costs of meeting a given standard
differ across geographic regions.

        Federal intervention in environmental regulation has traditionally been justified by reference
to one or more of three perceived pathologies that hamper effective state regulation: the race to the
bottom induced by competition for mobile resources; the existence of significant interstate
externalities; and the public-choice rationale that environmental groups can more effectively lobby
at the Federal level than at the state level. Analysis has cast doubt on the viability of these
justifications.135

4.2.1 Competition Among Political Jurisdictions: The Race to the Bottom

         The conventional race-to-the-bottom rationale for federal regulation posits that states, in an
effort to induce geographically mobile firms to locate within their jurisdictions, will offer them sub-
optimally lax environmental standards in order to benefit from additional jobs and tax revenues. In
the absence of Federal regulation, states would therefore systematically under-regulate.

4.2.1.1 Normative Assessment of the Race-to-the-Bottom Claim

        The theoretical foundation for the view that interstate competition for industry would
inevitably lead to sub-optimally lax environmental standards is weak. Indeed, economic analysis
of the effects of interstate competition on the choice of environmental standards indicates that rather
than a race to the bottom, inter-jurisdictional competition may be expected to lead to the
maximization of social welfare, at least under conditions of perfect competition (Oates and Schwab
1988). In their model, Oates and Schwab posit jurisdictions that compete for mobile capital through
the choice of taxes and environmental standards. A higher capital stock benefits residents in the
form of higher wages, but hurts them through foregone tax revenues and lower environmental
quality. Each jurisdiction makes two policy decisions: it sets a tax rate on capital and an
environmental standard. Oates and Schwab show that competitive jurisdictions will set a net tax rate
on capital of zero (the rate that exactly covers the cost of public services provided to the capital,
such as police and fire protection). In turn, competitive jurisdictions will set an environmental
standard that is defined by equating the willingness to pay for an additional unit of environmental
quality with the corresponding change in wages. Oates and Schwab show that these choices of tax
rates and environmental standards are efficient.



135
   This section draws upon Revesz (2001b). Also see Krier (1995).

                                                      57
        When the assumption of perfect competition is relaxed, strategic interactions among the
states can lead to under-regulation absent federal intervention. But it is likewise plausible that in
other instances the reverse would be true: that the strategic interactions among the states would lead
to over-regulation absent federal intervention. Accordingly, there is no compelling race-to-the-
bottom justification for across-the-board federal minimum standards, the cornerstone of Federal
environmental law.

        The most extensive analyses of the effects of imperfect competition among states show that
either over-regulation or under-regulation can result (Markusen, Morey, and Olewiler 1993, 1995),
depending on the levels of firm-specific costs, plant-specific costs, and transportation costs.
Similarly, if a firm has market power enabling it to affect prices, it will be able to extract a sub-
optimally lax standard; but if a state has market power, the reverse would be true (Revesz 1992,
1997b). In summary, just as there are situations in which interstate competition produces
environmental under-regulation (Esty and Geradin 2001), there are other plausible scenarios under
which the result is over-regulation.

        Moreover, even if states systematically enacted sub-optimally lax environmental standards,
Federal environmental regulation would not necessarily improve the situation. If states cannot
compete over environmental regulation because it has been federalized, they will compete along
other regulatory dimensions, leading to sub-optimally lax standards in other areas, or along the fiscal
dimension, leading to the under-provision of other public goods. Thus, the reduction in social
welfare implicit in race-to-the-bottom arguments would not be eliminated by federalizing
environmental regulation. Rather, the federalization of all regulatory and fiscal decisions would be
necessary to solve the problem.136

        Several authors have attempted to rehabilitate some version of the race-to-the-bottom
justification for Federal regulation. Their arguments, however, rely on conflations of alternative
justifications for environmental regulation, such as the presence of interjurisdictional externalities
or public choice failures (Esty 1996; Esty and Geradin 2001), unsupported public-choice rationales
that are analytically distinct from the race-to-the-bottom justification (Swire 1996), weak empirical
support (Engel 1997), or circular notions that Federal environmental regulation serves to reinforce
“national evaluative norms” (Sarnoff 1997). The critics therefore fail to address two core difficulties
confronting supporters of Federal environmental regulation (Revesz 1997b). First, none are able
to explain why Federal environmental floors are an appropriate response to races that can lead either
to over-regulation or under-regulation. Regulatory ceilings would be, after all, the appropriate
Federal response to widespread over-regulation. Second, their arguments for federalizing
environmental decision-making prove too much, and tend equally to support the claim that all state
fiscal and regulatory decisions should be addressed at the Federal level.




136
  Similarly, there is a concern that absent federal regulation, firms could capture rents created by locational advantages
that otherwise would accrue to the states. But if environmental regulation is federalized, the rents could be captured
with respect to another component of costs. Only complete centralization would address the problem (Engel and Rose-
Ackerman 2001).

                                                           58
4.2.1.2 Positive Assessment of the Race-to-the-Bottom Claim

        The validity of race-to-the-bottom arguments for federal regulation cannot be resolved on
theoretical grounds alone. Empirical analysis is required, and available evidence indicates that the
stringency of environmental regulation does not have a statistically significant effect on plant
location decisions (Bartik 1988b, 1989; Friedman, Gerlowski and Silberman 1992; Levinson 1996;
McConnell and Schwab 1991).

        More generally, the empirical economic literature on the effects of environmental regulation
provides little evidence to support the hypothesis that environmental regulation has a significant
adverse effect on economic growth or on other measures of competitiveness (Jaffe et al. 1995).
Recent studies have reinforced this conclusion, finding that environmental regulation does not
reduce labor demand (Berman and Bui 2001a), and does not impair productivity (Berman and Bui
2001b). Such findings are not surprising, given that for all but the most heavily polluting industries,
the costs of complying with environmental regulation are a small share of the total costs of
production — an average of about 2 percent (Jaffe et al. 1995). It follows that the difference in
production costs among jurisdictions with relatively more stringent and relatively less stringent
environmental standards is even less. Other regulatory factors — including the level of state taxes,
the provision of public services, and the degree of unionization of a state’s labor force — have been
shown empirically to exert significant influences on location decisions, just as environmental
regulations have not (Bartik 1988b, 1989; Levinson 1996). Moreover, there is evidence that large
national or multinational firms build their plants to meet the standards of the most stringent
jurisdiction in which they have production facilities. Thus, they do not benefit from lower costs of
environmental regulation when they operate in jurisdictions with laxer standards (Jaffe et al. 1995).

         Of course, even if empirical evidence indicated that firms move from or do not locate in
jurisdictions with more stringent environmental standards, this would not necessarily indicate that
such a “race-to-the-bottom” was welfare-decreasing. A study of firm mobility measures only what
states lose as a result of more stringent environmental standards; it does not assess the corresponding
gains that may result from better environmental quality. A state that makes its environmental
standards more stringent and thereby loses some economic activity may well increase its social
welfare, if the environmental gains are greater than the losses.

4.2.2 Transboundary Environmental Problems

        In contrast to the race-to-the-bottom argument, the presence of interstate externalities
provides a potentially sound theoretical argument for Federal regulation. A state that sends pollution
to another state can obtain the benefits of the economic activity that generates the pollution, but not
suffer the full costs of that activity (Revesz 1996). Transaction costs — particularly in the case of
air pollution — are likely to be sufficiently high to prevent the formation of interstate compacts.137



137
  It is difficult for such compacts to emerge in the absence of a clearly defined baseline regarding when upwind states
have the right to send pollution downwind, and in the absence of generally accepted models for translating a source’s
emissions into ambient air quality degradation. Moreover, for different pollution sources, the range of affected states
will vary, rendering less likely the emergence of conditions favoring cooperation.

                                                         59
        The fact that interstate externalities provide a sensible justification for federal intervention
does not mean that existing federal environmental regulations can be justified on these grounds. For
some environmental problems, such as the control of drinking water quality, there are virtually no
interstate externalities; the effects are almost exclusively local. Even with respect to problems for
which interstate externalities exist, the rationale calls only for a response well targeted to the
problem, such as a limit on the quantity of pollution that can cross state lines, rather than across-the-
board Federal regulation.

         In fact, the environmental statutes have been an ineffective response to the problem of
interstate externalities. The core of the Clean Air Act, which addresses the type of pollution for
which externalities are believed to be most prevalent, consists of a series of Federally prescribed
ambient standards and emissions standards.138 The federal emission standards do not effectively
combat the problem of interstate externalities, because they do not regulate the number of sources
within a state or the location of those sources. Similarly, the federal ambient air quality standards
are not well targeted to address the problem of interstate externalities, since they require states to
restrict pollution that may have only in-state consequences, and states can meet the ambient
standards but still export pollution to downwind states (through tall stacks or locations near the
interstate border). In fact, a state might meet its ambient standards precisely because it exports a
large proportion of its pollution.139 Sections 110(a)(2)(D) and 126(b),140 enacted in 1977, are the
only provisions of the Clean Air Act specifically designed to combat interstate externalities. They
create a mechanism by which downwind states can seek to enjoin excessive upwind pollution.
During the first two decades of the program, however, no downwind state prevailed on such a claim.

4.2.3 Public Choice and Systematic Bias

        Advocates for Federal regulation on public choice grounds typically assert that state political
processes undervalue the benefits of environmental regulation, or overvalue the corresponding costs.
Even if this is true, of course, it does not follow that federalizing environmental law will necessarily
provide a solution. Federal regulation is justifiable only if the outcome at the Federal level is
socially more desirable, either because there is less under-regulation or because any over-regulation
leads to smaller social welfare losses. There are several reasons for being skeptical about the
soundness of such a claim.




138
   42 U.S.C. §§ 7409, 7411 (1994).
139
  The Federal environmental statutes have exacerbated, rather than ameliorated, the problem of interstate externalities.
In the context of the Clear Air Act, the Federal ambient standards give states an incentive to encourage sources within
their jurisdiction to use taller stacks (or to locate close to downwind borders). Not surprisingly, the use of tall stacks
expanded considerably after the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970, when only two stacks in the United States were
higher than 500 feet. By 1985, more than 180 stacks were higher than 500 feet, and 23 were higher than 1,000 feet
(Revesz 1996).

4.2.3.1 Normative Foundation for Public Choice Claims

        The public choice mechanism that makes it possible for Federal regulation to correct for
under-regulation at the state level is far from self-evident. For example, Esty (1996) states that “[a]t
the centralized level, environmental groups find it easier to reach critical mass and thereby to
compete on more equal footing with industrial interests.” He adds that the difficulty of mobilizing
the public in many separate jurisdictions is well established. In fact, the logic of collective action
may suggest the opposite: given the costs of organizing necessarily larger groups at the Federal
level, those groups will likely prove less effective there than at the state level. Aggregating
environmental interests on a national level increases the heterogeneity of environmental policy
priorities, thereby complicating organizational challenges. The situation is likely to be different for
regulated industry groups, which frequently consist of firms with nationwide operations. For such
firms, operating at the Federal level poses no additional free-rider problems or loss of homogeneity.

        The relevant question is whether the additional problems faced by environmental groups at
the Federal level are outweighed by benefits arising from the fact that the clash of interest groups
takes place before a single legislature, a single administrative agency, and, in part, as a result of the
exclusive venue of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit over important environmental
statutes, in a single court (Revesz 1997a). It might be the case that economies of scale of operating
at the Federal level would more than outweigh the increased free-rider problems. Such economies
of scale might well hold for certain costs associated with effective participation in the regulatory
process, such as for hiring a competent scientist. But the structure of other political costs is likely
to be quite different. For example, with respect to access to the legislative process, a standard public
choice account is that the highest bidder prevails (Peltzman 1976; Stigler 1971). Thus, the benefit
that a party receives from its expenditures is a function of the expenditures of the other party.
Unless costs of this type are small, economies of scale of operating at the federal level are unlikely
to outweigh the additional free-rider problems.

        Given the standard public choice argument for federal environmental regulation, it is not
clear why the problems observed at the state level would not be replicated at the Federal level
(Revesz 1997c). The logic of collective action would suggest that the large number of citizen-
breathers, each with a relatively small stake in the outcome of a particular standard-setting
proceeding, will be overwhelmed in the political process by concentrated industrial interests with
a large stake in the outcome. This problem could occur at the Federal level as well as at the state
level.

4.2.3.2 Positive Support for Public Choice Pathologies

        Public choice arguments for federal regulation rest on two empirical claims concerning the
nature of state regulatory actions: (1) that states ignored environmental problems before 1970, when
the major environmental statutes began to be enacted; and (2) that states continue to be less
concerned about environmental problems than is the Federal government.

        First, the view that the states ignored environmental problems before 1970 is simply not
correct. Several studies show that during the 1960s, without Federal prodding, states were making
considerable strides with respect to the control of air pollution. In particular, the concentrations of


                                                   61
important air pollutants were falling at significant rates, and the number of states, counties, and
municipalities with regulatory programs to control air pollution was increasing rapidly (Crandall
1983; Goklany 1998a, 1998b: Portney 1990; Stern 1982). For example, sulfur dioxide
concentrations fell by about 11 percent annually between 1964 and 1971, but only by about 5
percent per year in the decade after the Federal government began regulating. Similarly,
concentrations of total suspended particulates dropped sharply during the 1960s, but the pace of
reduction slowed significantly in the 1970s (Crandall 1983). The genesis of Federal environmental
regulation is consistent with this evidence. The Clean Air Act of 1970 was a response to industry
pressure for Federal regulation as a means of discouraging states from setting more stringent (and
hence non-uniform) standards (Elliott, Ackerman, and Millian 1985).

        The second view — that states are less concerned about environmental problems than the
Federal government — can be countered with reference to many states’ innovative environmental
laws which impose (sometimes significant) constraints on in-state firms. In the areas of automobile
emission standards, hazardous waste regulation, non-hazardous solid waste regulation, and wetlands
protection, states have taken an active role in (effectively) regulating to improve environmental
quality, and this involvement increased in the 1990s in the face of the Federal government’s less
aggressive action on environmental matters.

        Clearly not every state is equally active in the environmental regulatory arena. The citizens
of some states may have preferences for laxer environmental regulation than the Federal regulatory
level and may therefore not have any reason to adopt voluntarily additional environmental
constraints. Indeed, an analysis of Federal representatives’ voting records on issues of
environmental concern indicates a strong correlation between support for “pro-environment” bills
in Congress and heightened in-state environmental regulatory programs. The existence of
significant state regulation calls into question the simplistic public choice claim that environmental
groups are less able to lobby effectively at the state level than at the federal level (Revesz 2001a).


                                       5. CONCLUSIONS

        The growing use of economic analysis to inform environmental decision making marks
increasing acceptance of the usefulness of these tools to help focus and improve regulation. Debates
about the normative standing of the Kaldor-Hicks criterion and the challenges inherent in making
benefit-cost analysis operational will likely continue. Nevertheless, economic analysis has assumed
a significant position in the regulatory state.

        At the same time, despite the arguments made for decades by economists and others, there
seems to be no more than limited political support in the United States for much broader use of
benefit-cost analysis to assess proposed or existing environmental regulations. In truth, these
analytical methods remain on the periphery of policy formulation. In fact, as long as leaders on both
sides of the debates in the policy community continue to react on ideological bases to proposals for
such “regulatory reform,” the status quo is unlikely to change. Perhaps the significant changes that
have taken place over the past twenty years with regard to the means of environmental policy — that
is, acceptance of market-based environmental instruments — can provide a model for progress with
regards to analysis of the ends — the targets and goals — of public policies in this domain.


                                                 62
         Certainly the change has been dramatic. Market-based instruments have moved center stage,
and policy debates today look very different from those twenty years ago, when these ideas were
routinely characterized as “licenses to pollute” or dismissed as completely impractical. Market-
based instruments are now considered seriously for each and every environmental problem that is
tackled, ranging from endangered species preservation to regional smog to global climate change.
It is reasonable to anticipate that market-based instruments will enjoy increasing acceptance in the
years ahead.

        Of course, no particular form of government intervention, no individual policy instrument
— whether market-based or conventional — and no specific level of government is appropriate for
all environmental problems. Which instrument or level of government is best in any given situation
depends upon a variety of characteristics of the environmental problem, and the social, political, and
economic context in which it is being regulated. There is no policy panacea. But economic
instruments are now part of the available policy portfolio, and ultimately that is good news both for
environmental protection and economic well-being.
