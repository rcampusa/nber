Are There Civic Returns to Education?

JEL No. I2, H1

                                           ABSTRACT

The hypothesized effects of educational attainment on adult civic engagement and attitudes provide
some of the most important justifications for government intervention in the market for education.
In this study, I present evidence on whether these externalities exist. I assess and implement two
strategies for identifying the effects of educational attainment. One is based on the availability of
junior and community colleges; the other, on changes in teen exposure to child labor laws. The
results suggest that educational attainment has large and statistically significant effects on
subsequent voter participation and support for free speech. I also find that additional schooling
appears to increase the quality of civic knowledge as measured by the frequency of newspaper
readership.

which can be imparted by no other human instrumentality, is indispensable to a republican form of

INTRODUCTION

        Economists typically justify the government’s extensive and varied involvement in the

market for education by appealing to distributional concerns and several types of market failures.

The most frequently discussed types of market failure involve the positive externalities that might be

associated with schooling. For example, some have argued that education generates external social

benefits by reducing the prevalence of crime and by promoting knowledge spillovers and technology

diffusion in the workplace.1 However, the externality that is arguably featured most prominently in

discussions about education involves civic behaviors and attitudes. Specifically, it is widely believed

that education is an essential component of a stable democratic society because it encourages citizens

to participate in democratic processes and prepares them to do so in an informed and intelligent

manner. The putative existence of such civic returns to education motivated the proliferation of

common schools in the early 19th century and early educational reformers like Horace Mann and

continues to provide one of the most important justifications for the many public policies and

institutions that promote access to all levels of education.

        An extensive, empirical literature in political science has documented a strong correlation

between educational attainment and various civic behaviors. In particular, this literature has

demonstrated that higher levels of schooling are associated with substantive increases in voter

turnout. Political scientists generally interpret this literature as providing strong support for the view


1
  See Wolfe and Haveman (2001) for a discussion of the non-market and social benefits possibly
associated with education. Poterba (1996) and Taylor (1999) discuss the case for governmental
intervention in the market for education and conclude that there is surprisingly little empirical
evidence to indicate whether or not hypothesized, positive externalities exist. However, several
recent empirical studies have assessed the effects of schooling on knowledge spillovers (e.g.,
Moretti, forthcoming, Acemoglu and Angrist 2000) and on criminal behavior (Moretti and Lochner
2001, Witte 1997).
                                                                                                         2


that education is effective at promoting the quantity and quality of civic participation. However,

these correlations could actually be quite misleading since both schooling and civic outcomes are

simultaneously influenced by a wide variety of inherently unobservable traits specific to individuals

and the families and communities in which they were reared. For example, individuals who grew up

in cohesive families and communities that stressed civic responsibility may also be more likely to

remain in school. The plausible existence of such unobservables implies that conventionally

estimated correlations may spuriously overstate the true civic returns to education.2

        This study attempts to construct less ambiguous empirical evidence on this policy-relevant

issue by identifying the causal effects of additional schooling on civic behaviors and knowledge. The

research designs adopted here essentially parallel the extensive, empirical literature on the labor-

market returns to schooling (e.g., Angrist and Krueger 1999, Card 1999). More specifically, these

inferences rely critically on instrumental variables that generated possibly exogenous variation in

individual levels of schooling but that should otherwise be unrelated to adult civic outcomes.3 First,

using data from the High School and Beyond (HS&B) longitudinal study, I estimate the effects of

college entrance on adult voter and volunteer participation by relying on the geographic proximity

and density of junior and community colleges as a teen. Then, using data from the 1972-2000

General Social Surveys (GSS), I estimate the effects of years of schooling on adult voter

participation, on group memberships and on attitudes towards free speech by relying on changes in

teen exposure to child labor laws (Acemoglu and Angrist 2000). Using the GSS data, I also estimate

the effects of additional schooling on the frequency of newspaper readership, an outcome that is

closely related to measures of civic awareness. The results of these evaluations suggest that

additional schooling, both at the secondary and post-secondary levels, had large and statistically

2
  An additional concern is that the existence of measurement error in self-reported schooling could
lead correlations to understate the true effects of schooling (Angrist and Krueger 1999, Card 1999).
The direction of omitted variable biases could also be negative. For example, the high-ability
individuals who continue their schooling may have higher opportunity costs and may think that
voting is largely an expressive act that is extremely unlikely to actually influence policy.
3
  I discuss a variety of ad-hoc empirical evidence that is consistent with the maintained assumptions
regarding instrument validity.

significant effects on voter participation. I also find that the additional secondary schooling

significantly increased the frequency of newspaper readership as well as the amount of support for

allowing most forms of possibly controversial free speech.



EDUCATION AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT

        One of the fundamental mechanisms by which education has long been thought to generate

civic externalities involves improvements in the quality of civic participation and awareness.

Specifically, it is widely alleged that increases in education generate broad social benefits by

allowing citizens to make more informed evaluations of the complex, social, political and

technological issues that might be embedded in campaign literature, legislative initiatives and ballot

referenda. However, the contemporary literature among political scientists has also put a particular

stress on the positive effects that schooling may have on the likelihood of civic participation (e.g.,

Wolfinger and Rosenstone 1980). Education could promote civic participation through at least two

broad channels. First, schooling may reduce the effective costs of certain forms of civic participation.

In particular, this is thought to occur because increased cognitive ability makes it easier to process

complex political information, to make decisions and to circumvent the various bureaucratic and

technological impediments to civic participation.4 Second, education may increase the perceived

benefits of civic engagement by promoting "democratic enlightenment" or, stated differently, by

shaping individual preferences for civic activity. Similarly, it is often alleged that education plays an

important public role by directly inculcating students with other fundamental democratic and

pluralistic values (e.g., support for free speech, for the separation of church and state, etc.).5


4
  However, there are other indirect mechanisms by which education may currently lower the
effective costs of voting. For example, since thirteen states currently prohibit ex-felons from voting,
education may also reduce the effective costs of voting through its effects on criminal activity.
Similarly, to the extent that education increases the likelihood of having a driver’s license, the recent
expansion of “motor-voter” policies may have added to the effects of education on voter turnout.
5
  The preference-shaping nature of schooling is typically viewed as normatively desirable. However,
Lott (1990, 1999) argues that governments use the indoctrination that occurs in pubic schools to
support totalitarian regimes and large wealth transfers.
                                                                                                        4


However, it is also possible that additional schooling shapes civic preferences indirectly through

altering the composition of peer groups and shared social norms.

        Interestingly, an economic perspective could also suggest alternative mechanisms by which

additional schooling might actually reduce civic engagement. For example, by raising the

opportunity cost of an individual’s time, increased schooling could reduce the amount of time and

attention allocated to civic activity. This could be particularly relevant for volunteering, which,

unlike voting, can involve a substantial commitment of time. However, education could also reduce

voter participation by promoting an awareness of voting as an essentially expressive act with an

infinitesimally small probability of influencing actual policy.6 Nonetheless, the available empirical

evidence seems to provide an emphatic confirmation of the conventional view that education does

promote civic engagement. Numerous studies over the last fifty years have demonstrated that higher

levels of individual schooling are strongly associated with civic behaviors and knowledge.7 For

example, in a widely repeated interpretation of this empirical evidence, Converse (1972) refers to

educational attainment as the "universal solvent" of political participation. Similarly, Putnam (2001)

notes that "education is by far the strongest correlate that I have discovered of civic engagement in

all its forms" (emphasis mine). Also, in their earlier study of voting participation, Wolfinger and

Rosenstone (1980) suggest that their core finding is the "transcendent importance of education."

However, they also note that an individual's level of schooling could easily proxy for unobserved

traits that also influence civic behaviors (pages 19-20). For example, they suggest that the types of

family backgrounds that promote increased schooling may also promote increased socialization into

civic activities like voting. Wolfinger and Rosenstone (1980), like other researchers in this field,

have attempted to control for the possible bias in the estimated effect of education by introducing a

few additional control variables (e.g., income and occupational measures) into multiple regression

models. The apparent robustness of the correlations between education and civic outcomes has led

most researchers to conclude that education does have a causal effect. For example, in the most

recent contribution to this literature, Nie and Hillygus (2001) note that this orthodox view is "largely

uncontested."

        However, the basic approach of introducing a few additional controls may not convincingly

resolve the question of whether the strong correlations between education and civic outcomes

actually reflect the true causal effects. In particular, this could occur because so many of the shared

determinants of civic behavior and educational attainment are inherently difficult for researchers to

measure well. For example, as noted earlier, children who were raised in families or communities

that stressed civic responsibility are almost certainly more likely to remain in school longer. This

may occur in part because such families and communities are also likely to impart values that

encourage schooling. However, it could also occur simply because civic-minded families and

communities may do more to insure that their children attend well-funded, high-quality schools.

These plausible scenarios imply that the strong association between adult civic outcomes and

educational attainment may reflect, to an unknown degree, the confounding influence of unobserved

family and community traits. Alternatively, these correlations could also reflect the confounding

influence of other, inherently unobservable individual traits like the rate at which future outcomes

are valued and the taste for altruism. Certainly, the recent trends in the United States (i.e., declines in

voter turnout and contemporaneous increases in educational attainment) suggest that the association

between education and civic engagement could be specious. And at least two studies in the political

science literature provide more formal evidence that such concerns about omitted variable biases

may be empirically relevant. Both Luskin (1990) and Cassel and Lo (1997) present evidence that the

apparent influence of education on civic outcomes (political literacy and sophistication) may reflect

the spurious influence of other individual traits (e.g., intelligence and parents' socio-economic

status). Similarly, Gibson (2001) presents within-twin estimates, which suggest that education

actually reduces the probability of volunteering. In the next two sections, I present new empirical
                                                                                                        6


evidence on the effects of educational attainment on several civic outcomes. I attempt to identify the

causal effects of educational attainment by relying on instrumental variables that generate plausibly

exogenous changes in the levels of individual schooling.8



COLLEGE ATTENDANCE AND CIVIC PARTICIPATION

High School and Beyond (HS&B)

        The data for this section are drawn from High School and Beyond (HS&B), a major

longitudinal study conducted by the U.S. Department of Education. This detailed study began with a

cohort of high school sophomores in 1980. Follow-up interviews of roughly 12,000 members of the

sophomore cohort occurred in 1984 when most respondents were 20 years old and again in 1992

when most respondents were 28 years old.9 In the 1992 interview, respondents were asked four civic-

related questions: whether they were currently registered to vote (mean=.67), whether they had voted

in a local, state or national election within the past year (mean=.36), whether they had voted in the

1988 Presidential election (mean=.55) and whether they had volunteered in the last month

(mean=.37). The key measure of educational attainment examined here is college entrance defined as

of the 1984 interview (mean=.54). This definition of college entrance is based on attendance at a

junior college, a community college or a four-year college or university and explicitly excludes those

who only attended a vocational, trade, business or other training school. While this is a somewhat

narrow margin of educational attainment, the available evidence indicates that it is also an

increasingly important one. The rate of college enrollment among young adults has increased

dramatically over the last twenty years with roughly half of this increase being absorbed by junior

and community colleges (Kane and Rouse 1999). And prior studies suggest that modest persistence

at two and four-year colleges has beneficial labor-market consequences even when it does not result

in a degree (e.g., Kane and Rouse 1995). The HS&B respondents who had entered college by 1984

did generally remain in college long enough to accumulate a relatively large amount of

undergraduate credits.10 Furthermore, the baseline evidence discussed below demonstrates that this

measure of college entrance has a strong partial correlation with the probability of subsequent civic

engagement. However, the choice of college entrance as a measure of educational attainment is also

dictated by the availability of a plausible instrument, the geographic availability of junior and

community colleges as a teen, which appears to have substantively influenced the decision to attend

college and to have been otherwise unrelated to civic engagement as an adult.11



Baseline estimates

        The validity of the geographic availability of junior and community colleges (hereafter

referred to as two-year colleges) as a basis for identification is a critical issue, which is discussed in

some detail below. However, before turning to an assessment of the relevant instrumental variables,

it is useful to establish an empirical baseline by estimating the effects of college entrance on

subsequent civic behaviors in specifications that assume the absence of omitted variable biases.

Table 1 presents the estimated marginal effects from single-equation probits in which the four

measures of civic behavior are the dependent variables. The first specification (column (1))

conditions on 10 variables representing basic demographic information on age, race, ethnicity,

gender and religious affiliation and on 18 other variables that reflect family income, family

composition and parental education as defined during the 1980 interview.12 The subsequent models

introduce school-level controls (i.e., miles to the nearest 4-year college and urbanicity fixed effects),

10
   Specifically, data from the HS&B transcript study indicate that those who had entered college by
1984 had, on average, about 80 more semester hours of undergraduate credit than those who did not:
the equivalent of roughly five full-time college semesters. However, a caveat is appropriate since
transcript data are missing or incomplete for roughly 25 percent of the respondents in this extract.
11
   Similarly, I chose to define college entrance as of the 1984 interview when most respondents were
20 years old and not as of later interviews. The estimated effects of college entrance are similar
regardless of which interview is used to define it. However, college entrance defined as of later
interviews had a plausibly weaker relationship to one of the early measures of college availability
(i.e., the distance in miles from the high school to the nearest two-year college).
12
   See the appendix for details on these controls. The Huber-White standard errors are adjusted for
clustering at the school level.
                                                                                                          8


state and county-level controls based on the location of the base-year school and, finally, fixed

effects for the Census division of the base-year school. One of the county-level variables is a well-

measured proxy for the civic attitudes of the community in which the respondents grew up: the

county-level voter turnout in the 1980 Presidential election. The second county-level variable is a

measure of adult educational attainment in the respondent’s teen community: the percent of adults

aged 25 or older with high school degree. The third county-level control, the population share aged

18-24, may be a relevant determinant of civic engagement and also influence the competitiveness of

post-secondary institutions. The two state-level variables reflect influential voter regulations defined

as of 1992 (Knack 1995). One is a binary indicator for whether the state had an active policy of

allowing voter registration by mail. The second is the number of years the state had active “motor-

voter” regulations in place.13 The available evidence suggests that a years-based measure is the

appropriate variable for identifying the early effects of “motor-voter” policies because state drivers

licenses are renewed in cycles as long as six years (Knack 1995).

        These models are somewhat unusual in comparison to the prior literature since they

condition on detailed individual and community-level socioeconomic variables defined as of each

respondent’s teen years. The results presented in Table 1 uniformly suggest that college entrance had

positive and statistically significant effects on civic participation. Interestingly, the magnitudes of

these estimated marginal effects are also quite robust to the introduction of the additional controls.

These estimated marginal effects are also quite large, implying that a relatively modest increase in

educational attainment has sizable effects on subsequent civic participation. For example, these

estimates imply that college entrance increased voter registration by approximately 13 percentage

points, an increase of nearly 20 percent in the mean probability of being registered. Similarly, these

estimates imply that college entrance increases the mean probability of voting in the last year, voting

13
   “Motor-voter” regulations bundle an application for voter registration with those for driver
licenses. All states were required to institute “motor-voter” policies by 1995 as part of the National
Voter Registration Act. It should also be noted that North Dakota does not have voter registration.
The results reported here are robust to excluding observations from respondents who attended high
school in that state.
                                                                                                           9


in the 1988 Presidential election and volunteering by 29 percent, 32 percent and 20 percent,

respectively.

        However, the central concern with the results in Table 1 is that the strong partial correlations

between college entrance and civic behaviors may reflect the confounding influence of unobserved

determinants of both schooling and civic engagement. One straightforward way to assess the

possible empirical relevance of this concern is to examine the partial correlations between college

entrance and measures of civic attitudes and knowledge that preceded attendance in college. I rely on

two such measures based on data from the sophomore-year survey. One is a standardized test score

on questions related to civics. The other is the student’s response to a question about the importance

of correcting social and economic inequality (1=not important, 2=somewhat important and 3=very

important). Each of these variables is highly predictive of each measure of future civic engagement.

For example, a 10 percent increase in the sophomore-year civics test score is associated with a

statistically significant 7 percent increase in the mean probability of voting within the last year.

Similarly, a one-unit increase in the ordered attitudinal measure is associated with a statistically

significant 10 percent increase in the mean probability of voting. In auxiliary regressions where these

sophomore-year measures are the dependent variables, the estimated effects of college entrance are

positive and statistically significant. However, since the dependent variables in these models

preceded college entrance, these results cannot plausibly reflect causal effects. Instead, these results

suggest the existence of individual-level unobservables that may have a positive covariance with

both educational attainment and adult civic engagement. This stylized evidence suggests the need to

rely on instrumental variables in estimating the effects of college attendance on civic outcomes.

        Another possible concern with the results in Table 1 involves the quality of the self-reported

data on civic engagement. Specifically, prior comparisons of actual voting rates with those based on

survey data indicate that survey respondents often overstate their voter turnout. This problem can be

particularly acute in survey instruments that focus largely on political values. However, in surveys

that emphasize other issues (e.g., the November supplements to the Current Population Surveys), the
                                                                                                            10


aggregate voter-participation rates implied by self reports are generally quite close to the actual rates

(Teixeira 1992, Appendix A). Since the HS&B survey instruments asked very few questions about

civic values and engagement, the HS&B responses may also track actual behaviors closely. The

voter-registration rate implied by the HS&B responses (67 percent) is similar to the

contemporaneous CPS-reported rate for 25-34 year olds (61 percent, U.S. Census Bureau 1996). And

the percent of HS&B respondents who reported voting in the past year (36 percent) is actually lower

than the CPS-reported turnout rate for 25-34 year olds in the 1992 Presidential election (53

percent).14 However, further comparisons with the CPS data suggest that the HS&B respondents’

1992 recall of having voted in 1988 may be more biased. In the 1988 CPS survey, approximately 38

percent of 21-24 year olds reported voting in the Presidential election while the 1992 HS&B survey

suggests that 55 percent of respondents did. So, a caveat about this particular variable is appropriate.

However, it is not clear, even in that case, that the estimated marginal effects of educational

attainment would be confounded by over-reporting. For example, if schooling promotes more

accurate self-reports, these evaluations would only understate the true civic returns to education. On

the other hand, it is also possible that educational attainment creates a sense of obligation and guilt

that leads more educated respondents to over-state their actual civic engagement more frequently

than those with lower educational attainment. However, this does not appear to be the case.15

Furthermore, even if schooling did increase over-reporting, that would necessarily imply that

schooling has a type of structural effect (i.e., instilling a sense of civic obligation) that should also

generate true increases in voter turnout.




14
   That difference is reasonable since nearly all of the HS&B responses occurred before the
November 1992 general election.
15
   Specifically, a regression of actual county-level voter turnout in the 1980 election on the county-
level percent of adults with a high school degree generates marginal effects that are actually
somewhat larger than the estimated effect of being on high school graduate on the voter participation
reported by HS&B respondents. It is also somewhat larger than the estimated effect of being a high
school graduate on self-reported participation in the 1980 Presidential election among GSS
respondents.

Measures of college availability as instruments

        The partial correlations reported in Table 1 are consistent with the prior empirical studies of

civic participation. However, a more convincing strategy for assessing whether the estimates in

Table 1 reflect the causal effects of attending college is to exploit instrumental variables that

generate plausibly exogenous variation in this measure of educational attainment. The fundamental

requirements of such instrument are that they actually influence educational attainment and that they

are uncorrelated with the unobserved determinants of civic engagement. A recent study of the labor-

market returns to schooling by Card (1995) suggests that the geographic availability of colleges may

provide valid instruments for schooling.16 The basic motivation for such instruments is that the

proximity of colleges as a teen should substantially reduce the costs of attending college (particularly

for students from disadvantaged backgrounds) but should otherwise have no effects on adult

outcomes. Rouse (1995) also presents evidence that the availability of two-year colleges increases

educational attainment for those on the margin of attending college (a “democratization” effect) but

actually reduces it among those who would have otherwise attended a four-year college (a

“diversion” effect). I also find some support for a modest “diversion” effect (i.e., the proximity of

two-year colleges reducing the probability of completing a bachelor’s degree) but rely on the

stronger “democratization” effect as a source of identifying information.

        Specifically, I rely on two measures of the local availability of two-year colleges. One is the

distance in miles from each respondent’s high school to the nearest two-year college (as reported by

a high-school official as part of the HS&B school survey). The second is a count of the number of

two-year colleges within each respondent’s county in 1983 (mean=2.4).17 These variables provide


16
   See Kling (2001) and Currie and Moretti (2002) for further discussions and applications of this
approach.
17
   These counts were created using the 1983-84 data from the Higher Education General Information
Survey (HEGIS). See the appendix for details. Card (1995) and Kling (2001) rely similarly on a
binary indicator for any college in county. I also constructed counts of four-year colleges by county
but found that this was highly collinear with the number of two-year colleges and exclude it from
this analysis. So, a caveat about attributing the effects associated with this measure to two-year, not
4-year, institutions is appropriate.
                                                                                                          12


related but distinct measures of the availability of two-year colleges. In particular, it is reasonable to

suspect that the probability of attending college would be simultaneously influenced by the

proximity of the nearest two-year institution as well as by the local availability of several

postsecondary options.18 While every state has two-year colleges, their geographic distribution

across the United States is somewhat uneven. For example, several states in the West and Southwest

(e.g., California, Washington, Texas and Arizona) and in the upper Midwest (e.g., Illinois, Michigan)

have relatively extensive systems of public community colleges. Medsker and Tillery (1971) note

that this distribution partly reflects the dramatic mid-century growth in new two-year colleges, which

was shaped by the interaction of state-specific enabling legislation and several sources of enrollment

pressure (e.g., the G.I. Bill, the baby boom and population migration). However, the states of New

York, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida also have a large number of two-year colleges, with a

particularly large share of them being private junior colleges.

           I also considered, but rejected, the idea of using proximity to four-year colleges as an

instrument. Specifically, a central concern with any instrument based on the geographic availability

of colleges is that it might be flawed because it is associated with the unobserved determinants of

both educational attainment and civic behavior. In particular, the unobserved traits of communities

near colleges (e.g., high socioeconomic status) could simultaneously encourage both higher

educational attainment and increased civic participation. Furthermore, the availability of colleges

may promote a youth-oriented and politically aware culture that promotes the civic engagement of

teens independently of its effects on educational attainment. I assess the empirical relevance of these

concerns in a number of ways. For example, I discuss the robustness of the key results to the

introduction of the school, county and state-level controls. However, I also provide three other types

of ad-hoc empirical evidence on the validity of these instruments. First, I examine their effects on

different levels of educational attainment. If the estimated effects of college availability truly reflect

the costs of attending college and not the influence of omitted variables, these instruments are likely

18
     These measures are not highly collinear and have a relatively low correlation coefficient of -0.2.
                                                                                                            13


to have little or no effects on other levels of educational attainment.19 Second, I examine the partial

correlations between the instruments and sophomore-year measures of civic attitudes and knowledge

that are strongly correlated with future civic participation (i.e., scores on a civics test and attitudes

towards correcting inequality). And, third, I assess how the effects of these instruments vary across

students from advantaged and disadvantaged backgrounds. To the extent that the estimated effects of

these instruments truly reflect variation in the costs of attending college, these effects should be

concentrated among students from disadvantaged backgrounds (Card 1995, Kling 2001). The results

of all of these ad-hoc specification checks suggest that the proximity to 4-year colleges may be an

invalid instrument. In particular, nearness to 4-year colleges is associated with sharp increases in the

probability of graduating from high school as well as significant increases in sophomore-year civics

knowledge. These results do not constitute a definitive case against this particular measure as an

instrument for educational attainment. Nonetheless, all of the models for educational attainment and

civic outcomes reported here condition on this measure.20

        In Table 2, I present the estimated marginal effects of the availability of two-year colleges

on the probability of entering college. The results in the top panel suggest that both measures of

availability have plausibly signed and statistically significant effects on college entrance and that

these estimates are relatively robust to the introduction of additional controls. Specifically, the results

from Model (4) suggest that a location 100 miles further away from a two-year college reduces the

probability of college entrance by 6.1 percentage points. Similarly, these results suggest that an

additional two-year institution within county is associated with a 0.6 percentage point increase in the

probability of entering college. In the bottom panel of Table 2, I provide some ad-hoc evidence on

the validity of these instruments by estimating their unique effects on students from advantaged and

disadvantaged backgrounds. Card (1995) suggests that, if the interpretation of college availability as


19
   However, a signaling model of education suggests that there could be effects on other levels of
attainment (e.g., Lang and Kropp 1986). Also, as noted earlier, these instruments could influence
higher levels of attainment through diversion effects (Rouse 1995).
20
   Models that use this measure as an IV return results similar to those reported here.
                                                                                                       14


an independent measure of the costs of attending college is a valid one, the effects of these

instruments should be concentrated among students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Following

Card (1995), I assess the existence of such response heterogeneity by interacting the availability

measures with indicators for high and low parental education.21 The results in the bottom panel of

Table 2 indicate that the effects of the availability of two-year colleges are highly concentrated

among students with poorly educated parents. In particular, the estimated effect of the proximity of

two-year colleges is statistically insignificant for students with highly educated parents (though it has

the same sign). Similarly, the number of two-year colleges within county has a smaller and weakly

significant effect for students with highly educated parents.

        In Table 3, I present evidence how the availability of two-year colleges influenced different

margins of educational attainment. These estimates are based on specifications that include all the

individual, family, school, county and state-level controls. The results suggest that the availability of

two-year colleges has small and statistically insignificant effects on the probability of graduating

from high school and on the probability of obtaining an associate’s degree. These results also suggest

that the geographic proximity of two-year colleges led to relatively small and weakly significant

reductions in the probability of obtaining a bachelor’s degree: a “diversion” effect that appears to be

concentrated among students from disadvantaged backgrounds. However, the results in the bottom

panel of Table 3 also suggest that, for students with poorly educated parents, the number of two-year

colleges within county had strong “democratization” effects that increased the probability of entering

college as well as the probability of obtaining a bachelor’s degree.22 However, the more general and

important result from Table 3 is that the effects associated with the availability of two-year colleges

are highly concentrated on the margin of attending college. This evidence is consistent with the


21
   As in Card (1995), low parental education implies that the highest educational attainment of the
parents is high school dropout or missing. Students for whom parents’ education is missing have
lower levels of attainment than the students who report their parents are dropouts.
22
   These results for attaining a bachelor’s degree are not necessarily inconsistent since the proximity
of a single institution may promote diversion while the availability of several could facilitate the
ultimate progression to a bachelor’s degree.
                                                                                                       15


maintained assumption that these measures reflect plausibly exogenous variation in the costs of

college entrance and not other unobserved traits of these communities. In particular, because these

instruments have such a narrowly focused effect on this single margin of educational attainment, it

suggests that they do not proxy for the unobserved determinants of future civic engagement.

        However, in Table 4, I present further evidence on the validity of these exclusion

restrictions. As noted earlier, the base-year survey of HS&B sophomores contained two variables

that appear to reflect each student’s latent civic engagement and knowledge well: a standardized test

score on questions related to civics and an attitudinal question about the importance of correcting

social and economic inequality (1=not important, 2=somewhat important and 3=very important).

These latent indicators, which are highly predictive of future civic engagement, provide a potentially

plausible basis for evaluating the validity of the instruments. Specifically, if the measures of college

availability have an association with the unobserved determinants of future civic engagement, we

would expect them to be correlated with these observed measures as well. In Table 4, I present the

key results from auxiliary regressions in which these sophomore-year traits are the dependent

variables. These results are based on models that include all of the prior controls (e.g., Model (4) in

Tables 1 and 2). The estimates in Table 4 uniformly suggest that availability of two-year colleges,

both generally and for students with poorly educated parents, has a small and statistically

insignificant association with sophomore-year civics knowledge and with community attitudes.

Some studies also assess instrument validity and possible biases by considering the sign of the

relationship between candidate instruments and observed determinants of the outcomes under study

(e.g., Altonji et al. 2002). The mixed signs of the estimates reported in Table 4 do not provide

consistent evidence for particular violations of exclusion restrictions. In a similar vein, I also

examined the partial correlations between these instruments and the 1980 county-level voter turnout.

Interestingly, the results indicated that communities with better access to two-year colleges had

lower voter turnout rates. These negative relationships suggest that, if there are violations of the
                                                                                                        16


exclusion restrictions, they may impart a negative bias, which would not be fundamentally

confounding for most of the results presented below.



Results

          The results in Tables 2, 3 and 4 are consistent with the maintained assumption that the

geographic availability of two-year colleges provides a potentially valid source of identification. The

availability of two-year colleges is associated with a significant increase in college attendance but

smaller and statistically insignificant changes in other measures of educational attainment. These

increases are plausibly concentrated among students with poorly educated parents. And these

measures are unrelated to sophomore-year indicators of civic attitudes (e.g., civics knowledge and

attitudes towards inequality). In Table 5, I present the key results from bivariate probits in which the

adult civic behaviors are the dependent variable of interest and college entrance is an endogenous

regressor (Wooldridge 2002).23 The excluded instruments in Model (1) are miles to the nearest two-

year college and the number of two-year colleges within county. These results of these models

suggest that college entrance has small and imprecisely estimated effects on the probability of

volunteering but uniformly large and positive effects on each of the three measures of voter

participation. Specifically, these estimates indicate that college entrance increases voter participation

by roughly 21 to 30 percentage points. These results are clearly consistent with the conventional

claims that educational attainment is a critical determinant of civic engagement. In fact, these

estimated effects are substantially larger than those based on partial correlations (Table 1). The

sampling variation associated with these estimates suggests that these differences should not be

overdrawn. Nonetheless, it is also worth noting three reasons that the true effects of educational


23
  The results of 2SLS estimates generate similarly signed and statistically significant estimates but
are substantially larger than the marginal effects and average treatment effects (ATE) based on these
bivariate probits, particularly in models saturated with the additional controls. Identification in these
bivariate probits appears to be driven by the exclusion restrictions and not by functional form.
Bivariate probits that do not rely on excluded instruments generate small and statistically
insignificant effects.
                                                                                                       17


attainment might exceed the estimates based on partial correlations (Table 1). First, as frequently

noted in the literature on wages and schooling, this could reflect an attenuation bias driven by

measurement error in reported schooling. Second, these estimates could indicate that the civic returns

associated with college entrance are particularly large for the non-random subset of individuals

whose post-secondary attainments were influenced by the instruments (e.g., those from

disadvantaged backgrounds, Imbens and Angrist 1994). And, third, a downward bias in conventional

estimates could also reflect the influence of unobserved ability on both schooling decisions and time

allocated to civic endeavors.

        However, a fourth possibility with very different implications is that the size of these

estimates reflects undiagnosed violations of the maintained exclusion restrictions. One indication

that this is not so is that the results from Table 5 are quite similar across models, which incrementally

introduce the school, county and state-level controls. However, another way to assess this concern is

to use as instruments the interaction of low parental education and the measures of two-year college

availability. Specifically, in such models, the interaction of high parental education and the measures

of two-year college availability can then be included as controls in the outcome equations (e.g., Card

1995). This approach to identification can provide effective controls for the possible, indirect effects

on civic outcomes associated with college availability to the extent that these effects are constant

across students with different family backgrounds. The results based on this specification are

reported in the right panel of Table 5 (i.e., Model (2)) and are quite similar to those based on the

basic instruments. The robustness of these results suggests that the basic identifying assumptions are

accurate. I also assessed this issue by relying alternatively on miles to a two-year college and number

of two-year colleges in county as the sole instrument and including the other variable as a control.

This approach leads to similarly large and positive point estimates in models for voter registration

and turnout. However, in most cases, the reduction in identifying assumptions makes these estimates

statistically imprecise.

SECONDARY SCHOOLING AND CIVIC OUTCOMES

General Social Surveys (GSS)

        The evidence from the HS&B data has at least two critical shortcomings. One is that it only

identifies the civic returns to education at the post-secondary level. And the second is that the

available data provide no measures of the degree of civic awareness or of other fundamental civic

values. The data from the General Social Surveys (GSS) provide an opportunity to address both of

these concerns. The GSS is a nationwide survey, conducted every one to two years, on a broad range

of attitudes and behavior.24 My extract is based on the pooled 1972-2000 surveys and consists of the

respondents who lived in the U.S. at age 16 and were 14 years old between 1914 and 1978. In each

survey, these respondents were asked about their educational attainment and whether they voted in

the last Presidential election (mean=.73).25 In most, but not all, survey years, GSS respondents were

also asked about how often they read the newspaper, about their group memberships (e.g., fraternal

and community-service groups, political clubs, school-service and youth groups, church-service

groups, etc.) and about their attitudes towards free speech for particular groups.

        The GSS respondents report an average of 1.8 group memberships. The frequency of

newspaper readership is based on five possible responses (never, less than once a week, once a week,

a few times a week and every day) coded here as varying from 0 to 4 (mean=3.2). This measure of

newspaper readership is meant to indicate whether voters stay informed about current affairs. There

are inarguably better ways of measuring the degree of civic awareness. For example, in 1987, the

GSS respondents were asked to identify their congressman. Interestingly, only 37 percent of

respondents were able to answer this question correctly. Unfortunately, since this question was only

asked in 1987, there are relatively few observations (n=1,555) and a plausible identification strategy

24
  See the appendix for details on the GSS and construction of this extract.
25
  Actual votes cast as a percentage of the voting-age population declined from 61 to 49 percent over
these eight elections. These observed turnout rates should be somewhat lower than the GSS-reported
rates since the voting-age population includes ineligible voters. However, the GSS respondents may
overstate their actual voter participation more dramatically in the most recent survey years. In Table
10, I present evidence on the implications for this study’s key inferences of this possible change in
reporting biases.
                                                                                                          19


cannot be implemented. However, the data from 1987 do indicate that the frequency of newspaper

readership is strongly associated with being able to identify your congressman. Specifically,

conditional on all the covariates discussed below, a one-unit increase in the measure of newspaper

readership is associated with a 10 percentage-point increase in the probability of answering correctly

(i.e., a 27-percent increase in the mean). This suggests that the frequency of newspaper readership is

a reasonable proxy for the degree of civic awareness. The measures of attitudes towards free speech

are based on separate survey questions that allowed respondents to indicate whether they would

allow particular types of people to speak in their community. These types include someone against

churches and religion (an anti-religionist), an admitted Communist, an admitted homosexual,

someone who advocates outlawing elections and letting the military run the country (a militarist) and

someone who believes blacks are inferior (a racist). Support for allowing free speech ranges from 59

percent for the militarist to 73 percent for the homosexual (see appendix Table 2).



Baseline estimates

        In Table 6, I present baseline OLS estimates of how years of completed schooling influences

these measures of civic engagement and attitudes. The sparsest specification only includes as

controls basic demographic information (9 variables) and fixed effects for survey year (as many as

22 variables), year of birth (64 variables) and Census division of residence at age 16 (8 variables).

The second specification adds three control variables that reflect the quality of public schools and the

degree of civic engagement in each respondent’s teen community. The two school quality measures

are the pupil-teacher ratios and relative teacher salaries in public schools at age 14 in the Census

division of residence at age 16.26 The third variable is the voter turnout in the Presidential election

that occurred between the ages of 13 and 16 in the Census division of residence at age 16. The third


26
  Card and Krueger (1992) present evidence that these measures influenced average years of
schooling. I converted average teacher salaries to a relative measure by exploiting data on wages
paid to road workers on Federal projects (Card and Krueger 1992) and data on wages for production
workers in manufacturing. See the appendix for information on the construction of these variables.
                                                                                                        20


specification introduces variables based on survey responses that reflect a variety of family and

community-specific traits. These include family income at age 16 (5 variables), family structure at

age 16 (5 variables), parental education (4 variables) and the urbanicity of residence at age 16 (6

variables). In the final model, I control for all the unobserved determinants that might be specific to a

particular Census division in a particular year (e.g., weather, close political races, etc.) by including

approximately 200 fixed effects for each unique Census-division and survey-year combination. The

standard errors are adjusted for unspecified heteroscedasticity specific to the Census division of

resident at age 16.27 The results in Table 6 uniformly indicate that schooling is strongly and

positively correlated with all of these measures of civic engagement and attitudes. For example,

these estimates suggest that an additional year of schooling increases voter participation by 3.8

percent, an increase of approximately 5 percent. These results also imply that another year of

schooling significantly increases the index of newspaper readership (by 0.104, an increase of 3

percent) and the number of group memberships (by .222, an increase of 12 percent). Another year of

schooling also appears to increase support for free speech by a statistically significant 2.2 to 3.6

percentage points, depending on who is doing the speaking. Interestingly, these estimated effects are

generally quite robust to dramatic increases in the set of controls for observed traits.



Restrictive child labor laws as an instrument

        The estimates in Table 6 suggest that additional years of schooling led to significant

increases in the quality and quantity of civic engagement and in the support for free speech. I attempt

to assess whether these estimates reflect a causal relationship by exploiting the exogenous variation

in years of schooling generated by teen exposure to changes in child labor laws. Recent studies by

Acemoglu and Angrist (2000) and Lleras-Muney (2002) provide evidence that the variation in child

27
   This conservative approach may be appropriate since the pre/post nature of the instrumental
variable and serial correlation in the dependent variables could lead to overstated precision (Bertrand
et al. 2002). As a practical matter, this only appears to increase the 2SLS standard errors slightly.
However, this approach is also a conservative one because there are only 8 degrees of freedom in the
critical value of the t-statistic since there are only 9 Census divisions.
                                                                                                      21


labor laws influenced the amount of schooling at the secondary level. In Tables 7 and 8, I present

evidence on how these variables influenced educational attainment among the GSS respondents. The

coding of these child labor laws are discussed in detail in Acemoglu and Angrist (2000). Essentially,

for each state and year from 1914 to 1978, they identified the minimum amount of schooling

required before a child could enter the workforce (the variable CL). This variable is equal to the

greater of the years of schooling a state required before granting a work permit and the difference

between the age at which children could work and the age at which they had to enter school. These

laws are represented here by a dummy variable equal to one for CL greater than or equal to 9. These

state-year laws could not be matched directly to GSS respondents because the available data only

identifies which of 9 Census divisions they resided in at age 16. Therefore, I calculated division-by-

year means of these state-year dummies using state-year population estimates as weights.28 I then

matched each GSS respondent to these fractional variables representing restrictive child-labor laws

that were in effect at age 14 in their reported division of residence at age 16.

        In Table 7, I present evidence on how this variable influenced years of completed schooling

among the full group of respondents for whom voting data are available as well as among the smaller

samples who were asked questions about newspaper readership, group memberships and free speech.

The sparsest specification (Model (1)) suggests that exposure to a restrictive child labor law

increased years of schooling by roughly one year. These estimates are somewhat sensitive to

introducing the contemporaneous measures of school quality and civic engagement as controls

(Model (2)). However, the results from the remaining specifications are largely unchanged after

introducing the family/community controls and fixed effects specific to each division and survey-

year cell. Specifically, these estimates suggest that teen exposure to restrictive child labor laws




28
  This construction introduces measurement error into the instruments. However, it is not clear that
the implied measurement error is any less than that in other studies based on PUMS data, which
identify state of birth but not state of teen residence.
                                                                                                          22


increased years of schooling by a statistically significant .5 to .7 years.29 The quality of this measure

of restrictive child-labor laws as an instrument hinges critically on the maintained assumption that

these estimates accurately reflect its independent effects on educational attainment. The evidence

from prior studies is generally consistent with this view. For example, Lleras-Muney (2002) presents

a variety of ad-hoc empirical evidence on changes in child-labor laws and concludes that they were

not endogenously determined. Furthermore, Goldin (2001) argues that such laws played a relatively

minor role in the dramatic “high school movement” from 1910 to 1940, which suggests that these

law changes were not part of substantive social changes that might have also influenced civic

attitudes..

         The robustness of the first-stage estimates in Table 7 to the introduction of the additional

controls (i.e., across Models (2), (3) and (4)) also provides supporting evidence. However, in Table

8, I provide additional empirical evidence on the validity of these instruments by assessing some

straightforward counterfactuals. More specifically, if these models effectively identify the influence

of stricter child-labor laws on educational attainment, we should find that these estimated effects are

largely concentrated at the lower end of the distribution of educational attainment (Acemoglu and

Angrist 2000, Lleras-Muney 2002). However, we should be especially concerned about the existence

of undiagnosed specification errors if similarly specified models indicate that these laws had

substantive effects on higher levels of educational attainment. In particular, that could indicate that

the within-division variation in strict child-labor laws had a confounding correlation with the

unobserved determinants of educational attainment and other dimensions of youth development. In

Table 8, I present the estimated effects of restrictive child-labor laws on different levels of

educational attainment based on specifications that include the full set of controls (i.e., as in Model

(4) in Tables 6 and 7). These estimates indicate that the effects associated with stricter child-labor


29
  These estimated effects are somewhat larger than those reported by Acemoglu and Angrist (2000).
However, these differences appear to reflect the unique composition of their sample. They consider
older white males from particular birth cohorts. I get similar point estimates for the relevant sub-
sample of GSS respondents.
                                                                                                            23


laws were largely concentrated at the secondary level. More specifically, these estimates indicate that

the strictest child-labor laws led to large and statistically significant increases in the probability of

completing 9, 10, 11 and 12 years of schooling and the probability of high school graduation.

However, the same specifications indicate that these law changes had smaller and statistically

insignificant effects on several measures of post-secondary educational attainment.



Results

          The results in Tables 7 and 8 suggest that restrictive child labor laws may provide a valid

source of identifying information for estimating effects of variation in secondary schooling on adult

civic behaviors. In Table 9, I present 2SLS estimates of the effect of years of completed on each

measure of civic engagement.30 The results indicate that schooling has uniformly positive and

statistically significant effects on most measures of civic engagement and attitudes. For example,

these 2SLS estimates suggest that an additional year of schooling increased voter participation by a

weakly significant 6.8 percentage points (t-statistic=1.93), which is nearly twice the change implied

by the OLS estimate. The estimates in Table 9 also suggest that schooling increases the quality of

civic engagement and knowledge. More specifically, the 2SLS estimates imply that an additional

year of schooling generates a weakly significant increase (t-statistic=2.02) in the frequency of

newspaper readership that is roughly equivalent to that implied by the OLS estimate. The estimated

effect of schooling on group memberships is also positive but highly imprecise. However, these

estimates also imply that that schooling significantly increased support for free speech by anti-

religionists, communists and homosexuals. These estimated effects (8.0 to 12.5 percentage points)

are several times larger than those implied by the corresponding OLS estimates. But the estimated

effects of schooling on support for speech by militarists and racists are smaller and statistically

imprecise.

30
  I also experimented with specifications that recognized the categorical nature of the dependent
variable and the potential endogeneity of schooling (Wooldridge 2002) and found that they generated
similar results.
                                                                                                        24


        One of the concerns noted earlier is that the self-reported data on voting participation may

overstate actual turnout more dramatically in the most recent GSS surveys (particularly for survey

responses regarding the 1996 Presidential election). In Table 10, I assess whether a possible change

in reporting biases may have influenced this study’s key inferences. This evidence is based on the

2SLS estimates from models that incrementally exclude data from the more recent GSS surveys. The

results suggest that recent changes in reporting biases may impart a downward bias to the estimated

effect of schooling on voter turnout. Specifically, in models that exclude the most recent surveys, the

estimated effect of schooling on voter participation is nearly twice as large. While this sensitivity

could be due to any number of factors (e.g., cohort-specific changes in the schooling-voting

relationship), it is also consistent with an increased trend towards overstating voter participation

among less-educated respondents. Regardless, these results suggest that the estimates in Table 9

could be understood as a lower bound for the effect of secondary schooling on voter participation.



CONCLUSIONS

        In this study, I presented an empirical analysis of one of the fundamental relationships that

motivates public policies towards education: the effects of schooling on civic participation and

attitudes. In particular, I assessed whether increases in educational attainment have causal effects on

civic outcomes by exploiting possibly exogenous sources of variation in schooling that should

otherwise be unrelated to civic outcomes in adulthood (i.e., the geographic availability of two-year

colleges as a teen and exposure to child labor laws as a teen). The results suggested that educational

attainment, both at the post-secondary and the secondary levels, has large and independent effects on

most measures of civic engagement and attitudes. The apparent existence of these civic returns

implies that much of the long-lived hyperbole about the important role of education in a functioning

democracy may be accurate. However, it should also be noted that a great deal of the discussion

surrounding the role of education in a democracy has also confused the existence of these

externalities with other fundamental issues related to how the government should intervene in the
                                                                                                         25


market for education (e.g., price subsidies, regulation of the private sector, public production). In

particular, the existence of large civic returns to education is not necessarily relevant to the difficult

question of whether government should be involved in directly producing education (i.e., the “choice

of instrument” problem, Poterba 1996). Nonetheless, these results clearly underscore the dramatic

relevance of schooling to the critical functions of a democratic society and imply that initiatives to

promote educational attainment merit the continued and careful scrutiny of researchers and

policymakers.

                                         DATA APPENDIX

    A. High School and Beyond (HS&B) Sophomore Cohort
    HS&B, one of the U.S. Department of Education’s major longitudinal studies (Ingels and
Baldridge 1995), began with 1980 high school sophomores and seniors. The base-year samples were
based on a two-stage, stratified, probability design. In the first stage, high schools were chosen.
Certain types of schools (e.g., those with large Hispanic enrollments, Catholic schools with large
minority enrollments) were oversampled (Zahs et al. 1995). In the second stage, as many as 36
sophomores were randomly chosen from participating schools. The initial HS&B sample included
over 30,000 high school sophomores from 1,105 schools. Follow-up interviews of a stratified
sample of the original sophomore cohort occurred in 1982, 1984, 1986 and 1992. This study is based
on the 12,022 respondents from the sophomore cohort who participated in the second (1984) and
fourth (1992) follow-up interviews. The interviews for the fourth follow-up occurred from February
1992 through January 1993. Some observations were deleted because they were missing data on
post-secondary attainment in the 2nd follow-up (n=108) and because they attended a base-year school
for which the school survey responses did not provide information on college proximity (n=425). Of
the remaining 11,489 respondents, almost all answered the 4th follow-up questions on voting and
volunteering (see Table A1). The extract includes basic information on the gender, race/ethnicity,
age, and religious affiliation of the respondents. This extract also includes base-year information for
each respondent on family income (9 categories), highest parental education (5 categories), family
structure (6 categories) and the urbanicity of the high school area (3 categories). The 1980 attitudinal
question on the importance of correcting social/economic inequality has three possible responses: not
important (1), somewhat important (2) and very important (3). These respondents were also matched
to 1980 county-level data on voter turnout, on the percent of the population aged 18-24 and on the
percent of adults who graduated from high school, which were drawn from ICPSR study number
8314. Data on two-year colleges (institution type of 3, 5 or 6) were drawn from the 1983-1984
Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS, ICPSR study number 8291). County-level
counts were generated after excluding central offices and institutions that are for-profit or require
graduation from a two-year or 4-year college for admittance. Data on state-level voter regulations in
1992 were taken from Knack (1995, Appendix B).

     B. 1972-2000 General Social Surveys (GSS)
     The GSS is a personal-interview survey conducted every one to two years since 1972 and
designed to track a broad range of social attitudes and behaviors over time (NORC 2001). These
surveys were based on multi-stage probability samples of English-speaking persons aged 18 and over
living in non-institutional settings. The structure of the sampling design was broadly consistent over
time. The primary sampling units were generally Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas (SMSA),
counties and independent cities. In the second stage, block groups and enumeration districts were
chosen. In block groups and enumeration districts with large numbers of dwellings, a third stage was
sometimes carried out to select dwellings within a block. One interview was conducted at each
selected house. The 1972-2000 cumulative data file consists of 40,933 respondents (ICPSR study no.
3197). I deleted respondents aged 22 or less (n=2,810), those aged 14 in 1913 or earlier (n=668),
                                                                                                     40


those aged 14 in 1979 or later (n=2,892), those not in the U.S. at age 16 (n=1,709) and those missing
data on educational attainment (n=78). The remaining sample consisted of 32,776 observations.
Each GSS survey asked about voter participation in the most recent Presidential election (1968-
1996). Most of the limited non-response to the voting questions is due to respondents identifying
themselves as ineligible to vote. In most survey years (all but 1973, 1974, 1976, 1980, 1984),
respondents were also asked how often they read the newspaper: never (0), less than once a week (1),
once a week (2), a few times a week (3), every day (4). In all years except for 1972, 1973, 1976,
1982, 1985, 1996, 1998 and 2000, respondents were also asked about their membership in various
types of groups and organizations. Except for the surveys in 1975, 1978, 1983 and 1986, respondents
were also asked about allowing free speech for anti-religionists, communists and homosexuals (also
not asked in 1972). The questions about free speech for militarists and racists were asked in all
survey years except 1972-1975, 1978, 1983 and 1986. The sample means and sample sizes for the
voting, newspaper, group-membership and free speech variables are reported in Table A2. In
addition to the basic demographic information (age, gender, race, religious preference), these
respondents also provided retrospective information on their Census division of residence at age 16
(9 categories), their family income at age 16 (6 categories), family structure at age 16 (6 categories),
the urbanicity of their residence at age 16 (7 categories) and their parent’s highest educational degree
(5 categories). Using state-year data on whether restrictive child labor laws were in effect (CL of 9 or
higher; Acemoglu and Angrist 2000), I calculated a population-weighted variable by year and
Census division. I then matched the GSS respondents to the law variable in effect when they were
aged 14 in their reported Census division of residence at age 16. I also matched the respondents to
the pupil-teacher ratios and relative teacher salary at age 14 in the public schools in their Census
division of residence at age 16. The sources for enrollment and teacher data were various editions of
the Biennial Survey of Education, the Statistical Abstract of the United States and the Digest of
Education Statistics. I interpolated annual values for these series when they were only available
every other year. Another source of measurement error in these data is that, in a small number of
years, some states combined other instructional staff (e.g., librarians) with teacher counts and
salaries. I calculated relative teacher salaries by using division-year data on wages paid to road
workers on Federal projects (1914-1956; Card and Krueger 1992) and wages paid to production
workers in manufacturing (1957-1978). I also matched respondents to the voter turnout in
Presidential elections that occurred in their division of residence between the ages of 13 and 16. For
example, respondents aged 14 between 1914 and 1917 were matched to the voter turnout in 1916 for
their Census division of residence at age 16. The data on voter turnout were drawn from various
editions of the Statistical Abstract of the United States. For elections before 1952, estimates of the
voting-age population are based on the nearest decennial Census. For the voting-age population
during the 1916 election, I used one-half of the 1920 estimate.
