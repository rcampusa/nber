                                          ABSTRACT

Using two hundred years of national and Massachusetts data on medical care and health, we
examine how central medical care is to life expectancy gains. While common theories about
medical care cost growth stress growing demand, our analysis highlights the importance of
supply side factors, including the major public investments in research, workforce training and
hospital construction that fueled a surge in spending over the 1955-1975 span. There is a stronger
case that personal medicine affected health in the second half of the twentieth century than in the
preceding 150 years. Finally, we consider whether medical care productivity decreases over time,
and find that spending increased faster than life expectancy, although the ratio stabilized in the
past two decades.

Introduction


         If not nasty and brutish, life two centuries ago was much shorter than now. Since

then, life expectancy at birth nearly doubled, and life expectancy at age 65 increased

more than 66%.1 Medical care, two centuries ago, was a small part of the economy.

Doctors were loosely trained, the cause of disease was misunderstood, and hospitals

were where to die (Starr, 1982). Today, medical care is a major employer, accounts for

almost one-fifth of GDP, once fatal diseases are curable, and access to health is fought

over. How much medical care contributed to gains in life expectancy is the subject of this

paper.


         A substantial part of the improvements in health status over the past two centuries

was due to improved nutrition and public health. Fogel examined how technological and

physiological changes affected mortality, a symbiotic process he termed “technophysio

evolution”. He showed that the relevant factors in improved health changed over time,

and argued that long-term trends in life expectancy are due primarily to environmental

factors that enhanced the physiological capital of successive cohorts rather than access

to health care (Fogel 2004). At the same time, as health care transformed, new medical

advances and therapeutics have undoubtedly contributed to reduced mortality and

improved human wellbeing (Cutler, Deaton and Lleras Muney, 2006, Deaton 2004, Cutler

2004). Research on the evolving contribution of medical care to gains in life expectancy

over time remains early.


      This paper seeks to inform the debate on the evolving contribution of medical care

to life expectancy gains by adducing two hundred years of data on health and medical

care. Since national mortality data go back only in scattered form, we present national

data where available but focus our examination on Massachusetts, where data are

available since 1850. Our data on medical care include both medical spending and

employment, the latter a good proxy for spending when spending data are not available.

       Our analysis has three goals. First, we document gains in life expectancy and

changes in medical care over the past two centuries. Using national vital statistics and

estimates of life expectancy, we describe changes in mortality in the United States and

document the timing of trends and variation across big cities and other urban and rural

areas. As the evolution of medical care is related to its potential to affect health outcomes,

we then describe the changes in medical care organizations and institutions, and the

corresponding increases in medical expenditures and employment, that happened

concurrently with the gains in life expectancy.


       Second, we consider the role of medical care in the large improvement in health

over this time period. Our analysis of the link between medical care and health is not

conclusive, as we face the fundamental issue of intertwined development that have has

plagued past researchers as well. Still, deriving observations from data from

Massachusetts and nationally, we show there is a stronger case that personal medicine

affected health in the second half of the 20th century than in the preceding 150 years. Big

                                              2
medicine brought big benefits, especially to the older population, at big cost. In contrast,

much of the health advance prior to the mid-20th century was a result of public health

improvements, perhaps sometimes supported by physicians but not resulting from clinical

therapies for individual patients.

       Third, we consider whether medical advances are as productive now as in the past.

We do this simply, comparing the change in life expectancy with the change in medical

spending in each decade. Life expectancy is increasing, but not as fast as health care

expenditures. Since 1935 spending per year of life gained increases. In the past two

decades the cost effectiveness ratio has stabilized, but at a very high level.

       The first section of the paper describes the concurrent evolution of life expectancy

and medical care over the past two centuries. The second section examines the

importance of medical care and public health for health improvements. The third section

discusses the change in spending per year of life gained over time.


   1. Health and medical care: 1800-2016


       This section documents gains in life expectancy and changes in medical care that

happened concurrently in the United States and in Massachusetts over the past two

centuries.


   1.1.      Two hundred years of health



   1.1.1. Life expectancy gains in the United States


                                             3
       Using national vital statistics and published estimates of life expectancy, this

section documents the life expectancy gains of the U.S. population, and their distribution

across age groups and cohorts, over the past two centuries. The federal government

started collecting mortality data in 1900 from ten states. All states reported reliable data

by 1933. Fogel and colleagues (e.g., Fogel, 1986 and 2004; Haines, 2001), estimated

life expectancy prior to 1900, at age 10 because child deaths were not then consistently

recorded. Hacker (2010) extended these estimates to life expectancy at birth. We use

Hacker’s estimates, understanding that life expectancy at birth is subject to more error

than at age 10, but noting that the trends between the various series are relatively similar.

       Life expectancy at birth in the United States rose from 43 years in 1800 to 79 in

2014, with the bulk of gains realized during the twentieth century (Figure 1). During the

ninetieth century, life expectancy at birth increased modestly, from 43 years to 49 years.

In 1800, 43 years was above the level in England and France (36 and 33 years,

respectively; Fogel, 2004), likely because the U.S. had more agricultural resources and

less urban crowding. In the next half century, life expectancy fell by about 5 years. Prior

to public health improvements, urban areas were less healthy than rural areas, and the

share of the US population living in urban areas rose from 6% in 1800 to 15% in 1850.

By 1880, life expectancy had recovered, and the United States entered the 20th century

with life expectancy at birth of just under 50 years.


       The major improvements in survival occurred in the 20th century. Life expectancy

at birth rose from 49 years in 1900 to 59 years by 1930, to 75 in 1990 and near 80

presently. In the first half of the 20th century, the leading cause of life expectancy gains


                                              4
was reduced mortality from infectious disease. There were less deaths from water-borne

(e.g., typhoid fever) and air-borne (e.g., tuberculosis) diseases. In the second half of the

century, much more decline was due to decreasing cardiovascular disease mortality,

primarily heart attacks and strokes. Age-adjusted cardiovascular disease mortality fell by

73% between 1950 and 2015.


       While between 1900 and 1950, mortality rates for younger populations fell

enormously, after mid-century, the decline was much more pronounced at older ages.

Figure 2 shows mortality rates by age over time from Vital Statistics records. We divide

the population by 10-year age group and show annual trends in mortality in four time

periods: 1900-1935; 1935-1950; 1950-1990; and 1990-2016. The first period is the time

of large-scale improvements in public health, especially clean water and sanitation. The

second period involved continued public health innovation as well as the first widespread

medical care interventions: sulfa drugs, in the late 1930s and penicillin, in the early 1940s.


       Between 1900 and 1950, mortality rates for younger populations fell enormously.

Over the entire half century, mortality for infants fell by 80%, mortality for children aged

1-4 fell by 93%, and mortality for children aged 5-14 fell by 84%. By contrast, mortality

rates among people aged 45-54 fell by only 43% and mortality among people 65-74 fell

by 27%. Corresponding to this was a large increase in life expectancy at birth (20 years

between 1900 and 1950), but a much smaller increase in life expectancy at age 65 (about

2 years).2




       2 Life   expectancy at age 65 are available in Bureau of the Census (1921).
                                                     5
       After mid-century, the decline in mortality was much more pronounced at older

ages. Infant and child mortality continued to decline (an 80% cumulative decline from

1950 through 2016), but the rates were already so low that further reductions added less

to overall life expectancy. Rather, the dominant source of life expectancy gains was

reduced cardiovascular disease mortality. Between 1950 and 2016, mortality rates for

people aged 65-74 fell by 1.2% annually, compared to 0.4% annually from 1900-1950.

The cumulative decline post-1950 was 56%. Life expectancy at birth increased by 11

years between 1950 and 2016, more than half of which was associated with increased

survival at ages 65 and older.

       To consider the changes in mortality by age in more detail, Figure 3 plots the

logarithm of annual mortality rates from 1900-2016 for four age groups: 0-14, 15-44, 45-

64, and 65-84.3 In each case, mortality in 1900 is normalized to 100, so the figures show

the relative trend over time. The great flu epidemic of 1918 is clearly visible. As has been

widely noted, the highest relative mortality from the flu was in young adults. Mortality for

the older two groups – 45-64 and 65-84 – declines only slowly through 1936, before a

somewhat rapid decline in the antibiotic era. The period of rapid sustained reduction in

mortality in older age groups starts around 1968.


       Mortality for the two older cohorts moves roughly in parallel, with a few exceptions.

Relative mortality for the population 45-64 fell in the 1910s, where mortality for the elderly

population was stable. At the end of the time period, from 1999-2016, mortality for               the




       3 We  normalize population within each age group using the 1970 population standard. We omit the
population aged 85 and older because the average age of this age group is changing most rapidly.
                                                  6
population aged 45-64 has been flat or increasing, as noted by Case and Deaton (2015,

2017), particularly for non-Hispanic whites, especially those with less education.


       The era of large mortality improvements for the elderly, from 1968 on, is also an

era of large mortality reductions for the near elderly below age 65, though they lag by 5

years. The similarity of mortality for these two groups suggests that the explanation is not

something that is specific to the elderly population, as for example the implementation of

Medicare in 1966 (see also Finkelstein and McKnight, 2008).

       Certain cohorts have higher or lower mortality. Figure 4 shows the time series of

the ratio of mortality rates for people in adjacent age groups: 55-64 to 45-54, 65-74 to 55-

64, and 75-84 to 65-74 from 1900 to 2016. In the first half of the century, mortality rates

were declining more for the younger population; thus, the ratio of mortality for people aged

55-64 was rising relative to people aged 45-54. That trend stopped around 1960,

consistent with Figure 3.


       The cohort reaching age 55 around 1982 (born around 1927) has significantly

higher mortality than the cohort 10 years younger. That higher mortality continues

through the cohort passing through that age range in the mid-1990s, roughly, when the

cohort born in 1933 reaches age 65. That same cohort also has higher mortality when

they are 65-74 and 75-84. The story is not one of selection – a handful of less healthy

people who die and leave behind healthier stock. Rather, it seems that an entire

generation was rendered vulnerable by being born during and just before the Great

Depression (Lleras-Muney and Moreau, 2018).



                                             7
   1.1.2. Timing of trends and geographic variation: evidence from
          Massachusetts

       Massachusetts data include long time series and geographic detail, providing

valuable additional information about the timing of trends and mortality for each city and

town. This section describes mortality trends in large metropolitan areas, other urban

areas and rural areas, and shows that the trends in the three groups of areas are

somewhat different in overlapping time periods, particularly since 1990, with a significant

reduction in mortality in the Boston SMA, unmatched in other Massachusetts SMAs.


       Massachusetts has collected vital statistics since 1851, long before the federal

government. The data are tabulated in an Annual Report on the Vital Statistics of

Massachusetts. The timing of mortality changes in Massachusetts may not match those

of the nation as a whole. Massachusetts was richer and had a greater medical care

supply. Still, for the changes in mortality driven by understanding of disease and

technological innovation, the differences in timing are likely not too great.

       The crude (not age adjusted) mortality rate in Massachusetts, stitched together

from various vital statistics reports are reported in Figure 5. Mortality rates in

Massachusetts were about 20 per 1,000 (2% annually) from 1851 through the early

1890s. The rate was increasing slightly, though not greatly (0.3% per year). After 1892

mortality rates decreased dramatically, by 1.2% annually from 1892-1938, a cumulative

decline of nearly 50%. Then, after a period of relative stagnation in mortality between

1938 and the late 1960s, mortality rates started declining again post-1965, at an annual

rate of 0.5% until 2015. This is below the rate of decline in the early 20th century. But the

lack of age adjustment is important in this comparison: the crude death rate does not
                                              8
decline as rapidly when mortality reductions occur at older ages, because the marginal

survivors add to the number of people at more advanced ages, who have higher mortality

rates than younger individuals.

       In addition to the long time series, Massachusetts data provide geographic detail

on mortality in each of the 350 cities and towns in the State. We assembled data on the

number of deaths and population at five-year intervals from 1880 through 2015 (1880,

1885, and so on). We divided cities and towns into three groups: the 25 urban areas

having population of 25,000 or more in 1910; the remaining cities and towns that are

included in a Statistical Metropolitan Area (SMA) in 1950 (N=107); and the smaller areas

that are not included in a 1950 SMA (N=221). Both infectious disease and access to

medical care likely differ for those areas near to and far from metropolitan areas.


       The prevalence of small towns means that some deaths recorded in one town were

from people who lived in another town. Starting in 1945, deaths are tabulated both by

occurrence and residence. We use the death rate by place of occurrence prior to 1945

and the death rate by place of residence post-1945. We show data in 1945 both ways on

the charts for comparability. Unsurprisingly, death rates in the major urban areas fall and

death rates in other areas rise when tabulating deaths by residence as opposed to by

occurrence (some people die in hospitals). Because we suspect that very ill people were

also moving into cities during the 1935-1945 time period, where we do not have deaths

by residence, we do not examine the 1935-45 time period in as much detail.




                                             9
       As Figure 64 shows, trends in mortality in the three groups of areas are somewhat

different in overlapping time periods5. In 1880, mortality was highest in large metropolitan

areas and lowest outside of them. The gap was 13% (statistically significantly higher). In

the next half century, mortality fell throughout the state, but differentially more and earlier

in metropolitan areas. Mortality started declining around 1880 in metropolitan areas, 1890

in towns near metropolitan areas, and 1895 in rural areas. In 1930, mortality rates were

equal in major urban areas and rural areas; the lowest mortality rates were in suburban

areas that ultimately became part of SMAs. The trends diverged a bit post-1930. This

might reflect either true changes or more people receiving medical care in cities, and

hence dying there.

       After World War II, the trends are somewhat more divergent. Mortality increased

in major urban areas between 1950 and 1965, before beginning a lengthy fall. Mortality

in semi-urban and rural areas did not rise, but did not decline as rapidly. With the advent

of cars and commutes into cities, the distinction between urban and suburban mortality

became less relevant. For example, some of the increase in urban mortality between

1950 and 1965 is likely to reflect the movement of people outside of the Boston city limits

into nearby suburbs. To address this, our post-World War II analysis focuses on the SMA-

level. Within the SMA group, we separate Boston from the other SMAs, since it has the

most significant medical presence.



       4  Because there are a number of very small towns with high variance in mortality rates, the data
are weighted by population.
        5 Between 1945 and 1950, the change in death rates based on place of occurrence are -3.9%, -

3.6%, and -6.0% for the largest urban areas, areas near the largest urban areas, and areas farther from
the largest urban areas. Using death rates based on residence, the same changes are -5.1%, -4.3%, and
-4.2%.
                                                  10
       The recent divergence in trends between the Boston SMA, other SMAs and rural

areas of Massachusetts are shown in Figure 7. Mortality throughout the state was

relatively flat from 1945-1965. There was a slight increase in the Boston area and a slight

decline in rural areas, but the changes were modest. After 1965, mortality began

declining throughout the state. The declines were rapid and reasonably uniform through

1990: 23% in the Boston MSA, 20% in other MSAs, and 23% in rural areas. After 1990,

there was a significant reduction in mortality in the Boston SMA, unmatched in other

SMAs. Mortality rates in the Boston MSA declined by 18% between 1990 and 2015,

compared to a rise of 1% in other SMAs and a rise of 7% in rural areas. All three parts

of the state experienced increases in mortality between 2010 and 2015, reflecting the

widespread opioid epidemic.

       Many factors could explain the trends in mortality in Boston and throughout the

state, including changes in age or income composition of the residents, along with public

health and medical care. As our goal is to assess the importance of medical care in life

expectancy gains, the next section describes changes in medical care that occurred

concurrently with the described gains in life expectancy.


   1.2.   Two hundred years of medical care


       As the evolution of medical care over the past two centuries is intimately related to

its potential to affect health outcomes, this section describes the changes in medical care

organizations and institutions, and the corresponding increases in medical expenditures

and employment, that happened concurrently with the life expectancy gains documented

in the previous section.
                                            11
   1.2.1. Changes in Medical Care Organizations and Institutions

       This overview of the organizational and institutional aspects of medical care sets

the context for the next section documenting increases in medical expenditures and

employment over the past two centuries. Medical institutions have not developed linearly

or independently. Even though scientific advances have been major forces, policy and

path-dependence have also played major roles.


       Medical organization remained rudimentary up to the beginning of the 20th

century. Basic transactions between doctors and patients, and ancillary services provided

by nurses, druggists and hospitals, composed the small medical part of the economy.

Since the early twentieth century, overall economic and social development influenced

the organization and institutions of medicine. Scientific advances led to changes in

medical technology and organization. Many of the initial discoveries came from Europe

(aspirin, antisepsis, bacteria, stethoscopes, vaccination, vitamins, X-rays) but the United

States became the main supplier of medical research during the mid and late 20th century.

Of the 18 Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine awarded 1901-1920, none went to US

researchers. Over the next two decades, four out of twenty-four did, then for the rest of

the century, more than half.

       Scientific advances led to the regulation of the medical profession, the increasing

specialization of doctors, and the rise of ancillary occupations. The Flexner Report (1910)

called for reform of medical education based upon European scientific standards, and

influenced the regulation of the medical profession. This evolution led to greater division

of labor, with the regulation of existing ancillary occupations (e.g., nursing, nutritionists)


                                             12
and the creation of new ones (e.g., audiologist, perfusionist, nurse anesthetist,

occupational therapist, radiology technician). Doctors differentiated into a series of

specialties and sub-specialties6.

        The technological advances requiring capital investments and the increasing

division of labor requiring coordination of specialized groups of workers both called for

central organizations. Hospitals played this role even as they remained under the control

of legally and economically independent medical staffs. Physician control over

governance faded in recent years as hospitals became larger, accumulated outpatient

facilities, linked into large health systems, increased full time staff, and reduced the ranks

of independent medical staff members.


        Paying more employees and buying more expensive equipment forced hospitals

to find more stable and expansive sources of funding. In response to the Great

Depression, Blue Cross pre-payment and insurance pools were established. Shortly

thereafter, doctors established Blue Shield plans to facilitate collection of fees. During

World War II, private insurance companies entered this arena. Yet as private health

insurance expanded, it became more and more evident that the neediest groups, the old,

the poor and the disabled, would lack coverage unless government stepped in. Medicare

and Medicaid filled the gap.            By the end of the century, government had become the




        6
          Boards of surgery (1913), ophthalmology (1916), radiology (1923), internal medicine (1936) and other
fields were established, eventually including family medicine (1969) emergency medicine (1979) genetics and
genomics (1980) and clinical informatics (2011).
                                                     13
largest source of “personal” health insurance and, the main producer of standards for

physician payment7.

        Changes in the size, scope and complexity of medical practice shifted the division

of labor (from generalist to specialist), locus of payment (from individual to group),

geographic reach (from local to national), and regulatory framework controlling medical

institutions (from voluntary to mandatory/legal). During the 1920s and 1930s, the local

county medical society was the primary institution regulating the medical profession.

Hospital privileges depended upon the approval of a local peer group, and payments

came from patients residing in the community. By the 1950s, two associations of local

associations, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the American Hospital

Association (AHA), had become dominant national political forces, yet standards of

practice and payments remained local. This changed through the impulse of federal

legislation, with the creation of the NIH in 1938, the Hill Burton Act of 1946, the Health

Professions and Education Act of 1963, the Social Security Amendments of 1965 to

create Medicare and Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act (ACA) of 2010. The

organization and financing of medical care became increasingly national. Expert

judgments from national specialty boards, and accrediting organizations such as JHACO

(the Joint Commission) slowly replaced local community standards.


        In spite of these evolutionary changes, the U.S. health care system remains

fragmented and wasteful due to overtreatment, failures of care coordination, failures in



        7
          The earlier Blue Cross hospital rate-setting and Blue Shield “Usual, Customary and Reasonable” (UCR)
physician payment standards were displaced by prevailing Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) and Resource-Based
Relative Value Scale (RBRVS) standards, administratively regulated.

execution of care processes, administrative complexity, pricing failures, fraud and abuse

(Berwick and Hackbarth, 2012). Almost 10% of the population is still uninsured. Groups

of lobbyists representing many specialties, various ancillary professions, rural or urban

hospitals, private insurance, pharmaceutical companies and specific disease advocates,

now contest control over money in Washington DC.


       Voluntary professional control, charitable financing for care of the poor, non-profit

community hospitals and local insurance plans faded as the rise of a “medical-industrial

complex” resulted in “the monetarization of medical care” (Relman, 1980; Ginzberg,

1984). Professional obligations on physicians to volunteer at clinics and use sliding fee

scales could not cover an expansion of expenditures from 2.5% to 15% of GDP. Blue

Cross and Blue Shield could not retain community rating when confronted by selective

group enrollment from private insurance companies. Hospitals’ non-profit community

orientation eroded under debt loads and patient selection. Voluntarism largely dissipated

except in safety net institutions by the turn of the 21st century.

       Changes in medical expenditures and employment mirrored these changes in

medical care organizations and institutions. The next section documents the quantitative

magnitude of these changes.


   1.2.2. The growth of the medical care sector

       Medical care employment mirrored the growth of health spending, although most

of employment growth has been in non-physician personnel. Piecing together information

on the size of the medical system over the past two centuries is challenging since national

statistics did not keep track of the medical sector separately until the early twentieth
                                              15
century. Data about medical spending and employment were assembled and described

in detail by Getzen (2017), and are summarized in Table 1 and Appendix A.


      Medical spending and medical spending growth are presented in Figures 8 and 9.

Figure 8 shows medical care as a share of GDP. Figure 9 shows the 15-year moving

average of growth rates. Medical care employment as a share of total employment is

presented in Figure 10. Table 1 contains summary statistics in decadal intervals.

Available data for the last two hundred years suggest that medical expenditures followed

an S-shaped growth curve: variable but slowly rising before 1900, increasing to average

+1% in excess of real per capita income for the next half-century, surging to more than

+3% above GDP in the post-World War II era, and eventually moderating.

      Medical care accounted for about 2% of GDP in 1800, 2.2% in 1850, and 2.5% in

1900. These estimates suggest that the growth of medical care exceeded the growth of

the economy as a whole by only 0.2% annually (± 0.5%) over the 19th Century.


      Spending began to accelerate before 1900 in the more developed areas. Between

1880 and 1900, medical care rose from 0.8% of total employment to 1.2% of total

employment. Medical care spending was rising steadily by the 1920s, though major

variations on the order of two-fold to ten-fold across states and regions make

generalization of a national trend problematic.


      Medical care rose rapidly as a share of the economy in the Great Depression, but

some of this is a transitory artifact since medical spending fluctuates less than other

sectors of the economy. Overall, excess growth of   medical costs averaged about +1%

per year from 1900 to 1950.
                                            16
       Following World War II, particularly after 1955, medical costs surged. From 1955

to 1970, medical spending grew more than +3% more rapidly than incomes. Expansion

continued to be strong for the next twenty-five years (+2.7% excess 1970-1995) but has

moderated toward +1.5% or less in the decades since. The post-1955 trend is not linear.

Macroeconomic stagflation caused a temporary dip in the health share of GDP in 1973

but the overall rate of growth remained relatively high for the next twenty years.


       The growth of medical care employment has mirrored the growth of spending,

mostly in non-physician personnel. Physicians accounted for 0.8% of the total U.S.

workforce in 1850, falling to 0.5% in 1900 and 0.3% in 1950, before rising to 0.6% in 2000

and about 0.7% today. While physicians made up two-thirds of the health workforce in

1880, they were less than one-tenth in 1990, with more than 11 other health workers for

each physician employed.


       Establishing reliable sub-trends for shorter periods is difficult. Data are thin and not

reliable before 1900. Since there was little expansion during the 19th century, this

absence does not greatly complicate the analysis of trends. From 1900 to 1955, medical

care spending varied considerably across years and regions. The Great Depression and

World War II complicate the analysis of health expenditures over this period. Whether the

growth in health spending was more or less rapid after the onset of the Great Depression

depends upon the perspective taken. The 1929 shock is so large that calculated excess

growth rates are +1.2% for 1900-1929 and 0.8% for 1929-1955, but +1.4% and +0.5% for

1900-1930 and 1930-1950. However, since income growth was so much more rapid in




                                              17
the later period, relative growth in real per capita spending rather than share of GDP gives

the opposite result, 2.9% vs. 3.5% for 1900-1930 and 1930-1955 respectively.


      Analyzing the Great Depression, World War II, and Korean War era, Seale

asserted that “the proportion of the gross national product in a nation devoted to medical

care tends to remain constant,” and “a persistent rise in real per capita GNP will tend to

result in a very gradual increase” (Seale, 1959) (see Figure 11).

      To some extent, Seale’s econometrics were flawed. Changes in inflation rate take

up to three years to work through the health care system and real income shocks are

distributed over five years or more (Getzen, 1992, 2000, 2017). As a result, Seale may

have underestimated growth rates in the 1940s. The decline in the health share of GDP

between 1950 and 1955 is partly attributable to lagged effects from the 1949 and 1954

recessions. Still, the conclusion of a modest and inertial response to macroeconomic

disruptions was generally appropriate at least prior to 1960.


      Even with much better annual data, post-1960 delineation of sub-trends is

challenging. Four recent papers demarcate a number of eras in health expenditures

growth over the last fifty years (Chandra, Holmes, and Skinner 2013; Catlin and Cowan,

2015; Chen and Goldman, 2016, Horenstein and Santos, 2018). Using essentially the

same time-series, they each divide the time span at different places and into a differing

number of eras.


      Examining changes in health expenditures at particular institutions provides

another perspective. Meyer, et al. (2012) present 200 years of health and mortality at

Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), based on the hospital’s annual             records.
                                            18
Spending per person at MGH was relatively stable at about $1,000 (in 2010 dollars,

adjusted using the CPI) from 1820-1910. Costs increased mildly from 1910 through 1960,

before increasing quite rapidly after 1960. Spending per case, in real terms, increased

nearly 7-fold between 1960 and 2010, much more than in the prior 150 years.


   2. How central is medical care to life expectancy gains?


We consider the role of medical care in the large improvement in health over the past two

centuries. Deriving observations from national and Massachusetts data, we show there

is a stronger case that personal medicine affected health in the second half of the 20th

century than in the preceding 150 years.


   2.1.    The infectious disease era: 1800-1935


       A significant body of research has examined the cause of reduced mortality in the

early part of the 20th century. The consensus is that public health improvements explain

the bulk of the decline in mortality in this era, including both water (Cutler and Miller, 2005)

and sewage treatment (Alsan and Goldin, 2018). In this section, we analyze whether

medical care explains some of the residual mortality using data from big U.S. cities and

all cities and towns in Massachusetts.


   2.1.1. Evidence from U.S. big cities

       To extend the analysis of Cutler and Miller (2005), we consider whether cities with

greater medical care supply had larger trend reductions in mortality over the 1900-1936

time period. We find that areas with more physicians per population had a slightly smaller
                                              19
decrease in mortality, and that there is little correlation between medical care supply and

the timing of clean water interventions.


        The push for public health improvements began shortly after the germ theory of

disease became widely accepted in the late 19th Century. Public health officials could

finally explain how and why many people became sick and propose remedies for disease.

Since the remedies were often expensive – big treatment facilities and new sources of

water – the exact timing of the public health interventions varied across cities.

        Cutler and Miller (2005) use data on mortality by city and year matched with data

on clean water interventions to examine how clean water affected mortality. Their sample

includes 13 cities, each with data from 1900-1936. They estimate that 35% of the

mortality reduction over this period was a result of clean water interventions.8

        To analyze whether medical care explains some of the residual mortality, we

augment the analysis of Cutler and Miller to include two measures of medical care supply,

taken from the 1910 Census: the number of physicians and surgeons per 100,000 people

(we condense this to “physicians”); and the number of trained nurses per physician.9 We

adopt these variables as proxy measures of medical care supply over the entire time

period. We consider whether cities with greater medical care supply had larger trend

reductions in mortality over the 1900-1936 time period. The models are of the form:



        8 There is a slight error in Cutler and Miller. They divide the change in mortality due to clean water

measured in log points by the percentage point change in overall mortality. That share is 43%. Using the
change in mortality in log points in the denominator leads to a revised finding that 35% of total mortality can
be explained by clean water technologies.
        9 At the time, a distinction was made between trained nurses, who are the precursors to todays

registered nurses, and untrained nurses, who often functioned as baby nurses or to otherwise aid the infirm.
More developed medical care systems were likely to have more trained nurses.
                                                      20
        ln(mc,t) = β1 Filterc,t + β2 Chlorinec,t + β3 (Filterc,t*Chlorinec,t) +                         (1)

             β4 MDsupplyc * It + β5 Nurse/MDc * It + δc + μt + Σ λk ln(mc,t-k) + εc,t


        In equation (1), c denotes cities and t denotes years. The dependent variable is

the logarithm of city mortality in year t. This measure of mortality is related to whether the

city filters or chlorinates the water as of time t, and the interaction between the two.10 One

would expect the main effects β1 and β2 to be negative (cleaning the water lowers

mortality) and the interaction term β3 to be positive (the marginal contribution of a second

method of water cleaning is smaller than the first). β4 and β5 show the trend in mortality

for cities with more medical care personnel; It is a time trend. Controls include city and

year dummy variables (δc + μt) and five lags of mortality. 11

        Appendix Table A1 shows information about the two measures of medical care

supply for a larger sample of 38 cities. In 1910, the average city had 281 physicians per

100,000 people. The higher end generally consisted of smaller cities: Los Angeles (414)

and Kansas City (410), for example. Cities like Boston (280), Chicago (209), and New

York (185) were average. Smaller numbers of physicians were found in smaller East

Coast areas such as Jersey City (92) and Fall River, MA (109). On average, there were

0.81 trained nurses per physician. Nurse supply was inversely correlated with physician

supply (ρ=-0.40). Los Angeles had many physicians but few trained nurses (0.62                                per


        10  Alsan and Goldin (2018) note that sewer treatment is important as well. However, only two cities
treated their sewage during this time period, so we do not explore this issue with these data.
         11 Cutler and Miller include a few additional variables. First, they include a city-specific time trend.

Since our medical care supply variable is point in time and is interacted with the time trend, we cannot
include a general city-specific time trend. Cutler and Miller also include the logarithm of city population.
We omit this since the data on population were not readily available. Finally, Cutler and Miller include
dummy variables for whether the city started filtering or chlorinating the water within five years as a test of
the timing of the intervention. We omit these terms.

                                                       21
physician). Fall River had more trained nurses per physician than average (0.95 per

physician).


       The first two columns of Table 2 show the relationship between public health

improvements, medical care supply, and overall mortality. The first column mirrors the

specification of Cutler and Miller, with similar results: filtering the water supply reduces

mortality. The effects of water chlorination are negative but not statistically significant,

and the interaction term between filtration and chlorination is positive.

       The second column adds measures of medical care supply interacted with the time

trend. Areas with a larger number of physicians per 100,000 people had a less negative

trend in mortality than areas with fewer physicians. The effect is statistically significant

but small in magnitude. The cross-city standard deviation of physicians per 100,000

people is 76. A one standard deviation increase in physician supply raises overall

mortality by an additional 0.1% each year. The estimate on trained nurses per physician

is also positive and of similar magnitude (0.1% annually), but not statistically significant.


       Including the measures of medical care supply has relatively little impact on the

coefficients on water treatment. The coefficients decline slightly, but generally not by a

large amount. In this sample of 13 large cities, there is little correlation between medical

care supply and the timing of clean water interventions.

       These results may be specific to big cities. To examine whether medical care

supply explains different mortality trends across large metropolitan areas, other urban

areas and rural areas, we turn to Massachusetts data.



                                             22
   2.1.2. Evidence from Massachusetts

       This section relies on extensive data on water and sewer treatment, and medical

care supply for each of the 350 Massachusetts cities and towns. First, we examine

whether areas with more medical care supply set up water and sewer systems before

other areas, and find modest evidence that more physicians lead to more public health

interventions. Second, we examine the relationship between public health measures,

medical care supply and mortality where our analysis does not support a large impact of

medical care supply on mortality in the pre-antibiotic era.

       Alsan and Goldin (2018) gathered data on water and sewer treatment dates for

some cities and towns in Massachusetts: those around the Boston area that joined the

Metropolitan Water District and Metropolitan Sewerage District, which cleaned the

drinking and wastewater respectively for cities around Boston; and a selection of large

cities outside of the Boston area. We extend these data to the entire state.


       To understand our measures, it is helpful to understand the water situation in

Massachusetts. Massachusetts cities and towns receive water through lakes, rivers,

streams, reservoirs, wells, springs, and ponds. For many cities, these sources are

unpolluted – for example, underground reservoirs. Thus, even today, not all cities and

towns treat their water.


       When natural sources become polluted, there are two options. First, reservoirs

can be created to store clean water from rainfall and melting snow. This was the strategy

for many areas, including Boston and Springfield, MA. Such a reservoir was typically

created by a special water system, which had to lay pipes for large-scale water transport.

                                            23
Thus, our first measure of public health intervention is whether the city or town has a

water system. Depending on the purity of the water, there may be a need for filtration,

chlorination, or other methods. Our second measure of public health intervention is

whether the community treats the water in any such way. We do not distinguish among

methods because the need for particular methods varies across areas.


       The data on water treatments and sewage systems are assembled from archival

material and previous literature (see Appendix B). We were able to identify when a water

system starts for 260 cities and towns in Massachusetts (out of 351), and when water

treatment starts for 186 of them. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive

historical database on water systems and water treatment ever assembled across cities

and towns at the state level. Data on sewage systems are more difficult to obtain.

Inventories of sewage include only sparse data on when the systems started. We

therefore form sewage system information only for the largest 25 cities in the state – those

with over 25,000 residents in 1910. Appendix B describes these data in more detail.


       Appendix Table A2 shows the dates on which the 25 largest cities adopted water

and sewer systems, and started treating the water. The first water systems date from the

early 1870s, with systems put in place in Fitchburg (1872), Holyoke and Waltham (1873),

and Fall River and Springfield (1874). At the time, these were bustling industrial cities.

Water treatment occurred later. The first water treatment facility was in 1893. Sewer

systems date from the early 1890s. Boston and surrounding areas had the first sewer

systems.




                                            24
       Information on physician supply comes from an AMA directory of physicians in

Massachusetts in 1906. The numbers are consistent with the Census data on overall

physician supply in Massachusetts in 1900 and 191012, but provide physician distribution

throughout the state. We express physician supply as the number of doctors per 100,000

people. The number of trained nurses was measured in the 1900 census, only available

for towns with over 25,000 people in that year. For other areas, we infer the number of

nurses per physician by spreading the remainder of nurses across areas. We use the

average ratio observed in rural areas for all rural areas, the average ratio observed in

Rhode Island for all cities that, although in Massachusetts, belong to the Providence, RI

metropolitan area, and a similar ratio for Pittsfield (which is right below the 25,000

population threshold) and Gloucester (which is right above the 25,000 population

threshold). Appendix Table A2 also shows the number of physicians per 100,000 and

trained nurses per physician, where we have exact data. The most physicians were in

Boston and Brookline, right outside of Boston. Boston had 2.2 times more physicians per

100,000 residents than the average in the rest of Massachusetts (321 versus 143

physicians per 100,000 residents).

       We start by examining whether areas with more medical care supply set up water

and sewer systems before other areas. Our sample is the 25 big cities noted above. For

these cities, the decision to set up a water supply involved discussion of costs and

benefits. For smaller towns near the large cities, the decision is likely to have been in

concert with the large cities they are near, for example because of regional water systems.


        12 5,372 physicians are listed in the AMA directory in 1906 versus 5,497 in the 1900 census and

6,227 in the 1910 census.
                                                 25
        Figure 12 plots the relationship between the year of public health measures

addressing water and sewage and the number of physicians per 100,000 people in 1906.

Panel (a) considers the formation of a water system as the measure of treatment, panel

(b) considers the year that the water began being treated, and panel (c) shows the

measure of sewage treatment.


        Cities with more physicians had somewhat earlier dates of sewer systems (ρ = -

0.35), significant at the 10% level. Cities with more physicians had somewhat earlier

dates of water treatment (ρ = -0.22) but later dates of forming water systems (ρ = 0.11);

neither statistically significant. There is thus modest evidence that more physicians led

to more public health interventions, but the evidence is not very strong.13

        Indeed, the outliers tell the story as much as the regression. The first water

treatment facility in the country, in Lawrence, Massachusetts, begun in 1893.14

Springfield also had an early water treatment system, filtering the Ludlow River as early

as 1909. In contrast, Boston did not treat its water until 1930.

        The history of these areas suggests some of the driving forces. The State Board

of Public Health in Massachusetts developed an interest in clean water shortly after its

establishment in 1869 and especially after its reconfiguration as an independent

organization in 1886. The Board was led by Henry Walcott, a physician and longtime

public health official. One of the board members was a hydrologist named Hiram Mills,


        13 We also considered multivariate analysis, relating public health measures to physicians per
100,000, the population in 1910 (to reflect the ease of providing public goods) and the death rate in 1880
(as a measure of need). Physicians per 100,000 was not related to public health measures in any of these
specifications. The same is true if we expand the sample for water treatment to all cities and towns that
ultimately set up a water system or treated the water supply.
        14 There were earlier water pumping stations, as in Philadelphia. See Blake (1956).

                                                   26
who earned the sobriquet “Father of American Sanitary Engineering.” An employee of

the Essex Company in Lawrence, his experiments on water purity and filtration were

conducted at the Lawrence Experiment Station. He worked in concert with engineers and

biologists at nearby MIT, including William Sedgwick a physician and biologist who later

became president of the American Public Health Association.


        Being downstream from Lowell, MA, Lawrence had high water pollution and high

mortality. Thus, it followed naturally for Lawrence to be first to filter the water. Springfield

also had relatively unsafe water, as determined by state testing. After consultation with

the State and outside engineers hired by the city, Springfield decided in 1908 to switch

from the Ludlow Reservoir to the Little River watershed as its primary water supply. In

the interim before the switch was ready, the city decided to filter the Ludlow Reservoir. It

kept filtering the water even after the change in source. Public health officials and

engineers thus worked in concert to bring clean water and sanitation to cities in

Massachusetts, not particularly based on the local mix of physicians.


        The remaining columns of Table 2 show the relationship between public health

measures, medical care supply, and mortality. Columns (3) and (4) focus on the 25

largest cities in Massachusetts. Column (3) relates the logarithm of mortality to whether

the city has a water and sewer treatment, and the interaction of those two.15 Cities with

a water and sewer system each have lower mortality. The effect is .07 log points for a

water system and .06 log points for a sewer system. The interaction between water and

sewer systems is positive: the two together have less impact than the two separately.


        15 Alsan and Goldin have annual data, where our data are every five years. In addition, they focus
on infant mortality; our analysis uses all age mortality.
                                                   27
This is different from Alsan and Goldin, who find that water and sewer systems are

complements for infant mortality. The reason for the difference between these results is

not entirely clear.

       The next two columns expand the analysis to all 260 cities and towns which

ultimately established a water system. As these areas have a need for public health

measures, the impact of public health improvements should be most apparent there.

Because we do not have sewer system information for all cities and towns, we focus only

on water systems in our analysis of public health. Establishing a water system lowers

mortality, estimate of 0.03 log points. The coefficients on physician and nurse supply

remain positive. Thus, our analysis of Massachusetts data does not support a large

impact of medical care supply on mortality in the pre-antibiotic era. The next section

examines the impact of medical care on mortality in the era of big medicine.


   2.2.    The era of big medicine: 1935-2016



   2.2.1. Previous evidence and national data

       Medical technology expanded gradually over time. Surgical advances were

ongoing in the 19th century, often developed during war (e.g., safer amputations) and

aided by discoveries such as ether anesthesia in the 1840s. Still, the overall impact of

medical advance on mortality through the 1930s was slight, as discussed above.

       The story shifts around 1935. In the 1930s and 1940s, the major medical advances

were in medications to treat infectious diseases. Sulfa drugs became widely available

starting in 1937, and penicillin was mass produced in the mid-1940s.     Several recent

                                           28
papers have examined the impact of sulfa drugs on mortality (Thomasson and Treber,

2008; Jayachandran et al., 2010). They take advantage that sulfa drugs treat some

infectious diseases (most importantly maternal mortality, pneumonia, and scarlet fever)

but not others (e.g., tuberculosis). Thus, there is a natural control for other economic and

medical factors influencing mortality. They estimate that the advent of sulfa drugs reduced

mortality by 2-3% in total between 1937 and 1945. Overall mortality in this time period

fell by 16%, so sulfa drugs accounted for 10-20% of the overall decline in mortality.


       Such an analysis is not possible for penicillin, since there is no natural control for

deaths from infectious diseases that penicillin does not treat. Some studies clearly show

that penicillin was important in mortality reduction. For example, 50,000 US soldiers died

from respiratory infection in World War I. Only 1,265 did in World War II, despite many

more men in battle (Hager, 2007). On the other hand, a study in Sweden and Finland

found no change in mortality trend after the introduction of penicillin, suggesting that other

trends might explain the reduction in mortality over this time period (Hemminki and

Paakkulainen, 1976) at least up north.


       Figure 13 shows age-adjusted mortality rates for five causes of death from 1900-

2015, adjusted to the 2000 population standard. While mortality from pneumonia and

influenza fell throughout the first half of the 20th century, there is a change in trend in the

late 1930s and 1940s. Figure 14 shows the change in trend in more detail, plotting the

logarithm of influenza and mortality rates over time. Three periods of mortality decline

are apparent. Between 1900 and 1936, mortality fell by 1.5 log points annually.           The




                                              29
decline was 8.3 log points annually from 1935-1950, before returning to a decline of 1.6

log points annually between 1950 and 2015.16

       After 1950, the bulk of the recent decline in mortality was from heart disease, and

to a lesser extent cerebrovascular disease (stroke) and cancer. Between 1900 and the

early 1960s, age-adjusted heart disease deaths doubled. Starting in the early 1960s –

around 1963– mortality began a prolonged decline. Heart disease mortality now is below

any point in the 20th century. Falling mortality from heart disease and stroke mirrors the

rise in medical spending on the aged. Taken together, the two suggest a large role for

medical treatment in improved health. Cutler, Rosen, and Vijan (2006) examined the

sources of improved health between 1960 and 2000. They estimated that about half of

the improvement in survival was a result of medical advance; a bulk of the remainder was

due to lifestyle changes such as the reduction in smoking. Ford et al. (2007) examined

the specific causes of declining heart disease deaths between 1980 and 2000. They

estimated that half of the reduction in heart disease deaths was a result of medical

technologies, and half was due to changes in risk factors independent of treatments.

Cutler (2008) examined the trend in cancer mortality, shown in Figure 13. He estimated

that 35% of the reduction in mortality resulted from improved screening (especially

colonoscopy), 23% from behavioral changes, primarily reduced smoking, and 20% from

improved therapies, principally pharmaceutical.


       Improved health over this time period appears to be a response to the availability

of new treatments as opposed to people being better insured (i.e., to the supply-side, not

the 1940 age standard as well. See also Armstrong et al. (1999).
                                                  30
the demand-side). Finkelstein and McKnight (2008) examined whether the reduction in

mortality starting in the 1960s is attributable to Medicare. They concluded that was not

the case: mortality declined for the near-elderly population that was not eligible for

Medicare in addition to the elderly population that was eligible.


       A more difficult question is whether these supply-side changes were driven by

expansions of insurance coverage, or whether they came from the accumulation of

knowledge. Medicare by itself is clearly not the entire story; the reduction in heart disease

mortality predates Medicare by a few years. Acemoglu et al. (2006) examined whether

pharmaceutical innovation was driven by the increase in the number of elderly with

insurance; they concluded that it was not. That said, expensive technology might not

have been as widely adopted without a strong insurance base to pay for it.


   2.2.2. Evidence from Massachusetts

   .

       Using Massachusetts data, we examine how physician supply during the era of big

medicine differentially affected mortality in specific local areas. Massachusetts has a

Medical Mecca (Boston) and then the rest of the State. To the extent that medical

advances happen first or more extensively in more technologically advanced areas, we

expected to see that in our data. We find that medical care supply has no effect on

mortality in the earlier time period but has a significant impact on mortality in the later time

period.

       Figure 7 shows mortality trends in the post-World War II era in the Boston MSA

and the rest of the state. Mortality began declining in Massachusetts after 1965. This is
                                            31
consistent with the national trend noted above. Through 1990, there was a uniform

decline throughout the state; the change was 23 log points in Boston, 20 log points in

other SMAs, and 22 log points in rural areas. After 1990, mortality declined much more

in Boston than in the rest of the state. Indeed, with the recent upsurge in mortality from

drug overdoses, mortality outside of the Boston SMA was higher in 2015 than in 1990,

while it declined by 18 log points in the Boston SMA.


       The central question we consider is whether this differential decline in mortality in

the Boston SMA is a result of the greater number of physicians in the area. We use the

panel of mortality rates in each area from 1965 through 2015, matched with data from the

1960 Census on the number of physicians in each SMA. The 1960 census provides the

total number of physicians for the State and for all statistical metropolitan areas with more

than 100,000 population. Remaining doctors are spread in proportion of population across

rural areas, and smaller urban areas.


       Following the lines of equation (1), we relate the logarithm of mortality per 100,000

people to the number of physicians per 100,000 in the SMA in 1950 interacted with the

year trend. In addition, we include several other variables designed to capture medical

care supply: the distance to the nearest major city in an SMA interacted with the year

trend, the distance to Boston interacted with the year trend, and a dummy for whether the

area is the major city in an SMA interacted with the year trend. We also include the share

of the population age 65 or older and median family income in the SMA. When we

estimate models for the mortality rate in the entire population, including the elderly




                                             32
population share controls for the share of people at high risk of dying. All regressions

also control for area and year dummy variables.


       Table 3 shows the results of the regression analysis. The first column estimates

models for the logarithm of deaths per 100,000 people over the entire 1965-2015 time

period. The coefficient on the number of physicians per capita is negative and statistically

significant at the 10% level. As explained below, this result is somewhat misleading

because it does not account for age differences across areas, which are correlated with

the death rate.

       Three-quarters of deaths in the US occur among elderly people. Thus, an

informative measure of mortality rather than deaths per capita is deaths per elderly

person. The second column shows the results explaining deaths per person aged 65 and

older. The coefficient on medical care supply falls markedly and is much smaller than its

standard error. Hence there is little evidence that access to medical care plays a role in

mortality over the entire 1965-2015 time period, but it appears to have had an effect during

recent years.


       The third and fourth columns examine the relationship between deaths per elderly

person and physician supply in two subperiods: 1960-1990 and 1990-2015. Medical care

supply has no effect on mortality in 1960-1990 but has a significant effect on mortality in

1990-2015. The coefficient implies that mortality declined by .005 log points every five

years for a 1 standard deviation increase in physician supply (50 physicians per 100,000),

or .025 log points over the entire time period.



                                             33
       The final five columns of Table 3 examine different causes of mortality, looking to

see which ones are most responsive to medical care. The largest effects are for

influenza/pneumonia and cancer. Influenza and pneumonia are amenable to medical

care but have been for some time. It is not clear why they should differ in trends over this

time period between areas with more and fewer physicians, though influenza vaccination

rates for people age 65 and older increased dramatically over the second time period and

there could well be differential trends in vaccination practices. The relative decline in

cancer deaths comes from lung cancer and some other cancers, but not breast cancer.

Additional detail could examine which cancers are affected most by physician supply.


   3. Are additional years of life expectancy coming at increasingly
      higher cost?


       This section analyzes changes in age distribution of spending and considers

whether medical advances are as productive now as in the past.


   3.1.   Changes in age distribution of spending


       Combining three data sources, we observe that the ratio of medical spending for

the elderly to adults grew from 1953 to 1988 and decreased from 1988 to 2012 (Figure

15 and Table 4). After 1990, the rate of spending growth was faster for the young than

the old. The relative increase in medical spending for the elderly through the 1980s is

consistent with the expansion of medical knowledge and technology. The recent reduction

in the relative growth of medical spending for the elderly is not as easily explained as the

increase in relative spending.
                                             34
        There are relatively few data on medical spending for particular population groups.

Most of the spending estimates previously described are from providers: adding together

revenue received by hospitals, physicians, and so forth. These data do not naturally

permit a decomposition into spending by age. Periodically, however, micro surveys allow

researchers to estimate spending by individual and age group.


        Even data on spending from population surveys are complicated by

inconsistencies in measurement, particularly regarding the inclusion of institutional long-

term care and home health. Some surveys treat long-term care as medical care, while

other treat it as housing, and thus outside the medical system. As spending on these

services has grown over time, analytic complications have increased.


        We analyze data on the distribution of medical spending by age from three sources

that use consistent methods to cover extended spans of time. Meara, White and Cutler

(2004) present data on medical spending by age for 1963-2000. Centers for Medicare

and Medicaid Services (CMS) (2017) presents data for 2002-2012. The 1953 estimate

from Cutler and Meara (1998) is based on the National Opinion Research Center (NORC)

survey conducted by Anderson (1956) and therefore differs somewhat from later

estimates but was included so as to provide a better sense of spending patterns for the

decades prior to the development of Medicare and expansion of insurance coverage.17

Note that age-specific spending ignores the roughly 15% of medical spending not directly




        17Other sources for data on spending by age include Cooper, Worthington and McGee (1973),
Fisher (1980), Waldo et. al. (1984, 1989); Keehan et. al. (2004); Hartman et al. (2009); and Lassman et. al.
(2014).
                                                    35
attributable to individual patients, for example research, health insurance administration,

overhead, construction, and public health.


       Figure 15 shows relative medical spending on the elderly population in comparison

to the non-elderly population over time. In 1953, estimates suggest that per capita

spending on the elderly was 70% greater than per capita spending on the non-elderly.

Shortly after health spending as a share of GDP began to accelerate in the late 1950s, a

major reallocation of national expenditures toward the older population began. In 1963,

spending on the elderly was 140% higher than for the non-elderly. This increased to

250% in 1970 and 440% in 1987. As a percentage of GDP, the amount spent for the

elderly tripled over the twenty-year span from 1967 to 1987 (1.5% to 4.6%) while the

amount for the population age 0-64 increased by less than half (from 4.5% to 6.0%). Since

the data are per capita, these relative spending changes were due to technology and

policy, including Medicare and other reimbursement rules, not demography.


       After 1990, the rate of spending growth was faster for the young than the old,

bringing the relative expenditure ratio down to +230% in 2012. In the past decade,

Medicare spending on the elderly has been essentially constant in real terms (Keohane

et al., 2018).


       The relative increase in medical spending for the elderly through the 1980s is

consistent with the expansion of medical knowledge and technology noted above.

Conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer were relatively untreatable prior

to the mid-1950s. Subsequently, developing technologies allowed both conditions to be

treated more effectively. One consequence was higher spending.

                                             36
       To take one example, consider care for people with heart attacks (Cutler, 2003).

In 1950, there was little effective therapy for heart attacks. The standard treatment was

bed rest. Technological advances supported increasingly effective therapies such as

coronary artery bypass grafting (grafting a new blood vessel to bypass the occluded

arteries, developed in the 1950s and 1960s), administration of medications that dissolved

the clot (thrombolytic therapy, adopted widely in the 1980s), control of arrhythmias, and

insertion of balloons and wire mesh tubes to open blocked arteries (stents, developed in

the 1980s and 1990s). These therapies are all effective in reducing mortality after a heart

attack. Mortality in the month after a heart attack has declined by 75% since 1950 (Cutler,

2003). But they are also expensive. Medicare spending is over $10,000 per heart attack,

in many cases much more. Since the incidence of heart attacks rises with age, the

technological revolution in treatment of heart attacks affected spending for the elderly

more than for the non-elderly.

       The recent reduction in the relative growth of medical spending for the elderly is

not as easily explained as the increase in relative spending. There has been continuation

of medical technology development. For example, coronary revascularization procedures

have continued to diffuse, and there have been significant and expensive advances in

treatments for cancer (new chemotherapies) and orthopedic problems (hip and knee

replacements), among other areas. Some of the relative reduction in spending for the

elderly is a product of the diffusion of these technologies into the non-elderly population

as well, e.g., elective hip and knee replacements for people with severe arthritis. But this

is not the entire story. In addition to the reduction in the relative spending of people over


                                             37
age 65, there has been a slowdown in the real growth rate of spending for the elderly.

The explanation for this is unknown.


   3.2.   Changes in returns to spending


   In this section, we examine whether additional years of life expectancy come at

increasingly higher cost. Between 1935 and 1955, spending on medical care relative to

income remained nearly constant despite large increases in life expectancy. Since then,

the cost per year of life has increased in every subsequent decade, although the rate of

increases appears to have flattened out in the last two decades.


      A central question about the era of big medicine is whether the return to medical

care is falling – do additional years of life expectancy come at increasingly higher costs?

We cannot answer this question in detail, but we can provide some evidence, following

the methodology of Cutler, Rosen, and Vijan (2006). Those authors calculated the

incremental cost per year of life for decadal intervals from 1960-2000. They assumed

that medical spending was responsible for half of mortality improvements in all decades.

They matched up the implied changes in medical spending with changes in expected

lifetime medical spending over the same intervals.

      Using similar methods, we calculate the increase in real, per capita medical

spending (in 2016 dollars) in each 10 year period starting in 1935, and divide that by the

increase in life expectancy at birth over the equivalent decade (see Figure 16). This is a

scaled version of a cost per year of life due to medical care and will be directionally

accurate assuming that medical care accounted for the same share of              mortality

                                            38
improvements in each decade. Between 1935 and 1955, very little was spent despite

large increases in life expectancy. The cost per year of life has increased virtually every

decade since then, though it seems to have flattened out in the past two decades.

      The analysis in Figure 16 may understate or overstate the return to medical

spending. Recent increases in spending might have led to quality of life improvements

more than life expectancy gains. Quality of life has improved over time, likely due in some

part to medical advance (Chernew et al., 2017). We are not able to adjust for quality of

life changes in our data. And even if medical care is responsible for the same share of

longevity improvements over time, the most costly interventions might not lead to the

greatest longevity improvements. For example, it might be that medical spending is

increasingly directed towards unproductive end-of-life care, while cheap medications may

be the source of mortality reductions.


      Necessarily, our conclusions about changes in the return to medical care are

speculative. But they suggest some reason for concern about the rise of medical

expenditures in the post-World War II era.


Discussion and conclusion


      Fogel wrote about the theory of “technophysio evolution”. In the United States,

one sees it in action. The U.S. entered the 19th century an agricultural economy

transitioning into industry. By contemporary standards, the U.S. was poor, but by

standards of the day, it was rich. Life expectancy at birth was a robust 44 years, even

without much of a functional medical care system.

                                             39
       The beginnings of industrialization were harmful for health, as in Europe. Crowded

cities, low wages, and poor sanitary practices took their toll. Not until about 1880 did

health recover from the beginnings of the industrial revolution.

        From 1880 on, both life expectancy and medical spending grew, sometimes in

concert but often not. The initial improvements in health owe much to medical science if

not to therapeutics. In particular, public health measures such as handwashing, cleaner

water, and sewers saved millions from diarrhea and infectious diseases. In cross-area

analysis, we find little evidence that formal medicine added to the role of public health.

Physicians were involved in the public health revolution, but so too were engineers and

biologists.


       Medicine came of age in the interwar years. Sulfa drugs and antibiotics were

developed in the 1930s and 1940s, and they prolonged the mortality reduction of earlier

decades. The period from 1935 to 1950 saw the most rapid decline in infant and child

mortality of any time period since 1900. It is unclear how much of this change would have

happened without antibiotics, but blood banking and advances in surgical techniques

were among the host of distinct and incremental improvements that added to life

expectancy while the health share of GDP increased only slightly.


       In the 140 years from 1800 through 1940, medical spending doubled as a share of

the economy, from 2% to 4% of the economy. Expenditures were still only 4.3% of GDP

in 1955. They doubled again in the next 25 years and quadrupled by 2010.




                                            40
       Big medicine brought significant health benefits. Heart disease mortality declined

for the first time since records were kept. Deaths declined everywhere but – at least in

Massachusetts – more so in Boston than elsewhere in the state.

       Nearly a century into the era of Big Medicine, there is a new revolution brewing, or

perhaps three: a genetic revolution showing why common diseases occur and how they

might be treated; an information revolution allowing clinicians to follow patients and their

illnesses and individualize treatments; and a financial revolution in how medical care is

paid for. It remains to be seen how these three revolutions will match Fogel’s

technophysio revolution in scale and scope.

Appendix A : Data on Medical Spending and Employment

      The first data on medical spending are from the early 20th century. Lough (1935)

estimates spending on medical care for selected years from 1909 to 1931. He concludes

that medical spending was about 3-4% of GDP then. The far more comprehensive 28

volume report by the Committee on the Costs of Medical Care (CCMC, 1932) estimates

medical spending of 3.4%-3.8% of GDP from 1925-1930, and speculates that total health

spending accounts for “about 4% of national income” for “any normal year.” That is

consistent with Lough, though the CCMC report shows wide variation across the 10

counties included in their detailed surveys and little recognition of how abnormal the 1929

economy would later seem. The CCMC report served as the framework for subsequent

national health accounting efforts by the Social Security Administration, the Health Care

Financing Administration, and currently the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

(CMS) Office of the Actuary (Fetter 2006, CMS 2016). The annual National Health

Expenditures Account (NHEA) estimates since 1960 are generally accepted as valid.


      We assume the CCMC data for 1925-30 are approximately right for the US as a

whole. We use the Lough data to backcast medical care as a share of GDP to 1900,

using approximate growth rates by decade: 0.8% annually for 1900-1910; 1.5% for 1910-

1920 and 1.8% from 1920-1925.

      As few medical spending data are available prior to 1900, estimates of spending

during the 19th Century must for be extrapolated from census occupational data. The

decennial U.S. census collected occupational data from 1850 to 1990, after which data

are available from the Current Population Survey (CPS). Generally, expenditure and

                                            51
employment data have moved in tandem since 1900 (see Table 1), providing reasonable

grounds for extrapolation of spending shares back to 1850.


          The health share of total employment is about 0.8% for 1850-1880 and rises to

1.2% in 1900. We trend from 1850 to 1900 using these data. Before 1850, no national

data on employment are available. We assume continuation of the very modest

employment trend observed from 1850-1880. While this is a large period of time for such

an assumption, it is roughly consistent with Lindert and Williamson’s (2013) compilation

of occupational data in 11 city directories from 1772 to 1806.

          From 1960 on, our data on employment in the health sector come from the Bureau

of Labor Statistics (BLS).18 We use data from the BLS Handbook (2003) for 1960-1980

and from BLS (2017) from 1990. The latter series slows slightly higher health care

employment than the former: 7.5% in 1990 using the newer series v. 7.1% using the older

series.




          18
               The BLS began collecting data on employment in the health sector in 1958.

Appendix B: Data on Water and Sewage in Massachusetts

        Data on water treatments come from different sources for the Boston Metropolitan

area and the rest of Massachusetts. For the Boston Metropolitan area, the water systems

depend on a metropolitan authority that changed over time: the Metropolitan Sewerage

Commission (1889-1901), the Metropolitan Water Board (1895-1901), the Metropolitan

Water and Sewerage Board (1901-1919), the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC)

(1919-1985) and, from 1985 to present, the Metropolitan Water Resources Authority

(MWRA). Early data (1890-1915) are from Alsan and Goldin (2015), data for the 1920s

and 1930s come from the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC) annual reports, data

from the 1930s to present come from historical data included in the Metropolitan Water

Resources Authority (MWRA) Master Plan (2006).


        Data for the rest of Massachusetts come from censuses of water plants published

in academic journals and by public agencies. Johnson (1917), Gillepsie (1924) and

Streeter (1931) provide surveys of early purification and filtration plants in Massachusetts.

The inventory of water and sewage facilities in the United States19 published in 1945 by

the U.S. Public Health Service provides detailed information by city and town, including

water source types and treatment details. From 1954 to 1968, the U.S. Public Health

Service produces every other year a survey of Municipal Water Facilities for municipalities

of 25,000 population and over. In 1963, a cooperative State Federal report presents an




        19 Inventory of water and sewage facilities in the United States, 1945. A cooperative inventory by
the sanitary engineering divisions of state health departments and the U.S. Public Health Service.
                                                   53
exhaustive inventory of Municipal Water Facilities for all cities and towns (not limited to

larger cities).


       Data on sewage systems come from some of the same sources as well as other

sources. For the Metropolitan district, we use the data from Alsan and Goldin

supplemented with information from MDC and MWRA. For the rest of Massachusetts,

we use the inventory of water and sewage facilities in the United States published by the

U.S. Public Health Service in 1945 as well as data from Municipal Waste Facilities

Inventories published every other year by the Public Health Service from 1957 to 1968.

When no start date for the sewer system is available in any of these directories, we used

web searches to look for the operation date of local waterworks.

Sources: National Health Expenditure: Shares 1960-2016 are from CMS (2018). 1950 is from Reed & Hanft (1966) linked to
the CMS series at 1960 by adjustment x1.02 using relative values. 1940 is a linear extrapolation between 1950 and 1930 is
an estimate based of a variety of sources including CCMC (1932), Seale (1959), and Cooper, Worthington and McGee (1973)
with adjustment for distortion created by sharp recession in 1929 (see Getzen 2018 for details). Hough (1935) is used to
establish growth trends to extrapolate back from 1930 to 1910. Based on Census employment trends Getzen extrapolates
backward using cumulative annual growth rate estimates of 0.8% for 1900-1910, 0.4% for 1880-1900, and 0.2% for 1850-
1880, and extends backward at the same 0.2% rate to 1800 relying on the Lindert city occupational totals as an endpoint.
Real GDP per capita: U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (2017) Current-Dollar and “Real” Gross Domestic Product for 1929-
2016 and online Table Ca11 in Historical Statistics of the United States (Carter et al., 2006) (HSUSm) for 1790-2000 and
inflated to from 1996 dollars to 2009 dollars using BEA deflator. Resident population in millions from HSUSm-Table Ca14
(identical to Aa7). Urbanization: HSUSm-Aa699-715 for 1790-1999 and “percent urban” for 2000 and 2010 at (Census,
2018). Physicians from U.S. Decennial Census occupations 1850-1990 in HSUSM-Ba1218 & Ba1222 for 1970-2000 from
Health, United States, 1993 Tables 108 and 109, and Health, United States, 2015 Table 83. Health Employment: 1990 -
2016 from BLS “Current Employment Statistics Survey” data series CEU6562000101 and for 1960-1990 the comparable SIC
808 “Health” series from BLS Handbook of U.S. Labor Statistics, 2003, Table 2-1 (adjusted x1.07 to link with the current
NAIC series). For earlier years U.S. Decennial Census 1850-1970 in HSUSM-Table Ba1033-1439 (occupations categorized as
“health employment” by author), and for 1970-2000 and Edwards (1943). Health employment estimates in the older BLS
SIC series are somewhat smaller than in the current NAIC series, which began in 1990, and also differ from census
occupational totals 1960-1990. Staff per MD is total health employment (minus physicians) divided by number of
physicians. Note that various vintages or versions the “same” data series often show different values for the same year.
