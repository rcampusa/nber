                 On the Possibility of an Inverse Relationship
                   Between Tax Rates and Government Revenues


                                   ABSTRACT


     When Arthur Laffer or other "supply side advocates" plot total tax revenue

as a function of a particular tax rate, he draws an upward sloping segment called

the normal range, followed by a downward sloping segment called the prohibitive range.

Since a given revenue can be obtained with either of two tax rates, government would

minimize total burden by choosing the lower rate of the normal range. A brief

literature review indicates that tax rates on the prohibitive range in theoretical

and empirical models have been the result of particularly high tax rates, high

elasticity parameters, or both. Looking at labor tax rates and total revenue, for

example, the tax rate which maximizes revenue will depend on the assumed labor

supply elasticity. This paper introduces a new curve which sunimarizes the tax rate

and elasticity combinations that result in maximum revenues, separating the "normal

area" from the "prohibitive area." A general—purpose empirical U.S. general equi-

librium model is used to plot the Laffer curve for several elasticities, and to plot

the newly introduced curve using the labor tax example. Results indicate that the

U.S. could conceivably be operating in the prohibitive area, but that the tax wedge

and/or labor supply elasticity would have to be much higher than most estimates

would suggest.

1. Introduction

    Ever since Arthur B. Laffer first drew his famous curve on a napkin in

a Washington restaurant five years ago, there has been considerable public

debate about the possibility of an inverse relationship between tax rates

and government revenue. Pictured in Figure 1, the curve plots total revenue

against the tax rate and claims to show that there are two rates at which a

given revenue can be collected. The upward sloping portion of the curve is

called the "nol" range and the downward sloping segment is the "prohibi-

tive" range. No rational government would knowingly operate on the latter

range in the long run, but with adjustment lags and a high discount rate such

tax rates might be used in the short run. The prohibitive range is said to

exist because the high tax rates stifle economic activity, force agents to

barter, and encourage leisure pursuits. It is also made plausible by remem-

bering that, excess burden varies with the square of the tax rate)'

      The debate has been conducted mostly in the spheres of pQlitics and

journalism, and it includes a wide variety of unsupported claims and opinions.

These range all the way from the assertion that the prohibitive range does

not exist to the claim that "we are well within this range at present."--'

Simple theoretical models can show that the prohibitive range does indeed

exist, but the U. S. position on the curve Is clearly an empirical matter.

Despite the obvious importance of this issue for fiscal policy, there has been

no serious estimation of the curve using an economic model.-' This paper

attempts to correct this deficiency by using a general equilibrium taxation

model to address two questions. First, what is the position of the U. S.

on the curve today? Second, what is the relationship between the location

of the curve itself and critical parameters like the appropriate factor sup-

ply elasticity?!

      The next section offers a brief review of some salient points from the

debate. A common aspect of previous studies is that a prohibitive range for

some local or non—U. S. economy is always associated with particularly high

tax rates, high factor supply elasticities, or both. The third section sets

out the conditions under which a lower tax rate could result in higher revenues.

These conditions are summarized in a new curve, plotting the appropriate factor

supply elasticity against the tax rate. The fourth section describes the

general equilibrium model used to simulate the effects of various tax rates.

These estimations are performed in section five, and the two curves are plot-

ted for an example with a labor tax and labor supply elasticity. Section six

provides Some evidence on the value of the critical labor supply elasticity,

and the last section concludes that to operate in the prohibitive range, the

tax   wedge must be very high or the factor supply elasticity must be very high,
                                  —3—


or there must be some combination of the two.


2. A Brief Literature Review

    The idea of an inverse relationship between tax rates and revenue is not

entirely new. Adam Smith, in The Wealth of Nations (1776) could hardly be

more explicit:

                   High taxes, sometimes by diminishing the consumption
              of the taxed commodities, and sometimes by encouraging
              smuggling, frequently afford a smaller revenue to govern-
              ment than what might be drawn from more moderate taxes.
              (Book V, Chapter II)

    The trade literature, as exemplified by Caves and Jones (1973), has

always understood the existence of a revenue maximizing tariff. This pre—

Laffer edition contains a hump—shaped tariff revenue curve which looks just

like Figure 1. With respect to internal taxes, Jules Dupuit in 1844 states:

                   By thus gradually Increasing the tax it will reach a
              level at which the yield is at a maximum . . . Beyond,
              the yield of tax diminishes . . . Lastly a tax (which
              is prohibitive) will yield nothing.

    After the introduction of the Laffer curve (or perhaps the reintroduction

of the Smith—Dupuit curve) in 1974, the quality of debate deteriorates sig-

nificantly. Jude Wanniski (1978) chronicles every fiscal catastrophe from the

fall of the Roman Empire to the Great Depression and attributes each of them

to some tax hike occurring within a few years in either direction. At various

points in his analysis Wanniski suggests (a) that the mere existence of a

prohibitive range implies taxes should be reduced, (b) that the peak of the

curve is at a 25 percent tax rate, and (c) that the peak of the curve "is the

point at which the electorate desires to be taxed".-' The welfare maximizing

government would operate somewhere on the normal range with the size of its

budget determined by standard cost—benefit analysis.
                                  —4—


    For the opposition, Kiefer (1978) asserts that there is no tax rate for

the overall economy which can be measured on the horizontal axis, and that

"the Laffer Curve represents a gross simplification of a major portion of

macro—economics into a single curved line." These arguments are not compel-

ling, either, in view of the large number of economic models which oversimplify

in order to comprehend and convey economic phenomena. Kiefer also begrudges

the supply—side concentration, reminding us that income and substitution ef-

fects tend to be offsetting. "By concentrating primarily on incentive and

supply—side effects, the Laffer Curve largely ignores the actual mechanism

by which fiscal policy exerts its biggest and most immediate impact —— demand

side effects." One gets the feeling that these antagonists are talking past

one another, using different models that are not comparable. Take for example

the claim that the existence of a prohibitive range implies a marginal pro-

pensity to consume of greater than one. This Keynesian wisdom considers re-

ductions of noridistorting taxes and ignores the incentive effects central to

the supply—side argument.'

    Canto, Joines, and Laffer (1978) build a simple equilibrium model with

one output, two factors, and a labor/leisure choice on the part of consumers.

Their utility function includes discounted consumption and leisure of each

future period, a formulation which is very similar to the larger empirical

general equilibrium model used later in this paper. Another similarity is

that capital is inelastically supplied in any one period, but can grow over

time. Labor taxes in these models place a wedge between the wage paid by pro-

ducers and net wage received by workers. Each individual reacts to this wedge

with an income effect and a substitution effect. In their model, however,

government revenues are returned through transfers or used to buy goods which

are perfect substitutes for private goods. This modelling cancels out the
                                       —5—

 income effect and leaves the economy with an unambiguously positive substi-

tution effect and upward sloping labor supply. There are three points raised

by this modelling. The first point, recognized by these authors, is that if

transfers are given to individuals other than those who pay taxes, and if in-

dividuals have different preferences, then income effects do not necessarily

cancel. The second point is that if a government does nothing other than

place a distorting wedge into the labor/leisure choice with a lump—sum rebate

of revenues, then welfare should indeed unambiguously decrease. These authors

have not allowed for any positive contribution of a government budget. Their

model does not account for the inherent efficiency gain associated with cor-

recting market failure by providing a public good. Thirdly, they fail to

allow for any complementarity between private and public outputs. Clearly

there are public goods such a police protection and transportation systems which

act to encourage private production, more than offsetting the adverse effects

of the necessary tax wedge. Since the effects of a combined tax wedge and

labor complementing public good may be offsetting, the t1balanced budget"

labor supply curve does not have to be upward sloping as these authors insist.

The aggregate uncompensated labor supply elasticity may be positive or nega-

tive, and econometric estimates of this value will be surveyed in a later

section.21

    In empirical work, Grieson et al (1977) find the possibility of an inverse

relationship between tax rates and revenue for local government in New York.

"The inclusion of state taxes lost when economic activity leaves both the city

and state would . .   . raise   the possibility of a net revenue loss as a result

of an increase in business income taxes." They find that the nonmanufacturing

sector has fewer alternatives to the New York City location and should be taxed

more heavily relative to the manufacturing sector whose response to tax is more

elastic. Grieson (1979) finds the two sectors reversed for Philadelphia, where
                                  —6—


nonmanufacturing is under greater competitive pressure. Still, "Phila-

delphia may have been at or very close to the revenue maximizing point

before the recent income tax increase, which raises the possibility of it

having been in excess of the socially optimal one."

    Finally, Charles Stuart (1979) uses a fairly simple two sector model to

find that the current 80% marginal tax wedge in Sweden exceeds their revenue

maximizing rate by 10%. Sweden's high tax rates encourage barter and non—

market activity, placing the economy on the prohibitive range.


3. Another Simple Curve

    A common feature of arguments from both sides of the debate is anim—

plicit or explicit reference to factor supply elasticities. Offsetting in-

come and substitution effects merely imply that the relevant unèoinpensated

supply elasticity might be low or negative. The emphasis on large incentives

in the supply—side argument implies a large elasticity. The open nature of

a local economy implies mobile factors and a more elastic response to a local

tax. Indeed, the entire debate reduces to the empirical matter of determin-

ing the relevant parameter values. If supply elasticies are high enough, the

economy could be on the prohibitive range.

    The very location of Laffer's curve in the rate—revenue space of Figure 1

depends on the supply elasticity of the factor being taxed.-' If that elas-

ticity were fairly low, the total revenue maximizing point would be at a higher

tax rate for that factor, and conversely. One can imagine a third diin.ension

on that diagram giving different elasticity values. The hill would then be

converted into a ridge, running from a low tax rate and high elasticity com-

bination to a high rate and' low elasticity pair. The crest of that ridge is

plotted in Figure 2. Everything to the southwest of that curve signifies the
                              —7—

"normal area", where raising rates gain revenue, and northeast of the curve

is the "prohibitive area", where no rational government would knowingly

operate. Each point on the curve shows the tax rate which maximizes total

revenue for a given elasticity.-'

      At an infinite supply elasticity, the government cannot acquire additional

revenue by taxing that factor, and the maximum total revenue would be obtained

elsewhere (a zero tax rate for that factor is best). For a large finite

elasticity, the tax rate would have to be very low to remain in the normal

range, reflecting a general result from the optimal tax literature. As

this elasticity decreases, higher tax rates will maximize revenues. Finally,

at a zero (compensated) elasticity, the tax is nondistorting, and the only

bound on revenue is given by total product of the factor.




                                  Figure 2

                                   —8—


    From this description, we can place all the advocates on a cQmpre—

hensible spectrum: those who say we are in the prohibitive area believe

that the relevant elasticity and/or tax rate are higher, those who say we are

in the normal area believe they are lower, and those who deny the existence

of the inverse relationship must believe that the uncompensated supply elas-

ticity is zero or negative.


4. The General Equilibrium Model

    To simulate the effects of different tax rates for a variety of factor

supply elasticities, a previously developed general equilibrium taxation model

is used. This model is still evolving after several years of work, and it

has already been used for other purposes including the evaluation of various

tax reform proposals. However, it was built as a general purpose model, and

its features are surprisingly well suited for this application. No adjust-

ments were required to obtain the following estimates. Since more thorough

descriptions of the model are available elsewhere, I give only an essential
                    10/
outline   of it here.—

    The economy is divided into nineteen profit maximizing producers, f if—

teen consumption commodities, and twelve consumers differentiated by income

class. Each industry has a Cobb—Douglas or Constant Elasticity of Substitu-

tion (CES) production function, where the elasticity of substitution between

capital and labor is chosen as a "best—guess" value from evidence in the

literature. Each output can be used as a intermediate input through a fixed

coefficient input—output matrix. Outputs can be purchased by government, used

for investment, or converted into consumer goods. There is also a simple

foreign trade sector, though this model of the U. S. economy should be con-

sidered closed for these purposes.
                                   —9--


    Each consumer has initial endowments of labor and capital services which

can be sold for use in production. Because of perfect factor mobility and

competition, the net—of—tax return to each factor is equal among industries.

A consumer can also choose to buy some of his own labor endowment for leisure.

The capital stock is fixed in any one period, but the dynamic version of the

model allows the savings response to augment the stock in later periods. De-

mand functions are based on CES utility functions with double nesting. The

choice between present and future consumption is represented by the outside

nest, and the elasticity of substitution between those two groups is based

on an estimate of the uncompensated savings elasticity with respect to the

net—of—tax rate of return. For this value we use 0.4 as found by Boskin

(1978). The breakdown of present consumption into commodities and leisure

is represented by the inside nest, and the elasticity of substitution between

those two groups is based on an estimate of the uncompensated labor supply

elasticity with respect to the net—of—tax wage. For this value we typically

use 0.15, but relationships for different labor elasticity values will be

derived below.

    The various Federal, state, and local taxes are typically modelled as

ad valorem tax rates. on purchases of appropriate products or factors. Corpor-

ate income taxes and property taxes are modelled as different effective rates

of tax on use of capital by industry. Social security, workmen's compensation

and unemployment insurance appear as taxes on use of labor. These rates dif-

fer by industry partly because different proportions of workers hit the social

security maximum, but they average 10% of payments to labor. Personal income

taxes operate as different linear schedules for each consumer group, with

marginal tax rates increasing from an average of 17.   for   the lowest income

group, to an average marginal tax rate of 40% for the highest income group.
                                — 10 —




    The model is parameterized for 1973 using data from the National Income

and Product Accounts, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure

Survey, and the Treasury Department's Merged Tax File. These data are ad-

justed for known inaccuracies of government collection procedures and for

general equilibrium consistency requirements. This "benchmark" data set is

used to solve backwards for relevant preference parameters and tax rates, so

that the model solution can replicate the benchmark equilibrium. The user

can specify different tax rates to recalculate a simulated equilibrium with

different resource allocations for comparison with the benchmark. The model

is solved using a variant of Scarf's algorithm for an equilibrium price vector

where excess demands and profits are zero.V

    The model does not include involuntary unemployment, inflation per Se,

or other aspects of disequilibria. It measures real effects without a money

equation, expressing all prices in relative terms. Voluntary unemployment

is captured through the labor/leisure choice, however, and the interaction of

inflation with effective tax rates is modelled by adjusting those rates appro—

priately)-" The model thus concentrates on microeconomic behavior and can

meet the supply—side advocates on their own ground.

    A potential difference, however, is our modelling of government transfers

as essentially lump—sum payments to consumer groups in proportion to their

observed 1973 receipts from social security, unemployment compensation, food

stamps, and other welfare programs. Supply—side advocates may like to model

these payments as additional work disincentives, increasing the wedge between

labor's marginal product and leisure's implicit price. Though the government

does not intend to subsidize leisure, some programs do have that effect. The

Incentive depends on the program's ability to isolate important characteristics

such as age, disability, and number of dependents which make the recipient un—
                                  — 11 —




able   to work. If successful, the payments will have more income effect and

less substitution effect. To the extent that the reader wishes to use a larger

wedge in the following simulations, a higher tax rate can be used in describ-

ing the current U. S. economy)1'


5. Estimation

    Supply—side advocates refer to several different types of taxes when they

claim an inverse relationship between a particular tax rate and government

revenue. The curve in Figure 2 could be plotted by varying a product tax

rate against the price elasticity of demand for that product, or by plotting

capital tax rates against the elasticity of savings with respect to the net—of—

tax return to capital. The latter example was attempted with the empirical

model, but no prohibitive area was discovered.--' For this reason, the example

used here is the labor tax against the labor supply elasticity.

    In our basic model, the tax on labor used by industry averages 10% of

net payments to factors. The personal income tax takes another 1% to 40% of

marginal labor income, depending on the consumer's marginal tax bracket. The

total wedge thus ranges from 11% to 50% of labor income.' One problem with

interpreting a general formulation like the Laffer curve is that either average

or marginal tax rates might be applicable. The average rates are needed to

dterm1ne total revenues, but marginal rates are more important for incentive

effects. A solution is to vary the industrial labor tax rate of 10% since

this rate is both average and marginal. Variations in this rate alone are re-

ported below, but the reader should remember that the additional wedges created

by the personal income tax and other taxes always remain. The tax wedges re-

ported are thus understatements of the model's true wedge.'

   The consistent 1973 data set, with adjustments described above, also shows a

ticity as long as tax rates are unchanged. Simulations with labor tax rates

other than 10% will have revenues which depend on the elasticity. Additional

revenues are rebated to consumers in lump—sum fashion, in proportion to their

original after—tax income. These rebates are necessary because general equi—

librium conditions require a balanced government budget, and increases in

government purchases would influence the equilibrium solution)'
    The results from over sixty simulations are summarized in Table 1.-u-" The

spect to the net—of—tax wage. The "observed" total revenue of $360 billion

corresponds to the basic tax rate of 10%, and total revenues are positively

related to tax rates up to a tax which is 255% of net labor income, or 71.8%

of gross              Beyond that rate, revenues start to fal1.'

    Any column of data from Table 1 can be used to plot an example of

Figure 1, as done in Figure 3 for the .15 elasticity. In any of these Laffer

curve diagrams, the modelled U. S. economy is represented by .10 on the laborS

tax rate axis. If the various tax rates, transfers, and elasticities are

reasonable as modelled, then the U. S. economy is well down the normal range

of the curve. For those who prefer a high elasticity, Figure 4 plots another

Laffer curve. The 4.0 labor supply elasticity and current tax rates place

the U. S. well onto the prohibitive range.21

   Underlined in each column of Table 1 is the maximum revenue point for

that elasticity. These tax rate and elasticity combinations correspond to

points on a curve like Figure 2. When plotted for this example, the curve is

shown in Figure 5. On this curve, with tax .rates as modelled, the labor sup—
                                   — 17 —




ply   elasticity would have to be at least 2.5 to put us over the peak and onto

the prohibitive range. Alternatively1, if the supply elasticity is at least

1.0 and the tax rate is at least 30% (In addition to the personal rates from

1% to 40%), then again we could be operating irrationally. The continuum of

Figure 5 allows the reader to select a plausible tax rate and elasticity com-

bination to determine whether the U. S. is now in the prohibitive area.


6. What is the Labor Supply Elasticity?

      The empirical model was fairly careful in establishing all of the basic

tax rates, including the .10 labor tax rate, but it is much less explicit

about the aggregate labor supply elasticity. The econometric literature gives

many estimates for population subgroups, since different individuals will

typically have different rates of response to a new net—of—tax wage. Finegan's

(1962) occupational study found managers, craftsmen, and clerical workers

varying from a —.29 to a +.42 labor supply elasticity, while Boskin's (1973)

division by sex, race, and age found estimates from —.07 (for prime—age white

males) to a +1.60 (for elderly black women). Since taxes do not distinguish

among these characteristics, the relevant elasticity parameter is an aggregate

one. Table 2 summarizes a number of econometric studies and is based mostly

on discussion in Killingsworth (1976).

      There is a certain injustice to these authors in reporting their results

in such sunmiary fashion. Each study has its own measure of the wage, its own

data—year or time—period, its own mean values, and its own functional forms.

The studies differ as to how they account for labor participation rates and

as to whether they account for the balanced budget effects of government

spending as discussed above. The numbers in Table 2 are only provided to give

the reader a framework for choosing a plausible aggregate labor supply elas—

 ticity.   Since few aggregate studies are available, male and female estimates

can be roughly combined.

     Elasticity estimates for males are mostly small and negative, ranging from

—.40 to zero. Borjas and Heckman (1978) review the econometrics of these

studies and reduce the bounds to —.19 and —.07. The estimates for females

are more often positive, and can be large in absolute value. Killingsworth

finds that females' elasticity estimates are mostly between .20 and .90 in

cross—section studies. To obtain the model's .15 aggregate labor supply elas-

ticity, perform a rough numerical calculation. The Statistical Abstract shows

that the median money income of male employed civilians has consistently been

twice that of females. It also shows about a 1.7 ratio of males to females

in the labor force, a ratio which is decreasing with t1me In any case, the

ratio of male to female income should be at least 3.0 (though decreasing).

Taking a relatively high male elasticity of —.10 and a relatively high female

elasticity of +.90, the three—to—one weighted average is a .15 aggregate

elasticity.


7. Conclusion

    This paper investigates a number of analytical and empirical arguments

about the relationship between tax rates and government revenues. A general

equilibrium tax model was used to plot this relationship as well as another

relationship between tax rates and factor supply elasticities. This new curve

'shows that the U. S. economy could conceivably be operating in the "prohibi-

tive range" for a national tax on labor income, but that tax rates and/or labor

supply elasticities would have to be very high for that possibility to occur.

Available evidence about the value of the relevant elasticity parameter does

not support the view that our government is currently behaving irrationally
                                 — 20 —



with   respect to that tax.

    The tax rate and elasticity relationship can be applied to other federal,

state, or local taxes to find circumstances where a particularly high tax

rate on real income and/or a high elasticity could place a tax in the prohibi-

tive area. The tax on purely nominal capital gains, for example, or the under

allowance of depreciation can result in high tax rates on real capital income.

These accounting procedures and nominal personal income tax brackets should be

adjusted for inflation by indexing. The "marriage penalty" which places a

secondary worker in the higher marginal tax bracket of his or her spouse may

represent another high rate of tax on an elastically supplied factor. The

"notch" effect of welfare recipients who become ineligible at a given income

level results in implicit marginal tax rates of 100% or higher. Also, the

high elasticity argument is particularly applicable for state and local gov-

ernments since factors are generally more mobile within national boundaries.

McGuire and Rapping (1968, 1970) find labor supply elasticities of 20 to 100

for particular states or industries. This mobility implies that one juris-

diction cannot charge higher tax rates than its neighbors, and it applies in-

creasingly to international factor flows. These latter considerations do not

confirm the existence of a tax on the prohibitive range, but they make one much

more plausible.

    Finally, though the results of this paper tend to reject the notion of

an inverse relationship between major U. S. taxes and government revenues,

they do not necessarily invalidate the claim that these taxes should be lowered.

Even on the normal range, taxes may be higher than desired by voters. Pref-

erences can change over time, fewer public goods may now be demanded, and the

electorate can legitimately request a tax decrease. Though incentive effects
                                 — 21 —



can still be important without perverse revenue effects, the point is that

the "economics of the tax revolt" are less the economics of Incentive ef-

fects and more the economics of public choice.

1. The tax rate of Figure 1 generally refers to any particular tax instru-
    ment, while revenues generally refer to total tax receipts. Thus we
    must account for the effect of one tax on all other tax bases. An
    increase in the payroll tax rate, for example, could affect not only
    its own revenue, but work effort and income tax revenues.

2. Michael Kinsley (1978) correctly claims that there is no logical neces—
    sity for revenues to be zero at 100% tax rates, due to nonmonetary in-
    centives for work effort, but he incorrectly infers that "there's no
    logical reason to assume without proof that the Laffer curve ever reverses
    direction at all." Laffer (1978) points out that there must be some higher
    rate where economic activity goes to zero. "If every time a person goes
    to the office he receives a bill from the government instead of receiving
    a check from his employer, sooner or later even the wealthiest and most
    highly motivated will stop going to the office. There won't be any
    earnings, and total government revenue will equal zero. For the sake of
    argument, imagine the government collects zero revenue at 100 percent
    tax rates." The quote in the text is from           "Statement Prepared
    for the Joint Economic Committee Hearings on the Macroeconomic Impact
    of the Administration's National Energy Plan," May 20, 1977, reprinted
    in Laffer and Seymour (1979).

3. Several papers have described models in which there exists the possibility
    of a prohibitive range. See Canto, Laffer and Odogwu (1977) and Canto,
    Joines and Laffer (1978). Other empirical papers have found examples of
    local governments operating in this range. See Grieson et al (1977) and
    Ronald E. Grieson (1979). Estimates from DRI, Wharton, and Chase Econo-
    metric models are also provided in Kiefer (1978). None of these papers
    plot out the Laffer curve however, or estimate its relationship to various
    elasticity parameters. As shown below, an open economy like a local gov-
    ernment is more likely to be burdened with a ceiling on revenues.

4. In general, the location of the curve depends on consumption parameters,
    production-parameters, and other circumstances in the economy. In war-
    time, for example, individuals might be willing to work harder at higher
    tax rates to generate larger tax revenues. Later sections estImate the
    curve with a model of the 1973 U. S. economy.

5. Other interesting claims of Wanniski include Cd) "if the tax rate is
    zero . . . production is maximized," and (e) "revenues and production are
    maximized at (the peak of the curve)." Walter Heller (1978) has his own
    complaints about Wanniski's evidence: "At a time when only a few mil-
    lion Americans paid income taxes and federal spending was less than 5% of
    GNP (it was 3% in 1929), we are asked to believe that federal income tax
    cuts alone powered the growth of GNP from $70 billion in 1921 to $103
    billion in 1929." Arthur Laffer, on the other hand, calls it "the best
    book on economics ever written."
                                    —2—


 6. Also, supply—side advocates typically assume an equivalence between bond
     and tax financed spending, so that spending itself creates a wedge. De-
     bates over the rationality of consumers and the net wealth of government
     bonds are best conducted elsewhere. For the purposes of this paper, I
     grant this equivalence.

 7. These three shortcomings of the Canto, Joines, and Laffer (1978) theor-
     etical model are not explicitly corrected in the empirical model used
     below, but they are implicitly corrected through the possibility of posi-
     tive or negative labor supply elasticities.

 8. Product taxes are equally relevant. Convert general product taxes to
     equivalent taxes on factors, or consider specific product taxes by plot-
     ting against demand elasticities. Also, either a compensated or uncom—
     pensated elasticity might consistently be used as the relevant parameter.

 9. This analysis over—simplified by using a given elasticity for all tax
     rates to find the revenue maximizing point. As the tax rate varies, so
     would equilibrium prices, incomes, and preference parameters like the
     factor supply elasticity. Also, both curves are intentionally vague
     about the particular tax rate and elasticity involved because they have
     a general significance which requires specific application. Both curves
     will be estimated for a particular factor tax and factor supply elasticity.

10. See Fullerton, Shoven, and Whalley (1978, 1979) and Fullerton, King,
     Shoven and Whalley (l979a, l979b).

11. John Whalley points out that many of these features provide more detail
     than would be necessary to demonstrate the relationships of
                                                                 Figure 1
     and 2. This comment is correct, but it is analogous to saying that a
     fancy electric can—opener is not required to open a can. My analogous
     response is that if the fancy can—opener already exists, then why not
     use it?

12. Effective capital tax rates are calculated by measuring each industry's
     real use of capital with replacement cost depreciation. The modelling of
     capital gains accounts for the largely nominal gains that are subject to
     tax. The combined effect of inflation and nominal income brackets in a
     progressive tax system can be modelled by increasing effective rates.

13. The difference between paying people who don't work, and paying people
     not to work is the difference between a marginal payment with incentive
     effects, and a lump—sum payment. Legally, an employee must be laid off
     to be eligible for unemployment compensation. A worker can ask to be
     laid off, but employers may be reluctant to circumvent the intent of the
     law. These transfers are not automatically and fully available to non—
    workers. Similarly, AFDC payments are designed to select recipients by
    particular characteristics, maximizing the lump—sum effect and minimizing
     disincentive effects. Social security payments are higher for the blind
    or disabled. Finally note that these transfers, to the extent that they are
    disincentives, do not always apply to marginal hours. Most individuals who
                                    —3—


     take an extra hour of leisure do not becQme eligible fo transfers at all.
     Laffer (1978) is correct, hoeve, that "if transfer payments included
     'means', 'needs', or 'income' tests they too should be included."
     Another more thorough study could undertake to measure incentive effects
     of transfers.

14. Over forty simultations were performed in seeking a prohibitive area for
     capital taxes. Using the dynamic version of the model, rates were in-
     creased to 500% of net capital income (83% of gross capital income),
     savings elasticities were increased to 4.0, and equilibria were calculated
     out to fifty years in the future. There was not a single case discovered
     where total revenues were less than the revenues associated with a lower
     tax rate for the same period. Inverse relationships between tax rates
     and revenues may exist for high effective rates of tax on certain types of
     real capital income for certain individuals. No overall inverse relation-
     ship was discovered in this model, however, because the tax distortion
     applies to the savings decision, while savings are only an increment to
     the capital tax base. More than fifty years would be required for the
     tax base reduction to offset a tax rate increase and result in lower
     revenues.

15. The model measures labor income after the industries' factor tax but before
     the individual's personal income tax. Since the factor tax is 10% of labor
     income, and personal tax is another 1% to 40% of marginal labor income,
     the wedge can be expressed as 11.1% to 83.3% of net labor income after all
     taxes, or 10% to 45.5% of labor income gross of all taxes.

16. For those who wante& a higher wedge to account for the disincentive effects
     of welfare programs, the extra wedge of the personal income tax could
     roughly compensate for the ignored wedge of the transfer payments.

17. Our expanded notion of welfare, including leisure valued at the net—of—tax
     wage, is $1,690 billion.

18. A decrease in revenue is corrected by a similar lump—sum charge on con-
     sumers in proportion to their original after—tax income, so that govern-
     ment purchases still remain constant. In this sense, the model is much
     like Laffer's since a change in the tax wedge is accompanied by a positive
     or negative lump—sum redistribution.

19. These simulations are static in the sense that total endowments of labor
     and capital are fixed. Labor can be sold to industry or retained for
     leisure in the simulation, while both factors can be reallocated among
     industries.

20. The tax rate on gross income (t0) is related to the rate on net income
     (tN) by the formula tG = tN/(1 + tN).

21. The computer model provides much other information about the simulated
     equilibrium. With the .15 elasticity and 71.8% tax rate, labor supply falls
     off by almost half. The gross—of—tax wage rises, but the net—of—tax wage
                                    —4—


    falls by 40% in the new equilibrium. 3ecause of the distortion in labor!
    leisure choices, national income falls by more than the increased value
    of leisure for a net loss of $269 billion in real terms.

22. In the 4.0 elasticity case, even the small jump from a 10% to 15% tax rate
     causes a 9% fall in labor supply and a net welfare loss of $26 billion in
     real terms.
