Price Stickiness along the Income Distribution and the Effects of Monetary Policy

JEL No. E31,E52

                                           ABSTRACT

We document that the prices of the goods consumed by high-income households are more sticky
and less volatile than those of the goods consumed by middle-income households. This suggests
that monetary shocks can have distributional consequences by affecting the relative prices of the
goods consumed at different points on the income distribution. We use a Factor-Augmented VAR
(FAVAR) model to show that, following a monetary policy shock, the estimated impulse
responses of high-income households' consumer price indices are 22% lower than those of the
middle-income households. We then evaluate the macroeconomic implications of our empirical
findings in a quantitative New-Keynesian model featuring households that are heterogeneous in
their income and consumption patterns, and sectors that are heterogeneous in their frequency of
price changes. We find that: (i) the distributional consequences of monetary policy shocks are
large and similar to those in the FAVAR model, and (ii) greater income inequality increases the
effectiveness of monetary policy, although this effect is modest for realistic changes in inequality.

1    Introduction
There is growing recognition that monetary policy shocks have distributional consequences.
An active literature argues that monetary policy can have differential effects across vari-
ous types of agents: savers vs. borrowers (Doepke and Schneider, 2006), financially con-
strained vs. unconstrained (Williamson, 2008), or young vs. old (Wong, 2016). In turn,
the heterogeneity in the impact of monetary policy across agents can determine its overall
effectiveness (Auclert, 2017; Beraja et al., 2017; Kaplan et al., 2018). Coibion et al. (2017)
show empirically that monetary contractions increase both income and consumption in-
equality. In all of these contributions, the distributional consequences of monetary policy
arise from its heterogeneous impact on the value of agents’ income or wealth.
    This paper proposes and quantifies a novel mechanism through which monetary pol-
icy shocks have distributional consequences. If the effects of monetary shocks on prices
are heterogeneous across types of goods (Boivin et al., 2009), and consumption baskets
differ across the income distribution (e.g., Almås, 2012), then shocks will differentially af-
fect the prices faced by households of different incomes. We document that the prices of
the goods consumed by high-income households are (i) more sticky and (ii) less volatile
than those of the goods consumed by middle-income households. We then use both a
Factor-Augmented VAR (FAVAR) model and a quantitative New Keynesian DSGE model
to quantify the distributional consequences of monetary policy shocks. Both methodolo-
gies indicate that these consequences are large relative to the aggregate impact of mon-
etary policy on prices: a shock that increases inflation by 1% after a year also generates
a −0.2% difference in the inflation faced by households at the top vs. the middle of the
income distribution.
    Our analysis uses three main sources of data. The first is the US Consumer Expen-
diture Survey (CES), from which we obtain expenditure shares across detailed product
categories for households at different percentiles of the income distribution. The second
is the item-level consumer price data from the BLS, which are the most finely disaggre-
gated consumer prices publicly available for the US. Finally, we employ the measures of
price stickiness constructed by Nakamura and Steinsson (2008), who report the frequency
of price adjustment (i.e. the probability that a price changes in a particular month) for ev-
ery detailed product category in the US CPI.
    We combine these data to compute the average frequencies of price changes for the
baskets of goods purchased by households at each income percentile in the CES. We
find systematic differences in the price-stickiness of the consumption baskets of differ-
ent households. On average, 22% of the goods consumed by households in the middle


                                             1
of the income distribution change prices in a given month. However, the frequency of
price changes is 24% lower for the goods consumed by the richest percentile.1 We also
compute income-specific consumer price indices (CPIs) and show similar differences in
the volatility of prices faced by different households: the standard deviation of the CPI of
the top percentile is 38% lower than that of the CPI of the middle-income households.
     These differences across consumption baskets imply that income-specific CPIs may
respond differentially to monetary policy shocks. In particular, the CPIs of high-income
households should be less responsive to monetary shocks than the CPIs in the middle of
the income distribution. We evaluate this hypothesis both econometrically and quantita-
tively. We first implement a FAVAR model following Bernanke et al. (2005) and Boivin et
al. (2009), that allows us to estimate the impulse responses of a large number of economic
series to monetary policy shocks. Our interest is estimating the impact of monetary policy
shocks on household-specific CPIs. We thus include 100 income-percentile-specific CPIs
in the FAVAR. The estimates indeed show that after 12 months, the CPIs of high-income
households respond about 22% less to the same monetary policy shocks than the CPIs of
the middle-income households. Thus, the consumption basket differences in price stick-
iness and inflation volatility have the expected impact on the differential responses of
households-specific CPIs to monetary policy shocks in the data.
     We then perform a quantitative assessment using a multi-sector, multi-household model
with Calvo-style nominal rigidities. In the model, sectors are heterogeneous with respect
to their price stickiness, and households are heterogeneous with respect to their income
levels and consumption baskets. We calibrate the model to the observed levels of price
stickiness and observed cross-household differences in consumption patterns, and simu-
late the model’s response to a monetary policy shock, paying special attention to how a
monetary shock differentially affects households. As expected, high-income households’
CPIs respond less to a monetary policy shock than middle-income households’ CPIs. The
difference is once again quantitatively large: after 12 months, the CPI of the households
in the top percentile of the income distribution responds by 13% less than that of the
middle-income households. We also show that shifting the distribution of income to-
wards households that consume more sticky goods (i.e. more income inequality) would
increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, although this effect is modest for realistic
changes in inequality.
     Our paper draws on, and contributes to, two literatures. The first is the research
agenda on the distributional aspects of monetary policy reviewed above. The second is
   1 These numbers correspond to frequencies of regular price changes (i.e.   excluding sales). The results are
similar for the frequency of all price changes (including sales).

the literature on the differential responses of prices faced by different consumers follow-
ing macroeconomic shocks. Cravino and Levchenko (2017) document that after a large
devaluation in Mexico, consumption price indices of high-income households increased
by far less than consumption price indices of the poor. Argente and Lee (2015) show that
in the US Great Recession, prices of groceries and general merchandise items consumed
by the poorer households increased by more than those consumed by the richer house-
holds, while Jaravel (2017) shows that over the past 15 years, product variety increased
the most, and inflation was lowest, for the consumption basket of the high-income house-
holds. Kaplan and Schulhofer-Wohl (2017) document substantial cross-sectional disper-
sion in household inflation rates, while Coibion et al. (2015) study the impact of local eco-
nomic conditions on the geographical variation in prices paid by consumers. Ongoing
work by Clayton et al. (2018) focuses differences in price stickiness of goods consumed
by, and produced by, college-educated workers. Our paper documents new facts and
proposes a novel mechanism, that is based on differential price stickiness of consumption
items along the income distribution.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 lays out a simple model that
illustrates the main mechanism at work, and highlights the key objects of interest that
should be the focus of the empirical analysis. Section 3 describes the data and docu-
ments consumption basket differences across households. Section 4 presents the FAVAR
evidence, and Section 5 presents the quantitative model and reports the responses of
household-specific inflation to an aggregate monetary shock. Section 6 concludes.


2     A simple sticky price model
Before presenting our data, we describe a simplified sticky price model to build intuition
on how aggregate shocks can have distributional consequences when nominal rigidities
are heterogeneous across goods and households consume different baskets of goods.


Setup: Consider a two-period economy populated by H types of households indexed
by h, each consuming a different basket of goods. In the first period, the state of the world
is known, and in the second period the economy can experience one of infinitely many
shocks or states, s.2 The (log) price of the consumption basket (i.e. the CPI) consumed by
    2 The
        set of shocks can include monetary shocks, but at this stage we do not need to specify the exact
nature of the shocks.

household h in period t is given by

                                       pth (s) ≡   ∑ ω jh p j,t (s) ,
                                                    j


where ω jh is the share of goods from sector j in household h’s consumption basket. We
define the aggregate price index as pt (s) ≡ ∑h sh pth (s) = ∑ j ω j p j,t (s) , where sh denotes
household h’s share in the aggregate consumption expenditures, and ω j ≡ ∑h sh ω jh is the
economy-wide expenditure share in sector j.
    Sectoral goods are aggregates of a continuum of intermediates that are produced by
monopolistically competitive firms. We introduce price stickiness by assuming that in the
second period, only a fraction θ j of producers in each sector j can observe the realization
of the state before setting their prices. The remaining producers must set prices before
observing the realization of the state. To isolate the role of sectoral differences in price
rigidities, we assume all producers operate the same CRS technology and set constant
markups. In the first period, all the producers know the state and so they set the same
price, which we label p1 . In the second period, all producers that observe the state set the
same price, which we label p̄2 (s). The producers that don’t observe the state set a price
that we label p2e . Note that pe is not a function of the state. Without loss of generality we
assume that the shocks are mean zero, so that p2e = p1 .
    The average price in sector j in the second period is then given by:
                                                               
                               p j,2 (s) = θ j p̄2 (s) + 1 − θ j p1 .                                (1)

Let π h ≡ p2h (s) − p1 define the household-specific inflation rate. The difference in infla-
tion faced by two households, h and h0 , is:
                                                                     h                     i
                                  h0                                                   0
                      π (s) − π (s) = [ p̄2 (s) − p1 ] ∑
                        h
                                                                         ω jh   − ω jh         θj.
                                                                 j


This expression highlights that the difference between two households’ CPIs is driven by
                                                                                               0
the covariance between the differences in their expenditure shares across sectors, ω jh −
ω jh , and the price stickiness of those sectors, θ j . Households that consume less price-sticky
goods will experience larger CPI changes following a shock than households consuming
relatively more price-sticky goods. Dividing by the aggregate inflation π (s) ≡ p2 (s) −
p1 , yields an expression relating the differences in household-specific inflation to objects

                                  π h (s) − π h (s)   θ̄ h − θ̄ h

where θ̄ h ≡ ∑ j ω jh θ j and θ̄ ≡ ∑h sh θ̄ h . Note that this expression is independent of the
realization of the state.


Discussion: Equation (2) shows how aggregate shocks can have distributional conse-
quences when price rigidities are heterogeneous across goods and households consume
different baskets of goods. In this simple model where all firms face the same costs and
markups are constant, the weighted average frequencies of price changes, θ̄ h , are suf-
ficient statistics for all the distributional consequences, irrespective of the nature of the
aggregate shocks. Equation (2) states that, in response to a shock that generates positive
inflation, inflation will be relatively high for households consuming goods with relatively
more flexible prices (i.e. high θ̄ h ).
     To get a sense of the magnitude of these distributional consequences we can do a
back of the envelope calculation using US data (described in detail below). In our data,
θ̄ t ≈ 0.17 for households in the top percentile of the income distribution, θ̄ m ≈ 0.22 for
households at the middle of the income distribution, and θ̄ ≈ 0.21. These numbers result
      t     m
in θ̄ −θ̄ θ̄ ≈ −0.24, which indicates that a shock that increases the aggregate CPI relative
to its unconditional mean by 1% will also generate a −0.24% gap between the price of the
consumption baskets consumed by the top vs. the middle of the income distribution.
     The simple model also illustrates the connection between sectoral price stickiness and
sectoral price volatility. From (1), we can see that sectoral inflation, π j (s) ≡ p j,2 (s) − p1 ,
is less volatile in more sticky-priced sectors:

                                           σπ j = θ j σp̄ ,

where σπ j is the standard deviation of inflation in sector j price, and σp̄ is the uncondi-
tional standard deviation of p̄2 (s). The ratio of standard deviations of sectoral inflation
relative to the standard deviation of aggregate inflation is then given by the ratio of the
sectoral to the aggregate frequency of price changes:

                                            σπ j       θj
                                                   =        ,                                   (3)
                                             σπ        θ̄

Differences in sectoral price volatility translate into differences in household-level CPI


                                                   5
volatility. The standard deviation of household-specific inflation, normalized relative to
the aggregate is:

                                         σπ h  θ̄ h
                                              = .                                          (4)
                                         σπ     θ̄

Households consuming more price-sticky goods experience less volatile price changes.
The following section evaluates the relationships (3) and (4) in the data. Of course, these
relationships may not hold if the standard deviation of the desired price change σp̄ is
sector-specific (as would be the case for example if there are sector-specific shocks).
    To summarize, our illustrative model establishes that in order to understand how the
CPIs of different households react to monetary or other shocks, we must examine the
differences in price stickiness of consumption baskets across households. In addition,
it suggests a one-to-one relationship between sectoral price stickiness and sectoral price
volatility. Thus, a closely related object to be examined in the data is differences in infla-
tion volatility across households.


3     Empirical findings
This section describes our data sources and documents our two empirical findings on
how consumption baskets differ across the income distribution. It then evaluates the
relationship between frequencies of price changes and inflation volatility suggested by
equations (3) and (4). Appendix A describes in detail the construction of expenditure
shares from the CES and of the income-specific CPIs.


3.1   Data
We combine data on expenditure shares from the CES with the item-level consumer prices
from the BLS and with the frequency of price adjustment data from Nakamura and Steins-
son (2008). The CES contains two main modules, the Interview and the Diary. The Inter-
view module collects responses from about 30,000 households annually, and asks house-
holds about the purchases they make in all categories, as well as other demographic infor-
mation. Each household is interviewed for up to 4 consecutive quarters in the Interview
module. The Diary module surveys about 10,000 households per year, at weekly fre-
quency. The Diary questionnaire contains detailed questions about daily purchases, such
as groceries. All in all, there are questions on 350 distinct expenditure categories in the
Interview module, and on 250 distinct grocery and related categories in the Diary module.


                                              6
    The large majority of households do not report expenditures in all possible categories
in a given year. In addition, a different set of households is surveyed in the Interview
and in the Diary files, so the full consumption profile (both Diary and Interview module
expenditures together) of any particular household is never observed. This means that
we cannot compute expenditure shares for each household. Rather, we aggregate house-
holds into percentiles and work with percentile-level expenditure shares. Each percentile
contains about 300 households responding to the Interview questions, and 100 house-
holds responding to Diary questions. Appendix Table A1 reports the income cutoffs and
average incomes in the selected quantiles of the income distribution. It is important to
note that income categories in the CES (such as wage income) are subject to top-coding.
Nonetheless, there is a great deal of variation in incomes of households present in the
CES, with incomes of the top 5% of households an order of magnitude higher than those
at the median. Throughout the paper, the percentiles of the income distribution are de-
fined based on income information in the CES rather than any external data source.
    We use these data to compute the measures of income-specific frequencies of price
changes, price indices, and price volatility defined in Section 2. The average frequencies
of price changes, θ̄ h = ∑ j ω jh θ j , combine the income-specific expenditure weights ω jh from
the CES with the product-specific frequencies of price changes θ j from Nakamura and
Steinsson (2008).3 To compute them, we match CES expenditure categories to the Entry
Level Items (ELIs), a basic category in the CPI for which Nakamura and Steinsson (2008)
report frequencies. There are a total of 265 ELI categories. In this exercise, we use the
expenditure shares from the year 2015, but the results are quite similar for expenditure
shares in other years.
    We calculate household-specific inflation as πth ≡ pth − pth−1 , where the household-
specific price indices are given by pth ≡ ∑ j ω jh p j,t . Again, we take the income-specific
expenditure weights ω jh from the CES, and use item-level price indices p j,t obtained from
the BLS. The item level is the finest publicly available level of disaggregation in the US
CPI data (the BLS does not report inflation numbers at the ELI level), and is slightly
more coarse than ELI, containing 178 distinct expenditure categories. The price data are
monthly, for the period 1978-2008.4 We take 12-month log-differences to obtain annual
growth rates. We then compute the standard deviations of those annual growth rates for
   3 Nakamura   and Steinsson (2008) calculate these frequencies as the fraction of prices that change in a
given a month, both for all prices, and for regular prices (excluding sales).
   4 When building aggregate consumer price indices, the BLS periodically changes the base year for ex-

penditure weights. In computing income-specific CPIs, we follow the BLS procedure for switching base
years after 2004. The information on income is less reliable in the CES prior to 2004, and thus we use 2004
household-specific expenditure weights for CPIs prior to 2004. Using official BLS weights or 2004 aggregate
weights produces nearly identical pre-2004 aggregate CPI. See Appendix A.2 for more detail.

3.2                                   Two facts about consumption basket differences across households
Fact 1: Prices of goods consumed by middle-income households are relatively flexible.
Figure 1 presents the scatterplot of the weighted mean frequency of price adjustment, θ̄ h ,
for households at each of the 20 quantiles of the income distribution in the CES. Thus,
each dot corresponds to 5% of households. The solid line through the data is the local
polynomial fit, and the shaded area is the 95% confidence interval. The left panel de-
picts θ̄ h when θ j is measured as the frequency of regular (non-sale) price changes, while
the right panel measures θ j as the frequency of all price changes, including sales. Mean
frequencies of price changes are hump-shaped along the income distribution: middle-
income households consume goods with more frequent price changes, while high- and
low-income households consume goods with less frequent price changes.

Notes: This figure plots the weighted mean frequency of price changes for households in 20 quantiles of
the income distribution. Each dot represents 5% of the income distribution.

   Table 1 summarizes the underlying magnitudes. It reports, for different slices of the
income distribution, the weighted mean frequency of price adjustment. For the house-
holds around the median – the 40-60 income percentiles – the frequency of regular price
adjustment is 22.16 percent per month. For all the households from the 1st to the 95th
percentile, that frequency is 21.17 percent per month. By contrast, the frequency falls to
19.27 for the households in the 96th to 99th percentile, and further to 16.82 for the top
percentile in the distribution. Thus, the weighted mean frequency of price adjustment is
some 25% lower for the households in the top 1% of income compared to the households

                                                                                           8
around the median income. Including sales, the results are quite similar. In particular, the
top 1% of the income distribution has an 18% lower weighted mean frequency of price
adjustment than the middle of the income distribution.

Note: This table reports the weighted mean frequency of price changes, and the standard deviation of the
12-month log change in CPI for consumers of different incomes.



Fact 2: Prices of goods consumed by middle-income households are relatively volatile.
Figure 2 reports the standard deviation of πth , the income-specific inflation. Inflation
volatility is also hump-shaped along the income distribution. The households with mid-
dle incomes experience the highest inflation volatility, whereas the lowest volatility is
found at the top of the income distribution. The bottom of Table 1 reports the values of
the standard deviation of inflation faced by consumers of different incomes. The annual
inflation rate has a standard deviation of 0.020 for consumers in the bottom 95% of the
income distribution, and 0.021 for consumers in the middle (40-60th percentiles). By con-
trast, the standard deviation of annual inflation is 0.015 for households in the 96th to 99th
percentile of the income distribution, and 0.013 for those in the top 1%.


Discussion: What consumption patterns are responsible for these differences in price
stickiness and volatility across baskets? Table 2 reports the 10 consumption items with
the largest differences in the expenditure shares between the middle 20% of the income
distribution and the top 1% of the income distribution. The 10 items in the top panel
are those for which the middle 20% of the income distribution consume the most rela-
tive to the top 1%, and the 10 items in the bottom panel report the opposite categories.

The top categories in which the middle-income consumers exhibit highest expenditure
shares relative to the top 1% are mainly goods such as Gasoline, Electricity, Motor Vehicle
Insurance, and Used Cars. The items with the largest expenditure shares of the top 1%
relative to the middle income consumers are mostly services, such as Elementary School
and College Tuition, Child Care, Airfare, Domestic Services, and Club Membership Fees.

     Note: This table reports the product categories with the largest differences in expenditure shares between the middle (40th-60th percentiles) and the
     top 1% of the income distribution, the frequency of price changes, and the standard deviation of 12-month log price changes for those products.
    The last three columns report the frequency of the regular price adjustment, the over-
all price adjustment, and the standard deviation of price changes in these 20 categories.
Among the 10 categories consumed more intensively at the middle of the income distri-
bution, the frequency of monthly price adjustment is in excess of 30%. Among the 10
items most disproportionately consumed by the top 1%, the frequency of regular price
adjustment is 16%, and total price adjustment 18%. In either case, the difference in aver-
age price adjustment frequency between these two sets of items is pronounced. Note that
the pattern of price stickiness is not universal. Among the top 1%’s (relative) top 10 items
is Airfare, with price adjustment frequency of almost 60% per month. On the flip side,
General Medical Practice and Limited Service Meals are in the middle 20%’s top 10, and
among the price-stickiest categories.
    The left panel of Figure 3 plots the frequency of the regular price adjustment on the
y-axis against the difference in the expenditure shares between the top 1% and the middle
20%, with positive values meaning that the top 1% has higher expenditure shares in that
category. The majority of categories are concentrated on 0, implying that the high- and
the middle-income categories have similar expenditure shares. There is a large range,
however, and all in all the relationship between these relative shares and the frequency
of price adjustment is negative. The correlation between the x-axis and y-axis variables is
−0.251.

Notes: The left panel plots the frequency of price changes against the difference in sectoral expenditure
shares between households in the top 1% and the middle 20% of the income distribution. The right panel
plots the standard deviation of 12-month log price change against the difference in sectoral expenditure
shares between households in the top 1% and the middle 20% of the income distribution. Both panels
include the OLS fit through the data.



                                                                                                                                 12
    The categories with the largest expenditure share differences also differ substantially
in the standard deviation of item-level price changes. The mean standard deviation of
12-month log price changes in the set of goods consumed most disproportionately by the
middle-income households is 0.049, more than double the 0.023 mean in the set of goods
consumed by high-income households. The outlier sector here is Gasoline, whose stan-
dard deviation is 0.208, and which is also the sector with the single largest expenditure
share discrepancy – in either direction – between the middle- and high-income house-
holds. But the differences persist even if we focus on the median standard deviation,
or drop Gasoline when computing the mean. The right panel of Figure 3 displays the
scatterplot of the standard deviation of log price change at the item level against the ex-
penditure share difference between the high- and middle-income consumers. Once again,
most expenditure share differences are close to zero. Nonetheless, the correlation between
the expenditure share differences and standard deviation of price changes is negative at
−0.255.


3.3   Frequency of price changes and inflation volatility
This section evaluates the relationship between frequency of price changes and inflation
volatility suggested by equations (3) and (4) of Section 2, by providing the data coun-
terparts of those postulated relationships. The left panel of Figure 4 plots the empirical
counterpart of (3), along with a 45-degree line. As (3) expresses both the right- and left-
hand side variables relative to the average, we rescale both the product-level standard
deviation and the frequency of price adjustment by their means across items. Each dot
represents one of the 178 disaggregated CPI items. A positive relationship with a slope
close to unity is evident in this plot; the correlation coefficient between these two variables
is 0.715.
     The right panel plots the empirical counterpart of (4), once again with both y- and
x-axis variables rescaled by their respective means and adding a 45-degree line. Each
dot represents 5% of the income distribution, as in Figures 1-2. There is an evident pos-
itive relationship between these two variables, with the correlation coefficient of 0.643.
Households consuming more flexible-priced goods tend to experience higher CPI volatil-
ity. This is not surprising, as we are in effect plotting the y-axes of Figures 1 and 2 against
each other, and both follow a similar inverse U-shape with respect to income quantile.

frequency of price adjustment for that item. The right panel plots the standard deviation in the 12-month
log change in overall household CPI against the weighed mean frequency of price adjustment for that
household type; each dot represents 5% of the income distribution. Both plots include the 45-degree line.


4         FAVAR Evidence
The previous section shows that prices of goods consumed by high-income households
are more sticky and less volatile than those of the goods consumed by middle-income
households. This suggests that monetary shocks can have distributional consequences by
affecting the relative prices of consumption baskets of households at different points on
the income distribution. We now present evidence that monetary policy shocks indeed
lead to smaller CPI changes for households at the top of the income distribution relative
to the middle.
    To do so, we adapt the Factor-Augmented Vector Autoregression (FAVAR) approach
of Bernanke et al. (2005) and Boivin et al. (2009). Let there be a large number of eco-
nomic series, whose behavior is driven by a vector of common components. This vector
includes monetary policy in the form of the Federal Funds rate it , and a small number
of unobserved common factors Ft . The joint evolution of the Federal Funds rate and the
vector of factors, Ct , is characterized by a VAR:




                                                    14

                                        Ct ≡                 ,
                                                    it
                                   C t = Φ ( L ) C t −1 + v t ,                         (5)

where Φ( L) is a lag polynomial, and vt is an i.i.d. error term.
    The vector Ft is unobservable. What is observed is a large number of economic series
Xt . The FAVAR approach assumes that this set of economic series is characterized by a
factor model:
                                     Xt = ΛCt + et ,                                 (6)

where Λ is the matrix of factor loadings. This representation provides a great deal of par-
simony because in practice Xt includes hundreds of series, whereas the dimensionality of
the vector of common factors Ft is typically small: in the Boivin et al. (2009) implementa-
tion there are 5 common unobserved factors. The significant benefit of estimating model
(5)-(6) is that it yields impulse responses of each of the hundreds of series contained in Xt
to shocks to the elements of Ct , including monetary policy.
    In our application of this approach, the vector Xt includes the 100 income-percentile-
specific consumption price indices, as well as the additional variables included by Bernanke
et al. (2005) and Boivin et al. (2009), such as sector-level industrial production, employ-
ment and earnings, and industry-product-level PPI series. The time frequency is monthly,
and the time period is 1978m1-2008m12. Boivin et al. (2009) present a detailed evaluation
of the performance of the FAVAR model. Here, we focus on the element new in our paper,
namely the impulse responses of income-specific CPIs to monetary policy shocks.
    The FAVAR produces 100 of those impulse responses, one for each income percentile.
Figure 5 plots those impulse responses for selected percentiles. The monetary policy
shock is a 25-basis-point increase in the Federal Funds rate on impact, thus a contrac-
tion. The consumption price indices of the high-income households react substantially
less to monetary policy shocks than those for the middle of the income distribution. The
difference is economically meaningful. After 12 months, the top-1% households’ CPI re-
sponds by 34% less, and the 96-99th percentile households by 22% less, than the CPI of
the households in the middle of the income distribution (40-60th percentiles). After 24
months, the differences are still 12% and 6%, respectively.
    A well-known feature of the VAR impulse responses of prices to monetary shocks is
that the confidence intervals are wide, and it is often not possible to reject a zero impact
of a monetary shock on aggregate CPI. This is the case in the Boivin et al. (2009) FAVAR
model that forms our baseline analysis. However, our main object of interest is not the

overall response of prices to a monetary shock, but rather the differential response of the
CPIs of different households. Figure 6 plots the difference in the impulse responses be-
tween the CPI of the top 1% and the CPI of the middle 20% of the income distribution (left
panel), and the difference between the top 1% and aggregate CPI (right panel). Both pan-
els include the 90% boostrapped confidence intervals. The difference between impulse
responses is significant at the 10% level for most of the lags between 8 and 21 months.5


5     Quantitative framework
This section sets up a sticky price model with multiple households and sectors to evaluate
how monetary shocks affect consumption price indices for households at different points
of the income distribution.
    5 Note that the impulse is a monetary contractions, and thus the changes in the CPIs are negative after
an initial few months. Since the top-income CPIs respond by less in absolute terms, the difference between
the top- and middle-income CPIs is positive.

5.1            Setup
Preliminaries: We consider an economy populated by H types of households indexed
by h. Households get utility from consuming a bundle of goods produced by J different
sectors of the economy indexed by j. Sectoral goods are produced by aggregating the out-
put of a continuum of monopolistic intermediate producers indexed by i. The monetary
authority sets the nominal interest rate following a Taylor rule.


Households:                  Each type of household h has preferences given by:

                                                          ∞        h           i
                                               U h = E0   ∑      βt lnCth − Nth ,                                      (7)
                                                          t =0

and faces the budget constraint:

                                       Pth Cth + Θt,t+1 Bth+1 = Wt Ah Nth + Tth + Bth .                                (8)

Here, Cth is the bundle of goods consumed by households of type h, and Pth is the price of
this bundle. Nth and Ah respectively denote labor supply and the efficiency of household
h, and Wt is the nominal wage per efficiency unit. Bth+1 is a bond that pays one dollar in
t + 1, and Θt,t+1 is the date t price of that bond. Finally, Tth are transfers to the households
from the government and from firms’ profits.



                                                                 17
      The bundle of goods consumed by each type of household is:

where Pj,t is the price of the sector j aggregate. Note that both Cth and Pth are indexed by
h, as the bundle (9) differs across households. Monetary shocks can differentially affect
households if households put different weights across sectors and shocks have heteroge-
neous effects across sectoral prices Pj,t .

Intermediate good producers: Intermediate producers behave as monopolistic com-
petitors and set prices as in Calvo (1983). The probability that a producer can change
its price in any period depends on the sector in which it operates, and is given by θ j . The
producers operate a linear technology

                                                   Yj,t (i ) = N̄j,t (i ) ,                                       (12)

where N̄j,t (i ) denotes the efficiency units of labor used by producer i. The profit-maximizing
price for an intermediate producer that gets to adjust prices satisfies:

where it ≡ −logQt,t+1 is the nominal interest rate, Πt ≡ Pt /Pt−1 is aggregate inflation,
and Ȳ is the efficient level of output. Finally, νt is a monetary shock that satisfies

    We now characterize the equilibrium of a log-linearized version of this economy. In
what follows, we use lower-case letters to denote the log-deviations of a variable from
its non-stochastic steady state. The optimality conditions associated with the household
problem are the labor-leisure condition:

                                         Pth Cth = Ah Wt ,

and the Euler equation:
                                                   (                 )
                                                          Pth Cth
                                 Θt,t+1 = βEt                            .
                                                       Pth+1 Cth+1

Adding the labor-leisure condition across households we obtain that each type of house-
                                                                                Ph C h   h
hold gets a constant share of nominal consumption expenditures, sh ≡ Ptt Ctt = AA , where
A ≡ ∑h Ah . Substituting into the optimality conditions and log-linearizing we obtain:

                                          wt − pt = ct ,                                     (15)

and

                          c t = Et { c t +1 } − [ i t − Et { π t +1 } − ρ ] ,                (16)

with ρ ≡ −logβ. Goods market clearing implies yt = ct. Substituting into equation (16)
we obtain:

                          y t = Et { y t +1 } − [ i t − Et { π t +1 } − ρ ] .                (17)

   The optimal log-price that solves (13) can be written recursively as:

                     p̄ j,t = 1 − β 1 − θ j wt + β 1 − θ j Et p̄ j,t+1 ,
                                                               


and the law of motion for the sectoral price indices is
                                                           
                                p j,t = θ j p̄ j,t + 1 − θ j p j,t−1 .

Combining we these two equations we obtain a sectoral Phillips curve,
                                                     
                           π j,t = λ j wt − p j,t + βEt π j,t+1 ,                            (18)



                                                 20
             θ j [1− β(1−θ j )]
with λ j ≡                        . Finally, the Taylor rule is:
                  [1− θ j ]
                                                                            
                                  it = ρi it−1 + [1 − ρi ] ρ + φπ πt + φy ỹt + νt .           (19)

    Equations (15)-(19) can be used to solve for all sectoral inflation rates, along with the
output gap, real marginal costs, real wages, the nominal interest rate, and the aggregate
inflation rate. Sectoral inflation rates can then be used to compute household-specific
inflation according to:

                                                  πth =   ∑ ω jh π j,t .
                                                           j


In what follows, we will use the model to ask two questions: (i) what is the effect of a
monetary policy shock ε ν,t on household-specific inflation?, and (ii) how do changes in
the distribution of income sh affect the response of inflation πt and the output yt to a
monetary shock?


5.2     Results
5.2.1   Calibration

To evaluate the impact of monetary shocks, we need to assign values for the discount fac-
tor β, the coefficients in the Taylor rule, ρi , φπ and φy , the process for the shocks, ρν and
σε ν , the sectoral frequencies of price changes, θ j , ∀ j , the sectoral household-specific expen-
diture shares, ω jh , and the household consumption shares, sh . We calibrate the model to
monthly data and use values for most of these parameters that are standard in the litera-
ture. In particular, we set β = 0.961/12 , which corresponds to an annualized real interest
rate of 4 percent, and take the Taylor rule parameters ρi = 0.95, φπ = 1.5 and φy = 0.5/12
and set the persistence of the shocks to ρν = 0, as in Christiano et al. (2010). Finally, we
calibrate the model to 265 sectors and 20 household types, and calibrate the frequencies
of price changes θ j and the expenditure shares ω jh and sh using the data from Nakamura
and Steinsson (2008) and the CES data presented in Section 3. The parameter values are
summarized in Table 3.

deviation shock to ε ν.t . The figure shows that the shock has distributional effects: prices
of the middle-income households are the most sensitive to the shock, and prices are the
least sensitive for the top-income households. This is not surprising, since in our model,
as in the data, households at the top of the income distribution consume the goods that
are the most sticky and thus respond more sluggishly to shocks.
    Table 4 reports the price indices faced by households at different points of the income
distribution following the monetary shock, expressed relative to the aggregate price in-
dex. The table shows that the cumulative response after 6 months of the prices faced by
the top 1 percent is about 13% smaller than that of the aggregate price index, and almost
20% smaller than the response of the prices faced by the households at the middle 5 per-
cent of the income distribution. These differences are quite persistent, the cumulative
change in prices faced by the richest 1% is still 10% smaller than that faced by the middle
income households 18 months after the shock.


5.2.3   Changes in the income distribution and the effectiveness of monetary policy

This section investigates how changes in the income distribution affect the effectiveness
of monetary policy. With this in mind, we evaluate the response of aggregate prices to a
monetary shock in a counterfactual calibration of the model with more income inequality.
In this counterfactual, we set the shares sh so that the richest 1% of households has 50%
of the income of the economy, and rescale the remaining shares appropriately. That is, we
set                                

The figure shows that prices are more responsive to monetary shocks in the baseline than
in the counterfactual calibration with more income inequality. This is expected, given
that households at the top of the income distribution spend more of their income in sec-
tors with more sticky prices. The magnitude of the difference between the two impulse
responses is small but non-negligible. Prices decline by about 10% less in the counterfac-
tual model with high income inequality for every horizon up to 24 months.


6    Conclusion
It has been known since at least Engel (1857, 1895) that households with different incomes
consume different goods. This paper documents two novel patterns in how consumption
baskets differ: in the United States, households at the top of the income distribution con-
sume more sticky-priced goods and face substantially lower overall inflation volatility
than households in the middle of the income distribution. Since the price stickiness, the

volatility condition and the response of prices to monetary policy differs across goods
categories, these patterns suggest distributional consequences of monetary policy shocks.
Because the prices of goods consumed by the high-income households are less responsive
to monetary shocks, the overall CPIs of those households will react less to those shocks.
We document both empirically and quantitatively that this is indeed the case. In a FAVAR
model, CPIs of the high-income households react 22-34% less to a given monetary policy
shock than CPIs of middle-income households 12 months after the shock. We then set
up a multi-sector, heterogeneous-household model with sticky prices, parameterizing it
to the observed sectoral heterogeneity in price stickiness and household heterogeneity in
consumption baskets. In the model, the CPIs of high-income households respond 13%
less to a monetary shock than the CPIs of middle-income households after 12 months.

Appendix A            Data Appendix
A.1     Constructing percentile-level expenditure weights
A.1.1   Consumer Expenditure Survey
We use data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) to obtain the expenditure
weights of consumers. The CES data are collected by the Census Bureau, and cover ex-
penditures, income, and demographic characteristics of households in the United States.
The CES is the primary source of data for constructing the weights for the US Consumer
Price Index.
    The CES contains two modules, the Diary and the Interview. The Diary is designed to
measure expenditures on daily items, such as groceries, personal products, and other fre-
quent purchases. The Interview is designed to measure large or durable expenditures,
such as major appliances, vehicles, and other large infrequent purchases. The Diary
records household spending for two consecutive survey reference weeks, while the In-
terview records purchases over the previous three months.
    For each survey, we make use of expenditure, income, and characteristics files in com-
puting expenditure weights. In the expenditure files, the CES collects household expen-
ditures on about 600 Universal Classification Code (UCC) categories. Questions such as
“How much did you spend on babysitting in the last quarter” are asked in the survey
and the corresponding responses are saved in UCC 340210 babysitting and child care. Over-
all, there are questions on about 350 UCC categories in the Interview module, and on
250 UCCs in the Diary module. Income files record detailed information on household
monthly income from different sources, such as wages and salaries, or interest and div-
idends. Characteristics files record demographic characteristics data for each member
of the household, such as education, gender, race, etc. Income variables, which contain
annual values for the 12 months prior to the interview month, are also included in the
characteristics files.
    Diary and Interview modules survey different households each year, so a household
in the Diary will not appear in the Interview and vice versa. Thus we could never observe
the full consumption profiles of an actual household and we could not compute expen-
diture shares for an actual household. Rather, we aggregate households into percentiles
and work with the percentile-level household expenditure shares.

A.1.2   Constructing the concordance
The in-scope expenditures for CPI could be divided into 8 major groups, 70 expenditure
classes, 211 item strata (item level) and 303 entry level items (ELI). CPI uses the item
strata -- e.g. SEFT04 Spices, seasonings, condiments, sauces -- as the elementary level of
its expenditure weights and price index calculation. Within each item stratum, one or
more substrata are defined as ELIs, which are the ultimate sample units for products. For
example, there are four ELIs under item SEFT04: FT041 Salt and other seasonings and spices,
FT042 Olives, pickles and relishes, FT043 Sauces and gravies and FT044 Other condiments.
    Using CES data to compute the item-level and ELI-level expenditure weights from


                                            29
CES, we need a concordance between the UCC categories, item strata codes and the ELIs.
The concordance is constructed by following the BLS document “CPI requirements for CE”
Appendix B. The CES collects household expenditures on about 600 Universal Classifi-
cation Code (UCC) categories, which could be concorded to 303 ELIs. To combine the
expenditure weights with the frequency of price adjustment data from Nakamura and
Steinsson (2008), we look at a subsample of 265 ELIs. And we could further aggregate the
265 ELIs to 178 item strata.

A.1.3   Compiling the expenditure, income, and characteristics files
To obtain the expenditure shares at the detailed product category level for households at
different percentiles of the income distribution, we take the following steps.
    In the first step, we put together the quarterly expenditure, income, and characteris-
tics files from the Interview survey. With the compiled interview data, for each house-
hold, we could observe its interviewed month and year, monthly expenditures on the
UCC categories in the previous three months as well as annual income for the 12 months
prior to the interview. One thing to note is that respondents are asked to report expendi-
tures made since the first of the three months prior to the interview month. For example,
if a household is interviewed in February of 2015, they are reporting expenditures for
November and December of 2014, and January of 2015. Thus, to produce a 2014 annual
estimate based on expenditures made in 2014 (calendar period), one needs to access five
collection-quarter files, the first quarter of 2014 through the first quarter of 2015.
    By the same token, we put together the expenditure, income, and characteristics files
from the Diary survey. For each household in the Diary survey, we are able to observe
its weekly expenditure on the detailed UCC categories and its annual income for the 12
months prior to the interview. Then we append the compiled Interview data file to the
compiled Diary one to get the whole sample of UCCs.

A.1.4   Adjusting the expenditure values
In the second step, we make several adjustments to the collected expenditures in order to
meet the BLS’s requirements for the creation of CPI expenditure weights. The adjustments
are made following the BLS document “CPI Requirements of CE”.

Housing
 Two adjustments are made to housing categories.

   • Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence
     UCC categories only collect the value of the house, its property taxes, real estate
     fees, and mortgage interests. Houses and other residential structures are capital
     goods and should not be considered as CPI items. Interest costs (such as mortgage
     interest), property taxes and most maintenance costs, are part of the cost of the cap-
     ital good and are not consumption expenditures either. All of these are not useful
     in computing the expenditure weights for the item Owners’ equivalent rent of primary
     residence.

                                            30
      According to the BLS document “How the CPI measures price change of Owners’ equiv-
      alent rent of primary residence (OER) and Rent of primary residence (Rent)”, the expendi-
      ture weight in the CPI market basket for Owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence
      (OER) is based on the following question that the CES asks consumers who own
      their primary residence:
      “If someone were to rent your home today, how much do you think it would rent
      for monthly, unfurnished and without utilities?”
      CES collects the household responses to this question and saves them in the variable
      RENTEQVX in characteristics files. We construct an artificial UCC code “999999” to
      store the values of variable RENTEQVX, which provides the household expenditure
      on the owners’ equivalent rent of primary residence.
   • Homeowner insurance/maintenance/major appliance
     The BLS adjusts the expenditures on homeowner insurance, maintenance, and ma-
     jor appliances to separate the consumption components of those expenditures from
     the investment component. The BLS uses a factor of 0.43 to account for the con-
     sumption portion of a homeowner’s total expenditure on these housing categories.
     The factor is based on the likelihood that renters will purchase these types of ap-
     pliances and perform these types of home maintenance and improvement. Thus,
     to reflect the consumption portion of a homeowner’s total expenditure on housing
     insurance, maintenance, and major appliances, we multiply the expenditures on the
     corresponding UCC categories by 0.43.

Medical care
  The BLS uses the National Health Expenditure (NHE) tables produced by the Center
for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to calculate the factors that redistribute the
weights from private health insurance and Medicare premium to medical care services.
Unfortunately, we do not have access to the underlying formulas the BLS used to calculate
these factors. By way of approximation, we take the redistributing factors from the NHE
Table 20 Private Health Insurance Benefits and Net Cost; Levels, Annual Percent Change and
Percent Distribution, Selected Calendar Years 1960-2015.6
    We redistribute the expenditures from private health insurance and Medicare premi-
ums related UCC categories to health care services categories, such as nursing homes and
adult day services, by using factors obtained from the table mentioned above. Note that
medical reimbursements are allocated across all households to smooth the household ex-
penditures on medical expenses. That is to say, a household may be reimbursed even
during a period in which they had no medical expenses.

Transportation


   • Used cars
     Expenditures on used cars and trucks should only reflect dealer value added. There-
  6 For more details see the link https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/
statistics-trends-and-reports/nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet.html

                                              31
        fore, the expenditure weights on used cars and trucks should be determined by
        spending on used cars and trucks, minus trade-in value of vehicles and other sales
        of consumer-owned vehicles.
        CES does not provide data on trade-in values of vehicles (UCC 450116 and 450216)
        and other sales of consumer owned vehicles (UCC 860100 and 860200). Thus, we
        take the expenditure weight on used cars and trucks from the BLS released table
        Relative Importance of Components in the Consumer Price Index to recover the ratio of
        trade-in values and other sales of vehicles to spending on used cars and trucks, and
        we find the ratio is around 1/2. Thus, we reduce the spending on used cars and
        trucks to half to reflect only the dealer value added.

   • Gasoline
     Gasoline expenditures are not allocated into categories (regular, premium, midgrade,
     etc.) at collection. To distribute the total gasoline expenditures (UCC 470111) amongst
     the gasoline ELIs (TB011 Regular Unleased Gasoline,TB012 Midgrade Unleased Gasoline
     and TB013 Premuim Unleased Gasoline), the BLS constructed the distribution factors
     from expenditure habits in each primary sampling unit (PSU).
     However, we don’t have access to the expenditure habits of each PSU. Instead, we
     follow Nakamura and Steinsson (2008), and allocate the expenditures on gasoline
     to regular, premium, midgrade categories equally.

A.1.5    Aggregating households into percentiles
In the third step, we aggregate households into percentiles. Because the Interview and
the Diary survey different households, we sort the households into percentiles in two
sub-steps. First, we aggregate the households in the Interview survey into percentiles
based on imputed household annual income before tax, and then find the income cut-
offs for each percentile. Second, we use the Interview survey income cut-offs to divide
households from the Dairy survey into percentiles. In this case, each household in our
data sample has been sorted into a percentile. We could get similar results by using in-
come cutoffs from the Dairy survey to aggregate households in the Interview survey into
percentiles.
    The CES data start to include the imputed incomesince 2004. Before that it only pub-
lishes income data collected from households that are complete income reporters. House-
holds are defined as complete reporters if they report one of the major sources of income,
such as wages and salaries, Social Security income, or self-employment income. How-
ever, even a complete reporter might not provide information on all sources of income
they indicate they received. Thus, in cases when the values of income are not reported,
imputation allows them to be estimated. We sort households into percentiles based on
the imputed household income before tax, which is only available since 2004. Because
of this, therefore, we could only compute the percentile-level expenditure weights since
2004.




                                              32
A.1.6   Calculating the expenditure shares
In the final step, we calculate the expenditure shares at the detailed product category level
for households at different income percentiles.
    First, we calculate the average expenditure for each detailed UCC category for house-
holds at different income percentiles. Note that there is a distinction between survey pe-
riod and expenditure reference period in the interview survey, as the CES collects house-
hold spending in the three months prior to the interview month. This distinction will
affect the estimation procedure for producing household average expenditure during a
calendar year. For example, households interviewed in February will report their spend-
ing for November and December of 2014 and January of 2015. Thus, to compute the aver-
age value for expenditures made on a certain UCC category during year 2015, they only
contribute one month (January) of the expenditures they made during the expenditure
reference period to the calculation. While households interviewed in May report their ex-
pense for February, March and April of 2015 and could contribute all their expenditures to
compute the average expenditure this household made during 2015. To reflect the num-
ber of months a household can contribute to the mean value of a calendar year, we follow
the BLS to create a variable called MO_SCOPE. In the above example, MO_SCOPE=1 for
households interviewed in February and MO_SCOPE=3 for households interviewed in
May. There is no such distinction between the survey period and expenditure reference
period in the Diary. We multiply each weekly expenditure by 13 to get a corresponding
quarterly expenditure. As there is no lag between the survey period and the expenditure
reference period, the number of months households in the Diary survey contribute to es-
timate of the mean value is 3, i.e. MO_SCOPE=3. We could also interpret MO_SCOPE as
the number of months a household reports expenditures during a calendar year.
    Following the BLS manual, we use the formula below to calculate the average expen-
diture for each UCC category k at each percentile h. First, for household i at percentile
h, we sum over all the spending it made on good k during the calendar year. Second,
we weight total expenditures made by household i in percentile h on good k up by its
household-specific sampling weight. Third, we sum up the weighted household expen-
ditures on good k over all the households at percentile h. Fourth, we divide the sum of
weighted household expenditures on good k at percentile h by the sum of the weighted
number of months household at percentile h reported expenditures during the calendar
year, to get the monthly average income on good k of household at percentile h. Then
multiplying the monthly average expenditure by 12, we get the annualized average ex-

                                    ∑i FI NLWTih · MO_SCOPEih

where FI NLWTih is the sampling weight for household i at income percentile h, Ci,k,t
                                                                                h     is
the expenditure on good k of household i at income percentile h during month t, and
MO_SCOPEih denotes number of months household i reports expenditures during a cal-
endar year.

   Second, we take percentile-level average expenditure for each UCC from above, and
then aggregate according to the constructed concordance between UCC categories and
ELIs (or Item Strata) to get percentile-level household average expenditure X̄ jh for each
265 ELIs (or 178 items) and the corresponding percentile-level expenditure share ω jh =
  X̄ jh
            .

A.2             Constructing income-percentile-specific CPIs
A.2.1           Item-level consumer price data
To construct the income-percentile-specific consumer price indices (CPI), we need to com-
bine the percentile-level expenditure share data computed above with the micro con-
sumer price data. We obtain the consumer price data from the BLS. Each month, the
BLS releases the consumer price index at all levels of aggregation. Each price index has
a unique identifier called series id, CUUR0400AA0 for example. The series id can be
broken down to: CU–survey abbreviation–current series, U–season code–seasonal un-
adjusted, R–periodicity code–monthly, 0400–area code–Western Urban and AA0–item
code–all items. We use the U.S. city average, all urban consumers, seasonally adjusted
item-level monthly price indices to construct the monthly income-percentile-specific CPIs.

A.2.2           Concordance between old and new series
The revised consumer price data were introduced by the BLS in 1998, and the revision
included an updated and revised item structure. For example, there were only 7 major
groups of goods and services before 1997 and in 1998, a new group Education and Com-
munication was created and the new group included components previously included in
the Recreation and Housing groups. Here, we refer to the revised item structure as the new
series and to the pre-revised item structure as the old series. Micro consumer price data
are provided in the old series before 1997, and in new series since 1997.
    To combine the item-level consumer price data from the old series with the expendi-
ture share data, we manually construct a concordance from the new series to the old series
at the item level. Note that there are some new series items that are more aggregated than
the old ones, and in these cases one item in the new series is concorded to multiple items
in old series. To deal with it, we construct a concordance weight by using the expenditure
weight taken from the BLS table Relative Importance of Components in the Consumer
Price Index. One example is as follows. Item SEFF01 Chicken in the new series is con-
corded to SE0601 Fresh whole chicken and SE0602 Fresh/Frozen chicken parts in the old
series. We find that the average expenditure during years 1987 to 1989 on the two items
are 0.152% and 0.220% respectively, and thus we assign the concordance weights based
on their relative expenditure weights on the two items. The 265 new series items are
concorded to 165 old series ones.

A.2.3    Aggregation formula
We follow the BLS manual “Chapter 17. The Consumer Prie Index” in constructing the
income-percentile-specific CPI. The formula can be written as follows:

                                                           Pj,t
                              PIXth = PIXvh · ∑ (ω j,β
                                                   h
                                                       ×        ),
                                              j∈ J
                                                           Pj,v

where:
 PIXth = consumer price index for household at percentile h at time t
v = pivot year and month, usually December, prior to the month when expenditure
weights from reference period (β) are first used in the CPI
β = predetermined expenditure reference period
Pj,t = price of item j at time t
   h = expenditure weights of household at percentile h on item j during the predeter-
ω j,β
mined expenditure reference period β .
     The BLS periodically updates its expenditure weight reference period. Historically,
it updated approximately every ten years, and since 2002, it adopted a biennial rotation
schedule to update the expenditure weight reference period. We follow the BLS expen-
diture reference period schedule after 2004, and prior to that, we use the 2004 percentile-
level expenditure weights to construct the income-percentile-specific CPI. As mentioned
in A.1.5, this is due to the availability of the imputed household income before tax. We
have computed the pre-2004 aggregate CPI by taking the official expenditure weights
from BLS table Relative Importance of Components in the Consumer Price Index for the
pre-2004 expenditure reference period. And comparing it with the aggregate CPI con-
structed by using 2004 aggregate weights, we find the two CPI series are almost identical.
     Due to the revision of item structure in 1998, we have to construct the income-percentile-
specific CPI separately in two periods. We use old series item-level micro price data to
compute the income-percentile-specific CPI for the period 1978m1-1997m12 and new se-
ries price data for the post-1998 period. In the year 1997, the BLS released item-level micro
prices in both old and new series, which allows us to bridge the two periods by using one
of the months in 1997 as the pivot month (based period) for the second period. We used
both the old and new series micro price data to construct the aggregate CPIs in 1997 and
found that they give us similar results in (log) price terms. We choose 1997m12 as the first
pivot month for the construction of the post-1998 income-percentile-specific CPIs.
