                                            ABSTRACT

Corporate cash flows are highly volatile and strongly procyclical. We examine the asset-pricing
implications of the sensitivity of corporate cash flows to economic shocks within a continuous-time
model in which dividends are a stochastic fraction of aggregate consumption. We provide closed-
form solutions for stock values and show that the equity premium can be represented as the sum of
three components which we call the consumption-risk, event-risk, and corporate-risk premia.
Calibrating to historical data, we show that the model implies a total equity premium many times
larger than in the standard model. The model also generates levels of equity volatility consistent with
those experienced in the stock market.

Standard asset-pricing theory implies that equilibrium asset values can be expressed
as the expected product of a pricing kernel and the cash flows from those assets.
Because of this, the ultimate ability of an asset-pricing model to explain the equity
premium hinges on being able to successfully identify an appropriate pricing kernel
and accurately model corporate cash flows.
    Since the equity premium puzzle was identified by Mehra and Prescott (1985),
considerable progress has been made in specifying pricing kernels. Important recent
examples include Eichenbaum, Hansen, and Singleton (1988), Sundaresan (1989), Con-
stantinides (1990), Abel (1990), Epstein and Zin (1991), Ferson and Constantinides
(1991), Detemple and Zapatero (1991), Heaton (1995), Chapman (1998), Campbell
and Cochrane (1999), Hansen, Sargent, and Tallarini (1999), Lettau and Uhlig (2000),
Wachter (2001), Chen and Epstein (2002), and many others.
     In contrast, less attention has been paid to the problem of modeling corporate
cash flows within this framework. In fact, many papers in this literature sidestep
this issue altogether by simply constraining aggregate dividends to equal aggregate
consumption. Important exceptions include Merton (1971) and Santos and Veronesi
(2001) who model aggregate corporate cash flows as consumption minus a labor income
component. Other important papers that allow aggregate cash flows to diﬀer from
aggregate consumption include Campbell (1986), Cecchetti, Lam, and Mark (1993),
Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Abel (1999), Bekaert and Grenadier (1999), Brennan
and Xia (2001), and others. In a series of insightful recent papers, Barberis and
Huang (2001), and Menzly, Santos, and Veronesi (2002, 2003) model the cash flows
of individual firms in a way that allows aggregate dividends to diﬀer from aggregate
consumption.
     Modeling cash flows separately from aggregate consumption is crucial since cor-
porate cash flows have historically been far more volatile and sensitive to economic
shocks than has aggregate consumption. For example, corporate earnings have been
more than ten times as volatile as consumption growth during the post-war period.
Similarly, while aggregate consumption declined nearly 10 percent during the early
stages of the Great Depression, aggregate corporate earnings were completely obliter-
ated as they fell more than 103 percent. In addition to being more volatile, corporate
cash flows are also highly correlated with aggregate consumption because of their
strong procyclical behavior. To provide specifics, during the 1929 to 2001 period the
volatility of earnings growth was 29.5 percent, while the correlation between per capita
real consumption and earning growth was 68.7 percent.

                                           1
     Intuitively, the reason for the extreme volatility and procyclicality of corporate
earnings is that stockholders are residual claimants to corporate cash flows. Thus, the
compensation of workers is a senior claim to cash flows. In other words, labor contracts
provide workers with some degree of insurance against business cycle risk. These con-
tracts make the fraction of labor income in output (or consumption) countercyclical,
while the fraction of earnings in output is procyclical. Gomme and Greenwood (1995)
document that these business-cycle-related changes in labor income and earnings can
be found in many countries.
     This paper extends the literature by modeling aggregate dividends as a small but
highly volatile and procyclical component of aggregate consumption. The procycli-
cality and volatility of dividends directly impact the covariance between the pricing
kernel and corporate cash flows and significantly aﬀect equilibrium stock values. To
capture the sensitivity of corporate cash flows to both the usual “small” economic
shocks as well as to rare catastrophic “large” economic shocks, we extend the rep-
resentative agent framework to allow aggregate dividends and consumption to follow
distinct exponential-aﬃne jump-diﬀusion processes. The ratio of aggregate dividends
to consumption, which we designate the “corporate fraction,” plays a central role in
the model.
      From the first-order conditions of the representative agent, we obtain an explicit
closed-form expression for the stock price. In turn, this allows us to derive a simple
expression for the equity premium in which there are three distinct components. The
first is the standard Mehra and Prescott (1985) equity premium proportional to the
variance of consumption growth, which we call the consumption-risk premium. The
second is proportional to the probability of a jump times the product of the jump sizes
in consumption and the stock price. We designate this jump-related component the
event-risk premium. The third is proportional to the covariance between the growth
rates in consumption and the corporate fraction, and is designated the corporate-risk
premium. This three-component model of the equity premium nests many of the
previous models in the literature and provides a number of new insights about the
determinants of the equity premium.
     To illustrate the model’s asset-pricing implications, we calibrate the model using
parameters that approximate the properties of consumption and the corporate fraction
during the past century. A novel feature of our approach is that we calibrate the model
using imputed dividends (calculated by applying a payout ratio, which we assume to be
constant, to aggregate corporate earnings) rather than using reported dividends. The
rationale for this stems from the well-known tendency of firms to artificially smooth
their dividends over time, thereby delinking reported dividends from actual corporate
cash flows.
     We show that the high sensitivity of imputed dividends to economic shocks maps
into equity premia many times larger than in the standard framework. For example,
using a risk aversion coeﬃcient of five, the three components of the equity premium

                                           2
are 0.36, 0.51, and 1.39 percent respectively, giving a total equity premium of 2.26
percent. Thus, the equity premium implied by the model is more than six times as
large as the standard Mehra and Prescott (1985) equity premium (given by the first
component). Similar results hold for a variety of other calibrations.
     It is important to recognize, however, that the equity premium implied by the
model is less than half as large as historical estimates. Thus, the model clearly does
not provide a complete resolution of the equity premium puzzle. Moreover, the Euler
equation for the riskfree bond in our model is the standard one, which means that we
inherit Weil’s (1989) riskfree rate puzzle. Our results do suggest, however, that com-
bining our approach with other elements such as habit formation (as in Campbell and
Cochrane (1999)) or investor heterogeneity in incomplete markets (see the discussion
in Constantinides (2002)) could play an important role in the ultimate resolution of
asset-pricing puzzles.
     There is an extensive literature on the equity premium puzzle. Detailed refer-
ences can be found in the excellent surveys by Kocherlakota (1996), Cochrane (1997),
Campbell (1999), Constantinides (2002), and Mehra (2002). Breeden (1979) and Bak-
shi and Chen (1996, 1997) are continuous-time versions of the endowment economy in
Lucas (1978) based on diﬀusions. Naik and Lee (1990) extend the setup to allow for
jumps in consumption growth. Their model is the continuous-time analogue of Rietz
(1988).
     The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the asset-
pricing model. Section 3 solves for the equity premium generated by the model and
examines its properties. Section 4 discusses the properties of the corporate fraction.
Section 5 describes how the model is calibrated. Section 6 examines the asset-pricing
implications of the model. Section 7 summarizes the results and makes concluding
remarks.

                                  2. THE MODEL

In this section, we extend the Lucas (1978) and Mehra and Prescott (1985) framework
by introducing an explicit model of corporate cash flows. In this model, corporate cash
flows represent a small but highly volatile fraction of aggregate consumption. This
sensitivity to economic shocks has a number of important asset-pricing implications.
    We consider an economy populated by a representative agent who maximizes an
expected power utility function of the form,

                                 }8       ∞                        ]
                                              −δ(s−t)   Cs1−γ
                            Et                e               ds       ,            (1)
                                      t                 1−γ

where Ct represents consumption, γ is the coeﬃcient of relative risk aversion, and δ is

                                                  3
the subjective discount rate. The agent has two sources of a nondurable consumption
good. First, the agent receives an exogenous endowment It of the consumption good
which constitutes his nonfinancial income. Second, the agent is also initially endowed
with one share of a stock which pays dividends Dt in the form of the consumption good.
The stock is thus a claim to dividends instead of consumption, which in equilibrium
is given by the sum of the dividends and nonfinancial income, Ct = Dt + It .
    We specify the corporate fraction Ft of dividends in consumption exogenously as,

                                      Dt
                               Ft =      = exp(−Xt ),                              (2)
                                      Ct

where Xt follows the square-root jump-diﬀusion process,

                                               √
                    dX = (µ − κX) dt − η        X dZ1 + ξ dq.                      (3)

Here, Z1 is a standard Brownian motion and q is a Poisson process with constant
intensity λ. Provided that µ, κ, and ξ are positive, the value of Xt is nonnegative.
In turn, this ensures that the corporate fraction Ft is always between zero and one.
This property makes intuitive sense given the interpretation of Ft as the proportion
of total consumption that comes from dividends. It is easily shown that the expected
value of the corporate fraction converges to a steady-state value as s → ∞ because of
the mean reverting nature of these dynamics.
    We next assume that aggregate consumption follows the jump-diﬀusion process,

                        dC           √
                           = α dt + σ X dZ2 − ψ dq,                                (4)
                         C

where 0 ≤ ψ < 1, and Z2 is also a standard Brownian motion. The correlation
between the two Brownian motions is ρ dt. By allowing changes in both Xt and Ct to
be driven by Brownian motions, the model captures the sensitivity of dividends and
consumption to small or continuous economic shocks. Furthermore, by allowing ρ < 1,
the model captures the feature that small changes in dividends can be influenced by
factors other than those driving consumption. Because both Xt and Ct are aﬀected
by a common Poisson process, however, the model allows for large economic shocks or
events (such as the Great Depression) to trigger simultaneous jumps in both dividends
and consumption. Finally, note from Eq. (4) that expected consumption growth is
constant, implying that consumption growth is not predictable. This follows Hall
(1978), Campbell and Cochrane (1999), Chan and Kogan (2002), and many others
who assume that consumption growth is not predictable.
    From Eq. (2), dividends are given by,

                                          4
                            Dt = Ct Ft = Ct exp(−Xt ).                               (5)

An application of Ito’s Lemma implies the dynamics for the dividend process,

              dD D        D                i i
                 = α − µ + κ + ρση + η 2 /2 X dt
               D
                                                                                     (6)
                       √         √        D             i
                    + σ X dZ1 + η X dZ2 + (1 − ψ)e−ξ − 1 dq.

Comparing these dynamics with those in Eq. (4) shows that dividends have the
potential to be more volatile than consumption in this framework because dividend
dynamics are driven by both Brownian motions. Similarly, these dynamics allow jumps
in dividends to be larger than jumps in consumption. This feature is particularly
important since it allows the model to avoid the Mehra and Prescott (1988) critique
of the Rietz (1988) model. Rietz argues that the historical equity premium can be
explained by the risk of large downward jumps (possibly as large as 90 percent) in
consumption. Mehra and Prescott argue that the size of the downward jumps in
consumption necessary to explain the equity premium is many times larger than any
ever experienced in U.S. history. By allowing us to specify the jump in dividends
separately from the jump in consumption, the model is in a better position to capture
the historical equity premium without resorting to unrealistically large consumption
crashes.
     Taken together, these results imply that dividend growth is more sensitive to
economic shocks whenever the corporate fraction is stochastic. Only in the case where
the corporate fraction is deterministic are dividends and consumption growth equally
sensitive to economic shocks.1 In this case, our model reduces to the standard Mehra
and Prescott (1985) framework.
    In equilibrium, the price of the stock satisfies the Euler equation,

                               ^8                  w   W−γ      

  To see this, note from Eq. (3) that the corporate fraction is deterministic if and only
if η = ξ = 0. Substituting these values into Eq. (6) makes the stochastic components
of the dynamics for D identical to those for C in Eq. (4).

Using the results in Duﬃe, Pan, and Singleton (2000), the appendix shows that the
stock price is given by the following closed-form expression,

                     B(t, s) =                            −                      ,

and where,

                                       η 2 + κ + ρση(1 − γ) + φ

From this closed-form solution, it is clear that the stock price is a complex function of
consumption, the corporate fraction, and the parameters governing their dynamics.2

                                    3. THE EQUITY PREMIUM

To explore the implications of the model for the equity premium, it is helpful to
first simplify notation slightly. Let σC and σF denote the instantaneous volatility
of percentage changes in consumption and the corporate fraction respectively.3 By a
2
 As discussed in the appendix, this solution requires that the term under the square
root in the definition of φ be positive. Given typical parameter values, however, this
condition is easily satisfied. Other recent papers that provide solutions for equity
prices in terms of their fundamental cash flows include Ohlson (1990, 1995), Bakshi
and Chen (1996, 1997, 2001), Bekaert and Grenadier (1999), Ang and Liu (2001),
Vuolteenaho (2002), Mamaysky (2002), and Pastor and Veronesi (2003).
3
 More precisely, σC and σF denote the instantaneous volatility of the continuous
portion of dC/C and dF/F respectively.


                                                          6
simple extension of the results in Cochrane (2001) to jump-diﬀusion processes, the
appendix shows that the equity premium EP implied by the model can be expressed
as,

                          2
                  EP = γ σC        − λ JΛ JP       + γ H ρ σ C σF ,                  (9)

where JΛ is the percentage jump in marginal utility, JP is the percentage jump in the
stock price, and H is the elasticity of the stock price with respect to F .
     This expression illustrates that the equity premium implied by the model has
                                                 2
three distinct components. The first term, γ σC    , corresponds to the equity premium
implied by many traditional models (for example, see the recent review paper by
Mehra (2002)). To make things more clear, we call this first component of the equity
premium the consumption-risk premium. As is well known, this first term by itself
generates a very small equity premium given the low volatility of historical aggregate
consumption data and reasonable levels of the risk aversion coeﬃcient. To provide
a simple numerical illustration, assume a value for consumption volatility of three
percent and a value of five for the risk aversion coeﬃcient. From Eq. (9), this implies
a value for the consumption-risk premium of only 0.45 percent.
     The second term is directly related to the eﬀect of a jump on the equilibrium
price of the stock. A jump event has two potential eﬀects on the Euler equation
defining the price of the stock in that it aﬀects both consumption and the dividend
stream. In particular, a downward shock in consumption has the eﬀect of increasing
the representative agent’s marginal utility. Thus, JΛ is positive. On the other hand,
the shock to dividends results in a price decline, which means that JP is negative.
Thus, the second term −λ JΛ JP is positive in sign, and can be directly interpreted as
the event-risk premium or jump component of the equity premium.
     When jumps cannot occur, λ = 0, and the event-risk premium becomes zero.
Alternatively, if jumps aﬀect only dividends and not consumption, JΛ = 0, and the
event-risk premium is again zero. The presence of the event-risk component in the
equilibrium equity premium parallels Rietz (1988) in which large downward jumps in
consumption aﬀect asset prices. Unlike Rietz, however, our model allows the jump in
dividends to diﬀer in size from the jump in consumption. As we show later, this allows
the model to generate a large event-risk premium even when the downward jump in
consumption is realistic by historical standards. To continue our numerical illustration,
assume that a major event such as the Great Depression happens every 100 years on
average, resulting in a 10 percent decline in consumption and a 75 percent decline in the
stock market. The corresponding percentage increase in marginal utility JΛ is simply
(0.9−5 − 1), or 69.4 percent. Thus, the event-risk premium is 0.01 × 0.694 × 0.750 =
0.0052, or 0.52 percent. This simple example shows that the event-risk premium can
be larger than the usual Mehra and Prescott (1985) consumption-risk equity premium
given jumps in consumption and the stock market similar to those during the early

                                           7
1930s.
      The third term in the equity premium is directly related to the covariance between
consumption growth and percentage changes in the corporate fraction. For example,
if dividends are a constant fraction of consumption (as in Mehra and Prescott (1985)),
then σF = 0, which implies that this component of the equity premium is zero. Note
that this is true even if the ratio of dividends to consumption is not one. Alternatively,
if the correlation ρ between the continuous changes in Ct and Ft is zero, then this
component is again zero. We designate this third term the corporate-risk premium.
To provide a realistic upper bound on how much the corporate-risk premium could
potentially contribute to the total equity premium, consider the extreme case where
both the correlation and elasticity coeﬃcients are equal to one. Using values for σC
and σF of 3 and 30 percent respectively, Eq. (9) implies a value for the corporate
volatility premium of 4.50 percent, which is ten times as large as the consumption
volatility premium. Totaling all three of the risk premia in this numerical illustration
gives a rough upper bound for the equity premium of 0.45 + 0.52 + 4.50 = 5.47
percent, which is clearly on the right order of magnitude. In the next several sections,
we provide a simple approach for calibrating the model and examining more carefully
its implications for the equity premium.

             4. MEASURING THE CORPORATE FRACTION

One of distinguishing features of our framework is that dividends are explicitly modeled
as a stochastic fraction of total consumption. Since this corporate fraction plays a key
role throughout our framework, this section describes how the corporate fraction is
estimated and provides summary statistics about its properties.
     In theory, the corporate fraction could be estimated by taking reported aggregate
dividends and dividing them by aggregate consumption. In actuality, however, there
are important reasons why the resulting estimate of the corporate fraction may not
be appropriate. Foremost among these is the extensive evidence that corporations
tend to artificially smooth dividends over time. Specifically, firms tend to retain earn-
ings within the firm during good periods, and pay dividends out of capital during
bad periods. Evidence on this tendency dates back as far as Lintner (1956), Brittain
(1966), and Fama and Babiak (1968). More recent examples documenting this ten-
dency include Marsh and Merton (1987), DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and Skinner (1992),
Allen and Michaely (2002), and many others. Clearly, if firms manage their dividends
for reasons related to their information or signaling content (for example, as in Bhat-
tacharya (1979), Miller and Rock (1985)), or to resolve agency conflicts (see Allen and
Michaely), then the stochastic properties of reported dividends may not be directly
linked to the actual cash flows generated by firms. Interestingly, Fama and French
(2001) show that firms that do not pay any dividends now account for one-quarter of
the value of the stock market. In addition, as argued by Liang and Sharpe (1999), Hall

                                            8
(2001), and others, reported dividends may not include important cash distributions
such as share repurchases or corporate acquisitions. Allen and Michaely document
that the amount of share repurchases is much more volatile than dividends.4 These
considerations provide a compelling motivation for using a measure of dividends that
more closely reflects actual corporate cash flows.
     To this end, we adopt the intuitive approach of assuming that aggregate “eco-
nomic” dividends are equal to a constant payout ratio times aggregate corporate earn-
ings. This approach is used in a number of recent papers such as Lee, Myers, and
Swaminathan (1999), Bakshi and Chen (2001), and others. Furthermore, this ap-
proach is consistent with the evidence by Lintner (1956), Fama and Babiak (1968),
and others that dividend policy is well described by a model in which firms apply a
target payout ratio to earnings in making dividend decisions. An important feature of
this approach is that percentage changes in imputed dividends are equal to percentage
changes in earnings. Thus, the volatility and correlation properties of growth rates in
imputed dividends mirror those of corporate earnings.
     To provide historical perspective, we collect data on the corporate fraction for
the period from 1929 to 2001. The inclusion of the 1930s in the sample is particularly
important given the peso-problem-like diﬃculty in estimating the size and frequency
of catastrophic events which could lead to a significant event-risk component in the
equity premium. The annual earnings and consumption data used to compute Ft are
from the National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) reported by the Bureau of
Economic Analysis. As the earnings measure, we use total after-tax corporate profits.
We use after-tax rather than pre-tax earnings since dividends are not tax deductible
at the corporate level and must be paid out to shareholders on an after-tax basis (see
McGrattan and Prescott (2001) for a discussion of the eﬀects of taxes on the equity
premium).
     Although it could be argued that firms also manage their earnings, there are a
number of reasons why this measure of earnings should be largely free of this prob-
lem. First, NIPA corporate profit measures are based on Federal tax law rather than
on the set of more-flexible rules used by corporations and accounting firms to report
financial results to shareholders (typically referred to as GAAP or Generally Accepted
Accounting Principles). Second, the NIPA earnings measure avoids many of the “ex-
traordinary” items that firms report since the NIPA earnings measure excludes capital
gains and losses, losses resulting from bad debts, interfirm cash flows, depletion, etc.
Finally, since these numbers are aggregated over all firms, any idiosyncratic “extraor-
dinary” items that may cause earnings volatility at the firm level may have little
influence on volatility of aggregate earnings.5

    For example, if a transaction involves one firm reporting an extraordinary gain and

                                            9
      It is important to note that the NIPA measure of earnings does not simply equal
total consumption minus labor income. The reason for this is that the National income
accounts also include components such as proprietors’ income, rental income, and net
interest. We exclude these components in our measure of earnings since our focus is on
valuing equity claims, and these components do not accrue to corporate shareholders.6
Consumption is defined as the sum of aggregate nondurable and services consumption.
In computing real growth rates in consumption, our estimates of realized inflation are
based on the price series corresponding to our definition of consumption (not the CPI).
Year-end population estimates used to calculate per capita consumption are from the
Census Bureau. Consistent with the historical average for this period, we assume that
the payout ratio is 50 percent.7 We note, however, that varying the payout ratio has
little eﬀect on the any of the results.
     Fig. 1 plots the time series of the corporate fraction for the 1929 to 2001 period.
As shown, one of the most striking features of the corporate fraction is its volatility.
The corporate fraction ranges from a low of −2.11 percent in 1932 to a maximum of
7.81 percent in 1959. The average value of the corporate fraction is 4.92 percent. The
standard deviation (in levels) of the corporate fraction is 1.62 percent, which is a ratio
of 32.99 percent of its mean value. This ratio closely parallels the 27.03 percent stan-
dard deviation of percentage changes in the corporate fraction.8 Another indication
of the extreme sensitivity of the corporate fraction to economic shocks is that while
consumption declined 8.91 percent during the early stages of the Great Depression,
the corporate fraction declined 103.35 percent. The first-order serial correlation of
percentage changes in the corporate fraction is 0.058.
    Another key feature of the corporate fraction is its surprisingly high correlation
with consumption. Specifically, during the 1929-2001 sample period (excluding 1931
and 1932), the correlation between percentage changes in the corporate fraction and

another an oﬀsetting extraordinary loss, the aggregate should be largely unaﬀected.
Furthermore, a recent survey by the American Institute of Certified Public Accoun-
tants estimates that fewer than ten percent of firms report extraordinary items.
6
 This is a key distinction between our approach and other papers in the literature
that model aggregate dividends as aggregate consumption minus some measure of
aggregate labor income.
7
 For example, from 1929 to 2001, the median payout ratio is 46.5 percent, and the
average payout ratio (excluding the two years with negative earnings) is 54.6 percent.
Allen and Michaely (2002) Table 1 implies an average dividend payout ratio of 45.2
percent from 1972 to 1998.
8
 Since earnings for 1931-32 are negative, we compute the percentage changes in the
corporate fraction for these years relative to 1930 and then annualize the percentages.
Note that this likely results in the volatility of percentage changes being understated.


                                           10
consumption growth is 0.632. This is shown in Fig. 2. which plots the percentage
changes in the corporate fraction against those of consumption growth. Clearly, there
is a strong positive correlation between the two variables; the t-statistic for consump-
tion growth from the regression of percentage changes in the corporate fraction on
consumption growth is 6.54. Thus, the corporate fraction varies significantly with the
business cycle; the corporate fraction is highly procyclical. In particular, a one-percent
decline in consumption is associated with roughly a six-percent decline in the corpo-
rate fraction. In turn, this implies about a seven-percent decline in dividends. This
procyclicality of dividends has important implications for the size of the corporate-risk
premium.
     There are a number of important theoretical and empirical reasons why the cor-
porate fraction should be strongly procyclical. The distribution of income between
capital and labor income plays a critical role throughout much of the macroeconomic
literature during the past several decades. One of the main components of capital
income is corporate profits (the other components are net interest, rental income, and
depreciation). As documented by Gomme and Greenwood (1995), the share of income
going to capital is highly procyclical in the U.S. as well as in the eight other OECD
countries they study. This share approximates the corporate fraction if one thinks of
capital income as being mostly corporate profits and of consumption as being roughly
equal to income. Gomme and Greenwood show that this procyclicality arises naturally
in a model where entrepreneurs insure workers against business cycle fluctuations. En-
trepreneurs (or shareholders) therefore become residual claimants to corporate cash
flows.
     To provide additional empirical evidence about the procyclicality of the corpo-
rate fraction, we investigated a number of alternative approaches for estimating the
correlation. For example, using the extensive historical data set on stock prices, earn-
ings, and consumption collected by Shiller (1989), we calculate the correlation between
annual growth rates for real per capita consumption and earnings on the S&P Com-
posite Stock Price Index for the 1889-1985 period. Although earnings on the S&P
index represent only a small proportion of aggregate corporate profits, the estimated
correlation of 0.454 is similar to that based on the NIPA data. Shiller explains that
prior to 1926, S&P does not report earnings on the index and that earnings data for
the pre-1926 period are based on average price-earnings ratios. Using only the data
for the 1926-1985 period, the correlation estimate is 0.568.9
     As an alternative measure of the corporate fraction, we collected data from the
2002 Economic Report of the President about aggregate corporate income tax and
total income tax revenues from the period from 1959 to 2001. Using the ratio of cor-
porate income tax revenues to total income tax revenues as a proxy for the corporate
9
 The correlation for the 1889 to 1985 period excludes the crash of 1921-1922 since this
represents a large jump event.


                                           11
fraction, the correlation between percentage changes in the corporate fraction and in
real per capita consumption is 0.546. We apply a similar income tax revenue based
approach to estimate the corporate fraction in several other countries for which we
could find tax data. Using data from the Inland Revenue Service of the U.K., the
correlation between annual percentage changes in the corporate fraction and real per
capita consumption in the U.K. is 0.490 for the period from 1978 to 2002. Similarly,
using data from the Department of Finance for Canada, the correlation between per-
centage changes in the corporate fraction and real per capita consumption in Canada
is 0.436 for the period from 1962 to 2002. Although the ratio of corporate to total
income tax revenues is clearly a noisy estimate of the corporate fraction (i.e., it is
aﬀected by changes in tax rates, by the progressivity of tax rates, etc.), these high
correlations provide independent support for the strong correlation of the corporate
fraction and consumption found in the NIPA data.10

                           5. MODEL CALIBRATION

In examining the asset-pricing implications of the model, our approach is to first
provide a simple benchmark calibration that captures the historical properties of the
data. To provide more insight into these asset-pricing implications, however, we also
report results using a range of realistic alternative values for a number of key model
parameters.
     First, to hold fixed the properties of the pricing kernel throughout the analysis,
the results are all based on a modest level of five for the risk aversion coeﬃcient γ of
the representative agent. We also assume that the subjective discount rate δ is 0.01.
     Second, to calibrate the jump-related parameters, we use estimates that reflect
the U.S. experience during the Great Depression. In particular, we use a benchmark
value for λ of 0.01, implying that a major economic crash occurs every 100 years on
average. This mean frequency may actually be overly conservative given the experience
of other major economies such as Germany and Japan during the past century. For
the consumption jump size ψ, we assume a downward jump of 10 percent. This value
is consistent with 8.9 percent downward jump in consumption during 1932, and the
16 percent decline from 1929 to 1932.11 Next, we assume that the realization of the
10
  We also found data sources from the Ministry of Finance for Japan in which a
measure of aggregate pre-tax corporate profits is reported. Using this to calculate the
corporate fraction, the correlation between the corporate fraction and consumption is
0.284 for the 1960 to 2001 period.
11
  While downward jumps in consumption of this magnitude are large, there are many
examples of economies that have experienced downward jumps in consumption of as
much as 20 to 30 percent during the past 50 years. In particular, countries that have
experienced a one-year decline in real GDP of more than 20 percent since 1950 include

                                          12
Poisson event in the model results in a 90 percent decrease in corporate earnings and
imputed dividends. Again, this is on the conservative side given the more than 103
percent decline in corporate earnings during the early stages of the Great Depression.
     Third, consistent with the properties of consumption during the 1929 to 2001
period, we assume that the instantaneous mean and standard deviation of consumption
growth are 2.34 and 2.86 percent respectively.12 Setting these values equal to the
instantaneous first and second moments implied by Eq. (4) gives the following simple
expressions,


                             0.0234 = α − λ ψ,                                    (10)

                            0.02862 = λ ψ 2 − σ 2 ln F̄ ,                         (11)

which are easily solved for α and σ. Here, the moments are evaluated at the average
value F̄ = 0.0492 of the corporate fraction in the sample.
     Fourth, the appendix shows that the expected instantaneous change in the cor-
porate fraction is positive for small values of F and negative for large values of F .
Setting this expected change equal to zero when the corporate fraction equals F̄ and
using a value of 27.03 percent for the instantaneous volatility of the fraction implies
the following two expressions,


                        0 = −µ − (κ + η 2 /2) ln F̄ + λ (e−ξ − 1),                (12)

                  0.27032 = −η 2 ln F̄ + λ(e−ξ − 1)2 ,                            (13)

which likewise are easily solved for the parameters µ and η. For κ, we use a value
of 0.058, matching the first-order serial correlation coeﬃcient for percentage changes
in the corporate fraction during the sample period. Finally, given the properties of
the corporate fraction described in the previous section, we use a value of 0.632 for
the correlation parameter ρ. Table 1 summarizes the calibration assumptions and
parameters.13
Algeria, Angola, Chad, Iran, Iraq, Namibia, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone,
and Uganda (see Heston and Summers (1991)).
12
   Table 3 of Campbell (1999) reports that the mean and standard deviation of con-
sumption growth during the 1891 to 1995 period are 1.77 and 3.26 percent respectively.
13
   The standard deviation of earnings growth rates during the 1929 to 2001 sample
period is 29.5 percent. The correlation of per capita real consumption and earnings
growth rates during the same period (excluding 1931 and 1932) is 68.7 percent.

                    6. ASSET-PRICING IMPLICATIONS

Given this benchmark calibration, it is now straightforward to solve for the equity
premium and its components. Table 2 reports the values of the equity premium
implied by the benchmark calibration. Also reported in Table 2 are values implied by
alternative sets of some of the key parameters of this model.
     As shown, the total equity premium is 2.26 percent in the benchmark case. This
equity premium consists of a 0.36 percent consumption-risk premium, a 0.51 percent
event-risk premium, and a 1.39 percent corporate-risk premium. Note that the total
equity premium implied by this calibration is more than six times as large as the tradi-
tional Mehra and Prescott (1985) equity premium (given by the first or consumption-
risk component). Thus, this approach of explicitly modeling corporate cash flows and
calibrating the model to earnings data clearly can increase the equilibrium equity
premium by nearly an order of magnitude.
     Table 2 also shows the sensitivity of the equity premium to some of the key pa-
rameters that are unique to this modeling framework. As shown, the mean value
of the corporate fraction has only a second-order eﬀect on the equity premium. In
contrast, the volatility of changes in the corporate fraction, the correlation coeﬃcient,
and the serial correlation coeﬃcient all have large eﬀects on the equity premium. Fur-
thermore, this eﬀect comes predominantly (but not exclusively) through their eﬀects
on the corporate-risk component of the equity premium. Finally, an increase in the
risk of a large economic shock has the eﬀect of significantly increasing the total eq-
uity premium. Note, however, that as the probability of a large jump increases, the
volatility of the continuous shocks in C and F must decrease to hold fixed the total
volatility of percentage changes in these variables. Thus, both the consumption-risk
and corporate-risk premia decrease as the probability of a jump increases.
     Although not shown, we also examine the sensitivity of the equilibrium equity
premium to a number of the other parameters in the model. These results indicate
that the eﬀects of changes in parameters such as risk aversion coeﬃcient, the volatility
of consumption, and the size of the jumps in consumption or the corporate fraction
are exactly as implied by the expression for the equity premium in Eq. (9). Not
surprisingly, changes in the subjective discount rate and the expected growth rate of
consumption have very little eﬀect on the equity premium. Finally, changes in the
assumed payout ratio have virtually no eﬀect on the equity premium.
     By applying Ito’s Lemma to the closed-form solution for the stock price, it is
straightforward to solve for the instantaneous volatility of stock returns. Using the
parameters for the benchmark scenario gives a stock return volatility measure of 17.37
percent. This closely approximates the actual volatility of market returns during most
of the past century. For example, the annualized volatility of monthly returns on the
CRSP value-weighted index for the period from 1929 to 2000 is 19.20 percent.


                                           14
     Given the closed-form solution for equity values in the model, it is also straight-
forward to solve for the eﬀect of a catastrophic event or jump on the stock value.
Under the benchmark scenario, the stock value declines by 74.15 percent when a jump
event occurs. While this is clearly much larger than the associated 10 percent de-
cline in consumption, it is significantly less than the 90 percent decline in dividends.
Intuitively, equity values decline less than dividends since the mean reversion in the
corporate fraction implies that the eﬀects of a jump downwards are not permanent.
The 74.15 percent value for the benchmark scenario is in close agreement with the
historical evidence from the Great Depression. For example, the Dow Jones 30 stock
index declined by 69 percent during the two-year 1930-1931 period. During 1931 alone,
the Dow Jones 30 index fell by 53 percent.
     Although our model is calibrated to U.S. data, these results are also consistent
with the experience of many other major countries which have undergone large eco-
nomic shocks. For example, Jorion and Goetzmann (1999) report stock market returns
for countries which experienced shocks severe enough to result in temporary stock mar-
ket closures. Specifically, they report the return for the period from just prior to the
closure to the date of reopening. Their Table IV reports that Greece experienced
a 58 percent decline, Japan, a 95 percent decline, Germany, a 84 percent decline,
and Portugal, a 86 percent decline during the periods of closures. Of course, there
are countries such as China where the economic shocks were so severe that investors
presumably lost 100 percent of the value of their stockholdings.

                                 7. CONCLUSION

We explore the asset-pricing implications of allowing cash flows to diﬀer from aggre-
gate consumption in a representative agent model with power utility. To model cash
flows, we specify processes for consumption and the fraction of dividends in aggregate
consumption, which we call the corporate fraction. Consistent with their historical
properties, we model these processes as aﬃne jump-diﬀusions. We show that equilib-
rium stock prices can be computed in closed form in this economy.
     To measure cash flows, we assume a constant payout ratio and use aggregate
data on earnings. The resulting cash flow series is more sensitive to economic shocks,
including catastrophic shocks, than data on aggregate consumption. The series is also
highly correlated with consumption growth. These two empirical properties are key
features of our calibration.
     For calibrated parameter values, we find that our model is able to generate an
equity premium that is many times larger than in the standard model. We can write
the equity premium in our model as the sum of three components. The first compo-
nent is the standard consumption-risk premium. This component is small, because
consumption growth is smooth. The second component is an event-risk premium due


                                          15
to large catastrophic shocks, such as the Great Depression. Even under conservative
assumptions on the probability of a large catastrophic shock and the size of its impact
on earnings and consumption, we find that this component is already larger than the
first. The third component is the corporate-risk premium. As cash flows are volatile
and highly correlated with consumption growth, the third component represents the
largest portion of the equity premium. We also compute the volatility of equilibrium
returns. We find that our model is able to match the return volatility in the data.

I. Solving for the Stock Price.
Let Yt denote ln Ct . Taking the expectation inside the integral in Eq. (7) requires
evaluating terms of the form,

                             Et [exp(−Xs + (1 − γ)Ys )] .                           (A1)

From Duﬃe, Pan, and Singleton (2000) Proposition 1, these expectations can be
expressed in the following form,

                          A(t, s) exp(B(t, s)Xt + C(t, s)Yt ),                      (A2)

where A(t, s), B(t, s), and C(t, s) satisfy the system of ordinary diﬀerential equations,


                   A               J                    o
                     = −αC − µB − λ (1 − ψ)C exp(Bξ) − 1 ,                          (A3)

                   B = σ 2 (C − C 2 )/2 + (κ + ρσηC)B − η 2 B 2 /2,                 (A4)

                    C = 0,                                                          (A5)

subject to the boundary conditions A(s, s) = 1, B(s, s) = −1, and C(s, s) = 1 − γ.
From (A5), it is immediate that C(t, s) = 1 − γ. Substituting this expression for
C(t, s) into (A4) gives a simple Riccati equation for B(t, s) which can be solved by a
direct integration. Given typical parameter values, the term under the square root
in the definition of φ is positive and the solution for B(t, s) is as shown in Eq. (8).
When the term under the square root in the definition of φ is negative, there is a
periodic solution for B(t, s) which can become infinite as s → ∞. With little loss of
generality, we abstract from this periodic solution and require the parameter values
to be such that φ is well defined. The term A(t, s) is then given by direct integration
once C(t, s) is substituted into (A5).
With the solutions for A(t, s), B(t, s), and C(t, s), we substitute the expression in
(A2) into Eq. (7). Dividing this expression for the expectation by the Ct−γ =
exp(−γYt ) term that appears in the denominator of the agent’s marginal utility
implies that the solution is linear in Ct . Recall that Ft = e−Xt , which implies
                   −B(t,s)
exp(B(t, s)Xt ) = Ft       . Substituting this into Eq. (7) gives Eq. (8).

       = −µ − κ + η 2 /2 ln F dt + η − ln F dZ1 + e−ξ − 1 dq.                     (A6)
     F

Since Xt is nonnegative, Ft takes values between zero and one. It is also easily shown
that Ft has a stationary long-run mean value (by solving for the value of Et [e−Xs ]
and taking the limit as s → ∞). That Ft displays mean reverting behavior is also
clear from its dynamics. In particular, since ln Ft < 0, the drift term in (A6) is
positive for values of Ft close to zero, and is negative for values of Ft close to one.
Taking expectations in (A6) implies,
                  }        ]
                      dF        D                      i      D       i
             Et                = −µ − (κ + η 2 /2) ln F dt + λ e−ξ − 1 dt.        (A7)
                      F

Setting the left-hand side of (A7) equal to zero and evaluating at F = F̄ gives Eq.
(12). Similarly,
                               }        ]
                                   dF                           D      i2
                      Vart                  = − η 2 ln F dt + λ e−ξ − 1 dt,       (A8)
                                    F

which implies Eq. (13) when evaluated at F = F̄ .
III. The Equity Premium.
Following Cochrane (2001), let Λt denote the stochastic discount factor e−δt Ct−γ and
Pt the price of the stock. Using the generalized form of Ito’s Lemma to allow for
jumps, Cochrane Eq. (1.32) can be expressed,

             d(ΛP ) = P dΛ∗ + Λ dP ∗ + dP ∗ dΛ∗ + [Λ+ P + − ΛP ] dq,              (A9)

where changes in the processes superscripted with an asterisk denote continuous
changes, and Λ+ and P + denote the values of these processes immediately after a
jump. Using this expression, Cochrane Eq. (1.33) becomes,


                    } ∗                   ]    } + +    ]

          P           Λ    P      P    Λ         ΛP

Using the following expressions,

                                                     18

Rearranging terms and using Eq. (1.34) of Cochrane gives,
                           }            ]    w +    Ww +    W

                                P Λ            Λ       P

An application of Ito’s Lemma implies,

                   Λ                     C

Substituting into (A14), taking expectations, and using the notation introduced in
the text now gives Eq. (9).

Benchmark Calibration Values. This table reports the values for the indicated calibration inputs.
The parameter estimates are based on NIPA data on annual real per capita consumption and after-tax
corporate earnings for the 1929 to 2001. Consumption is defined as the sum of aggregate nondurable and
services consumption. Jump size parameters correspond to the approximate magnitude of the decline in
consumption and the corporate fraction during the early stages of the Great Depression. Consumption
growth and volatility represent the mean and standard deviation of annual percentage changes in real per
capita consumption. Mean corporate fraction is the time series average of the corporate fraction. Fraction
volatility and autocorrelation are the indicated moments for annual percentage change in the corporate
fraction. The correlation coeﬃcient represents the correlation between percentage changes in real per capita
consumption growth and in the corporate fraction.
