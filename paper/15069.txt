Empirics of Strategic Interdependence: The Case of the Racial Tipping Point

                                             ABSTRACT

The Schelling model of a “tipping point” in racial segregation, in which whites flee a neighborhood
once a threshold of nonwhites is reached, is a canonical model of strategic interdependence. The idea
of “tipping” explaining segregation is widely accepted in the academic literature and popular media.
I use census tract data for metropolitan areas of the US from 1970 to 2000 to test the predictions of
the Schelling model and find that this particular model of strategic interaction largely fails the tests.
There is more “white flight” out of neighborhoods with a high initial share of whites than out of more
racially mixed neighborhoods

1. Introduction

         Models of strategic interaction are common in the economic growth literature, as

well as in many other fields. For example, in human capital spillover models of economic

growth, your incentive to acquire human capital depends on the human capital of others.

If spillovers take place within neighborhoods, then strategic interactions affect

neighborhood formation, human capital of different ethnic groups, and overall inequality

(Borjas 1993, 1996, Benabou 1993, 1996, Durlauf 2002, 1999, 1996). These models

often feature multiple equilibria and sensitivity to initial conditions. Although the theory

is well developed, there has been only limited empirical testing of strategic interactions

and sensitivity to initial conditions.2

         One of the most famous models of strategic interaction in economics is Thomas

Schelling’s (1971) elegant model of racial segregation (see its coverage in Dixit and

Nalebuff 1991, for example). He shows how only a modest preference of whites to live

next to other whites could result in nearly complete residential segregation, because of

the instability of intermediate points where one agent’s residential location depends on

the actions of other agents in the neighborhood. In this model, even a relatively small

fraction of nonwhites could cause the neighborhood to “tip” from completely white to

completely nonwhite. The fraction at which this happens is called the “tipping point.”

         Segregation outcomes might seem to reflect segregationist preferences by whites,

but in the Schelling model the degree of segregation exceeds what all but a small

minority of the white population desires. If there are differences in average human capital


2
 Borjas 1993, 1996 shows empirically that outcomes for individuals are affected by “neighborhood
capital” and “ethnic capital”, but does not test for sensitivity to initial conditions in neighborhood
formation.

between whites and blacks, and there are spillovers within neighborhoods, then

residential segregation has important implications for black-white income differences.

Card and Rothstein (2007) find that the black-white test score gap is higher in more

segregated cities. Hence, Schelling’s model is potentially one of the important building

blocks in understanding inequality (Durlauf 2002 cites it in this context).

        The tipping view of neighborhood change had been around long before

Schelling’s piece. Schelling (1971) says he was inspired by articles from the 1950s,

where the tipping process was described as universal, as was the instability of mixed

neighborhoods. Once a neighborhood had begun to change from white to black, there was

rarely a reversal. The process was very nonlinear. An article in 1960 defined it thus:

Although the movement of whites out of the area may proceed at varying rates of speed, a
“tipping point” is soon reached which sets off a wholesale flight of whites. It is not too
long before the community becomes predominantly Negro.3

        The idea of the “tipping point” is very much alive today both in academic

literature and in popular folklore. Sociologists Douglas Massey and Nancy Denton (1993)

describe how a white “majority still feel uncomfortable in any neighborhood that contains

more than a few black residents; and as the percentage of blacks rises, the number of

whites who say they would refuse to enter or would try to move out increases sharply.”

Ellen (2000) sums up the current conventional wisdom similarly: “racially integrated

neighborhoods cannot stay that way for long…because as soon as the black population in

a neighborhood has reached some “tipping” point, whites move away in droves.”4 A

recent paper by Card, Mas, and Rothstein (2008) (discussed further below) reaffirms the


3
 Oscar Cohen quoted in Wolf (1963).
4
 Ellen (2000) does not share this conventional wisdom, arguing for a more nuanced view of “white
avoidance” of integrated neighborhoods for reasons unrelated to race. She argues that racially mixed
neighborhoods in 1990 were more common and more stable than the conventional wisdom would have it.
                                                                                                           4

story that, in their words, “once the minority share exceeds the tipping point, the

neighborhood transitions rapidly to a very high minority share.”

         A large social science literature studies racial segregation. However, the Schelling

model has undergone surprisingly little large-scale empirical testing on residential

neighborhoods. There has been extensive empirical testing of the determinants of

segregation using survey methods to ascertain people’s preferences for segregation, or

testing small samples of neighborhoods or school districts, or testing cross-city

determinants of segregation, some of which address the Schelling hypothesis (with mixed

results).5 In a Galllup survey in 1997, 25 percent of whites said they would move if

blacks came in “great numbers” into their neighborhood (which was a large decrease

from 73 percent in a similar survey in 1966). This seems to indicate an increased

tolerance for racial integration among whites over time. However, the researchers who

report this survey result (Schuman et al.1997) still believe in the tipping point model:

“the upward trend does not seem to match reality if compared with the exodus of white

families that often occurs when large numbers of black families move into a previously

white neighborhood” (pp. 152-153).

         The Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality (O’Connor, Tilly and Bobo 2001)

conducted a more nuanced survey in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles. They

showed whites five different cards indicating neighborhood composition ranging from

5
  See Clark (1991), Galster (1988), Clark (1988), Massey and Gross (1991), Wilson (1985), Farley et al.
(1994), Giles (1978), Farley and Frey (1994), Hwang and Murdock (1998), Giles et al. (1975), Wolf
(1963), and Schwab and Marsh (1980). Denton and Massey (1991) analyze transition matrices for a large
sample of metropolitan census tracts from 1970 to 1980, but do not test the nonlinear dynamic equation
implied by the Schelling model. Massey and Denton (1993) extensively discuss neighborhood transitions
with census tract data, but do not test the tipping point hypothesis. Crowder (2000) does do a regression of
individual level mobility on neighborhood nonwhite share that shows a highly nonlinear relationship as
predicted by the tipping point model, but his setup does not lend itself to explicitly testing for a tipping
point. Clotfelder (2001) finds the growth of white enrollment in schools declines almost linearly over most
of the range of exposure to nonwhites in school districts.
                                                                                                          5

all-white to majority black and asked them if they would “feel comfortable” in such

neighborhoods or would be “willing to move in” to such a neighborhood. The affirmative

response by whites falls fairly sharply as the black share rises, which would be more

consistent with the tipping point hypothesis (for example, only 30 percent of whites

would be willing to move into a neighborhood with an 53 percent black majority, with

slightly more “feeling comfortable.”)6

         Despite the popularity of the tipping model, there has been little in the way of

full-scale test of the tipping point hypothesis with nationwide data on American

metropolitan neighborhoods.7 The major exception is Card, Mas, and Rothstein 2008,

who use the same data as this paper (the data will be described next) and a regression

discontinuity design to test for racial tipping points based on the local stability of

intermediate points of minority share. They did find evidence of tipping at relatively low

levels of minority share. Their methodology has the important advantage that they can

derive from the data a different tipping point for each metropolitan area, allowing for

different sensitivity to minority share across metropolitan areas. This paper (whose first

version preceded Card et al.) differs from Card et al by estimating the global dynamics of

tipping based on initial racial composition. To accommodate the highly non-linear

prediction of the Schelling model, I estimate the change in white share as a function of a

fourth-order polynomial of initial white share. I first assume that the tipping point is the

same in all neighborhoods, and then will allow tipping points to vary parametrically with

other neighborhood characteristics. These two different methodologies allow for testing

6
  Charles 2001, pp. 233-237
7
  Aaronson (2001) and Ellen (2000) also run regressions for neighborhood dynamics using census tract data
from 1970 to 1990, but they do not explicitly test the tipping point hypothesis. Both have indirect results
that tend to indicate stability of neighborhood racial composition, which would be in line with this paper’s
conclusions.
                                                                                             6

of different predictions of the tipping model – the model has predictions both for local

instability and for global dynamics. The Card et al. approach economizes on assumptions

about parametric forms, however it does so at the cost of being only a test of local

instability. Local instability is necessary but not sufficient for confirmation of the tipping

model. The advantage of this paper’s approach is that it tests also the global dynamics

predictions that are also required to confirm the tipping story.

       These tests have become feasible thanks to the availability of a new database from

the Urban Institute and a firm called Geolytics.com, which matches census tract

information from the U.S. censuses for 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. This is called the

Neighborhood Change Data Base (NCDB). The database covers metropolitan areas; it

does not include rural areas.

       This database confirms that American neighborhoods continue to be highly

segregated in the year 2000, despite some decrease in segregation and despite years of

rhetoric and legal action in favor of integration. Nonwhites made up 28 percent of the

sample population in the NCDB in 2000. Blacks make up 14 percent of the sample

population. If each neighborhood were a random draw of whites and nonwhites, with the

probability of drawing a nonwhite = .28, the odds against a neighborhood nonwhite share

of less than 10 percent would be astronomical. Yet 35 percent of all census tracts had

nonwhite shares less than 10 percent. Similarly, the probability that a nonwhite would

live in a neighborhood where the nonwhite share exceeds 50 percent would be extremely

low if the population were distributed randomly. Yet the median black lived in a

neighborhood that was 52 percent black. The Tauber dissimilarity index, a widely used

indicator of segregation, was .53 in the year 2000 for America as a whole (the index
                                                                                                        7

ranges from 0 if nonwhites are evenly distributed across neighborhoods to 1 if whites and

nonwhites are completely segregated). The index can be interpreted as the fraction of

either whites or nonwhites that would have to move to achieve even distributions of racial

groups across neighborhoods.8 I do not attempt in this paper to cover the rich literature on

the historical and modern mechanisms determining racial segregation; I am just doing a

test of one particular model of segregation.9

        Of great relevance for the tipping point hypothesis, changes in neighborhoods

from majority white to majority nonwhite are common in the dataset. Of the 41,321

urban census tracts in the NCDB that have data for both 1970 and 2000, 3965

neighborhoods had a drop in white share of .5 or greater from 1970 to 2000. Thus nearly

10 percent of the neighborhoods in the sample changed drastically from majority white to

majority nonwhite over these 30 years. A weaker definition of tipping, the change from

any white majority in 1970 to a nonwhite majority in 2000, reveals 14 percent of the

neighborhoods tipped during this 30 year period.

        This paper uses this database to conduct tests of some of the predictions of the

Schelling “tipping point” model. It will ask the fundamental question of whether the high

degree of segregation observed in American neighborhoods is a consequence of the

dynamic instability of intermediate points due to strategic interdependence, with only

weak preferences for living next to your own racial group.

2. Schelling’s model

       Schelling’s model is simple and elegant. Suppose that whites’ preferences for

neighborhood segregation between whites and blacks can be summarized as follows:

each white individual j has an individual-specific preference to live in a neighborhood

that has at least wj percent of whites. If white individual j finds himself in a neighborhood

containing less than wj percent of whites, then he will exit the neighborhood. As long as

the neighborhood contains more than wj percent of whites, then individual j will stay in

the neighborhood. Whites have diverse preferences for racial segregation ranging from

integrationist to segregationist, which can be summarized by a cumulative density

function increasing from zero to one over wj from zero to one. Thus, the cumulative

density function gives us the percent of whites that have an wj less than or equal to w.

The CDF therefore shows the percent of whites that will live in a neighborhood that is w

percent white – it is all those who have an wj less than or equal to w.

       To relate the CDF to the whites who desire to live in the neighborhood as a

fraction of the neighborhood population, one set of assumptions consistent with his

model is that whites have a right of first refusal on the homes in any neighborhood – so

all the homes are offered to a representative sample of whites, F(w) of whom accept. The

remainder of homes are then occupied by non-whites. Hence F(w) also gives the ratio of

whites desiring to live in the neighborhood to the total neighborhood population.

       Note that Schelling’s basic model assumes the outcome is entirely driven by

whites’ preferences. This assumption is debatable (and perhaps even offensive), but it

reflects the traditional view of neighborhood segregation as mainly driven by whites’

behavior. It could be justified by saying that whites have stronger preferences about
                                                                                              9

getting their preferred racial composition than nonwhites, and hence will pay more to live

in their preferred neighborhood (note that the basic Schelling model does not have any

role for housing prices). Schelling actually did a version of the model that also

incorporated nonwhites’ preferences for neighborhood composition, but it has not caught

on like the original model and it did not dramatically change the predictions of the model.

       The point where the cumulative density function crosses the 45 degree line is

where the fraction of whites willing to live in a neighborhood that is w percent white is in

fact equal to w:

   (1) w = F(w)

This is an equilibrium outcome for racial composition of the neighborhood; there will be

more than one such point since CDFs satisfy F(0)=0 and F(1)=1. The tipping point story

only makes sense if (1) also holds for an intermediate point between 0 and 1.

       The dynamics of the white share can be specified by giving the change in white

share as the distance between the CDF and the 45 degree line.

   (2) Δw = F(w) – w

This is the equation that will actually be estimated in the empirical section, using a very

flexible fourth order polynomial.

   Now suppose also that (3) holds.

   (3) F’(w) >1 evaluated at a point strictly less than 1 and strictly greater than 0 where

       (1) holds.

If (3) holds, then one of the points where (1) holds is an unstable equilibrium. In other

words, (1) and (3) define a tipping point. Any w above this point will spiral upwards
                                                                                                       10

towards greater segregation of mostly white neighborhoods, and any w below it will

show white flight and more segregated black neighborhoods.10

        Suppose for illustration that the CDF is of the normal distribution with mean μ

and variance σ2, F(w;μ,σ2), For example, assuming just for illustration that μ=.75 and

σ=.1, Figure 1 shows the corresponding cumulative density function.

 (3) could hold at w=1, in which case w=1 is a tipping point. However, this is not what Schelling had in
mind, since he discusses a shift from a stable neighborhood above the tipping point.

                                                                                              12




        The CDF is highly nonlinear, with flat segments at either end but climbing steeply

in the middle. This reflects the characteristics of the normal distribution, with flat tails but

steep increases in the number of individuals contained in the middle. The actual fraction

of whites who live in the neighborhood is given by the 45 degree line.

        Note that the tipping point is a higher fraction of whites w than the mean of the

normal distribution of white preferences. For example, in the figure the equilibrium point

is .86, while the mean of the normal distribution was .75. Any mean of the normal

distribution greater than .5 cannot be an equilibrium or a tipping point, because only .5 of

whites are willing to live in the neighborhood with the mean of the normal distribution

for fraction of whites. The tipping point always lies above the mean in this case.

        If there is a disturbance to a neighborhood in the vicinity of the tipping point such

that a few whites leave the neighborhood or a few nonwhites enter and the white share

drops below equilibrium, then the fraction of whites willing to live in the neighborhood

falls below the actual share. There is a further decrease in white share, and yet a further

white exodus. This process does not stop until the neighborhood becomes completely

nonwhite – a white share of 0 is a stable equilibrium. The neighborhood has “tipped”

from being majority white to completely nonwhite.

        Conversely, any deviation of the white share above the equilibrium will lead to a

fraction of whites willing to live in the neighborhood that is greater than the actual share.

This will cause the white share to increase. A new equilibrium is not reached until the

cumulative density function intersects the 45 degree line from above. In the diagram, this

happens at a white share of about .992. Hence, the remarkable outcome of Schelling’s
                                                                                             13

model is that the long run equilibrium is for neighborhoods to be either entirely nonwhite

or 99.2 percent white, despite the preferences of the median white for a mixed

neighborhood that is 75 percent white and 25 percent nonwhite.

        Although the tipping point idea is linked historically to racial scare-mongering

about the “threat” of nonwhites moving into the neighborhood, Schelling’s contribution

actually gives quite a different perspective on racial segregation. The point of Schelling’s

model was that the strategic interdependence of weak preferences for living next to

people of the same race could lead to an outcome of almost total segregation. Suppose a

small increase in nonwhites around the tipping point of a neighborhood with high white

share directly causes only the most racist white to exit the neighborhood. However, the

departure of the most racist white causes a further decrease in white share, which now

leaves the second-most racist white uncomfortable with fewer white neighbors, and he

also leaves. (I do not mean to imply that people have to move sequentially and gradually,

this is just for illustration.) This in turn leaves the third most racist white discomfited, and

he leaves. So things keep unraveling until even relatively integrationist whites wind up

exiting, until the whole neighborhood tips over, all because of an initial small increase in

nonwhites that only directly bothered the most racist white. This contrasts with the view

that segregation reflects whites having a very strong preference for having white

neighbors. Hence a test of Schelling’s model is a test of whether residential segregation

simply reflects the interaction of what could be weak average preferences for same-race

neighbors. The alternative is that segregation is something more fundamental driven by

other factors.
                                                                                               14

        In figure 1, the fall in white share is dramatic below the tipping point, reflecting

the rapid movement through the fat part of the normal distribution of the wj. This accords

well with the classic story of tipping as a rapid exodus of whites out of the neighborhood

once tipping begins. However, we have no evidence that the distribution is normal or any

other distribution, and the prediction of very rapid exodus comes out of some

distributions and not others. A CDF could be much closer to the 45 degree line below the

tipping point and still satisfy conditions (1) through (3).

        In general, some CDFs do not fit the classic “tipping point” narrative, even

though they have tipping points. For example, think of a simple distribution where there

are only three discrete groups of whites, each containing one-third of the white

population. The first has a wj of 0.3, the second of 0.6, and the last of 0.9. This would

generate the CDF shown in Figure 2. This CDF features no less than 4 stable equilibria

(zero white, minority white, majority white, and all white) and 3 tipping points. Tipping

is a relatively more modest affair between these stable equilibria, and each group has a

neighborhood close to their preferences, in contrast to the massive reversal and difference

between preferences and outcomes in the normal distribution tipping story. The classic

tipping story relies on a distribution of whites who are fairly similar to one another and

thus vulnerable to chain reactions; more heterogeneity of preferences leads to more stable

outcomes closer to preferences. The advantage of this paper’s methodology in

estimating the entire distribution (2) is that it allows for the “classic” tipping point story

to be compared to two alternatives: (a) there are no tipping points, and (b) there are

tipping points but the CDF does not fit the “classic” global tipping story. The Card et al.

2008 approach, in contrast, can only rule out (a), not (b).

       One last set of considerations when taking the model to the data is considering the

overall outcome. When whites exit a neighborhood that is tipping nonwhite, where do

they go? Obviously, they would go to a neighborhood with a higher white share, and so

they become part of those neighborhoods that are tipping towards greater white share.

       However, note that the Schelling model is not a general equilibrium model. There

is no adding up constraint to enforce that the population-weighted average of

neighborhoods’ white share be equal to the system-wide share of whites in the

population. Because all neighborhoods are subject to random shocks of varying intensity,

the Schelling model does not place any restrictions on how many of the neighborhoods

will be in the segregated nonwhite equilibrium or in the higher segregated white

equilibrium. Hence, one cannot reject a particular estimated tipping point on the grounds

that it is inconsistent with overall white share.
                                                                                                       16

        However, other possible estimated outcomes of equation (2) could be inconsistent

with overall population structure. If (2) shows a globally stable intermediate equilibrium

which is different than the overall white share, then that does violate adding up

constraints. Similarly, if the estimated equation (2) implies a dynamic structure in which

all neighborhoods converge to all-white (or all-nonwhite), then that would also obviously

violate the adding up constraint. Such violations would call into question that what has

been estimated is in fact a global dynamic structure, as opposed to a relationship between

initial white share and predicted changes in white share (which could be one time

changes) that are explained by other stories besides the Schelling model.

3. The data

        The database used in this analysis was originally called the Underclass Database

(UDB). It was put together for 1970, 1980, and 1990 by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan

think tank in Washington DC. Given the interests of the Institute, the data covered

metropolitan neighborhoods (where “metropolitan” is defined as in the census to include

central city, inner suburbs, and outer suburbs). The database has been updated to include

the 2000 census by a commercial firm called Geolytics Inc.11 The unit of analysis in the

database is the census tract, a division meant to approximate a “neighborhood”, usually

containing between 2500 and 8000 people. The tract boundaries are chosen to capture

neighbors with similar social characteristics (which means that measures of segregation

based on tract data will tend to exaggerate segregation). Tract boundaries do not cross

county, metropolitan area, or state boundaries.12



11
   The new database is available on CD-ROM from geolytics.com. The description of the data contained
here is based on the NCDB Data User’s Guide, including Appendix J on tract matching.
12
   Except in New England, some tracts cross metropolitan area boundaries.
                                                                                              17

       There are several difficult issues surrounding the data construction. Of those tracts

that have data for both 1970 and 2000, two-thirds changed boundaries. Some tracts were

merged into a single tract, and some single tracts were divided into multiple tracts.

Unfortunately, in the majority of tract changes, there are boundary changes that are not

simple mergers or divisions of existing tracts. The constructors of the database addressed

this problem in several different ways, depending on what data was available for different

census years. They used geographic information software (GIS) to overlay 2000 tract

boundaries on earlier tract boundaries. They then used 1990 block data to estimate the

proportion of the old tracts in various racial categories that went into the new tract, and

then recalculated the 1990 tract data using the 2000 tract boundaries.

       Block data located spatially were not available for 1970 and 1980. The 1980 tracts

were matched to the 1990 tracts and 1970 tracts matched to 1980 tracts using Census

Bureau information on tract correspondence based only on spatial changes in tract

boundaries. Hence, the 1970 and 1980 tract matching to 1990 and 2000 is less accurate

than the tract matching between 1990 and 2000.

       The database includes an indicator of which tracts changed boundaries. The use of

the full sample could be justified if we think any errors introduced by boundary changes

are random, i.e. uncorrelated with the right hand side variables in my regressions below.

However, I will run a robustness check of my results by running them on the sub-sample

which did not change boundaries between 1970 and 2000.

       Some 2000 tract boundaries include areas that were not covered at all by 1970

data. As long as the covered area is a random sample of the whole tract, with the error

term uncorrelated with the 1970 white share, the use of the full sample could still be
                                                                                                             18

justified. Nevertheless, I will run another robustness check by omitting these observations

from the sample.

         Census data has the commonly known problem that it undercounts the population

because some people are harder to reach for enumeration. Of concern for our exercise,

the undercount is thought to be proportionally greater for nonwhite populations. The

undercount percentage has been falling over time. I do not have any solution to this

problem, but hope that it is of small enough magnitude not to distort the results. In 1990,

the Census estimated the overall undercount as 2 percent, down from 5 percent in 1950.

The undercount for blacks was estimated at 5.7 percent in 1990, an increase from 4.5

percent in 1980.13

         Table 1 shows the variable definitions and summary statistics. The sample is all

available data in the NCDB, which as I noted is mainly for metropolitan census tracts

(Map 1 shows the coverage of NCDB for 1970). Census tracts have a mean population in

1970 of 3,208 people. I eliminated any census tracts with a population of less than 100 in

either 1970 or 2000 from the sample so as to avoid extreme outcomes in very small

census tracts. The maximum population of census tracts in the sample is 31, 903 in 1970

and 36,146 in 2000.



13
   Another problem was that the 2000 census introduced a change in its racial classification methodology.
Racial classification is done by self-identification. In 2000, individuals were allowed to select more than
one race to describe themselves, in contrast to earlier years when they could only pick one. 2.4 percent of
respondents chose multiple races in 2000. To match 2000 data to earlier years, the NCDB creators used the
principle that anyone who selected a nonwhite category, even if it was in addition to white, would be
classified as nonwhite. Since this conforms to the social convention for defining nonwhites, which probably
influenced individuals’ self-classification in prior years, and since the number choosing multiple races is
small, I do not think this will overly distort the results. For some reason, the database authors violated this
rule only with Native Americans, who were counted as Native Americans only if they did not also choose
“white.” However, the proportion of Native Americans in the sample is small in any case. Other racial
issues arise with classifying Hispanics. “Hispanic” is a national origin classification, which is different than
racial classification. There is a category “other” in the racial classification, which in earlier work co-authors
and I have found to be strongly correlated with “Hispanic” (Alesina, Baqir, and Easterly 1999).

       Map 1: coverage of NCDB in 1970




       The restriction of the NCDB to metropolitan census tracts is fine for my purposes,

since the tipping model is mainly about urban neighborhoods.

4. Empirical testing 1970 to 2000

         Note from Table 1 that the mean white share declined considerably from 1970 to

2000, reflecting the faster growth of nonwhite population than white population in

metropolitan areas. While the white population only increased by 15% from 1970 to

2000, the nonwhite population nearly tripled over the same period. Both blacks and other

nonwhites shared in this rapid population increase. We could think of this influx of

nonwhite population as a natural experiment of the Schelling model – predicting that

neighborhoods in the vicinity of the tipping point would flip over to nonwhite majorities,

while neighborhoods well above the tipping point would have retained stable white

majorities.

4.1 Basic estimation

         Using the NCDB, I estimate dynamic equations for the change in white share as a

function of initial white share. I first assume that the tipping point is the same in all

neighborhoods, and then will relax that assumption. To accomodate the highly non-linear

prediction of the Schelling model, I estimate the change in white share as a function of a

fourth-order polynomial of initial white share.14 I test first the change in white share from

1970 to 2000, and then I will test the change over each decade. I will first assume that all

neighborhoods in the sample have the same tipping point, but shortly I will relax this

assumption. Table 2 shows the basic regression for this fourth-order polynomial. All of




14
  I experimented with a fifth-order polynomial also, but it did not make a difference to the shape of the
curve described below.
                                                                                                              21

the polynomial terms are significant, which does confirm the highly nonlinear dynamics

of the white share. 15

         The predicted change in white share for initial white share is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 does not have a tipping point (except for zero and unity as discussed below). We

would need some predicted increases in white share at a high enough initial share to get

an intermediate tipping point of the kind that Schelling had in mind. There is a large

predicted decrease in white share for all mostly white neighborhoods no matter how high

the initial white share. Only at very low values of white share is there a predicted increase

in white share. Hence, we fail to identify any such tipping point using the simple

structure of the Schelling model.


15
   This is somewhat different from the results of Ellen (2000) for change from 1980 to 1990, who did not
find the linear term for black share in 1980 to be significant in a regression for percent change in whites.
She specifies the relationship as quadratic, but did not find different results in a spline regression for black
share.

       We can reconstruct the implied CDF by adding w to the predicted dw for each w,

following the rigid assumptions of the Schelling model as specified above (i.e. we

assume that only the distribution of preferences for racial shares causes racial shifts, and

not any other factors). Figure 4 shows the implied CDF as a function of initial white

share. The implied estimated CDF has F(0) >0 and F(1) <1. F(0)>0 suggests that about 8

percent of whites have NO tipping point, they will not leave a neighborhood no matter

how low the share of whites. There is therefore a singularity at zero, shown here as a

vertical segment of the CDF. Zero is an unstable equilibrium. There will be a stable

equilibrium at a white share that includes the zero-tipping-point group and any other
                                                                                                                                                      23

whites with wj between zero and that stable equilibrium. This would cause any

neighborhood between zero and the low stable equilibrium to tip upward.16

        At the other extreme, there is also a singularity at unity, shown again as a vertical

segment of the CDF. This means that for 18 percent of whites, anything arbitrarily close

to 1 from below is a tipping point; they will exit if even a single black moves into the

neighborhood. When we consider the historical anecdotes of extreme aversion to

integrated neighborhoods, this is not completely implausible, although it would be more

surprising that such extreme segregationist preferences still exist today among a


16
  Taken literally, we have the paradoxical implication that 8 percent of whites want to live in a
neighborhood with no whites! Being less literal so that we consider neighborhoods with an epsilon share of
whites as being arbitrarily close to zero, this just suggests that some group of whites residing in a
neighborhood will never exit even if they are the only remaining white in the neighborhood.
                                                                                                       24

nontrivial share of whites. Note that this extreme literalist implication would hold for any

negative predicted change at an initial white share of 1. More likely than this extreme

implication, some other factors probably cause all white neighborhoods to have an

average decrease in white share.

        Thus the implied density curve from the initial estimates is very different from the

kind of density curve suggested by Schelling for the tipping point story. He thought in

terms of a bell curve around some mean high tipping point that was significantly less than

one, which meant that virtually no one had extreme tipping points (0 and 1). The

estimates above imply preferences that are very polarized with density spikes at 0 and 1.

        The problem with the estimated curve above is that there are no stable equilibria

with high white share; the only stable equilibrium has a very low white share far below

the average share of whites in the population and thus violates an adding up constraint in

the long run. We will explore next whether this problem can be fixed by allowing the

tipping point to vary continuously with other neighborhood characteristics.

        So far the initial results do not support Schelling’s “tipping point” story as an

explanation for neighborhood dynamics from 1970 to 2000 (although Schelling’s story

could have explained neighborhood dynamics for pre-1970 periods) . The pattern does

suggest that segregation was diminishing from 1970 to 2000, as neighborhoods with high

white shares had the biggest drop in those shares. This is confirmed by the aggregate

statistics: while the Tauber dissimilarity index for nonwhites was 0.53 in 2000, it had

been 0.75 in 1970.17 Decreasing segregation by itself does not prove or disprove the

tipping model. If there had been a tipping point, there still could have been some

17
  Cutler, Glaeser, and Vigdor 1999 also present evidence that segregation declined from 1970 to 1990, as
does Ellen (2000).
                                                                                            25

decreased segregation as many mostly white neighborhoods had a fall in white share as

they were in the process of tipping over to a nonwhite neighborhood, in response to the

influx of nonwhites. However, neighborhood change did not follow the dynamics of

tipping, in which some segregated white neighborhoods remained stable or showed an

increase in white share. Instead a high degree of “white flight” happened in all

neighborhoods with high initial white shares.

4.2 Allowing tipping points to vary across cities and neighborhoods

       The models estimated so far were restricted in that the dynamics (and the

potential tipping point) was assumed to be equal in all neighborhoods in the sample.

Another logical step is to allow for differences across the 202 metropolitan areas in the

sample. I put metro dummies, allowing the intercepts to vary. At the average intercept for

the metro areas, the shape of the curve is little different from figure 2. The intercept does

vary considerably across metro areas, from a low of -.045 (Albany, Georgia) to a high of

0.297 (Johnson City-Kingsport-Bristol, Tennessee). Johnson City, Tennessee is the

ONLY metro area with a tipping point, as shown in Figure 4.

       I next consider other control variables that allow the tipping point to be different

in different neighborhoods as a continuous function of these variables. The two most

important candidate variables are income and population density, as rich neighborhoods

may be more stable and have lower tipping points than working class neighborhoods, and

dense inner city neighborhoods may have a higher tipping point than less dense suburban

neighborhoods. Hence, I also introduce the log of initial population density as a control

for change in white share.

       Table 3 also shows the regression of change in white share on these right hand

side variables. All of the polynomial terms for initial white share are still highly

significant. The population density variable is significant with an extremely high t-
                                                                                             27

statistic, which (with the polynomial estimated) suggests a higher tipping point the lower

is population density. (I also tried estimating separate polynomials for the central city

sample and for the sample in the suburbs, but it made little qualitative difference in the

results described here.) Family income is also very significant, suggesting the tipping

point goes up with income (again for the estimated polynomial). All variables together

have decent explanatory power for such a noisy variable in a large sample, with an R-

squared of .226. Of course, there could be alternative explanations for the effect of

income and density rather than thinking of them only as changing tipping points. As an

alternative to the tipping story in general, the higher white flight out of denser, lower

income neighborhoods could reflect a large explanatory power for the “white

suburbanization” hypothesis for changing white share.

       Figure 5 shows the shape of the relationship between initial white share and

change in white share at mean values of population density and family income, and then

considers shifts in income and density. At the mean values, the curve in Figure 5 looks

similar to Figure 3 except with a higher stable equilibrium at a white share of around 0.2.

This curve has all the same problems as the curve in Figure 3, as the stable equilibrium

white share is inconsistent with the share of whites with mean income and population

density.

                    Figure 5 shows how the curve would look if the initial log population density

           were two standard deviations below its mean, and in addition, the log family income were

           two standard deviations above its mean. While we do get a predicted increase in white

           share at high initial values of white share, the large shifts in income and density mean

           that we are describing only a very tiny part of the sample: 6 out of 41,865 neighborhoods

           to be precise. For this miniscule set, we get an unstable “tipping point” equilibrium at a

           white share of around .97, but even this is far from the large tipping over to majority

           nonwhite envisaged by the tipping point hypothesis. The drop in white share is fairly
                                                                                            29

modest below .97 and there is a stable equilibrium at a white share of around .7. Below

.7, there is a predicted increase of white share which becomes quite large at low initial

white share. Note that the singularity at zero has an even higher share of whites (above 40

percent) who have no tipping points. For the (mostly out of sample) “rich and spacious”

neighborhoods there are two stable equilibria: 100 percent white share and 70 percent

white share.

       The adding up constraint is not automatically violated as long as all such

neighborhoods have a total share of whites above 70 percent. Anything above this could

be consistent with some indeterminate number of neighborhoods at 100 percent white

share. This seems much more plausible than the other estimated curves, and there is

something of a tipping point story, but these neighborhoods are not the ones that will tip

over to majority nonwhite and so do not really fit the original tipping point story.

       To sum up, even controlling for density and income, we do not see anything like

the kind of dynamic behavior of neighborhoods predicted by the tipping point model.

4.3 Further robustness checks

       One issue that obviously follows from the white suburbanization hypothesis is

that there is a high degree of spatial correlation in the data. A central city neighborhood

with a declining white share is not independent of its neighbors, who also often turn out

to be neighborhoods with declining white share. If the assumption of independence was

violated, as seems certain, that would imply that the standard errors and hence t-statistics

were incorrectly estimated in the regressions above.

       Hence, I run another set of regressions with clustered standard errors. I use three

different definitions of clustering. First, each zip code typically contains a handful of
                                                                                                          30

census tracts, and so correcting for clustering by zip code will take into account very

local spatial dependence.18 This yields 8227 clusters. Second, it may be as suggested by

the suburbanization hypothesis that tracts in high density and low density areas of each

metropolitan area behaved similarly to other tracts in those same areas. Hence, I define a

new set of groups that are first broken down by metropolitan area, and then broken down

into tracts above median density and those below median population density for the

whole sample. This second method yields 404 clusters (i.e. 202 metropolitan areas, with

low and high density areas in each one). A third method aims at capturing the same idea

with jurisdictional boundaries – whether the tract lies in the central city or the suburbs for

each metropolitan area.

         Another robustness check I perform is to enter the dummies for metropolitan

areas at the same time as the income and density terms. Finally, I omit observations that

may be questionable for reasons described in the data section. There are two types of

problematic observations: 1) those in which the 1970 data apply to only part of the area

contained in the 2000 tract boundaries, and 2) those in which the tract definition changed

from 1970 to 2000. Note that 1) is a subset of 2). 1) is the most problematic kind of tract

change, because there is simply missing information on a part of the tract for the year

1970. For other tract changes, there was an attempt by the database builders to map from

the old tract data to the new tract boundaries, as described in the data section above.




18
  Zip code boundaries are independent of census tract boundaries, so they will split some tracts into 2
different zip codes. The tract is assigned to the zipcode that accounts for the majority of the tract.

The results of clustered standard errors are shown in Table 3. The t-statistics do fall

drastically, especially on the population density variable, but also on the initial white
                                                                                                32

share. All variables remain significant at the 1% level, however. The results (Table 3) are

also qualitatively similar with metropolitan dummies, with the plot for predicted change

in white share much the same as in figure 3.

        Table 3 also shows what happens when observations falling under either 1) or 2)

are eliminated. All of the variables are still statistically significant in the smaller, more

reliable samples. The coefficients are relatively unchanged for the sample that omits

observations in which 1970 data did not cover the whole 2000 tract. The coefficients do

change quite a bit in the restricted sample with no tract redefinitions at all. However, the

picture of the predicted changes in white share looks qualitatively similar with these

coefficients to that shown in figure 3.

        I next consider a more extensive set of ancillary variables: percent of population

under 18, percent over 65, percent of population who are homeowners, and percent of

tract located in the central city. These additional variables are chosen based on what the

previous literature considered; I did not do any searching among alternative sets of

variables. All of the additional variables are significant, except for percent of population

under 18, with intuitive signs. However, they do not alter the coefficients on white share

very much and the shape of the curve with these variables is similar to that shown in

figure 3. As with the earlier exercise with income and density, a positive or negative sign

on these variables can be interpreted as a positive or negative shift of the tipping point

(for the estimated polynomial shape). So a higher share of population over 65 and share

of homeownership increases the tipping point, while an increase in the percent of the

neighborhood lying in the central city decreases the tipping point. The share of children

under 18 is not statistically significant.

       Using these additional variables, we could check how much of a shift is necessary

to give something like a tipping point story. If we shift all variables by x standard

deviations in the direction that would increase the tipping point, I choose the x that

produces a tipping story. X turns out to be about 1.4 (standard deviations). So
                                                                                                                                                                                                   34

neighborhoods that have higher income, lower density, higher share over 65, higher share

of homeowners, and lower share of neighborhood in central city, each by 1.4 standard

deviations compared to the mean, would have a tipping point (Figure 6). The tipping

point story is once again not fully matching the qualitative features of the Schelling

model, as the stable equilibrium is at about.75 white share, and the tipping point is

between .96 and .97. Unfortunately, this is an out of sample prediction, as there are no

neighborhoods out of 41,139 observations that satisfy all these criteria.

       A final robustness check is to regress the change in black share from 1970 to 2000

on a polynomial for initial black share in 1970. This tests whether the dynamics of

tipping are any different when we focus on blacks rather than all non-whites. The tipping

point hypothesis would imply a positive relationship between initial black share and

change in black share, peaking at an intermediate level of black share, before declining

mechanically because the maximum increase in black share possible is 1-initial black

share. The story would predict that neighborhoods with a black share below the tipping

point would have a fall in black share, with the tipping point where the curve crosses the

x-axis from below.

       The polynomial terms for initial black share are all significant (not shown). The

implied curve is shown in figure 7. The curve is the mirror image of the white share

dynamics in figure 3 above. The relationship between change in black share and initial

black share has only a small upward sloping portion. Over most of the range of black

share, the line is downward sloping – suggesting that neighborhoods are moving away

from the extremes of all black or all non-black, which is just the opposite of the tipping

prediction. The change in black share is much larger at low initial levels of black share

rather than at intermediate levels, contradicting the tipping point hypothesis.

5. Decade to decade changes in white share

       The results are similar when I look at the individual decade changes from 1970 to

1980, 1980 to 1990, and 1990 to 2000. Table 5 shows these three regressions.

Again, population density is by far the strongest predictor of change in white share. The

effect of initial family income is weak in the 1980 to 1990 regression and insignificant in

the 1990 to 2000 regression. The nonlinear terms for initial white share are significant,

but much less so than density. The following figures show the dynamic curves for each

regression, comparing the curve at mean log population density with that with density

1.96 standard deviations below the mean, and then both density and income 1.96 standard

deviations away from the mean. The curves are quite different from one decade to the

next, but none of them fit comfortably with the picture predicted by the tipping point

model. At mean density and income, all of them show the highest predicted drop in white

share to be at high initial levels of white share rather than the intermediate levels (Figure

8 a,b,c).

There are multiple equilibria for some low values of density in these graphs, but the

lower stable equilibrium is one with a mixed neighborhood. At mean density, all of the

neighborhoods with high white share show a decline in white share, with only a modest

trough at intermediate values of the white share. (The curvature in this zone is consistent

with the predictions of the normal CDF for preferences, but we do not find a tipping point

except at low density.)

                                               The curve for changes from 1990 to 2000 comes the closest to fitting the tipping

model. At low density, the stable equilibria are a white share equal to one, and a white

share equal to about .4. This captures the idea that neighborhoods could tip from

homogeneous white neighborhoods to minority white neighborhoods. However, the

lower equilibrium of .4 is much higher than in the typical view of the tipping point. And

the tipping point itself is implausibly high – any white share less than .99 will tip over to
                                                                                            41

the minority white neighborhood. While providing some support for the tipping point

view, these parameters do not portray a very plausible tipping story.

       It would be nice to have data from earlier decades to assess tipping. It may be, as

the survey evidence suggests, that whites’ behavior and attitudes have changed in the

course of the 20th century. It is possible that “tipping” is a good description of

neighborhood change before 1970. Unfortunately, we do not have the data to assess this

conjecture.

6. Conclusions

       Although a significant fraction (about 10 percent) of the sample of urban

American neighborhoods did change from majority white to majority nonwhite over 1970

to 2000, they did not do so as the “tipping point” hypothesis suggests. The main factor in

neighborhood change was arguably a movement of whites from central cities and inner

suburbs to outer suburbs in metropolitan areas. The relationship between change in white

share and the initial white share does not fit the “tipping point” model. In this dataset, the

dynamics of neighborhood composition do not suggest the instability of strategic

interdependence as modeled by Schelling. This result differs from the results of Card et

al. (2008), who found locally unstable tipping points in an approach that attractively

economized on any assumptions about functional forms. However, these locally unstable

equilibria are only necessary conditions, not sufficient ones to confirm the tipping story

(recall Figure 2’s demonstration of multiple unstable equilibria in a form that did not fit

the normal tipping narrative). The tipping story also makes predictions about the global

dynamics of racial share, which this paper finds to be contradicted by the data, using as

flexible a parametric form for such dynamics as possible.
                                                                                             42

        Models of strategic interdependence are very slippery creatures to test. It could be

that there were other long-run factors not captured by the empirical analysis that

determined changes in white share, and that conditional on these other factors there was

still strategic interdependence that would lead to tipping. I have sought in the robustness

checks to explore some of the obvious candidates (which also allow tipping points to be

heterogeneous based on these other factors), but the list of possible third factors is

endless. I can only say that the simplest tests of the tipping model, conditional on the

seemingly most obvious third factors, fail to confirm the model.

        Schelling’s model remains a classic theoretical milestone for understanding

instability of interdependent behavior. Perhaps we need to distinguish two intellectual

tasks: (1) the theoretical demonstration that massive tipping could occur through strategic

interaction despite only weak preferences for same-race neighbors, and (2) the empirical

explanation of segregated neighborhoods. Schelling’s tipping point model remains a

masterpiece as far as task (1). It is not so surprising that it is, however, too simple to

actually do task (2), i.e. explain the patterns of neighborhood change in the real world.

These empirical results should induce some caution as to the widespread use of the

phrase “tipping point” as a sufficient explanation for real world segregation outcomes.
