          TAXING INTERNATIONAL INCOME: AN ANALYSIS OF THE U.S. SYSTEM
                            AND ITS ECONOMIC PREMISES


                                       ABSTRACT




      This paper describes the basic U.S. legal rules that govern the

taxation of international transactions and explores the economic

policies or principles they reflect.     Particular attention is paid to

the changes made by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, but it is impossible to

understand the 1986 Act changes without placing them in the context of

the general taxing system applicable to international transactions.        The

exposition is intended to be intelligible to readers with either legal

or economic training.
