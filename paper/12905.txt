                                             ABSTRACT

This paper investigates the salient diabetes prevalence patterns across key SES indicators, and how
they changed over time. The investigation spans both the conventional concept of diagnosed diabetes
and a more comprehensive measure including those whose diabetes is undiagnosed. By doing so,
I separate the distinct impact of covariates on disease onset, better self-management, and the probability
of disease diagnosis. Emphasis is given to SES correlates of undiagnosed diabetes and how these changed
as those with undiagnosed diabetes plummeted over the last 25 years. I estimate the differential ability
by education to successful self-manage diabetes, especially when disease self-management became
more complicated.

          Diabetes is a serious illness that deals with the body’s inability to produce (Type 1) or
regulate (Type 2) insulin which controls the level of glucose in the blood. Diabetes prevalence
rises rapidly with age, is believed to be increasing rapidly over time,1 and prevalence is
apparently particularly high among Americans.2 The consequences of diabetes can be quite
severe, including heart and kidney disease, poor circulation occasionally resulting in amputation
of limbs, vision problems with blindness a possibility, a diminished quality of life, and premature
death.1
          Diabetes may not be an equal opportunity disease. Research has indicated that the
incidence and prevalence of diabetes is much more common among those at the bottom of
several alternative prominent SES markers, such as education and income, as well as for
America’s principal ethnic and racial minorities- African-Americans and Hispanics.
          In this paper, I investigate several dimensions of the SES gradient with diabetes. These
include the salient prevalence patterns across these key indicators of SES and especially the way
those patterns have been changing over time. My investigation spans both the conventional
concept of diagnosed diabetes, a more comprehensive measure that includes within it those
whose diabetes is as yet undiagnosed, and a measure that excludes those whose diabetes is under
control. By doing so, I am able to separate the distinct impact of covariates on disease onset,
better self-management, and the probability of disease diagnosis. Special emphasis is given in
the research to SES correlates of undiagnosed diabetes and how these changed as the fraction of
the American population with undiagnosed diabetes plummeted over the last twenty-five years. I
also summarize results about the differential ability of those of different education groups to
successful self-manage their diabetes, especially during a time span when disease self-
management became more complicated.


METHODS
Data
          In this research, I will use various waves of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES). These waves include what I will label NHANES IV, which
took place during the years 1999-2002, NHANES III, fielded during 1988-1994, and NHANES
II, implemented in all years in the 1976-1980 interval. These series of NHANES contain data
obtained through personal interviews, physical exams, and lab tests. All data are available for



                                                    1
adults ages 25-70, the age span studied in this analysis. Details of the specific survey and
sampling procedures used can be found in the references cited for each of the NHANES.3,4,5,6
However, it is important to note that NHANES II over-sampled low income households while
the latter two NHANES over-sampled African-Americans and Hispanics. All tabular data
presented in this paper are weighted.
       In all waves, information is available on the self-reported prevalence of a wide variety of
illnesses including diabetes. Moreover, individual attributes including age, gender, race, marital
status, family income, education, and parental prevalence of diabetes are obtained from
individual interviews conducted during each annual wave. In particular, all variants of NHANES
collect data on individual self-reports of diabetes of the general form ‘Did a doctor ever tell you
that you had diabetes…’ Unfortunately, gestational diabetes, a significant component of diabetes
among women, is neither consistently included nor excluded in the NHANES over time and for
that reason this research will focus on men only.
       In addition to personal interviews, the key advantage of NHANES for this research is that
all waves contain data obtained both through physical tests and lab exams (blood, urine, and
swabs). Particularly relevant for research with a focus on diabetes, physical tests were
performed on height and weight so that BMI can be computed and with it an objective indicator
of whether or not the respondent is obese (BMI ≥ equal to 30) or overweight (BMI ≥ 25 and <
30). In addition, I separate the obese population into three groups- class 1 (≥ 30 and <35), class
2 (≥ 35 and < 40) and morbid (≥ 40).7
       The lab exam for diabetes in NHANES III and IV is a glycosylated hemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) test, a measure of the percent of hemoglobin molecules that are bound to glucose.
Although not usually a screener for diabetes, HbA1c is highly correlated with fasting plasma
glucose levels8,9. While there is no strict diagnosis threshold value, I follow the standard
convention by using values greater than or equal to 6.5% as indicating clinical diabetes. My
principal results are not sensitive to the specific threshold chosen.
       NHANES II relied instead on fasting glucose. For NHANES II, I defined clinical
diabetes using a classification of the Oral Glucose Challenge/Tolerance Test (OGTT) results
developed by NHANES. The OGTT involves measurement of plasma glucose concentrations in
the fasting state, and cut by whether the fasting level is 140 milligrams per deciliter or more.




                                                  2
         Lab tests in HHANES II were not given to all sample participants, but only those
randomly selected for the blood tests. Additional respondents in NHANES II had to be excluded
from the clinical analyses since their tests results were not useable for a variety of reasons.
Consequently, sample sizes for analyses which rely on the lab test results are much smaller in
NHANES II compared to the other two surveys, limiting the analysis that can be conducted by
on lab results with this data.
        Finally, all versions of NHANES collect several health related behaviors, some of which
are thought to be significant ‘risk factors’ for diabetes. These risk factors include whether the
respondent ever smoked or is a current smoker, and the amount of physical exercise in which one
normally engages.
        The definition of exercise is not identical in the three waves. In NHANES IV respondents
are asked “Over the last 30 days, did you do any vigorous activities for at least 10 minutes that
caused heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rates? Some examples are
running, lap swimming, aerobics classes or fast bicycling.” In NHANES II respondents are asked
“In the things you do for recreation, for example, ports, hiking, dancing and so forth, do you get
much exercise, moderate exercise, or no exercise” – only much is counted as vigorous. In
NHANES III, you are asked how often over the last month you did a set of activities (walk a
mile, jog or run, bicycle, swim, aerobics, other dancing, calisthenics or other exercise, yard work,
lift weights. You were also asked what other (exercise, sports, or physically active hobbies)
activities you did in last month. An intensity rated scale is given to each activity. We examined
the intensity scales of activities counted as vigorous in NHANES III, and only activities in
NHANES III receiving that score or above are counted as vigorous exercise.
        These revisions create imprecision in the amount of real change in vigorous exercise over
time. However, these exercise variables provide the same threshold at a point in time so there
impact on the gradient can be ascertained. There is also relevant information about diet in
NHANES, which will be dealt with a latter version of this paper.


Measures of SES
        The principal measure of SES used is years of education. In all waves, I divide men into
three education groups- less than a high school education, a high school education, and more
than a high school education. This is the only measure of schooling available from NHANES IV



                                                  3
and for reasons of comparability education is defined similarly in the other waves. For some of
the analyses using NHANES II and III, I separate college graduates from those with 13-15 years
of schooling in the highest schooling group. This division is not yet possible in NHANES IV.
        Since income is crudely measured in NHANES with annual family income categorized
into relatively few brackets at the top, NHANES is certainly not the data source to conduct a
detailed investigation of the role of income. Instead, I divide total family income roughly three
equally sized groups or terciles. That goal produced income tercile cutoffs points of $35,000,
and $65,000 in NHANES IV, $25,000, and $50,000 in NHANES III, and $10,000, and $20,000
in NHANES II. Race and Hispanic ethnicity is ascertained from a self-report of respondents.


Statistical methods
        Combined, these series of NHANES allow one to monitor over a twenty-five year period
(both overall and by various SES measures) trends in diagnosed and actual diabetes. The
combination of biological measures alongside self-reports of disease prevalence also permits one
to track differential trends in undiagnosed diabetes, a central focus of this research. Age specific
diabetes prevalence is modeled as a function of indicators for race and ethnicity, a quadratic in
age, ever and current smoking, vigorous physical activity, overweight (BMI ≥ 25 and <30), the
three stages of obesity class 1 (≥ 30 and <35), class 2 (≥ 35 and < 40) and morbid (≥ 40), height
(in inches), and parental prevalence of diabetes (either the father or mother was a diabetic).
Probit models were used in estimation, but the main conclusions do not depend on the specific
statistical model chosen.
        As mentioned above, the measures of obesity, overweight, and height used are based on
physical exams of respondents and hence are free of the well-known types of measurement errors
associated with self-reports of these concepts. For each of the series of NHANES, comparable
models are estimated both for self-reports of diabetes prevalence as well as the more
comprehensive prevalence measure based on both self-reports and biological measurement. I
also estimate models estimating the probability of having undiagnosed diabetes and the
probability of successful diabetes management. Both of these analyses are conditioned on being
a diabetic.




                                                  4
RESULTS
       Table 1 documents trends in alternative measures of diabetes prevalence for all men 25-
70 years old as well as for major ethnic and racial groups separately. If we only examine self-
reports of diagnosed diabetes, the increase in prevalence among all men in this age group is
dramatic. For example, the fraction of men of all races who self-report being diabetic has well
more than doubled from 3.1% to 7.1%. Indeed, the absolute increase in the fraction of men
reporting that a doctor told them they were diabetic was larger than the initial proportion of
diagnosed male diabetes in the late 1970s. In the most recent NHANES used in this study, self-
reported male diagnosed diabetes is about one-third larger among African-Americans (8.4%) and
Hispanics (8.5%) compared to non-Hispanic White men (6.3%).
       If we examine instead the more comprehensive measure of prevalence obtained by
combining clinically evaluated with self-reported diagnosed diabetes, levels of male diabetes are
not surprisingly higher making this serious disease even more common with about one in every
eleven men in this age group afflicted between 1999 and 2002. At the same time, the observed
secular trends- while still real and significant- are also far less dramatic. For example, among
men of all races, overall diabetes prevalence rose over this period from 6% to 9%, a fifty percent
increase compared to more than a doubling when respondent reported diagnosed diabetes was
used earlier. The absolute percentage point increase in the comprehensive measure of diabetes
prevalence is 75% as large as the absolute percentage point increase in diagnosed diabetes. The
discrepancy in these two measures of diabetes prevalence is particularly large among African-
American and Hispanic men.
       The reason for the discrepancy is trends in the two alternative prevalence measures
results from the quite large decline in the fraction of male diabetics whose diabetes is
undiagnosed. Over these twenty-five years, rates of male undiagnosed diabetes fell sharply from
almost half to a little more than one in five. Especially during the 1990s, these declines in
undiagnosed diabetes were particularly large among Hispanic and African-American men.
       Table 1 also documents levels and trends some well established and prominent risk
factors associated with diabetes. Male heights increased by less than half an inch while mean
age was also relatively constant over time within this broad age group. The main exception to
this stagnant portrait was the very large expansion in the fraction of men who were obese. Male
obesity more than doubled over this period, growing from 13% to 28%. The increase in obesity



                                                 5
was particularly large among White Non-Hispanics as male rates of obesity converged over time
amongst the different ethnic and racial groups.
        Finally, secular trends in education are strongly positive. Between the late 1970s and
early 2000s, the fraction of men without a high school diploma fell from a third to a fifth.
Similarly, the percent of men who went beyond high school increased from 35% to 55% over
this period. There was a steady secular advance in the education accomplishments of all male
ethnic groups over time, which was only partially offset by the increased weight given to Latinos
as the numbers of Hispanic immigrants increased dramatically over this period.
        A central concern of this research involves understanding reasons for gradient of diabetes
with education and the manner in which that gradient has evolved over time. To set the
background, Table 2 provides a list of key outcomes stratified by my division of years of
schooling in each of the three sets of NHANES.
        Especially in recent years, there exists a pronounced negative gradient of diagnosed
diabetes prevalence with years of schooling. To illustrate, in NHANES IV 9.8% of men who
went behind high school had diagnosed diabetes compared to 6% of men who failed to obtain a
high school degree. In contrast, the education gradient in diagnosed diabetes in NHANES II is
more muted with the only real diagnosed prevalence difference taking place after high school
graduation.
        In fact, once we control for age, there essentially is no education gradient in diagnosed
diabetes in NHANES II. For example, among men ages 55-70, the fraction with diagnosed
diabetes are 6.4%, 6%, and 7.2%, among those with less than a high school degree, only a high
school degree, and more than a high school degree respectively. In all three sets of NHANES,
the education gradients appear to be much sharper in the more comprehensive and presumably
more accurate total prevalence measure.
        The other rows in Table 2 are suggestive about some possible reasons for the education
gradient and the manner in which it has evolved over time. Those in the lowest education group
are much more likely to be Latino or African-American, are less likely to engage in vigorous
physical exercise, are much more likely to smoke, and are more than an inch and a half shorter in
stature. All these gradients are reasonably steep. While the education gradient in % overweight
is essentially flat, there is a negative education gradient in the far more critical obesity, one that
becomes steeper as we move up the obesity categories toward the morbidly obese. Although the



                                                   6
percent with a parent who was a diagnosed diabetic does decline with education, the strength of
this relationship is very weak. This may suggest that the fundamental reasons for any education
gradient in male diabetes may not be largely genetic.
         Turn next to the risk factors associated with schooling that have changed the most over
time. First on that list would have to be the increasing fraction of Latinos in the lower education
groups. In NHANES IV, among men who were not high school graduates, one third were
Hispanics- in NHANES II the comparable fraction was ten percent. Today, more than half of
male non-high school graduates are either Latino or African-American- twice the rate in the late
1970s.
         Second prize goes to age. The cross-sectional negative relation between age and
schooling basically reflects the rate of cross cohort improvement in education. With the
slowdown in educational advancements over time, the age-education relation has basically
disappeared. For example, there was more than a nine year age difference between college
graduates and non-high school grads in NHANES II with less than a two year difference now. To
some extent, the initial education gradient with diabetes prevalence was simply picking up the
correlation with age, a point made above. The negative smoking gradient with education also
became much larger over time, but as we will see in the next section smoking behavior
apparently has little to do with the onset of diabetes.
         While rates of obesity have clearly risen over the last 25 years, there does not appear to
be any significant steepening of that gradient as obesity rates in all categories of obesity appear
to have risen at roughly similar rates. Education gradients in height and parental diabetes also
seem not to have been altered sharply over time.
         The data in Table 3 list by education, income, and ethnicity rates of undiagnosed diabetes
in each of the three sets of NHANES. Especially in NHANES III and IV, there exists a
pronounced negative gradient in those with undiagnosed diabetes across education and income
groups. For example, using NHANES III to illustrate the point, 38% of diabetics who have less
than a high school degree are not aware of their condition. The comparable fraction for those
who went past high school is only 21%. Overtime there has taken place a very pronounced
decline in the percent of diabetes that is undiagnosed diabetes falling from almost half to about
one fifth. These improvements in eliminating undiagnosed diabetes appear to be larger among
the more educated and to a lesser extent those with the most income. In sharp contrast, the huge



                                                  7
differentials in undiagnosed diabetes across racial and ethnic groups have for all practical
purposes been eliminated.


Model Estimates
       Table 4 contains estimates of diabetes prevalence models estimated or all three NHANES
waves. There are three alternative models of prevalence estimated in each wave, each of which
illuminates a different dimension of behavior related to prevalence. By including both diagnosed
and undiagnosed diabetes, the most comprehensive model of prevalence in the final two columns
estimates the relationship of covariates to the actual presence of diabetes in this population.
Because the two middle columns (labeled clinical) models the presence of diabetes above the
clinical threshold, the difference between the comprehensive and clinical models is that clinical
models exclude those respondents whose diabetes is under control. Thus the difference between
these two models is an indication of how co-variates affect good disease management. Since
some diagnosed diabetes were excluded from the NHANES lab tests, modeling clinical diabetes
only is not possible in NHANES II.
       Finally, the estimates in the first set of columns tell us about the relation of covariates to
diagnosed diabetes only. The difference between the estimated effects in the diagnosed and the
comprehensive prevalence models are indicative of the impact of covariates on the probability of
having undiagnosed diabetes. I will present more direct models of undiagnosed diabetes below.
Table 4 lists for each of the three types of prevalence models estimated partial derivatives
alongside the associated ‘z’ statistic for the estimated effect being different from zero. Robust
standard errors are used in all models.
       First examine estimated effects for the comprehensive measure of total diabetes. Even
after controlling for this set of personal attributes, diabetes prevalence is significantly higher
among both Latino and African-American men, but the estimated disparity is somewhat smaller
in the most recent NHANES especially for African-Americans. Not surprisingly, diabetes
prevalence increases with age, albeit at a decreasing rate. The probability of being a diabetic is
considerably higher if one of the respondent’s parents was also a diabetic. The extent to which
this strong generational transmission reflects common genetic influences or a shared family
social and environmental background is not knowable from these estimates alone.




                                                   8
        Being either overweight or obese raises the likelihood that one is a diabetic with the
estimated impact of obesity considerably larger than that of being overweight. Within the obesity
classification, the estimated effects increase as we move across the three stages of obesity with
very larges effects estimated for those who have a BMI ≥ 40. These estimated effects of
excessive weight are much stronger in the combined clinical-self report prevalence estimates, an
issue to which I will return below. Engaging in vigorous exercise is negatively associated with
diabetes, although the impact of this risk factor does not vary much depending on the definition
of diabetes prevalence. In none of the models does additional height (measured in inches) have
any systematic association with the probability of being a diabetic. Only in NHANES III is the
positive estimated impact of ever smoking statistically significant, but even this effect is negated
by past smoking cessation.
       Next examine some differential patterns that emerge across the three measures of
diabetes prevalence and consider first the difference between the diagnosed prevalence and total
prevalence models, which are indicative of the impact of co-variates on the probability of being
undiagnosed. Perhaps, the most systematic pattern is that estimated effects of excessive weight
are much larger in the total prevalence models, indicating that obesity is strongly negatively
correlated with the probability of being diagnosed. As mentioned above, these results also
suggest that race was associated with not being diagnosed but that its effect has been eliminated
over time.
       In addition to excessive weight, the variables whose estimated impacts differ the most
between the diagnosed and total diabetes prevalence are the two SES markers- education and
income. For both education and income, I estimate a more consistent and larger negative impact
on prevalence when the most inclusive definition of prevalence is used that includes undiagnosed
diabetes detected through the biological exams. Indeed, for years of schooling there exists no
statistically significant association with self-reported diagnosed diabetes prevalence conditional
on the other personal attributes included in the model. In contrast, the estimated effects of
education on prevalence are large and statistically significant when undiagnosed diabetes is
included in the prevalence computation. Especially for the middle income group, a similar
difference is found for the relationship with income between the self-report and inclusive
measure of prevalence.




                                                 9
       These differences in the estimated effects of an important sub-set of variables that include
the SES markers between the narrow and broad definitions of prevalence suggest the alternative
model that is contained in Table 5. This model represents the probability of being an
undiagnosed diabetic conditional on being a diabetic. This conditioning lowers sample sizes
considerably and thus makes obtaining statistical significance more difficult. Therefore these
models were estimated combing men and women- tests for differences by gender did not indicate
any significant differences between the male and female samples outside of an intercept shift.
Even after combining the sexes, samples sizes in NHANES II were too small for any meaningful
analysis so these models were only estimated for NHANES III and NHANES IV.
       A few additional co-variates were added to these models in addition to those contained in
the prevalence models. These include two measures meant to capture the extent of contact with
the medical system-whether one has health insurance and the last time one saw a doctor-one to 3
years and more than three years with one year or less the omitted category. To capture the
possible impact of misplaced self-perceptions, the difference between clinically measured and
self-reports of obesity is also included, a variable that is also interacted with an indicator variable
that one is clinical obese. Finally, an indicator for marriage was added, an effect that was
allowed to differ by gender.
       The covariates that do not appear to be related to conditional non-diagnosis are smoking
exercise, Hispanic ethnicity, marriage, mistaken BMI perceptions, and height. In NHANES III,
female diabetics were more likely to be diagnosed and the probability of not being diagnosed
increased with age- while still present, both patterns were not statistically significant in
NHANES IV.
       Given that doctors are trained to have a standard checklist to use to query patients for the
likelihood of a disease and that these checklists typically include familial disease histories, it is
not all surprising that in both waves of NHANES having a parent who is a diabetic reduces the
likelihood that diabetes is not diagnosed. Parental diabetes is the best predictor in these models
for diabetes prevalence and it is reassuring that it is taken into account in detection. However, the
second best predictor of diabetes prevalence is obesity and it appears not to be sufficiently taken
into account. In al three stages of obesity and in both NHANES waves, the obese are more likely
to be undiagnosed. Why this would be so is a bit of a mystery. One possibility is that the
evidence relating obesity to diabetes is more recent and there are (most surely unnecessary) lags



                                                  10
in implementation. Doctors may also discount signals that they see as the patients fault and
obesity may fall within that group.
       Duration of time since last contact with a physician is positively related to being
undiagnosed although the interpretation of this effect is somewhat problematic as diagnosis
induces additional physician visits. Health insurance appears not to be related to the probability
of diagnosis.
       These results suggest a declining significance of race in being diagnosed over this time
period. Race and ethnicity have been highlighted in NIH campaigns to reduce health disparities
in health outcomes including disease detection, and- at least based on these results- with some
success. In NHANES III, African-Americans were more likely to not have been diagnosed, a
result that is statistically significant. By NHANES IV, this disparity had disappeared.
       However, at the same time that race and ethnic disparities in diabetes diagnosis were
eliminated, disparities by education appeared. In NHANES IV, diabetics in the highest education
group are much more likely to be diagnosed- a statistically significant difference that was not
present in NHANES III. Health disparities appear in all sorts of ways, with race and ethnic
differences more easy to monitor in terms of patient attributes. Disparities across markers such as
education level are more difficult to monitor and perhaps easier to ignore or dismiss as an
underachieving patient problem. They are no less real. Finally, in neither of the two NHANES
waves was income a marker for undiagnosed disease.


Self- Management of Diabetes and the SES Health Gradient
       As explained above, a comparison of estimates of the models for total prevalence with
those for clinical prevalence in Table 4 provides some evidence of the determinants of successful
self-management of diabetes since the clinical measures excludes those diabetics whose lab
readings are below the clinical threshold. (These may also be false positives, a point to which I
return below). The clinical models are much closer to the total prevalence models than the
diagnosed diabetes models were so I turn to an alternative specification to identify the
determinants of successful disease management.
       Those with diagnosed diabetes whose clinical tests indicate levels that are below the
diagnosis threshold may be considered very successful in their disease management. Table 6
presents models of this form of successful disease management, once again estimated conditional



                                                11
on being a diabetic. These models include the same set of covariates as in the models for
undiagnosed diabetes in Table 5. The threshold for success is high in these models requiring
management that brings one below the diagnostic threshold. Thus, success will be a function not
only how one manages the disease but how far one is from the diagnostic threshold.
       These estimates indicate a significant shift in the determinants of successful self-
management between the NHANES III and NHANES IV. Besides race and age, the only
variables that appear to be statistically significantly related to successful disease management in
NHANES III are the length of time since the respondent saw a doctor (lowering the probability
of good self-management). By NHANES IV, however, two types of variables are associated with
successful self-management of diabetes. The first component reflects variables that measure
good personal behaviors in other ways. For example, better self-management is associated with
not currently smoking, not being overweight or obese as well as seeing a physician more often.
       In addition, both markers of SES-education and income- are positively associated with
good self-management of diabetes in NHANES IV. I interpret the emergence of these SES
gradients with successful self-management of diabetes as indicating an enhanced premium on
education as well as income in adopting and adhering to the new but complex treatments for
diabetes. New recommended treatment regimens for diabetes are quite complex and often require
high quality and persistent patient self-management on a daily basis, and not all patients will be
equally adept at complying. Extensive self-management is important, including frequent
monitoring of blood glucose levels, balancing dosages with food intake and physical activity,
prevention and treatment of hypoglycemia, monitoring timing and dosage of insulin injections,
and regular consultation with health care providers. While a greater tendency to have false
positives among the more educated, non-smokers and the non-obese could also explain these
patterns that seem a more unlikely mechanism.
       New treatments for diabetes are known to be efficacious but the treatment is complicated
and places great demands on a patient’s ability to self-monitor his condition. In an earlier study
with Goldman10, I used data from an important clinical trial—the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial (DCCT). In the DCCT patients with type 1 diabetes were randomized into
treatment and control groups. The treatment arm involved a quite intensive regimen where there
was very close self and external monitoring of blood glucose levels and encouragement of strict
adherence. In particular, patients in the treatment arm were seen weekly until a stable treatment



                                                12
program was achieved. While not insignificant, the treatment in the control arm consisted of a
more standard regimen and far less intrusive external monitoring of patients.
       Table 7 shows that prior to the intervention there were large differences across education
groups in several measures of good behavior at the study’s baseline. Whether it involved
checking blood, following insulin regimens, exercise, or smoking, those with less education were
not doing as well. Given these initial but unsurprising baseline differences by education in
adherence to good practice, we hypothesized that imposing a good behavior regimen—which is
essentially what the rigorous treatment regimen did—would impart more benefits to the less
educated who were having more problems with treatment to begin with.
       We used an objective health outcome measure in the DCCT—glycosolated hemoglobin,
which measures the amount of sugar binding to the blood. Higher levels indicated worse control.
The impact of enforcing a common treatment regime can be obtained by subtracting what
normally would occur (the control sample) with what took place under an enforced treatment
regimen (the treatment sample). The data in Table 8 demonstrate that while those in all
education groups benefited from being in the treatment arm, the benefits from enforced better
adherence relative to the control group were largest for the least educated (see the final row in
Table 8). Thus, a differential ability to adhere to beneficial albeit complicated medical regimens
appears to be one reason for the association between education and health outcomes for those
with diabetes.
       In our study, Goldman and I were also able to provide some evidence on why education
might matter for adherence. Two factors that did not matter in promoting better adherence were
household income or having a better memory. Alternatively, it does appear to be related to
higher-level aspects of abstract reasoning, part of which included the ability to internalize the
future consequences of current decisions.
       Additional research on why education matters so much in effective self-management
should receive high priority. One possibility is that the education experience itself has little to do
with it, but it is simply a marker for personal traits (reasoning ability, rates of time preference,
etc.) that may lead people to acquire more education and to be healthier. But education may not
be that passive. It may help train people in decision-making, problem solving, and adaptive
skills, forward looking behavior, all of which have pretty direct applications to a healthier life.
Education may well have biological effects on the brain, which result in improved cognitive



                                                  13
function and problem-solving ability some of which may impart benefits to choices made
regarding one’s health. This is similar to the argument that more active brain functioning when
younger pushes off the onset of dementia.


Explaining trends in Diabetes Prevalence


         My goal in this section is to isolate those factors most responsible for increasing diabetes
prevalence over time.11 Consider the impact of a single risk factor j. Let P(A) and P(B) be the
(predicted) diabetes prevalence rates in years A and B and let P ( A) − j and P ( B ) − j the predicted
prevalence in years A and B for the “counterfactual” situation that nobody suffers from this risk
factor j. P ( A) − P ( A) − j can be interpreted as the diabetes rate in year A due to that risk factor and
similarly for year B. This assignment of importance depends both on the risk factor prevalence and
on the sensitivity of the probability of diabetes to that risk factor (the corresponding coefficients). I
will separate them below.
         The difference in diabetes prevalence in the two years is:
P( B ) − P( A) = [ P( B ) − j − P ( A) − j ] + [ P( B ) − P ( B ) − j ] − [ P( A) − P( A) − j ]
The first term on the right hand side can be interpreted as the difference between diabetes prevalence
in the two years not due to the chosen risk factor. The sum of the second and third term is the part
due to the chosen risk factor. The latter two terms can each be further separated in a ‘prevalence’
effect (the percentage with the risk factor) and an ‘impact ’effect (the impact of the risk factor on
diabetes). We can write:

                                          NA ∑
          P( A) − P ( A) − j = 1                   {g ( xi , bA ) − g ( xi− j , bA )} =
                                             i∈A

         [∑ xij / N A ][     ∑           Δg ( xi , bA ) / ∑ xij ]
           i∈A             i∈A, xij =1                   i∈A


where g ( xi , bA ) is the probability of having the risk factor for an individual with characteristics xi

and parameter vector bA .

         The first factor is the fraction in year A that suffers from the chosen risk factor (the
“quantity effect” for year A). In the second term, Δg ( xi , bA ) is the marginal effect (“partial

derivative”) for a dummy variable, the difference if it is set to 1 or 0, with other variables set to
their values for observation i. Thus the second term can be seen as the average marginal effect



                                                                       14
for those who have the risk factor. The same decomposition can be used for all co-variates in the
model allowing one to compare the importance of each to the prevalence rates of diabetes in each
year and the difference between the years.
       Table 9 presents my accounting for the increase in total diabetes prevalence between the
three NHANES waves. Some attributes included in the model either did not change over time
(age, height) or had relatively small estimated effects on diabetes prevalence (smoking and
exercise) and are therefore excluded from this accounting. Those that remain include
demographic factors (race and ethnicity), SES variables (income and education), and high levels
of BMI (overweight and the three stages of obesity).
       Demographic forces (including age) had a relatively small impact as the small increase in
prevalence predicted mostly as the increasing numbers of Hispanics was partly offset by the
diminished importance of race as a predictor of diabetes. Combined race and ethnicity predicts
that diabetes prevalence would have risen by 0.19 percentage points.
       Increasing numbers of men who had a parent who was a diabetic and the increase impact
of parental diabetic inheritance combined to predict that male diabetes prevalence would have
increased by 1.39 percentage points between the three NHANES data sets.
       Excessive weight by height was the most important factor leading to rising levels of
obesity over time. Being overweight itself was not critical (except that it makes you more likely
to be obese), but all three stages of obesity are. The three stages combined predict an increase of
obesity of 2.02 percentage points between NHANES II and NHANES IV- adding in the small
contribution of overweight implies that excessive BMI lead to a 2.15 percentage point rise in
male diabetes prevalence. The increase in obesity did not come out of thin air. A number of
papers have argued that the recent growth in obesity can at least partially be explained by
declines in the relative price of food, reinforced by even steeper declines in the relative price of
foods dense with calories.7,12 The decline in physical activity associated with work (especially in
lower SES more manually intensive occupations) may also have played a contributing role.
       The principal factor operating in the opposite direction was the improving levels of SES
in the population and most importantly higher levels of education. SES related factors predict a
decline in diabetes prevalence of 1.21 percentage points.
       Using data from Table 1, total diabetes prevalence increased by three percentage points
between the late 1970s and the beginning of this new century. Three factors loom largest in



                                                 15
attempting to explain the increase in diabetes prevalence over time. The biggest impact flows
from the increasing obesity in all three stages of the population, following by the increasing
fractions of Americans with a parent who was a diabetic, with a relatively small effect due to the
changing racial and ethnic demographics of the country. The important offsetting force was the
improving SES levels of the population over the last 25 years which negated some of the
deleterious effects of the other factors. Combined all these factors predict that diabetes
prevalence would increase by 2.48 percentage points, 83% of the increase in male diabetes
prevalence that actually took place.
       If the objective instead was to explain the secular increase in total diagnosed diabetes
prevalence then the large decline in undiagnosed diabetes would be added towards the top of the
list of factors accounting for trends. Twenty-five percent of the increase in diagnosed diabetes
since the late 1970s actually represents improved detection.


Explaining the SES education gradient in diabetes

       My second objective was to isolate the prominent reasons for the SES health gradient in
diabetes as well as the manner in which it has changed over time. To do so, I re-estimate the
total prevalence models in Table 5 starting with only controlling for education- that is the
unadjusted education gradient. I then add variables to this model in the following order always
keeping in the previous variables in the list- (a) age quadratic, (b) race and ethnicity, (c) smoking
and exercise, (d) parental diabetes, (e) excessive weight, (6) income groups. The (b) model in
this grouping represents the education gradient without controlling for any behavioral factors
related to schooling and the (e) models the adjusted gradient with only a single SES marker-
schooling- without trying to parcel out the distinct effects of schooling and incomes. This would
be my preferred model for understanding the nature of the schooling gradient with diabetes.
Estimates are provided for all three waves of NHANES using the same education stratifications
for all waves in Table 10.a and using the additional separation of higher education possible only
in NHANES 2 and NHANES 3 in Table 10.b.
       The unadjusted gradients in prevalence in (1) are large, generally statistically significant
and have increased only slightly over these twenty five years. Even thought the average age is
about the same in all three education groups (see Table 2), controlling for age still significantly



                                                 16
diminishes the schooling gradient in diabetes due to the non-linear effect of age on prevalence.
Approximately half of the schooling gradient with diabetes prevalence is accounted for by age,
race, and ethnicity controls but now it appears that the demographically adjusted schooling
gradient with diabetes prevalence may have risen over time.
       Smoking and exercise contribute to an additional diminishing of the gradient but this is
largely offset by including past parental diabetes. Adding in the effects of being overweight or
being obese further attenuates the estimated gradient- combined all of these behavioral and
demographic controls explain somewhere between 60% and 75% of the schooling gradient. Once
again, the estimated schooling gradient appears to increase slightly over these twenty five years.
         Even when schooling and income battle it out as competing SES markers in the final
row of Table 10, a schooling gradient remains (albeit smaller). It should be mentioned that the
controls for income and education in such models are of very different standing. Education has
been showed elsewhere to be related to the onset of diabetes while income is not related to
diabetes onset.13 Instead, reduced income appears to be the consequence of diabetes onset and at
least based on that reasoning income does not belong in these models. For this reason, the
education effects in row (6) of Table 10 represent my preferred summary of the net effect of
education on diabetes prevalence.

Conclusions


       While the increase in diabetes prevalence over time is less than that indicated by the
commonly used measured of diagnosed diabetes, it remains a significant public health concern.
The prevalence models estimated in this paper suggest that the most important forces leading to
higher diabetes prevalence are excessive weight and obesity, an increase inheritance of diabetes
through parents, and to a smaller extent the changing ethnic and racial demographics of the
country. Some but not all of this predicted increase in diabetes due to these factors was offset by
improvements in the education of the population over time.
       Undiagnosed diabetes remains an important health problem with a little over one in five
male diabetes undiagnosed by the years 1999-2002. However, this is far less of a problem than it
was twenty-five years ago when almost half of male diabetes were undiagnosed. Although race
and ethnic differentials in undiagnosed diabetes were eliminated over the last twenty five years,



                                                17
the disparities became larger across other measures of disadvantage such as education.
Moreover, undiagnosed diabetes is a particularly severe problem among the obese, a group at
much higher risk on diabetes onset.
       Successful diabetes management is also related to education. With the introduction of
new efficacious but highly complex therapies for treating diabetes, the more educated have
another advantage over the least educated in that they appear to be more able to adapt and to
adhere to these new therapies.
       Those in lower education groups face a triple threat with diabetes. First, at least in more
recent years, they are of slightly higher risk in contracting the disease. Second, they remain at
considerably greater risk of having their diabetes undiagnosed and presumably untreated. Third,
even after diagnosis, they have considerably more difficulty in successful self-management of
the disease using the complex but effective treatments necessary to diminish the negative health
consequences associated with diabetes.
