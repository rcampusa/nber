                                         ABSTRACT

This analysis proposes new measures of rent creation or (notional) mark-up and workers’ share of
rents on cross-country-industry panel data. While the usual measures of mark-up rate implicitly
assume perfect labor markets, our approach relaxes this assumption, and takes into account that
part of firms’ rent created in an industry is shared with workers to an extent which can vary with
their skills. Our results are based on a cross-country-industry panel covering 14 OECD countries
and 19 industries over the 1985-2005 period. In a first part of our analysis we draw on OECD
indicators of product and labor market (anticompetitive) regulations to test how they are related
to our new measures of mark-up and rent-sharing. We find that anti-competitive Non-
Manufacturing Regulations (NMR) affect mark-up rates positively, and hence firms’ rent creation
and workers’ share of rent, whereas Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) has no impact on
rent creation, but boosts workers’ wages per hour. However, we observe that these wage
increases are offset by a negative impact from EPL on hours worked per output unit, leading to a
non-significant impact of EPL on workers’ share of rents. The effects of EPL for low-skilled
workers appear to be more pronounced than those for medium-skilled workers, both being much
greater than for highly-skilled workers. In the second part of our analysis, we estimate the
impacts of our new measures on Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in the framework of a
straightforward regression model. We use the OECD regulations indicators as relevant instrument
to take care of endogeneity and to make sure that the resulting estimates assess the proper
regulation impacts of rent creation and sharing without being biased by other confounding
effects. We find that less competition in the product and labor markets as assessed by our
measures of mark-up and workers’ share of rents have both substantial negative impacts on TFP.

1. Introduction

Extensive empirical literature based on cross-country-industry panel data has been devoted in recent
years to the analysis of the impact of competition on productivity. Many of the papers concerned draw
on the OECD's anti-competitive Non-Manufacturing Regulation (NMR) indicators to estimate the
productivity impact of the lack of competition in product markets (see, for instance, Conway et al.,
2006, and Barone and Cingano, 2011). A few papers have also used the OECD's Employment Protection
Legislation (EPL) indicators to gauge the productivity impact of the lack of competition or flexibility in
labor markets (see, for instance, Bassanini, Nunziata and Venn, 2009). In the present study, we propose
new measures of rent creation or (notional) mark-up and workers’ share of rents on cross-country-
industry panel data to estimate both types of productivity impacts and use the OECD regulations
indicators as relevant instrument to take care of endogeneity and to make sure that the resulting
estimates assess the proper impacts of regulations without being biased by other confounding effects.1

In Blanchard and Giavazzi's (2003) theoretical approach, the creation of rents results from product
market regulations, while workers’ rent-sharing is influenced by labor market regulations. The analysis
of Spector (2004), which is also theoretical, leads to the same conclusions: a decrease in the barriers
to entry reduces the rent to share between capital and labor and thus impacts real wages negatively.
These models have received empirical corroboration on a cross-country-industry panel by Askenazy,
Cette and Maarek (2018), who use value-added prices and the value-added labor shares as indicators
of rent and rent-sharing. The empirical investigation of Azmat, Manning and Van Reenen (2012) has
also shown, on a cross-country-industry panel, that different components of the OECD NMR indicator
have contrasting impacts on labor shares. They find a positive influence of the ‘state control’
component (a combination of sub-indicators on government ownership, control and interference in
the running of the industry) and a negative influence of barriers to entry on labor shares. These findings
may reflect the fact that barriers to entry tend mainly to augment total rents, while `state control’
increases workers’ bargaining power and their share of rents.

Our present paper follows on from Cette, Lopez and Mairesse (2016a), not only because we exploit
the same cross-country-industry panel covering 14 OECD countries and 19 industries over the 1985-
2005 period, but also because we follow a similar, but direct and a priori preferable approach. In our
previous paper, we first used industry production prices and wages as very crude indicators of mark-
ups and workers’ rent-sharing, and we then instrumented these indicators with the NMR and EPL
indicators to evaluate the impacts of product and labor market regulation on productivity. This is what
we do here, but on the basis of the new measures of mark-up rates and workers’ rent shares that we
propose.

In a nutshell in this paper, we will first explain the new measures of mark-up and workers’ rent-sharing
at the country-industry level, which are largely inspired by the firm panel data analyses of Dobbelaere
and Mairesse (2013, 2015, 2017). We will then assess the relationship of these new measures with the
OECD NMR and EPL regulation indicators. Finally, using the OECD indicators as instrumental variables,
we will assess the impacts on total factor productivity (TFP) of mark-up and workers’ share of rents.

  There are several papers that investigate the relationship between regulations and other measures of
competition, but no cross-country-industry analysis of the impact of NMR or EPL indicators on direct measures
of competition. For instance, Griffith, Harrison and Simpsons (2010) use regulation indicators as instruments to
estimate the impact of a direct measure of competition, average profitability, on productivity growth. But their
regulation indicators concern non-tariff barriers to trade and other barriers to the free movement of production
factors across borders. It is also interesting to note that Nicoletti and Pryor (2006) study the relationship between
‘objective’ and ‘subjective’ measures of competition, the first based on an extensive review of laws and
regulations, and the second on observational data of those familiar with these regulations. Both papers show
correlations between regulations and other measures of competition.

                                                         2
While standard measures of firms’ market power, such as the Lerner index, assume perfect labor
markets, our new measures relax this assumption by taking into account that workers may appropriate
part of the rent created in a given industry. To give a preview of our results, we find that our new
measures lead to a more in-depth understanding of the impacts of regulations that overall
corroborates Blanchard and Giavazzi's (2003) theoretical conclusions, but with interesting differences.

Concerning the relationship of the OECD indicators with our measures, we find that: (i) NMR is
positively linked with the mark-up and workers’ share of rents, a result which is consistent with Jean
and Nicoletti's (2015) estimates of increasing inter-industry wage differentials; (ii) EPL has a negative
impact on hours worked per output unit, which offsets an increase in workers’ rent per hour and leads
to a non-significant impact of EPL on workers’ share of rents; iii) EPL has a positive impact on the wage
per hour of low- and medium-skilled workers positively, but a negative one on their hours worked per
output unit, particularly for low-skilled workers, thus also on their share of rent, whereas highly-skilled
workers tend to be much less affected. Regarding the impacts on TFP, we find that lack of competition
on the product market and of flexibility on the labor market have a detrimental impact on TFP, which
is consistent with Cette, Lopez and Mairesse (2016a) and the previous literature. Using our estimation
results to calibrate an illustrative out-of-sample policy simulation, we find that a decrease in country
regulations to the United States' level in 2013 (the last year available for the regulation indicators)
might lead in the long run to an overall average country rise in TFP of about 3.7%.


In Section 2, we explain our measures of the mark-up rate and workers’ share of rents and comment
on a number of instructive descriptive statistics. In Section 3, we document in detail the relationship
between the OECD NMR and EPL indicators and our measures. In Section 4, we explain and discuss the
OLS and IV estimated impacts on TFP of our measures. We also present an illustrative policy simulation
of the expected effects on TFP of pro-competitive reforms. Section 5 concludes.


2. Measuring mark-ups and extent of rent-sharing at the industry-country level

2.1. Definitions

Standard measures of lack of competition / mark-ups, such as the Lerner index, assume implicitly
perfect labor markets. In this paper, we consider a measure of markup at the industry level taking into
account that workers may capture part of the created rent, and the corresponding measure of workers’
share of rents.

Product market imperfections make it possible to set selling prices higher than marginal costs in order
to extract a rent (country and time indices are omitted):

                                                 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 = (1 + 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 )𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖

where: Pi is the relative production price (i.e. the ratio of production price to GDP price) in industry i;
𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 the mark-up rate; and Ci the marginal cost.

The marginal cost is difficult to measure with our industry-level data. As a proxy, we use the average
variable cost per output unit, assuming the capital cost is fixed in the short run. 2 An original feature of
our approach is to consider that workers’ wages are the sum of their share of rent and their reservation
wages, with only the latter being considered as a cost during wage bargaining. We can thus write:

2
    This assumption is standard but questionable. See Appendix D for “An analysis of sensitivity to capital intensity”.

                                                             3
                                                   ∑𝑗𝑗�𝑊𝑊𝑗𝑗𝑟𝑟 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 � + 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖     𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖
                                          𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 =                                =
                                                              𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖                        𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖


                                                      𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 − 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 − (𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 )
                                    𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 =                   =
                                                           𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖             𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖

where: 𝑊𝑊𝑗𝑗𝑟𝑟 is the ‘reservation wage’ per hour at skill level j; Nij is the number of hours worked in
industry i for skill j (low, medium or high skill); Mi the intermediate input total cost; and Qi the
production at constant prices. 3 To simplify the following equations, we introduce the variables 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 and
Ni, which are the overall skill average ‘reservation wage’ and the total number of hours worked.

We are missing information concerning ‘reservation wages’, but we assume that, for a given country
and year, the ‘reservation wage’ should be equal to or lower than the minimum industry average
observed workers’ compensation across all industries. Therefore, we measure the ‘reservation wage’
relative to the country x year minimum industry average worker compensation for each skill level, with
our main measures equal to 90% of it (our main results are robust to several thresholds). This measure
implicitly assumes that all workers are identical, for a given skill level, which is of course a strong
assumption. In the same way, the difference between the variable cost per output unit and relative
production prices may also stem from innovation, entrepreneurship and workers’ efforts, etc. So our
measure of the mark-up rate includes not only the rent created by product market imperfections but
also the consequences of these various factors. Section 3 sets out how we treat this issue
econometrically.

Our measure of workers’ bargaining power derives from the Nash bargaining solution, when firms and
workers together choose wages and employment level simultaneously. Thus, wages and employment
are chosen in order to maximize the average logarithm of firms’ and workers’ rents:

                   𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 log�(𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 − 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 )𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 � + (1 − 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 ) log�𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 − (𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 )�

where 𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 is workers’ bargaining power and Wi the average compensation in industry I; and the first
and second terms respectively correspond to workers’ rent and firms’ rent. We thus derive that at the
maximum, that the workers’ bargaining power and their share of rents are equal:

                                                                     (𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 − 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 )𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖
                                              𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 =
                                                              𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 − �𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 �

In order to investigate further the changes in our two key measures (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) and (𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊) in the next
sections, we consider the two following interesting decompositions. The mark-up rate (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) is equal
to the sum of to the sum of the firms’ and the workers’ rent rates (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑓𝑓 ) and (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑙𝑙 ):

                                     𝑓𝑓      𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖 − (𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 )            𝑙𝑙
                                                                                             (𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 − 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 )𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖
                             𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖 =                                      and 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖  =
                                                      𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖                      𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖 + 𝑀𝑀𝑖𝑖

where (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑓𝑓 ) is a measure of the mark-up rate assuming a perfect labor market. The workers’ share
of rent can be broken down into three multiplicative components:

3
 Note that Ci is not the marginal cost from the firm's point of view. For firms, the cost also includes the rent
captured by workers. It is important to calculate the rent created from Ci and not from firms’ cost perception in
order to measure total rent and rent-sharing.

                                                                       4
                                       𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖 − 𝑊𝑊𝑖𝑖𝑟𝑟 𝑁𝑁𝑖𝑖       𝑃𝑃𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺
                                                    ;      and
                                         𝑃𝑃𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺     𝑄𝑄𝑖𝑖     𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖 − 𝐶𝐶𝑖𝑖

where PGDP is the GDP price. The first component corresponds to the workers’ rent per hour (on
average across the different skill levels) deflated by PGDP, say at constant prices; the second is the
inverse of labor productivity (number of hours worked per output unit) and the third is the inverse of
total rent per output unit at constant prices.


2.2. Descriptive analysis

To calculate the mark-up rate (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀) and the workers’ share of rent (𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊), we use data from the
OECD STAN database concerning production value and prices as well as intermediate input costs, and
EU-KLEMS data concerning labor compensation per hour and the number of hours worked for the
three skill levels. These measures are calculated for our estimation sample of 4,988 observations
covering 14 OECD countries (Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the United States) and 19 industries over the 1985-
2005 period (see Section III for more information on the estimation sample). This section sets out the
descriptive analysis of these measures (Appendix A provides more detailed data information).


                              INCLUDE CHART 1 and CHART 2 about HERE


Chart 1 shows the observed density function of the mark-up rate (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀), its firm and worker
components (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑓𝑓 and 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 𝑙𝑙 ), and workers’ share of rent (𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊). Our measure of the mark-up rate,
which is relatively high on average (36.8%), is shared equally between firms and workers (the average
workers’ share of rent is of 47.8%). It leads to firms’ and workers’ rent rate distributions that are very
close, with average rates of 20.4% and 16.4%, respectively. However, this sharing differs a lot between
country x industry x year, as shown by the spread of the density function (with a coefficient of variation
of 38.0%). This strong heterogeneity implies that our firms’ rent rate, which is a standard measure of
the mark-up rate assuming a perfect labor market, may be a noisy measure of the total mark-up rate
and so of lack of competition.

Chart 2 also shows that changes in firms’ and workers’ rent rates are independent. Indeed, these rents
move in the same direction as often as in opposite directions. This is as true for rent increases as for
decreases (see Appendix A for more detailed information). It means that half of firms’ rent increases
(decreases) are achieved through the decreases (increases) in workers’ rent and half through the
sharing of total rent increases (decreases). Again, it means that firms’ mark-up rate is not enough to
understand total mark-up changes.


3. Linkages between OECD indicators and measures of mark-up and rent-sharing


There is an abundant literature using OECD anti-competitive Non-Manufacturing Regulation (NMR)
indicators and Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) indicators as proxy for lack of competition in
product market and of flexibility in labor market. In this section, we assess the linkages between these
OECD regulation indicators and our measures of mark-up and workers’ share of rents.



                                                       5
3.1. Presentation of the OECD regulation indicators

The OECD NMR and EPL indicators are based on detailed information on laws, rules and market
settings. The values of these indicators are between 0 and 6, with 0 for the most competitive/flexible
regulations (for a descriptive analysis, see Appendix A). A main advantage of using such indicators in
empirical analysis is that their construction can be held to be exogenous to productivity developments.

The OECD NMR indicators aim to measure to what extent competition and firm choices are restricted
when there is no a priori reason for government interference, or when regulatory goals could plausibly
be achieved by less coercive means. They cover energy (gas and electricity), transport (rail, road and
air) and communication (post, fixed and cellular telecommunications), retail distribution and
professional services, with country and time coverage varying across industries (see Conway and
Nicoletti, 2007, for a more detailed presentation).

Our analysis treats separately a sub-domain of regulation: state control. The corresponding low-level
OECD indicator, called NMR – State (NMRs) in this paper, takes into account the extent of public
ownership in the network sectors, the control of strategic choices and price controls. We expect that
the impact of state control on competition or bargaining power may be different than the other part
of the OECD NMR indicators, called NMR - Entry (NMRE ), which takes into account barriers to entry,
vertical integration and market structure.

The OECD EPL indicator aims to measure the procedures and costs involved in dismissing individual
workers with regular contracts and workers on temporary contracts, including regulations on fixed-
term and temporary work agency contracts (we do not use data on collective dismissal because these
data are available only from 1998). It differs between countries and years, but not between industries
(see OECD Employment Outlook 2013 for more information).


3.2. Linkages with the OECD indicators: choice of specification

According to Blanchard and Giavazzi's (2003) approach, product market regulations lead to rent
creation, whereas labor market regulations affect rent-sharing. We investigate whether this is
confirmed in the light of our new measures of mark-up and rent-sharing. We thus regress these two
measures, (𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀), and (𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊), on the three OECD regulation indicators (𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑅𝑅 𝐸𝐸 ), (𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑅𝑅 𝑠𝑠 ) and (EPL).
For further insight, we also regress the (WSR) components: workers’ rent per hour ((𝑤𝑤 − 𝑤𝑤 𝑟𝑟 )⁄𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ),
number of hours worked per output unit (𝑁𝑁⁄𝑄𝑄 ) and rent per output unit ((𝑃𝑃 − 𝐶𝐶)⁄𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ) on the three
OECD regulation indicators. For each of these five variables, say 𝑦𝑦 for simplicity, we estimate a
regression equation specified as:

                                          𝐸𝐸                   𝑆𝑆
          𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑦𝑦𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) = 𝜃𝜃1 × 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑅𝑅𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃2 × 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑅𝑅𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜃𝜃3 × (𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 × 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) + 𝜙𝜙𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜙𝜙𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝑢𝑢𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
                                                                                                                                  (1)

Where: c, i, t are the country, industry and year indices; NMRE is the OECD NMR indicator excluding
the state control component NMRS; (𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 × 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 )is the OECD indicator (EPL) interacted with 𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 the
intensity of the use of labor, measured by the industry labor share over production in the United States
in 2000; 𝜃𝜃𝑘𝑘 , 𝑘𝑘 = 1,2,3, are our parameters of interest; 𝜙𝜙𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 and 𝜙𝜙𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are country* industry and
country*year fixed effects; and u the equation idiosyncratic error term.

The fixed effects 𝜙𝜙𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 and 𝜙𝜙𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 are included to control for various sources of endogeneity, such as
omission bias and reverse causality which could stem in particular from governments implementing
structural reforms. In order to identify the impact of the EPL indicator, which is not measured at the
industry level, we assume that it depend on the intensity of the use of labor 𝜆𝜆. We use to measure 𝜆𝜆

                                                                   6
the ratio of labor to output in the USA as this country exhibits the lowest EPL value in our sample,
which we can consider as an appropriate benchmark. We shall call from now on (𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 × 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) EPL –
impact variable.


3.3. Linkages with the OECD indicators: estimation results

Tables 1 and 2 show the estimation results of relation (1), and sub-Sections 3.3.1 and 3.3.2 discuss
these results, respectively. Section 3.3.1 presents the impact of OECD regulation indicators on our
measures of the mark-up rate (MUR), workers’ share of rent (WSR) and its components for all workers,
whereas section 3.3.2 distinguishes between workers by skills levels.


    3.3.1. Main estimates




                                       INCLUDE TABLE 1 about HERE


According to the estimation results in Table 1, NMR – Entry appears to have a positive and significant
impact on the mark-up rate (column 1) and on workers’ share of rent (column 2). This impact on
workers’ share of rent comes from a positive impact on both workers’ rent per hour (column 3) and
hours worked per output unit (column 4), which are higher than the impact on total rent per output
unit (column 5). 4 These results mean that an increase in barriers to entry, everything else being equal,
reduces labor productivity and increases workers’ rent per hour, which consequently increases
workers’ share of rent, and at the same time increases the mark-up rate.

NMR – State has a positive and significant impact on the mark-up rate (column 1), but a non-significant
impact on workers’ share of rent (column 2). This last result comes from the non-significant impact of
NMR – State on workers’ rent per hour (column 3), unlike NMR – Entry, while its positive and significant
impacts on hours worked per output unit (column 4) and total rent per output unit (column 5) offset
one another. These results mean that an increase in State control, everything else being equal, reduces
labor productivity but has no significant impact on workers’ rent per hour and consequently on
workers’ share of rent, and at the same time increases the mark-up rate.

These results concerning the impact of NMR (Entry and State) on the rent level and on the rent-sharing
process seem to be consistent overall with the theoretical literature on the topic, and in particular with
Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003) concerning the rent level. They confirm the interest of our mark-up rate
measure as a measure of lack of competition.

The estimated coefficients of the impact of EPL – impact on the mark-up rate (column 1) and on
workers’ share of rent (column 2) are both non-significant. The non-significant impact on workers’
share of rent comes from the negative impact on hours worked per output unit (column 4), which
offsets the positive one on workers’ rent per hour (column 3) and the negative effect on total rent per
output unit (column 5). These results mean that an increase in EPL, everything else being equal, has
no impact on the mark-up rate, which is consistent with Blanchard and Giavazzi (2003). They also mean
that this increase in EPL has no impact on workers’ share of rent, which is at first sight more surprising.

4
 Obviously, regulation effects on workers’ rent per hour stem from effects on real wages per hour (see Appendix
B for more details).

                                                      7
But this non-impact results from opposite effects. The positive impact on workers’ rent per hour is
consistent with the literature and suggests that an increase in EPL strengthens workers' wage
bargaining power. But this direct wage impact and an indirect one, higher firing costs from the EPL
increase, lead to a substitution between capital and labor and/or worker selection, which corresponds
to a rise in labor productivity. This second channel is also consistent with the literature, for instance
the negative impact of regulations on employment in Azmat et al. (2012).

We underline in Section II the issue raised by the capital user cost. Our measure of the lack of
competition, the mark-up rate, assumes capital is fixed in the short run and so does not take into
account the user cost of capital. However, this assumption is questionable and the omission of the
capital user cost may affect our estimation results, particularly if regulations influence capital stocks.
We therefore analyze the sensitivity of our relation (1) estimation results to the inclusion of capital
intensity among the control variables and find that our estimation results are robust, despite the fact
that NMR – State and EPL – Impact affect capital intensity (see Appendix D).


    3.3.2. Estimates by skills



                                       INCLUDE TABLE 2 about HERE


Table 2 presents the estimation results of relation (1) for workers’ rent per hour and hours worked per
output unit at each of the three skills levels (high, medium and low).

The estimated coefficients of the impact of NMR – Entry on workers’ rent per hour and on hours
worked per output unit are both positive and significant, and do not differ within the three skills levels.
The estimated coefficients of the impact of NMR – State on workers' rent per hour is slightly significant
and negative only for the highly-skilled concerning workers’ rent per hour (columns 1, 2 and 3) and
positive only for the medium- and low-skilled concerning hours worked per output unit (columns 4, 5
and 6). These results suggest that NMR – State slightly reduces wage inequality between highly-skilled
workers and other workers, but also reduces highly-skilled employment relative to medium- and low-
skilled employment.

The estimated coefficient of the impact of EPL – impact on workers' rent per hour is positive but
significant only for the medium- and low-skilled, not for the highly-skilled (columns 1, 2 and 3). At the
same time, the estimated coefficient of the impact of EPL – impact on hours worked per output unit is
negative and significant for the three levels of skills, but larger for the low-skilled than the highly-skilled
(columns 4, 5 and 6). These results suggest that an increase in EPL – impact raises the wages of low-
and medium-skilled workers, but not of highly-skilled ones, who are the least protected by EPL. This
direct cost impact and the indirect one mentioned above (an increase in EPL means higher firing costs
that firms can consider as an increase in the cost of labor) lead to a substitution mechanism between
production factors detrimental to labor. The fact that, in the case of highly-skilled workers, there is a
significant impact on hours worked per output unit (column 4), even with no significant impact on
workers’ rent per hour (column 1) could correspond to the indirect labor cost effect of a change in EPL.
These results are consistent with those of Cette, Lopez and Mairesse (2016b). Taken together, the
estimation results in Table 2 and Table 1 column (5) indicate that EPL greatly reduces workers’ share
of rent for low-skilled workers, whereas it has a tiny impact on this share for medium- and highly-
skilled workers.

4. Impact of the mark-up rate and extent of rent-sharing on TFP

The previous section confirms the relationship of our measures of the mark-up rate and workers'
bargaining power with lack of competition and workers’ bargaining power. We now investigate their
effects on TFP.


       4.1. Presentation of the TFP measure and estimated specification

To measure productivity, we build a total factor productivity (TFP) index. We first compute capital
stocks using the permanent inventory method with a 10% depreciation rate and EU-KLEMS investment
data. 5 Second, TFP growth rates are calculated using the OECD STAN database as follows (indices
omitted):

                                                                      𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉                    𝐾𝐾
                                           ∆ log 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 = ∆ log            − (1 − 𝑠𝑠) × ∆ log
                                                                       𝑁𝑁                     𝑁𝑁

Where VA is value added at constant prices, N the total number of hours worked, K the capital stock
at constant prices and s the output elasticity of labor, approximated by the industry-specific average
of US labor share on value added. Finally, the TFP level is calculated for a base year using OECD national
purchasing power parity indexes and then extended over the sample period using our measure of TFP
growth.

We estimate the impact of the lack of competition and workers’ bargaining power on this TFP measure
according to the following equation:

                                               𝑈𝑈𝑈𝑈
    𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 ) = 𝜌𝜌 × 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙�𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 � + 𝛼𝛼 × 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐−1 ) + 𝛾𝛾 × 𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙(𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐−1 ) + 𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 + 𝜖𝜖𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐
                                                                                                                                               (2)

Where: TFP and TFPUS are domestic and US total factor productivity; 𝜌𝜌, 𝛼𝛼 and 𝛾𝛾 our parameters of
interest; 𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 and 𝜉𝜉𝑐𝑐𝑐𝑐 fixed effects; and 𝜖𝜖 the estimation residuals. The inclusion of US TFP takes into
account catch-up effects as well as various industry-specific common correlated unobserved factors,
such as technological change.


       4.2. Estimation results


                                                    INCLUDE TABLE 3 about HERE


Table 3 shows the estimation results for relation (2). These estimates are first carried out using the OLS
method (columns 1, 2 and 3). But considering the possible endogeneity issues between explained and
explanatory variables (for example, a demand shock can temporarily impact both the TFP and the
mark-up rate), we also perform IV regressions (columns 4, 5 and 6), the two explanatory variables
mark-up rate and workers’ share of rent being instrumented. The pool of instruments are the two
product market regulation indicators (NMR – Entry) and (NMR – State) and their product (NMR – Entry)


5
  For sensitivity analysis, we also compute other TFP measures taking into account capital stock composition:
information and communication technology (ICT) equipment, non-ICT equipment, construction and R&D capital.
The estimation results are strongly robust to the choice of TFP measure.

                                                                        9
x (NMR – State).6 From a theoretical point of view, considering the content of the regulation indicators,
which are built from detailed information on laws, rules and market and industry settings, these
instruments can arguably be thought of as exogenous with respect to explained variables. First-stage
regressions indicate that all the instruments are highly significant. The Sargan tests confirm our
assumption of the instruments' exogeneity (column 5 and 6), except when workers’ share of rent is
omitted (column 4), which may be explained by the low power of this test on our data. The Durbin-
Wu-Hausman (DWH) test confirms the endogeneity of the mark-up rate and workers’ share of rent. 7

The estimated coefficient corresponding to the process of catching up to the US TFP level is high and
stable over the different estimates, which is a usual result. The estimated coefficient of the mark-up
rate is negative and significant, as expected, but only for IV estimates (columns 4 and 6). This suggests
that less competition, here measured through a higher mark-up rate, reduces the incentive to
innovate, with lower TFP as a result. The estimated coefficient of workers’ share of rent is negative
and significant, as expected, both on OLS (columns 2 and 3) and IV (columns 5 and 6) estimates, the
estimated value being larger with IV estimates. This result suggests that, everything else being equal
(and in particular for a given level of rents), an increase in workers’ share of rent reduces the firm's
incentive to innovate but also its own resources to finance innovation, with lower TFP as a result. These
results confirm that lack of competition on the product market and labor market has a detrimental
impact on TFP. They are also consistent with the literature (see, for example, and also for a literature
review Cette, Lopez and Mairesse, 2016a).


    4.3. Policy simulation

To illustrate the meaning of our estimation results, we compute from them and for all countries in our
dataset the TFP gains from changes to competition. In order to take into account of changes in the
mark-up rate resulting only from these competition changes, we follow the same approach as for the
estimations: we compute first the impacts of NMR reforms on the mark-up rate and workers’
bargaining power, and then the effects of both on TFP. The illustrating NMR reform corresponds to the
adoption of the lowest NMR – Entry and NMR – State 2013 levels, 2013 being the last year the NMR
indicators were available. The adoption of these lowest levels of regulation would require very large-
scale product market structural reforms in some countries, such as France and Italy. The
implementation of such reforms cannot be considered politically or socially realistic in the short to
medium term.

The impact of structural reforms is calculated at the industry level using the main estimates (given in
Table 1, column 1 and 2, and Table 3, column 6) for our five non-manufacturing industries, then these
effects are aggregated at the national level using the value added industry shares in the whole
economy for each country (these five non-manufacturing industries account for one third of country
value added on average). The country level impact depends, for each variable, on the NMR – Entry and
NMR – State differentials with the lowest levels. It corresponds to a long-term impact, after dynamic
adjustments not evaluated here. Chart 2 presents the results of this simulation (see Appendix E for the
contributions to the TFP gains of each regulated industry). The two main points to bring out from them
are the following:


6
  The OECD NMR indicators are available for five industries: energy, transport, communication, retail distribution
and professional services. Therefore, the IV estimates of the impact of the mark-up rate and workers’ share of
rent only mobilized the data variability of these five industries. The estimation results are robust when the
estimation sample is reduced to these five industries.
7
  US TFP may also be endogenous, in particular with respect to an omission bias. We have explored this issue by
implementing the Dynamic OLS approach, introducing leads and lags of first difference US TFP into our estimated
regressions. Our estimation results are robust, as shown in Appendix C.

                                                       10
The overall impact is the largest (more than 5% TFP gains at the country level) in Italy and France,
followed Austria, Spain and Canada (more than 4%). These countries suffer from the highest levels of
anti-competitive regulation. At the other end of the scale, it is the smallest in Sweden, Australia and
the United Kingdom (less than 2%), followed by the Netherlands (less than 3%), which appear to be
the least regulated countries. These figures confirm that the gains that could be expected from the
implementation of ambitious product market reforms could be large in many countries (gains of 3.6%
on average).
In all countries, the TFP gains come mainly from the adoption of the lowest levels of NMR – Entry. The
gains from the adoption of the lowest levels of NMR – State appear to be much smaller in all countries.
This result suggests that the priority in reforming the product market is more to reduce barriers to
entry than to decrease State control.


   5. Conclusion

We have proposed new measures of mark-up and workers’ share of rents, inspired by Dobbelaere and
Mairesse (2015) approach regarding firm-level data. Our empirical investigation is based on a cross-
country-industry panel covering 14 OECD countries and 19 industries over the 1985-2005 period. We
find that: (i) our new measure of the mark-up rate provides a different view of competition than a
mark-up rate assuming perfect labor markets; (ii) the NMR indicator influences positively the mark-up
rate and workers’ bargaining power; (iii) the EPL indicator has no significant impact on the mark-up
rate but a positive impact on workers’ rent per hour; iv) EPL impacts hours worked per output unit
negatively, which offsets the increase in workers’ rent per hour and leads to a non-significant impact
of EPL on workers’ bargaining power; (v) lack of competition on the product market and of flexibility
on the labor market (measured through our original indicators) have a detrimental impact on TFP.

Our simulations show that a decrease in mark-up rates and workers’ bargaining power that would
result from a switch of countries' NMR to the United States' NMR might lead to an average increase in
TFP of 3.7% in the long run. But the adoption of these levels of lowest regulation would require very
large-scale product market structural reforms in some countries, such as France and Italy. The
implementation of such reforms cannot be considered politically or socially realistic in the short to
medium term.

The original findings of this paper give more content to the channels of the impact of market (both
product and labor) regulation on the rent-building and rent-sharing processes. They also confirm that
the impact of regulations on productivity occurs via lack of competition and labor market flexibility. A
limitation of our investigation concerns the distinction between short- and long-run effects. Our
estimation results using static specifications may be interpreted as long-run estimates, but short-run
changes are important in understanding the mechanisms for and political feasibility of reforms. The
use of a dynamic approach, such as an Error Correction Model, would be interesting but hard to
implement because of the lack of time variability in our regulation indicators, particularly the EPL
indicator. We are probably at the limit of the use of a cross-country-industry panel dataset, and some
corroboration may be needed, perhaps from firm-level data.

    Appendix A: Descriptive analysis


This appendix completes the descriptive analysis in Section II of our measures of the mark-up rate and
rent-sharing, and then presents the values of the OECD regulation indicators and the country sample
average of the TFP gap with the United States.

Table A1 shows the distribution of the mark-up rate, workers’ share of rent and its components, in
level (Table A1A) and difference form (Table A1.B). The numerical values in columns (1) to (4) of Table
A1. A columns correspond to Chart 1. The values of hours worked per output unit and rent per output
unit in level, given in columns (6) and (7) of Table A1.A, cannot be interpreted directly as the difference
between industries depends on the output deflator level, so we introduce the rent per hour variable,
in column (8), which is the ratio of rent per output unit to hours worked per output unit and is
independent of the deflator. The median value of this rent per hour is 19 $ (in 2000 US PPP) and
workers’ rent per hour, column (5), 8 $, with large heterogeneity for both, but much greater for total
rent. Table A1.B columns (2) and (3) shows the distributions of workers' and firms' mark-up rate first
differences used in Chart 2, and Table A2 shows the relationship between these first differences. The
median and mean changes are small for each variable, with sometimes high increases being offset by
equivalent decreases.

Chart A1 completes this view of our measures of the mark-up rate and rent-sharing, introducing firms’
and workers’ rent rate (𝜇𝜇 𝑓𝑓 and 𝜇𝜇𝑙𝑙 ) by industry (Chart A1.A), or country (Chart A1.B) or year (Chart
A1.C). Chart A1 makes it possible to observe both the mark-up rate – the sum of firms’ and workers’
rent rate – and the rent-sharing. The mark-up rate varies greatly between industries, with lower values
for manufacturing industries. Among non-manufacturing industries, the mark-up rate is very high for
three industries, ‘electricity, gas and water supply’, ‘communications’ and ‘financial intermediation’,
and very low for ‘hotels and restaurants’. Workers’ share of rent is particularly low in two of the high
mark-up rate industries, the ‘electricity, gas and water supply’ and ‘communications’. Focusing on
countries, we observe that Canada and the United States have the highest mark-up rates. It may be
explained by other factors than lack of competition, for instance innovation, education and risk-taking,
showing the need to use the Instrumental Variable estimation method in Section IV in order to mobilize
only the mark-up variability explained by competition changes when estimating the impact of
competition on TFP. The lowest workers’ share of rent is in the Czech Republic. Finally, we observe
relatively stable mark-up rates and rent-sharing over time.

Charts A2 to A4 show the values of the OECD regulation indicator and Chart A5 the country sample
average TFP gap with the US (i.e. the ratio of domestic TFP to US TFP), for each sample country and
the years 1985 (or the first year available for TFP) and 2005. We observe a decrease in the regulation
indicators over time, with a very strong fall in NMR – Entry, a smaller but significant reduction in NMR
– State and weaker changes concerning EPL, with even small increases in some countries. We can also
observe that large differences between countries remain in 2005. We do not observe a catch-up effect
in Chart A5 but, as mentioned in Section III, the inclusion of US TFP in our estimated specification is
also motivated by various industry-specific common correlated unobserved factors, such as
technological change.

      Appendix B: Impact of regulation indicators on wages


Table B1 shows in column (1) the estimated impact of regulations on workers’ rent per hour, like Table
1 column (3), and, column (2), the impact on real wages. The effects of regulations have the same sign
in both columns: NMR – Entry and EPL – impact have positive and significant effects on workers’ rent
per hour and real wages, whereas NMR – State has no significant impact. However, the effects on real
wages are smaller than on workers’ rent per hour. 9

    Appendix C: First step estimates of Table 3 Instrumental Variable regression


Section IV investigates relation (1) between OECD regulation indicators and our measures of the mark-
up rate and worker’s share of rent. The findings that NMR – Entry and NMR – State affect our measures
but not EPL leads to the estimation strategy of relation (2) in section V, i.e. the instrumental variable
estimation of the impact of mark-up rate and worker’s share of rent on TFP. The first stage
specifications of this estimation differ from relation (1): (i) EPL – impact is omitted among the
instruments; (ii) we introduce the product of the NMR – Entry and NMR – State indicators in order to
increase first-stage explanatory power and to implement the over-identification Sargan test; (iii)
relation (2) introduces the US TFP and the leads and lags of its first differences; and (iv) the estimation
sample differs because of TFP data availability. Columns (1) and (2) of Table C1 show the estimation
results of relation (1), as Table 1 columns (1) and (2), and columns (3) and (4) presents the first step
estimates of the relation (2) instrumental variable estimation (whose estimates are presented in Table
3 column 6). Our main conclusion is that the estimated coefficients of the regulation indicators are
very robust to the specification changes. The coefficient of US TFP is difficult to interpret – this variable
is included in the estimated specification for methodological reasons. If we assume that US TFP takes
into account technological changes, we would conclude that technological progress reduces the mark-
up rate and increases worker’s share of rent, maybe because technological change is a threat for
dominant firms and requires qualified workers to be implemented. We can also observe that NMR –
Entry and NMR – State variables have complementary effects on the mark-up rate and that this
increase in rent mainly benefits firms.

(a): The introduction of the ‘NMR – Entry * NMR – State’ variable into the estimated equations would lead to a problem of
multicollinearity with NMR – Entry and NMR – State variables. To deal with this issue, we first regress this ‘NMR – Entry *
NMR – State’ variable on all the other instruments and introduce the residual of this estimation into the estimated
specifications in columns (3) and (4), rather than the observed ‘NMR – Entry * NMR – State’ values. Note that this choice has
no effect on the estimates of the second step instrumental variable.

      Appendix D: Analysis of sensitivity to capital intensity


 Our measure of mark-up rate assumes capital is fixed in the short run and so does not take into account
 the user cost of capital. We may expect that this omission leads to the mark-up rate being
 overestimated. If regulations influence capital stock, this omission may lead to bias in our estimators.
 We therefore analyze the sensitivity of the relation (1) estimation results to the inclusion of the capital
 intensity among the control variables. Tables D1 and D2 take into account of this capital intensity and
 should be compare with Tables 1 and 2, respectively. Table D1, column (6), also shows the effects of
 regulations on capital intensity: the NMR – State and EPL – Impact variables affect capital intensity,
 but not NMR – Entry. This last result may be explained by the use of an aggregate capital stock, without
 taking into account capital composition, but such a breakdown would be beyond the scope of this
 paper (see Cette, Lopez and Mairesse, 2016b, for the importance of capital composition in the analysis
 of EPL effects). Most importantly, we observe that the effects of regulations on the mark-up rate,
 workers’ share of rent and its components are robust to the inclusion of capital intensity among the
 control variables.

 It is also interesting to note that capital intensity has a positive impact on the mark-up rate, as
 expected, but no significant effect on worker’s share of rent. This last result corresponds to a strong
 positive effect of capital intensity on workers’ rent per hour and a negative impact on rent per output
 unit offset by a negative impact on hours worked per output unit. The negative impact on workers’
 rent per hour is similar for the three skills levels, but the negative impact on hours worked per output
 unit is lower for highly-skilled workers, so their share of rent may increase with capital intensity.

    Appendix E: Breakdown of the simulation TFP gains by regulated industry


In Section V, Chart 3 shows for each country the TFP gains expected from the adoption in 2013 of the
lowest NMR – Entry and NMR – State indicator values, calculated according to our main estimates
(given in Table 1, columns 1 and 2, and Table 3, column 6). In this appendix, Chart E1 shows the 2013
values of these OECD indicators in each regulated industry and Chart E2 the contribution of these
industries to the TFP gains. These contributions depend on excess regulations and industry shares in
value added. A major limitation of this assessment is that we use the same estimated average
coefficient for each industry. Indeed, estimation of specific effects for each industry is not possible
because of lack of data variability. We must bear this limitation in mind when we observe that in most
countries the entry barriers (NMR – Entry) in ‘Professional Services’ and State control (NMR – State) in
‘Retail Services’ are the strongest contributors to expected TFP gains.
