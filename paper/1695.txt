                             Affordability and the
                           Value of Seller Financing




                                     ABSTRACT




 The typical methodology in valuing seller financing consists of calculating a

 discount ——   the   present value of the after—tax interest savings due to the
 creative financing —— and
                           including this variable, along with other

 characteristics of the purchased house, in an hedonic price equation explaining

 the house price actually paid. Resulting from this equation is a set of

marginal prices corresponding to each characteristic of the house, including

the quantity (discount) of creative finance accompanying the house. The

central question usually addressed is whether the discount is fully capitalized

in the value of the house —— whether
                                     the price of creative finance is unity.

In our view, one should not ask what the price of creative finance is because

this price, like that of other housing
                                           attributes, likely depends upon supply
and demand conditions. We develop and estimate a model incorporating this

dependency.

                Affordability and the Value of Seller Financing*

                   Donald R. Haurin and Patric H. Hendershott



      A plethora of studies have appeared recently on the value of creative

 financing [see Jaffe (1984) for a summary). The typical methodology consists

of calculating a discount ——   the   present value of the interest savings due to

the creative financing —— and including this variable, along with other

characteristics of the purchased house, in an hedonic price equation explaining

the house price actually paid. Resulting from this equation is a set of

marginal prices corresponding to each characteristic of the house, including

the units or quantity (discount) of creative finance accompanying the house.

The central questions usually raised is whether the discount is fully

capitalized in the value of the house ——     whether the price of creative finance
is unity.

      In our view, one should not ask what the price of creative finance is

because this price, like that of other housing attributes, likely varies with

supply and demand conditions. In a high interest rate/inflation environment,

many borrowers have short—run affordability problems. Mortgage payments that

will be a minor burden in five years, owing to future nominal income growth,

can be a major burden initially. By providing below—market financing for three

to five years, seller financing, like builder buydowns and graduated payment

mortgages, increases affordability. Similarly, creative financing may allow

low wealth buyers to avoid equity downpayment requirements typically faced in

the conventional market. The "market price" of a specific creative financing

package at any point in time should depend on the ability of the package to

address the affordability and downpayment problems of potential buyers.
                                         —2—



Moreover, the market price of a typical creative financing package should vary

over time, depending on the aggregate demand for and supply of seller finance.

When affordability is a major problem overall, creative finance will be in

great demand and its price will be relatively high. In contrast, when the

availability of creative finance increases, buyers are likely to be able to

obtain a given discount for a lower price.2

      A prior question to determination of the price or value of creative

finance is measurement of the discount or the quantity of creative finance.

The terms of the seller financing ——     initial   balance, contract interest rate

and repayment schedule ——   are   generally known, but the "market" interest rate

to which the contract rate is compared and with which the resultant interest

savings (after—tax) are discounted is not. The appropriate market rate to

employ in the calculation depends on the term, default risk and call risk of

the loan. The coupon on long—term fixed—rate 80% loan—to—value mortgages being

issued at the time of the creative financing, a popular candidate, obviously

pertains to too long a term and contains too large a call premium for virtually

all seller financing deals.1 On the other hand, the default premium in this

yield is likely too small except for unusually low loan—to—value deals. The

market rate for each transaction must be determined individually, depending on

the loan—to—value ratio, the term of the loan and the distance the interest

rate is below—market (the further below market and the shorter the term, the

lower the call premium), and the tax rate of the typical buyer of houses of

this type.   (The latter, by the way, is the average rate the typical buyer who

has taken on substantial debt would be paying, not the higher average rate of

the typical holder of houses in the pertinent price range.)
                                           —3—



         Our paper is divided into five sections. In the first we present a model

 incorporating a dependency of the real prices of creative finance and other

 housing attributes on demand and supply conditions, and in the second we

 discuss the measurement of the quantity of creative finance. Our sample of 162

 sales in Columbus, Ohio over the 1979—84 period is described in Section III,

 and the econometric results are reported and interpreted in Section Iv. A

 summary concludes the paper.

                                     I. The Model

         The hedonic price model when applied to housing is based on the

 assumption that consumers value the components of a house such as lot size,

 structural characteristics and neighborhood amenities (Rosen, 1974). Total

value is determined by the quantities of these components and the manner in

which they are bundled into a package. The basic hedonic model is easily

extended to include the seller's financing package as a determinant of house

value:

                          V = V(h, z),

where V is real house value (the recorded sales price deflated by a general

price level), h is a vector of structural and
                                                     neighborhood characteristics of
the house and property and z is the "quantity" of creative financing.3 The

implicit real market price (unobserved) of attribute i is V/3h. =        p.,    and for
creative financing the price is aV/z =     p.    Thus, a linear hedonic price
equation implies:

                         V       +
                                     Ph±   +
                                               pz.                        (1)




All the p's should, of course, be positive assuming that the characteristics

are defined in a manner such that increased amounts
                                                          yield increased utility.

The Real Price of Creative Finance

      The price of greatest concern in this study is the implicit price of

creative financing. At any point in time, this price is affected by specific

characteristics of the financing such as the extent to which affordability (a)

is increased or the initial downpayment or equity constraint required in the

conventional market (e) is relaxed. Again assuming linearity, we write



                             =
                                 l   +
                                         2a   +
                                                  3e.                 (2)




         We measure a as the percentage reduction in the initial monthly payment

achieved by the specific creative financing package. With PAYC and PAYO,

respectively, being the payments on the creatively and ordinarily financed

loans,



                              a = (PAYO — PAYC)/PAYO.




PAYC depends on the specific package and PAYO is computed from the standard

formula.4 The greater is a, the more affordable is the house and thus the

higher is the price of a unit of creative finance          0). In the few cases

where a <0, it is set equal to zero because a buyer would never choose a loan

with a negative a if affordability mattered.

         The minimum equity downpayment ratio in the private market is 0.05 plus

the 0.0125 first year private default insurance premium. Thus we define the

equity constraint as
                                          —5—



                                                ife<.0625
                                .0625           otherwise,



 where LV is the ratio of the loan to the nominal selling price of the house.

 The lower is e, the more the package has relaxed the equity constraint and the

more valuable is the package (3 <   0).
       The market price for a specific creative financing package should vary

over time with changes in the aggregate demand for and supply of creative

financing. On the demand side, we should look to macroeconomic counterparts (A

and E) to the a and e variables discussed above. The aggregate
                                                                 affordability
index computed by the National Association of Realtors (the ratio of median

family income to FNMA's "qualifying income" based on an 80 percent loan—to—

value ratio loan on the median—priced existing single—family home) is the

obvious choice. The greater is affordability generally, the less valuable is

creative finance. Because the importance of the downpayment constraint likely

varied little over this period, no macroeconomic E variable is introduced.

      Identification of macroeconomic supply side variables is more difficult.

Owners will be more likely to provide seller financing if they can obtain

below—market funds themselves. Such would be the case if they had far below—

market rates on existing loans from institutional lenders who were willing to

provide short—term below—market loans in order to get long—term below—market

loans off the books. We define S as the difference between the new—issue

mortgage rate on loans closed at savings and loans and the average yield on the

existing portfolio of loans at these institutions.5 The greater is S, the

lower will be the price of a unit of creative finance. Continuing our

linearity assumption, we express the constant term in equation (2) as
                                             —6—



                                                                    (3)
                        1=b1+b2A+b3S.

The Real Price of Housing

      If the real price of housing were constant over the 1979—84 estimation

period, the p's could reasonably be treated as constants. However, the

general rise in both nominal and real after—tax interest rates during this span

suggests that the real prices may have declined. Two variables are tested as

determinants of real house prices: and the real annual rental cost of owner—

occupied housing, U, as computed by Hendershott and shilling (1982) and the

NAR's affordability index, A. Movements in the former are dominated by changes

in real after—tax mortgage rates; movements in the latter by changes in

nominal mortgage rates. Ideally, U and A would be interacted with all the h.

(all of the p. would depend on U and A); given our limited degrees of freedom,

we allow the real price of only the most important attribute, quality—adjusted

square feet (h1), to vary over time. More specifically, we write



                        p1 = p11 + p12U +                           (4)




The higher is the annual cost of housing, the lower should be the price (p12<O).

The more affordable is housing, the higher should be the price (p13)O).

      Using equations (l)—(4), our preliminary estimation equation is

V =    + (p11+p12U+p13A)h1   +   'p.h.   +
                                             (b1+b2A+b3S+2a+3e)z.   (5)




The implicit price of creative financing (the coefficient on z) depends upon

the levels of A, S, a, and e. The price will vary temporally with changes in A

and S and across observations at any point in time depending on the reductions
                                                  —7—



 in the equity downpayment and monthly mortgage payment offered in a particular

 financing package relative to ordinary financing. As discussed above, we

 anticipate     >0   and b2, b3,         <0. Also, we expect p12 < 0 and p13> 0.



                                   II. Measurement of z

        Contrast a balloon payment mortgage of maturity M, amount LC, and rate i

 for the creatively financed loan with an alternative loan of the same maturity

 and amount but at rate o, the opportunity market cost of the financing. The

 after—tax present value of monthly payments for the creatively financed loan

 is:




                                PAYC —   IrLC
                      c                      tt,
                                [1 + (l—r)o]


where PAYC and the time path of LCt are defined by the contract. The after—tax

present value of monthly payments for the first M periods of the alternative

loan, which amortizes over N periods, is specified as:

                           M   PAYO - OTLO
                                             t
                     zo=                         t'
                          t=l [1 + (l—t)oJ



where Lot =                —   (l+O)t]/[(l+O)N        —   1].
              LC1[(l+o)N                                        We specify M as the minimum of

the stated period of the loan and 8.1 years. Truncating the maturity of

creatively financed loans in this manner accounts for the high probability of

relocation or refinancing within 8 years of house purchase.6

       The nominal quantity of seller financing reflects differences in both the

present values of after—tax loan payments and the present values of the

outstanding loan balances when the balloon comes due:7
                                               —8—



                     Pz = z — z + (LO —LC )/[l +
                           0   c           M M               (1)1M

To obtain the real quantity, z, we deflate by the CPI—U xi (experimental
                                                                                is also
urban—based CPI) ,   rescaled to unity in January 1979. This deflator
used to obtain the real house value, V.

      The tax rate is inferred from the real house value and a regression,

based on the 1979 Michigan Panel Study of Income Dynamics, of marginal tax

rates of recent movers on the real values of their house purchases. The

regression is



                       = .18 +   .0000015      V.            = .20

The t—statistic suggests a quite systematic

in the calculations of our discount varies from a low of 0.21 (real house value

of $20,000) to a high of 0.30 (real house value of $80,000)

       The most difficult task is specifying o. In general, we write



                           o     g +   s   +   d +   c,


 where g is the risk—free yield of maturity equal to that of the creative
         financing deal,

       s is the servicing fee charged on regular financing,

       d is the default premium that would be charged on equally—risky regular
         financing, and

       c is the call premium that would be charged on regular financing with
         equivalent call risk.

 We set s equal to 0.25% and vary d with the initial loan—to—value ratio (see

 Table 1). For LV5 from 80.1 to 95%, the premium is roughly that charged by

 private mortgage insurers, computed by spreading the difference between their

 first year fee and 0.25 over roughly 5 years and adding it to the 0.25 annual
                                           —9—



  fee (insurers raised these fees in late    1984) .     For LVs of 80% and less we use
  our estimate of the fee private lenders would build
                                                             into the mortgage coupon
  rate. For 95.1 to 97.5% loans, we add 0.20 to the fee on 95% loans; for loans

  above 97.5% we assume a full 1% default premium.
                                                           (As indicated in the Table,
  the creatively financed loans in our sample are spread widely across the

  spectrum of loan—to—value ratios, with roughly a third having LVs under 75% and

 one—quarter being over 90%.)

       The call premium is especially difficult to estimate because it depends

 on both the maturity of the loan and the amount by which the loan rate is below

 market. During the late 1979 —    early   1983 period, the call premium on a par—

 value 30—year mortgage was roughly 1.5% (Hendershott, Shilling and Villani,

 1983). Call would have less value for shorter maturity loans and for below—par

 loans (those with coupon rates below—market).         Table 2 indicates our presumed
 values of call for different combinations of
                                                 the maturity and distance below
 market of special financing deals. No number appears when the call value is

 assumed to be zero.   (For our sample, 10 loans have a ¼% call value and 13

 loans have higher values, spread about evenly from          to 1½%.)



                                III. The Data Sample

      A random sample of 90 creatively financed houses was drawn from the

Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area. As a supplement, a sample of 72 non—

creatively financed houses was added, these additional
                                                              houses paired with the
creatively financed observations. All creatively financed observations are

land contracts available for public inspection.         To be included in the sample

used in the empirical analysis, the land contracts had to report sale price,

the term of the loan, a single interest
                                           rate, and monthly payment.
      The rest of the sample was of transactions that were conventionally

financed and gave no indication of a loan assumption. Observations were

obtained by searching for a transaction within a one city block area of a
                                     —10—



creatively—financed transaction occurring at a similar point in time. Because

of these constraints, matches could not always be obtained.    Thus the

conventionally—financed sample is of slightly smaller size.   The sample period

for creatively—financed transactions extends from August 1980 to    March 1984,

while that for conventionally—financed transactions is somewhat longer, October

1979 to May 1984.

      One potential problem with the analysis of creative financing is the

inclusion of intra—family or other unusual transactions. These transactions

could include a wealth transfer (gift) using the financing of the purchase of

the parent's house by the children as the vehicle for the transfer. A number

of obvious intra—family transactions were deleted from the original sample. In

addition, we deleted 5 observations with no downpayment, 4 observations with

a>0.5, 2 with a(—O.25, and 2 observations where z/V exceeded 0.3.

      In the hedonic price approach, the quantities of structural and

locational attributes of a house must be controlled for. Measures of lot size,

the square footage of the structure, the type of attic and basement, the number

of plumbing fixtures, whether centrally air conditioned or not, the type of

exterior, the percentage of the house already depreciated (in the assessor's

view), an index of special features, and jurisdictional dummies were obtained

 from the county tax assessor's office. Table 3 contains variable means and

definitions, including the product of square feet and the fraction of the house

 not yet depreciated.



                           IV. The Empirical Results

       Table 4 contains three sets of coefficient estimates. These equations

 include z along with the nonfinancial variables affecting real house value.

 All variables in column 1 have the expected positive signs; the most

 significant are area (square footage) and the assessor's estimate of the

 undepreciated fraction of the property. A more plausible model would include

 the product of these variables, the quality—adjusted area, rather than the

 separate variables. The adjusted R2 at the bottom of column 2 indicates that

 such a model does indeed work better. Brick exterior, central air, special

 features, the high—tax suburb dummy, and quality—adjusted area all have t—

 statistics in excess of 2.0. The price of special features is of particular

 interest to accessors. The accessor is asked to state the value of special

 features in $100 units. The $117 estimated price of these units is not far

 from the expected $100 value; moreover, in our final equation in Table 5, the

estimated price is $102.

      The real price of housing (of the quality—adjusted square—foot

characteristic) is allowed to vary in column 3 with changes in the annual cost

of housing (the real after—tax mortgage rate) and in affordability (the nominal

mortgage rate). While movements in both of these variables suggest that a

decline in real house prices would be observed between early 1979 and mid 1982,

affordability has increased since mid1982, suggesting a recovery in real house

prices, but the annual cost variable has remained roughly constant at a high

level, suggesting real house prices would not increase. As can be seen, the

cost variable seems to be the relevant one, based on the relatively large t—

ratio (the affordability variable has the incorrect sign, but its coefficient

 is very near zero). The cost variable rose from 0.02 in 1978—79 to 0.10 in

1982—83. Evaluated at the mean value of ADJAREA, this increase lowers real

value (V) by $6,000, or 14 percent relative to the mean real value in our

sample.

      The z coefficient (p) in these equations is just over one half, with a

t—statistic of about 1½ (significantly greater than zero at the 0.10 level).

Table 5 contains estimates of the variable—p model in which all the

determinants of     (A, a, e and S) are interacted with z (column 1). These
                                       —12—



estimates are not very appealing: only two of the determinants, A and a, have

coefficients with the expected signs, and only one of these has a t—statistic

greater than unity. The F value of the test of the joint (null) hypothesis

that the coefficients of all of the intereaction terms are zero is only 1.18;

the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.

      In the face of these disappointing results, we were lead to reconsider

our linearity assumption. For example, the success of a given quantity of

creative finance in addressing the affordability problem might raise the price

of creative finance at an increasing rate. So might a reduction in aggregate

affordability. To test for nonlinearities, we have replaced b2Az with b21Az +

         and 2az with 21az + 22a2z.     Given our hypotheses about 2 and b2, we
b22A2z
expect the partial derivatives of p with respect to A and a to be,

respectively:


                    b21 + 2b22A   <0
                    2l + 2b22a >0,
where A = 71 and a = 0.1952 are the means of the variables. The coefficients

in the second column of Table 5 are consistent with these hypotheses.

Moreover, the e and S coefficients are now very near zero. The third column

excludes these variables, and the equation F value rises to 1.86 which is

significant at the 12% level.

         Based on these results, we have computed the sensitivity of    to the

aggregate level of affordability, A, and to the ability of a given quantity (z)

creative—finance contract to address the affordability problem by lowering the

initial monthly mortgage payment, a. The middle row and column of Table 6 are

based on the mean values of A and a for creatively—financed contracts in our

sample. That is, on average, the income of the median income family was 71

percent of the income needed to qualify for a 80% loan, at market rates, on the

median priced house, and creatively—financed contracts lowered the initial

monthly mortgage payment by 19½ percent. The other a values are one standard
                                         —13—



  deviation from the mean. The high A value is the average of the affordability

  index in the March—October 1980 period, just before the affordability crunch

  really set fl;   the low A value is the average during the June
                                                                  l981—August 1982
 period, when affordability was at Its lowest level.     Each of these values is

 also approximately a standard deviation from the mean value of A.

       The general contours of the prices in Table 6 are quite appealing,

 although there are some difficulties with the details.     Going from left to
 right across any given A row, a creatively—financed contract of given quantity

 has a higher price the more the contract addresses the affordability problem.

 For example, at the mean aggregate
                                      affordability level (A=71), contracts that

 lower initial mortgage payments little have little value, while those that

 reduce payments by 30 percent (shorter contracts with a further below—market

 rate) are worth more than their "book" value.    Also, we see that given

 contracts are generally valued more highly when affordability is a major

problem in the aggregate than when it is not. A contract lowering the initial

mortgage payment by 20 percent (the middle column) is worth only a few cents on

the dollar when affordability is not a major problem, but is worth 65 cents

when affordability is tight.

      The estimates of p raise two major questions. The first is the low

average price of creative finance (0.60 in equation 1 of Table 4; 0.66 at the

mean values in Table 6). Why are sellers willing to accept less than a dollar

for a dollar of value and why don't buyers bid the price of a dollar of value

up to a dollar? One explanation of the seller's willingness to accept less

than a dollar is that it may not cost sellers a dollar to create the dollar

that buyers are getting (Hendershott, 1982).     If sellers are in a higher tax

bracket than buyers, then the after—tax interest loss of the seller is less

than the gain of the buyer; part of the loss is being paid by the U.S.

Treasury.8 Obviously, low tax bracket buyers and high tax bracket sellers
                                                                          have
                                       —14—



incentives to opt for seller financing. Also, sellers may have obtained

short—term concessionary financing terms from their lenders who were anxious to

get long—term, below—market loans off their books. Sellers would be willing to

accept 60 cents for a dollar of creative finance if the Treasury and lenders

are paying 40 cents of the creative finance dollar.

      As for the buyers, one would not expect them to be willing to pay a

dollar for a dollar of creative finance, in the absence of a significant

affordability problem, because of the costs or risks for the buyer using land

contracts that would not be faced by buyers in the conventional market.

Examples include prohibitions against the seller taking out second mortgage on

the property and the risk involved in refinancing the balloon payment. Also,

major alterations could be prohibited or, if allc5wed, buyers may not be able to

reclaim the expense if they default.

      The second question concerns the negative prices for low a's and sharply

negative prices for low a's and high A's in Table 6. How can prices be

negative? While contracts that do little to address the affordability issue

likely have little value and contracts generally will have little value if

affordability is not a problem in the aggregate, negative prices are difficult

to rationalize.9 We don't believe these negative estimates (which have high

standard errors).


                                   V. Summary

      Our methodological extensions of the existing literature were summarized

in the introduction to the paper, so here we discuss our empirical results

only. The first major result is significant sensitivity of real house prices

in Columbus to the sharp increase in the annual rental cost of owner—occupied

housing (the real after—tax mortgage rate) between early 1979 and 1982. This

increase is estimated to have lowered real house prices by 15 percent. The

second result is a relatively low value of the price of creative finance. On

average, a one—dollar present—value after—tax interest saving is worth only
                                          —15—




  about 60 cents. This price appears to be quite sensitive to both the aggregate

  affordability of housing in the economy and the ability of a specific financing

 package to increase affordability.

       The affordability of housing varies over time, with the June l98l—July

 1982 period constituting the least affordability in the last quarter century.

 During this brief period, creative financing packages that increased

 affordability in a very significant way (reduced the initial monthly mortgage

 payment by 30 percent relative to that based on conventional finance) were

 priced slightly above par. That is, the buyer was willing to pay more than a

 dollar to obtain below—market financing with present value of a dollar. In

 contrast, buyers have not been willing to pay anywhere near par value for

 creative financing since affordability problems eased in early 1983. Moreover,

 the more a given quantity of creative finance increases affordability ——   the
 more the discount is front—loaded to lower the initial mortgage payment ——   the
higher is the value of the creative finance. To illustrate, the price of a

given quantity of creative finance appears to be fifty percent higher if it

reduces the initial monthly payment by 30 percent, rather than 20 percent.

Further, creative finance packages that lower the initial monthly payment by

less than 10 percent seem to be worthless.

      Unfortunately, the empirical estimates are not measured with substantial

precision and thus our evidence for the hypotheses tested is weak. While weak,

the evidence is not disappointingly so.    Testing the hypotheses of this paper

required a cross—sectional and time series data set.   Aggregate affordability
and the supply of potential creative finance loans fluctuate only over time,

while the observation specific affordability and equity measures vary cross—

sectionally. Ideally, one would have a data set of perhaps 200 observations

(matched creative and conventionally financed) available in each quarter,

yielding a total set of over 3000 observations for the four
                                                              year period. Our
90 creative—finance observations yield a very small cross—section per quarter,
                                     —16—



resulting in limitations being placed upon the generality of approach in the

econometric analysis. For example, while variations in the rental cost of

owner—occupied housing should affect the real prices of all housing

characteristics, not only quality—adjusted area, our small sample size

precludes interacting rental cost with the other characteristics. Table 6

suggests the price of creative finance is non—linear in aggregate and micro—

level affordability, but a precise measurement of the non—linearities and

interactions among the variables affecting price requires a larger data set;

the results in Table 6 are about as good as one might expect considering the

sample size. Hoping for precision of the estimates in the tails of the

distribution of affordability is unrealistic given the sample size.

                                    FOOTNOTES



 *Discussjons with Steve Buser have helped us to clarify some of the arguments.

 The research reported here is part of the NBER's research program in financial

 markets. Any opinions expressed are those of the authors and not those of the

 National Bureau of Economic Research.



1.This point was first made by Hendershott (1982) and has been emphasized by

Jaffe (1984) and Ferreira and Sirmans (1984). The call premium is not

accounted for in Rosen (1984) and Smith, Sirmans and Sirmans (1984).



2.Jaffe (1984) notes that the price of creative finance depends on supply and

demand but does not generalize to a temporal setting where the price would vary

over time. Studies by Rosen (1984) and Smith, Sirmans, and Sirmans (1984)

avoid the issue by obtaining a sample that is close to being from a single

point in time. One explanation for the widely varying estimates of the price

of creative finance [generally in the range of zero to one, Jaffe (1984)], is

that the samples are from different time periods in which supply and demand

conditions varied markedly.



3.As an alternative to deflation, some studies introduce time dummy variables

where the estimated coefficients on the dummies then measure inflation in each

period. Other studies enter a general price index as a regressor (Clauretie,

1984). The problem with either of these procedures is the implication that

inflation has the same dollar impact on a $20,000 house as on an $80,000 house.
                                      —18—


4.More specifically, PAYO = m(l+m)NL/[ (l+m)N_l], where in   is   the current

effective mortgage rate, L is the size of the loan, and N is the typical length

of a conventional loan.    For m, the FHLBB's effective rate charged by all

major lenders on previously owned houses is employed; N is assumed to be 25

years.



5.The data are for all mortgage loans at FSLIC—insured savings and loans, and

the portfolio yield is a monthly interpolation of a semiannual series.



6.Smith, Sirmans and Sirinans (1984) suggest that maximum maturity of creatively

financed loans should be the maximum truncation period that yields a price of

creative finance that is not significantly different from unity. In both this

study and ours, the result is four years if after tax measure of z is employed.

We reject this suggestion because we expected the average price of creative

finance to be less than unity (see pp. 13—14 in the text).



7.If the local property tax assessment practice based the evaluation of a

particular property's tax on the sale price of that property, then the after—

tax measure of the quantity of creative finance should include an additional

term reflecting the additional property taxes that would be due. In the

sampled area, the assessment procedure is based on the average estimated market

value of similar properties in the neighborhood. Because the value of creative

finance is not included in the assessed value of a particular property, the

formula in the text is applicable to our study.


8.If the buyer has a 0.25 marginal tax rate and the seller has a 0.40 rate, the

buyer receives 75 cents for a dollar of below—market interest while the seller

only gives up 60 cents. Thus the seller would accept 80 cents (60/75) for a

dollar's worth of creative financing.
                                   —19.-


9.Frorn the seller's point of view, the tax advantages of an installment sale

could be sufficient to lead to his being willing to pay to engage in a

creatively financed transaction. For example, if the seller had a discounted

tax saving of $5,000 on an installment sale of a $100,000 house (the

installment sale results in the final sale after the household reaches age 55)

and the cost of the deal was $2,000 to the seller, then at the margin the

seller would be willing to accept $97,000 for the house. That is, the seller

would accept a negative price of 1.5 (—$3,000/$2,000). However, the market

price would still be positive.
