        This paper considers the formulation and estimation of simultaneous
equation models with both discrete and continuous endogenous variables. The
statistical model proposed here is sufficiently rich to encompass the álassjcai
simultaneous equation model for continuous endogenous variables and more
recent models for purely discrete endogenous variables as special cases of
a more general model.
           Interest in discrete data has been ftsledby a rapid growth in the
availability    of microeconomic data sets coupled with a growing awareness

of the importance of discrete choice models for          the analysis of uiicroeconomic
problems (see McFadden, 1976). To date, the only available statistical
models for the analysis of discrete endogenous variables have been developed
for the purely discrete case. The log—linear or logistic model of Goodman
(1970)    as expanded   by   Raberman (1974) and   Nerlove and Press   (1976) is one
such   model that has been widely used. The multivariate probit model of

Ashford and Sowden (1970), Mnemiya (1975) and Zeliner and Lee (1965) is

another   widely used model. This paper expands the multivariate probit
structure to accomodate continuous endogenous variables. Alternatively,
the model presented here expands the classical, simultaneous equation theory
to encompass multivariate probit models.
          The models developed below rely critically on the notion that discrete

endogenous variables are generated by continuous latent variables crossing

thresholds. Such models have an honored place in the history of statistics

and were first advanced by Pearson (1900). The theory of biserial and

tetrathoric correlation is based on this idea. (See Kendall and Stuart,

                                          1

Vol.   II, 1967; Lord and     Novick,    cbs. 16—20, 1967.) It is argued in this

paper   that this class of statistical models provides a natural framework
for generating simultaneous equation models with both discrete and continuous
random variables.
             In contrast, the framework of Goodman, while convenient for formula-
ting   descriptive models for discrete data, offers a much          less natural
apparatus     for analyzing econometric structural equation models. This is so

primarily     because the simultaneous equation model is inherently an uncondi-
tional representation of behavioral equations while the model              of Goodman     is
designed to facilitate the analysis of conditional representations, and
does   not   lend itself to the unconditional formulations required in simultaneous

equation     theory.
          The structure of this paper is in four parts. in part one general
models are discussed. Dummy        endogenous    variables are   introduced      in two
distinct roles: (1) as proxies for unobserved latent variables and (2) as
direct shifters of behavioral equations. Five models incorporating such
dummy variables     are discussed. Part two, also the longest section, presents
a complete analysis     of   the most novel andgeneral of the five models
                                                  most

presented in part one. This is a model with both continuous and discrete
endogenous variables. The issues of identification and estimation are
discussed together by proving the existence of consistent estimators.
Maximum likelihood estimators and alternative estimators are discussed. In
part three, a brief discussion of a multivariate probit model with structural
shift is presented. Part four presents a comparison between the models
developed in this paper and      the    models of Goodman and    Nerlove   and   Press.

essential features of the argument, the conventional assumptions of classical


          tClearly, a second dt.immy variable could be defined as arising from
      crossing a threshold.. Note, too, that the choice of the zero threshold
is   an arbitrary normalization.

 simultaneous equation theory are maintained. In particular, it is assumed
 that equations (la) and (lb) are identified if 8i        0 and both     —



     and. y1 are observed for each of the I observations.' In this special
case, which conforms to the classical simultaneous equation model, standard
methods are available to estimate all of the parameters of the structure.
      The full model of equations (la)—(lc) is sufficiently novel to
require some discussion. First, note that the model is cast in terms of
latent variables y and     which may or may not be directly observed.
Even    if    y is never observed, the           event y1 > 0    is observed and     its
occurrence        is recorded by setting a dury          variable, di equal to one. If
    C    0, the dummy       variable   assumes   the   value zero. Second, note that if
    >    0,    structural equations (la) and (lb)         are shifted by an amount

and 82    respectively.

              To fix ideas, several plausible economic models are discussed that
may be described by equation system (la)—(lc). FirSt, suppose that both
    and            are   observed outcomes of a market      at   time   i,   say quantity and

price. Equation (la) is the demand curve while equation                      (lb) is the supply
curve.        [f the price exceeds some threshold (zero inequAlity
(lc), but this can be readily amended to be        any positive constant), the
government takes certain actions, that shift both the supply curve and the
demand curve, say a subsidy to consumers and a per unit subsidy to producers.
These actions shift the demand curve and the supply curve by the amount
and 8z respectively.
             As   another example, consider a model of the effect of laws on the
status of blacks. Let              be the measured income of blacks in state i while
         Tor reasons that become clearer in the analysis of Section II, identi-
fication is assumed to be secured through exclusion restrictions or through
restrictions on reduced forms for covariance parameters that are estimable.

  y*  is an unmeasured variable that reflects the state's population
                                                                     sentiment
  toward blacks. If sentiment for blacks
                                          is sufficiently favorable, (y > 0),
  the state may enact antidiscrimjnation
                                                      legislation and the presence of such
  legislation in state 1, a variable that can be measured, is denoted
                                                                      by a
  dummy variable di — 1. In the income equation (la), both
                                                            the presence of
 a law and the population sentiment towards
                                                            blacks is assumed to affect the
 measured income of blacks. The first effect is assumed to operate
                                                                                    discretely
 whilethe second effect is assumed to operate in a lore continuous fashion.
 An important question for the analysis of policy is to determine whether or
 not measured effects of legislation are              due   to genuine consequences of
 legislation (8 ,'     0)   or to the spurious effect that the presence of legisla-
 tion favorable to blacks merely proxies the presence of pro—black sentiment
 that would lead to higher status for blacks in      event        any          0). in
 Section II,     methods for consistently estimating the separate effects (n and

y1) are presented! This example is valuable because it illustratei two

 conceptually distinct roles for dummy variables: (1) as indicators of

latent variables that cross thresholds and (2) as direct
                                                                         shifters •of behafloral
functions.       These two roles   must   be carefully distinguished in the ensuing
analysis.

           The   model of equations (la)—(lc) subsumes a wide variety of
interesting      econometric models. These special cases are briefly discussed
in turn.

Case 1. The      Classical   Simultaneous   Equation Model
           This model arises when          and            are observed, and there is no
structural shift lathe equations          (81               0).

         1Note that even if sentiment were measured (i.e.,                   were known),
least squares estimators of equation (la) are inconsistent because of the
correlation of di and y1 with
                                     U1.
                                             6
 Case 2.    The Classical Simultaneous Equation Model with Structural Shift

            This model is the same as that of Case 1 except that Etructural

 shift is permitted in each equation. It will be shown below that certain

 restrictions must be imposed on the model in order to generate a sensible

 statistical structure for this case.


Case 3. The Multivariate Probit Model

           This model arises when           and y, are not observed but the events
         0 and         0 are observed (i.e., one knows whether or not the latent

variables have crossed a threshold). The notation of equations (la)—(lc) must

be altered to accommodate two dummy variables but that modification is obvious.

No structural shift is permitted             =        =   0).   This is the model of Ashford
                                                 82
and Sowden (1970), Amemiya (1975) and Zeliner and Lee (1965).


Case 4. The Multivariate Probit Model with Structural Shift

           This model is the same as that of Case 3 except that structural shift

is permitted l' 82 '        0).

Case 5. The Hybrid Model

           This model arises when y is observed and                  is not, but the event
         0 is   observed. No   structural   shift is permitted.

Case 6. The Hybrid Model with Structural Shift
           This   model is the same as that of Case 5 except          that structural
shifts   in the equations are permitted.

           The hybrid models of Cases 5 and 6 are the most novel and general.

Accordingly, these cases receive the greatest attention in the ensuing analysis.

Models 2 and 4 are also new but since the analysis of these models follow
                                                 7


directly from the analysis of the hybrid model they receive less attention

in this paper. Case 4 is briefly discussed in Section III while Case 2

is never explicitly developed.


                  It. The Hybrid Model with Structural Shift

           In this section, a model with one observed continuous random
                                                                                          variable,
and one latent random variable is analyzed for the general case of structural

shift in the equations. The argument proceeds in the following steps. First,

a condition for the existence of a meaningful statistical model is derived.

Second, consistent estimators of identified parameters are presented.                      Third,
marfminn   likelihood   estimators are discussed. Finally, some alternative

estimators are presented and discussed.

           To facilitate the discussion, equations (la) and (ib) may be written

in    semi—reduced form as

model of equations (la)—(lb) as represented in reduced form by equations

(3a)—(3b) makes sense. Without imposing a further restriction, it does

not. The restriction required is precisely the restriction implicitly

assumed in writing equations (3a) and (3b), i.e., the restriction that

permits one to define a unique probability statement for the events

d —    1 and di   O.so that P in fact exists. A necessary and sufficient

condition for this to be so is that it23    = 0,    i.e., that the probability

of the event di     1 is not a determinant of the event.. Equivalently, this

assumption can be written as the requirement that 1281 + 82 = 0.                    This

condition is critical to the analysis and thus deserves some discussion.

The argument   supporting this assumption is summarized in             the following

proposition.

Proposition. A necessary and sufficient condition for the model of equations
(la)—(lc) or (3a)—(3c) to be defined is that 1123 = 0          =
                                                                   1281
                                                                          +
                                                                              82.
                                                                                     This
assumption is termed the Principle Assumption.

Proof. Sufficiency is obvious. Thus, only necessary conditions are discussed.
Denote the joint density of V2,     d1 by   t(V2i    di)
                                                           which is assumed          to be a proper

density in the sense that


                           E    I                          1

           am grateful to Peter Schmidt for correcting an important error
in the argument of this section in a previous draft.

must be unity,            so that one may write,

                     P(V2i >                — 1)    —   1

where the symbols                and         are   defined by

Alternatively, one may               write this probability as

(4a)               t(V21, 1)dV21
          £
           I
and    obviously
               £
(4b)       I
                    t(V2, 1)dV21

Using    similar reasoning, one can conclude that
               LI
(4c)       I        t(V2i. O)dV21 —
                                            1


and


(4d)       I t(v2, 0)dv2 — 0.
           I

The    sum, of •the left hand side terms of equations (4a)—(4d) equals the sum
of the right hand side terms .which should equal one if the probability of
the event di —            1   is meaningfully defined. If               = 0,   this is the case.
But if 1123 'c 0, the sum of the left hand side terms falls short of one
while    if 1123 >        0, this    sum exceeds one. Q.E.D. Notice that this argument
does   not rely on the assumption                  that     V21 is normally distributed but does
                                           11

rely on the assumption that            has positive density at almost all points

on the real line.

           An intuitive motivation for this condition is possible. Suppose

that one rewrites equations (la)—(lc) to exclude dii i.e., write



                            'li lia 1
                                 —         +v  '2i'l
                                                       +Uli

                                           +
                                               'ti2 +
                             di=l iff
                             di = 0 otherwise.


Note that         is an unobserved latent variable. The random variable

is    observed and   is defined by the following equation



                            li
                            ,
                                     'li   +d3
                                             il

Making the appropriate substitutions of                    for    in the system given

above,   one concludes that                            -
                                                                             -




                                           +
                                               diB1 +      iil + lJii
                                =          +   'li —       d181)y2 + U2.

Invoking   the   Principle Assumption, one reaches equations (la)—(lc) including
di. Thus    the dummy shift     variable diB1    may be      viewed as   a   veil that obscures
measurement of the latent variable                But, as will be shown, the veil can

be removed, i.e., l can be estimated.

          It is important to note that the principle assumption does not rule

out   structural shift in equations (la) and (ib). It simply restricts the
nature of the shift. However, the Principle AsSumption does exclude any
                                                  12

structural shift in the reduced form equation that determines the probability
of a shift (equation (3b)).

          Given the principle assumption, equation system (3a)—(3c) may be

written as                                                                           -

Estimation of equation (5b) is a problem in probit analysis. Subject to

the standard requirements for identification and existence of probit estimates

(see Nerlove and Press, 1976), one may normalize by u4 and estimate

by using the reduced form probit fniction to estimate the conditional

probabilities        of the events di = 1 and di =             0.
           To determine how to estimate the parameters of the equation (5a),

it is useful to write the conditional expectatiàn of 7jj given di, i and

        i.e.,

the normalized parameters of equation <5b) are estimable, so is ci and hence
A.     A1 and E(V111d1, X11, X21). Elsewhere (Heckman, 1977) it s shown that

use of estimated values of A1 and Ai instead of actual values as regressors

in equation (7) leads, under general conditions, to consistent parameter

estimates of all the regression coefficients in that equation.

          Given this result, all of the parameters of equation (7) are estimable.

Note   in particular that the correlation between             and is also =

estimable even though there are no direct observations on22 y. This

result is a familiar one in the theory of biserial correlation.1
          To see how to estimate        the reduced form variance, w11,   note that

the general model, of which equation (7) is the conditional expectation, may

be written as

regressor to estimate the parameters of the disturbance covariance structure
closely parallels Telser' s (1964) procedure of utilizing least squares
residuals from other equations in a system of equations to estimate the
parameters of the inter—equation covariance structure.

 (iii) Maximum Likelihood Estimators

            The preceding analysis not only yields criteria for the identification

 of structural coefficients but also produces consistent estimators for

 identified coefficients. These estimators are useful for providing estimates

 enroute    to deriving maximum    likelihood estimators, but they are not, in

 general,    efficient. The mnvlmum likelihood estimator that is discussed
nextis      asymptotically efficient.

normal. For notational simplicity normalize
                                            V2 by l/2 and define

             Assuming random sampling, the likelihood function for the hybrid
model with structural shift is

                      It f(1 d)
                      i—i

where I is sample size.    Under conditions specified below, this function
possesses an optimum, and the maximum likelihood estimators have desirable
large sample properties. The identification procedure previously discussed
provides      an algorithm for generating initial consistent estimators so that

one Newton step produces asymptotically efficient estimators. These initial

estimators are particularly valuable because likelihood function (13) is not
a globally concave function of the structural parameters.

                                      0, so that the reduced form disturbances V1 and

so   that regression        estimators of equation (5a) and      probit   estimators of

equation (5b) are maximum likelihood estimators. In most practical problems

the   assumption that           = 0   is untenable.
             In   addition to the ordinary identification conditions previously
discussed, another condition is required in order for likelihood function
(13) to possess a well defined maximum with respect to its parameters. In
order to understand this condition, it is helpful to use conditional

normal theory to write density f(y1 di) as

This   representation of the density is both coinputationally and theoretically

convenient.

          In a   sample of size I, classify the observations into two groups
depending on whether or not the dummy variable                di is one. Among the

observations     with di 1, denote the smallest r by riin., and the largest
by 4Niax.       Among the to(= I — 1i observations with di a 0, denote the

largest ri by r{°lax,     the smallest by r°2iin. Then, likelihood
                           and

function (13) possesses no interior optimum in a compact parameter set if

(14)
         4°iax     C r'iin          or if        r°un >    riiax

so that there is no overlap among the values of the ri classified by the
occurrence of the event.'
         This condition arises in étandard probit analysis (see Nerlove and
Press, 1976). To understand it, consider estimates of an ordinary probit
model. If any variable perfectly classifies the outcomes of a discrete
experiment,     the coefficient of          that   variable becomes unbounded and is not

              similar condition arises in the conditional logit model. See
McFadden (1974, Appendix).

identified.  This phenomenon may arise in the current problem even if no
                       linear
exogenous variable (or/combination of exogenous variables) perfectly

classifies outcomes because of the presence of random variable                       in r.
There is a positive probability that condition (14) will be met and

maximum likelihood estimators will fail to exist. However, using standard

results in the theory of order statistics, it is trivial to establish that

the probability that condition (14) is met tends to zero if sample size

expands   by "fixed in repeated samples" sampling) Given their existence,
maximum likelihood estimators are consistent, asymptotically normal and
efficient.2
       1Briefly consider the condition 4°iax < r{4in. If one data
configuration (i.e., a choice of XL X2i) is considered and the number of
observations on that configuration becomes large, the condition becomes

        21t is a straightforward exercise to verify that LeCain's (1953)
generalization of the classical Cramer conditions applies to the model in the
text for suitably chosen values of the parameters. These conditions are local
in nature and imply the existence of some root of the likelihood equations
that is consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. Olsen (1977)
verifies the Lecam conditions for a model based on the one in the text. Olsen's
structural model       is
                    the reduced form of the current model with the exception
that 1113 is set at zero in his work. His proofs carry over to the more general
case.

(iv) Sane Alternative Estimators

         Since maximum likelihood estimation is computationally cumbersome,

it is useful to consider alternative estimators for the hybrid model. In

addition, the problem of the multiplicity of consistent estimators that

arises in an overidentified model remains              to    be resolved. It.will be shown

that the fact that           is never observed has important consequences that

cause the analysis in this paper to differ dramatically from conventional

simultaneous equation theory.

         Consider equations (la)—(lc), rewritten below to facilitate the

exposition. Because it is assumed that                       is observed, it is replaced

by        With this change, the equations become

to demonstrate the inconsistency of maximum likelihood estimators for the
parameters of a discontinuous density, it is worth verifying that the
expectation of the first partial of the log of the density of f(y11, di)
with respect to     vanishes when the expectation is taken with respect to
the density evaluafed at the true parameter values.

             From the probit estimates of (5b) it is possible to estimate the

probability of the event di = 1 conditional on values of                       and
                                                                                     X2

Least squares applied to equation (la') yields unique consistent estimators
of   c1, l and y.          The proof is trivial and        hence is omitted. Estimation of
this equation resolves the problem of the multiplicity of estimators that
arise from the application of indirect least squares discussed in Section (ii).
             Precisely the same procedure may be used to estimate, the parameters
of equation (lb). There is one new point. The choice of a normalization
                                           23

rule    in a simultaneous equation system is usually arbitrary. Here the

choice is important because Yj is never observed, although its expectation

can be estimated. In equations (la) and (lb), y1 is selected as the depen-

dent variable. Substituting estimated conditional means for endogenous

variables, equation (lb) may be written as


(ib')        Y1j
                     —           + Pi8 —   (y*l"2))         —

It is    straightforward to prove that least sqmres estimators of equation (lb')
are consistent.                                         -

       There is one further problemJ Although the Principle Assumption

requires      1281 + 82 = 0,   this constraint is not imposed in the preceding
analysis.         One way to impose the constraint is to estimate equation (la')

and use the fitted value of 82*112* (
                                              —8) as a parameter in equation (lb').
A more satisfactory approach that is computationally more burdensome is

to impose the constraint directly in formulating joint least squares

estimators for equations (lat) and (1W).

         -   It   is tempting to use the residuals computed from the fitted equations

(la') and (lbt) to directly estimate the structural covariance terms

will not work precisely because y is never observed. If estimated values
of       are used in place of actual values, the            residuals from (lc) and (lb)
will   not   permit identification of the structural covariances.

             One method for circumventing this difficulty is to use the estimated

structural parameters to solve for the reduced form parameters
                                                                            '!l'

and by   use of equations (9), (10) and (11) to obtain unique consistent
estimates of a11, a12 and          022•
         While      these estimators are simply computed, consistent, and free            of
the   nonuniqueness problem that plagues indirect least squares estimators in

the overidentified case, they are not asymptotically efficient nor are their

asymptotic distributions simple. The standard formulae used for the computation

of large sample parameter variances is inappropriate. This is so because

           is never directly observed and only an estimated value of this

variable is available.

          To understand these difficulties, it is useful to discuss two

special cases that are of interest in practical empirical work. First

consider estimation of equation (la) when                0 so that no direct structural

shift is present in that equation. Then consider a case in which                      0


so that no unobserved latent variable is present in equation (la). In both

cases consistent parameter estimates are available, as has been shown.

          Consider the disturbance from equation (la') under the assumption

that      =   0.    Denote the composite disturbance by U1

The crucial feature of these residuals is that they are not independent

across observations nor are they identically distributed. Accordingly,

standard central limit theorems do not apply to regression coefficient

estimates of equation (la'). In particular, it is not the case that the

 Both terms on the right hand side converge to proper normal random variables.1
 Accordingly1 the standard formula for the asymptotic variance—covariance matrix
 is   inapplicable. Although the correct asymptotic variance—covariance matrix

 can be estimated, the computational burden of doing so is greater than direct.

 optimization of the likelihood function.

           Now turn to the second case. Consider the estimation of equation Cia')

 for a case in which          0 so that no latent variable is present in equation (la).

The analysis of this case is thoroughly conventional.

           The estimated reduced form probability
                                                            P may be used as an instru-
mental variable for di. Standard instrumental variable formulas may                  be
used   to estimate the appropriate asymptotic variance—covariance matrix of
the   coefficients.

           The procedure to be used     is   as. follows.       may   be employed as an
instrument for di in equation (la'), and consistent estimators of
                                                                                  a1 and 81
may be produced. Using actual values for di and the               estimated coefficients,
one may   estimate    the residuals for each observation which when squared,

summed and   divided   by I yield an estimator of a11. The appropriate asymptotic

Note that since the residuals from the prediction of
                                                                 di (di —    F)   are not

guaranteed to be orthogonal to the X1 regressors, the instrumental variable

formula is not equivalent to the standard two          stage    least squares formula, and

           1The proof is straightforward. See Heckman (1977a, Appendix A for a
more complete discussion).
                                       27

the instrumental variable estimator is not equivalent to the standard two

stage least squares estimator.1

          Note further that if the sole purpose of the analysis is to estimate

equation (la), it is not necessary to estimate probit functions at all. It

is possible to generate an instrumental variable for di by estimating a

simple linear probability model with di as a dependent variable that contains
                                     and some other xogenous variable
at least all of the variables in X11/as regressors.   If these estimators are

utilized, the standard two stage least squares procedure applies and

predicted values of di may be utilized as regressors since in this case

the regression residuals from the prediction of di are constructed to be

orthogonal to the         regressors. This result simply restates the well

known point that it is unnecessary to obtain consistent estimates of the

parameters of reduced form equations in order to consistently estimate

structural equations.           -




          Since the linear probability procedure is the simplest one to use,

it is recommended. However, it is likely that the use of the probit

instrument results in more efficient estimates although no proof of this

assertion is offered.

          The discussion of these two cases is illuminating. For both cases

simply computed consistent parameter estimates are available. In the first

case, with an unobserved random variable present, the estimators converge

to a normal distribution but the theoretically appropriate asymptotic

covariance     matrix is cumbersome to compute. In this case it is suggested
that analysts utilize the consistent estimators discussed in this section
as starting values for at least one Newton step towards the likelihood

optimum   to   produce estimators with desirable large sample properties.3 The

second case requires only a simple application of conventional instrumental

variable estimator theory. For both cases and in the general case that

contains both special cases, full system maximum likelihood estimation will

produce asymptotically efficient estimates and is certainly recommended for

all but the special second case.
        The hybrid model can be generalized in several ways. Two extensions

are particularly important. First, several dummy indicator variables can

be introduced into the model. Two types of multiple dummy shj.ft variables

can be introduced. The first type of dummy variable represents a poly—

tomization of a single latent variable and is appropriate for the case of

ordered dichotomous variables. The second type is for intrinsically

unordered case.1 These models, and obvious multivariate extensions, are

briefly discussed in Appendix B. Second, the random variable       may be a

truncated variable. This case, which nests robin's model (1958) into a

simultaneous equation system, follows as a trivial extension of the previous

analysis and hence is not discussed here.


          III. Multivariate Probit Models with Structural Shift

        In this section maltivariate probit models are discussed. In these

models there are no observed latent variables so that the only information

available is that y 0 and            0. These models are superficially

different from those considered in the analysis of the hybrid model. Appear-

ances are deceiving. Both models are generated from underlying continuous

latent variables and the analysis of one model readily applies to the analysis

of the other.

        Equations (la)—(lc) apply to this case as well. As before, di is

defined as the dichotomization of

        l important reference for such models is Amemiya (1975).

and define dummy variable a as the dichotomization of

(15) a1 1ff
                 0   otherwise.

The argument of Section II may be applied to this case.

           As in the case of the hybrid model, the Principle Assumption

       +        = 0) is a requirement for a meaningful statistical modelto exist.
           82
Accordingly, the argument of Section II (1) of this paper applies to the multivariate

probit model. The models of Ashford and Sowden (1970), Ameiniya (1975), and

Zellner and Lee (1965) satisfy this assumption since none of these papers

considers structural shift in the equations (i.e., they assume that        =        =   0).
                                                                               82
           The identification procedure in Section II (ii) must be modified

since no observations are available on y1.. The analysis of identification

of      and 22 is as before. But the analysis of equation (5a) must be

modified. Two distinct cases are worth considering. First suppose that

       0 so that there is no structural shift in the equations.
it13

           In this case, normalized parameters of equation (5a) may be estimated.

That is, one may use probit analysis to estimate

                                    it11
                                                 and

The correlation between V1. and V2 may also be estimated, even though both

y and           are latent variables. This result is well known in the theory

of tetrachoric correlation (Kendall and Stuart, Vol. II, 1967). To establish

this result is is useful to recall that c is defined as


                                  c1 =     - (X1i11    +

and that b1 can be defined as

 Substituting consistent estimators of b and ci in place of the true values,

 these probabilities are solely a function of p. the correlation coefficient.

The sample      likelihood function may be                maximized with respect to p to achieve
a    consistent estimator of that parameter. The appropriate likelihood function
is

since the information matrix for the reduced                    form coefficients is not block

system information matrix is not block diagonal with respect to these parameters.

 The function nay be maximized with respect to the parameters listed in

 equations (17) and (18). As in the hybrid model, in a finite sample there

is some probability that maximum likelihood estimators fail to exist but this
probability becomes arbitrarily small as sample size becomes arbitrarily
large. The maximum likelihood estimators are consistent, asymptotically
normal and efficient.1

                IV.   The formulation of Simultaneous Equation Models
                        with Discrete Endogenous Variables2
             In this section, the models developed in this paper are contrasted

with previous work on discrete models with jointly endogenous variables by

Goodman      (1970) and Nerlove and Press (1976). These models deal with      purely
discrete random variables. Accordingly, the appropriate comparison is one

between that work and       the   models of Section III although an important topic

to    be considered is the issue of generalizing purely discrete models to
accommodate both discrete and continuous endogenous variables.
             It is argued here that the log linear model of Goodman and Rerlove
and Press is an inadequate scheme for formulating the sbnu.ltaneous equation
model required in econometrics. This is so for two reasons. First, the log
linear model is designed to simplify the estimation of conditional probabilities
        1The same sort of existence conditions are required as those presented
in Section II. With probability one, maximum likelihood estimators exist in
large sample samples.
               have greatly benefited from discussions with Marc    Nerlove   on the
material     in this section.

whereas the simultaneous equation mode], is intrinsically on unconditional
representation of random variables. Estimators of conditional probabilities
in   the log linear model have the same interpretation as direct least squares

estimators   in   classical simultaneous equation theory which are also condi-

tional probability        statements. Both estimators confound true structural
parameters   with eleme.nts of the equation error covariance structure. Second,

the log linear model does not readily generalize to accommodate continuous

endogenous variables while the multivariate normal structure can                             easily
be modified to do so, as has been shown.

          To fix ideas, consider a log linear model for a two equation system

comparable to the model of Section III. Nerlove and Press (1976, p. 51)

explicitly consider a log linear model for this case. Altering their

notation    to conform with the notation of Section III and suppressing
subscript i, the log linear analogue of equations (16a)—(l6d) is

no   covariance (p0)

so   that a simple probit model arises.

         Further note that in the log linear model, the conditional probability

that a — 0 given d may be written as

The simplicity of this representation is the basis for the popularity of the

log linear model. The comparable expression for the normal model is

                                                35

Note that a0 and b, a1 and c play similar roles in the model in which they

appear. The important point to note, however, is that B and p and ir                     play
similar roles. In the normal model the probability that a                  0 given d

depeüds on d for two        conceptually    distinct reasons: one related to the

true structure of the model Or!3             0) and the other due to covariance in

latent errors (p #        0).   In the log linear model, these effects are

indistinguishable. Thus          the   log linear parameter of association, B,

corresponds to two distinct parameters in the normal model p and
                                                                               iT!3.
          As    long as   one only seeks to estimate empirical relationships among

endogenous variables, this issue may be ignored. Suppose, however, that
one seeks to utilize fitted econometric relationships                to answer policy

questions. Then, as liaavelnio (1944) has stressed, it is important to

identify structural parameters. A simple example will fix ideas.

          Let   a    1 if a family has a child and let a = 0 if it does not.
Let d =   1   if the family uses birth control and d = 0 otherwise. It may
happen that because of unmeasured taste and knowledge factors, families
more likely to contracept are more likely not to have a                child. This     effect
would be captured in a normal model by setting values of the parameter
p c 0. There is,. however, a second effect. For obvious structural reasons
families on birth control will have fewer children (iT!3 < 0 in the normal
model). For either reason              < 0 in    the log linear   model.

          Suppose that the government forces all families to contracept, say

through a sterilization program.            The normal model would permit identification
of   the effect of this policy shift through use of irs. Thus the predicted

change in the probability of a couple having no children as a result of the

policy would be derived from equation (20) as

Notice that if           =    0,   there would be no effect predicted for the policy,

whether or not p         0.


           The estimate of the policy effect from the log linear model would

be given by subtracting the conditional probability that a = 0 given d = 1

(given in equation (21)) from the marginal probability (given in equation

(19)),

                                       = Prob (a =
                                                   Old =          1) — Prob (a             0).


Since it is not possible to disentangle purely statistical association from

purely causal association in the log linear model, it is not possible to

identify meaningful structural parameters interpretable within the classical

simultaneous equation framework. If one were to follow Ameniiya's (1975)

suggestion   and   use the        log linear model to approximate a multivariate
normal   model, misleading predictions of policy effects might occur. Indeed,

   irb     0, but p < 0 in the              normal model, the log linear model would predict

an effect of the program (B < 0) even when none in fact would occur. Conversely,

if 't3 >   0 and   p <   0,   estimated independence of events in the log linear

model (B     0) would lead to incorrect forecasts of policy effects. Mote,

however, that if dummy variables are defined S indicators of latent variables

that cross thresholds, and not as structural shift parameters (7r!3 =                                    0),
Amemiya's suggestion is appropriate, and the log linear model may be used to

approximate a multivariate normal, model. The parameters B and p                                   then play
         'The difference between the first term and the second term is that d
is set to one inside the brackets signifying that everyone in the population
is forced to use birth control.                                              -

the same role in their respective models.

        A second, more minor point, concerns the computational intractability

of the multivariate logistic model when both continuous and discrete

endogenous variables are present. The reader is invited to differentiate
                            function
the cumulative distribution/of the multivariate distribution to confirm

this point.1 Further, as Amemiya (1975) has noted the multivariate logistic

distribution   arbitrarily fixes the correlation structure among the random
variables,   a highly unattractive feature.2 For both reasons, the log linear
structure does not generalize to accommodate continuous and discrete
endogenous variables in a simultaneous equation system.

         2Note, however, that it is misleading to think that the cumulative
logistic distribution introduced in the previous footnote plays the same
role in the log linear model as the multivariate normal plays in the models
of Sections II and III of this paper. In the multivariate case, the log
linear probabilities are not dichotomizations of underlying continuous latent
logistic random variables. Thus, the transition from the log linear model
to the multivariate normal model involves more than a convenient choice of
a joint distribution for the latent variables introduced in Section I of this
paper. Moreover, if one were to alter the log linear model to incorporate
a structural shift term in a that would play the same role as parameter
ITt3 in the normal model, tha term would not be identified. This result is
simply a restatement of the argument in the text.

                                        Summary

          This paper develops a class of econometric models for simultaneous

equation systenswith dummy endogenous variables. These models are based on

the pioneering work of Pearson (1900) on dichotomized variables. The general

model   presented here includes simultaneous probit and        ordinary simultaneous

equation   models as special cases. Dummy         endogenous variables are introduced

in two conceptually distinct roles: (1) as proxy variables for unmeasured

latent variables crossing thresholds, as in the classical quantal response

model (Amemiya, 1975) and (2) as direct shifters of structural behavioral

equations   formulated in terms    of   latent variables. This distinction is
shown to be quite important in the formulation and interpretation of the
econometric models developed here. Maximum likelihood and alternative
estinators are discussed. Conditions for the existence of a meaningful
statistical model are derived.
          The models presented here have already been put to practical use

(see Edwards (1975) and Heckman (1975, 1977)). They are computationally

tractable   and   in   the applications cited have led to new    interpretations

of old evidence.
          The models formulated here are compared with alternative models by
Goodman (1970)     and Nerlove and   Press     (1976). It is shown that the log linear
model does not provide a natural framework for formulating the simultaneous
equation   model of econometrics     whereas the models presented in this paper do.

         In this appendix, there is a brief discussion of the derivation of

density f(1 di) that is used in the text. This discussion is useful

because random variables that are the sum of underlying continuous and

discrete random variables are unfamiliar in econometrics. The joint

density of V1, V1 (=                          is    given by h(Vii V1), a bivariate

normal density. The joint density of                      and di is

         Nultivariate   extensions of the models of Sections II and III in

the text are presented in this appendix. Let                   be a row vector of G

jointly endogenous latent random variables, some of which may be observed.

Let r be a C xG nonsingular matrix with unit diagonal elements. X is a

lxK row vector of bounded exogenous variables. A is a ICxG coefficient

matrix   for the exogenous variables. Td1U is a 1 xc vector of dummy
variables   (C c C). Only C1(c C) of these dummy variables act as shifters
of   the structural equations. Associated with the C1 shift dummy variables

is a C1xG coefficient matrix B. U1 is a lxG vector of disturbances for

observation i, I = 1,    .   .   .       , I.
         The structural equation system may be written as

U is assumed to be a multivariate normal random vector. Z is positive

definite. For notational convenience, suppose that the first C latent

variables activate theC dummy variables                         -

and that the first C continuous variables in                           are unobserved while the

remaining C—C variables are observed.1 Finally, note that C                         >         and
                                                                                        C1,
assume that   the   first C1 latent variables generate the C1 shift dummies.

          The semi—reduced form for the system is

where

                     it   = —Ar',      = —Br1 and               =

It   is convenient to work with reduced form variance normalized versions

of these coefficients. Define fl as

tition 0, and   define     D* as

tion that C1 c C and that only unobserved latent variables generate struc-
tural shift. The model can readily be generalized to include this case.

        is a (G—C) x (G—C)   identity matrix.

This operation normalizes the first C semi—reduced form equations to have

a unit variance disturbance, on obvious generalization of the procedure

utilized in Section II in the text. Note that


                               =   ,r(It), i =
           In   the notation of this appendix, the Principle kssumption in the

text    requires that   the first C1 rows of        the first C1 columns of 0 should
vanish.     Thus the Principle Assumption in this model becomes


                             = 0    i, j   =   1,         .

          Assuming   that the reduced form model is of full rank, the coef-
ficients in the first C1 columns of ir may be estimated by applying
probit analysis to each equation. If C > C1,                  the coefficients in the next

C—C1
        columns of wS and ii may be estimated by applying the methods of
Section III to each equation. Assuming              C >   C, the coefficients of the
final    G—C columns of ir and ff* may be consistently estimated by applying
the   methods of Section II to each equation. Precisely the same type of

argument offered in Section II establishes that                 all   elements of   are

estimable.

           Now consider the estimation of structural coefficients. Assume
                                    44

 that through exclusion restrictions all nonzero coefficients in equation

 (3—1) could be identified if        were observable.1 Clearly, in the trans-
ition      to equation system (B—i) with some continuous variables
                                                                       unobserved,
the same regression coefficients that can be identified in the previous

case can be identified in the current model if they are suitably re—

normalized. To obtain the required normalization, rewrite
                                                                  equation (3—1)
in terms of normalized latent variables


(3-1)                  Y(D*y- D*r + X1A +     =
                                          diE          U.
For the normalization implicit in the choice of r, it is natural to post—

multiply this equation by            to reach


(3—1')        (Y(D*))(D*r(D*)) +            X A(D')     + di B(D*)' = Ui(D.*)_l.

Clearly,   then, one can identify the following parameters:


(3—4)                 o*r(D*)JA* =       A(D*) 13* =   B(D*)l.

Finally,   it is clear that one can identify the following       parameters of
the structural covariance terms


(B—5)                           =   (D*)l   E (D*)'.


This completes the analysis of parameter identification.

         The likelihood function for the model may be generated from the

density for random variables di and 4 where            is the 1 X (C-C) subvector

of Y cortespondthg to the observed continuous variables. That density is

defined next. Let      be defined as

Identification through use of covariance restrictions is also permitted
so long as such restrictions can be imposed on

which   is to be maximized with respect to the terms in equations (B—4) and
 (B—5). As    the text, the identification analysis produces initial con-
              in

sistent estimators to use as starting values. In large samples, maximum
                                                                      -




likelihood estimators exist, and are consistent and asymptotically

efficient.

           One final multivariate extension is worth noting. The models

developed    thus far are for unordered dichotomous variables. In some cases,
dummy endogenous variables may               be naturally ordered. For example, in an

analysis   of the effects of legislation on the income of blacks, one might
distinguish existing laws by their "strength" and a natural ordering would
                                          46
exist.    One    simple   way to generate such ordered dichotomies is to polytomize

a single latent continuous random variable. Thus, each element of
                                                                                       d. say
d1 might be replaced by a vector of dummy variables, with a typical

element          defined as
           ic


                          d{? =     1.   iff


                                    0 otherwise, j = 1,       .    .    , 3,
where the categories are mutually exclusive, and the $,                        j   1, I are
a set of estimable constants (fixing            $ =     and    =       -°°).
          Each   of   the C dummy   variables   may   be polytomized in this fashion)

        1This procedure for generating ordered dichotomous variables is
discussed in iire specialized cases by Johnson (1972) and Amemiya (1975).
