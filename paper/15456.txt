Unexpected medical care spending imposes considerable financial risk on developing country households.
Based on managed care models of health insurance in wealthy countries, Colombia’s Régimen Subsidiado
is a publicly financed insurance program targeted to the poor, aiming both to provide risk protection
and to promote allocative efficiency in the use of medical care. Using a “fuzzy” regression discontinuity
design, we find that the program has shielded the poor from some financial risk while increasing the
use of traditionally under-utilized preventive services – with measurable health gains.

1. Introduction

        In developing countries, the inability to smooth consumption directly reduces welfare and

leads to informal risk management strategies that stifle productive activity (Paxson 1993,

Townsend 1994, Morduch 1995). Because unexpected illness is a leading source of economic

risk, the expansion of health insurance is therefore a public policy priority in many parts of the

developing world (Gertler and Gruber 2002, GTZ, WHO, and ILO 2005, WHO 2010, Mohanan

2012).1 Such initiatives are often large, centrally-planned programs operated exclusively

through the public sector – and they focus primarily on reducing the out-of-pocket price of

medical care.2

        An early exception is Colombia’s Régimen Subsidiado (or “Subsidized Regime,”

henceforth “SR”). Introduced in 1993, the SR is a pluralistic, publicly-financed health insurance

program targeted to the poor.3 Colombians meeting a proxy means-test (determined by the

Sistema de Identificación de Beneficiarios, or SISBEN) are fully-subsidized to purchase

insurance from private, government-approved insurers. In contrast to the classical ‘managed

competition’ model of insurance (Enthoven 1978a and 1978b), participating insurers must offer

standardized benefits packages and accept standardized premiums. Insurers can, however, form

restrictive medical care networks, deny reimbursement for services deemed ‘unnecessary,’ and

pay health care providers in ways that encourage higher quality and lower cost medical care
1
  For example, one study finds that 5% of Latin American households spend 40% or more of ‘non-subsistence’
income on medical care each year (Xu et al. 2003). As Gertler and Gruber (2002) note, there are two major costs of
illness: medical care costs and reduced labor income. Health insurance (our focus) addresses the former, while
disability insurance addresses the latter.

  According to Article 153 of Law 100 (authorizing the creation of the SR), one of the SR’s guiding principles is
Proteccion Integral: “The System of Social Security in health will provide health care to the population in:
education, information, health promotion and prevention, diagnostic, treatment and rehabilitation in quantity and
quality according to the Plan Obligatorio de Salud.”

                                                        1
(through capitated payment contracts, for example – fixed payments per enrollee per month).

Overall, Colombia’s SR shares features of managed care models of health insurance that

emphasize cost-containment and allocative efficiency traditionally found only in wealthy

countries. It therefore represents important early experience in a markedly different institutional

environment.

       This paper studies the impact of the SR on financial risk protection, service use, and

health outcomes among Colombia’s poor. Program eligibility is supposed to be determined

according to a discrete threshold in the continuous SISBEN index, so in principle we could use a

regression discontinuity design to do so. Because SISBEN scores are manipulated in practice

(BDO and CCRP 2000, DNP 2001, 2003a, and 2003b, Fresneda 2003, Camacho and Conover

2011), we instead use underlying index components collected through independent household

surveys to generate our own (un-manipulated) SISBEN score calculations. We then instrument

for SR enrollment with our re-constructed eligibility measure (Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw

2001). In general, our estimates are robust across a variety of parametric and non-parametric

specifications.

       Despite our strategy for addressing manipulation of eligibility, our approach has

limitations. First, because we use household surveys to implement a “fuzzy” regression

discontinuity design, our samples are relatively small. Second, we measure SISBEN index

components after official SISBEN classification occurred, presumably resulting in a degree of

measurement error. Third, due to financial shortfalls, many of Colombia’s municipios (hereafter,

“counties”) used eligibility thresholds that fell short of the official one. Following Chay,

McEwan, and Urquiola (2005), we therefore estimate and use county-specific thresholds. These




                                                 2
limitations introduce noise into the regression discontinuity design and generally bias us against

finding behavioral responses to the SR.

        We first find evidence that by the mid-2000s, the SR succeeded in protecting poor

Colombians from financial risk associated with the medical costs of unexpected illness. In

particular, SR enrollment appears to have reduced the variability of out-of-pocket spending for

inpatient care. Despite this reduction in risk, however, we observe little evidence of meaningful

portfolio choice effects (changes in the composition of household assets, human capital

investments, or household consumption), perhaps because the SR falls short of providing full

insurance.

        Our results also suggest that SR enrollment is associated with large increases in the use of

traditionally under-utilized preventive services – some of which nearly doubled. Moreover, we

find evidence of health improvement under the SR as well – specifically, gains along margins

sensitive to the increases in preventive care that we observe. There is more mixed evidence of

changes in the use of curative services (although theoretical predictions about the use of curative

care are ambiguous).

        We conclude by discussing the underlying behavioral mechanisms that may explain our

results. Because the SR is complex and multi-faceted, it is important to note that we cannot draw

firm inferences about them; we emphasize this as an important direction for future research.

Overall, we highlight two mechanisms that we suspect are important: high-powered supply-side

incentives and the possibility that enrollees receive care from higher-quality private sector

facilities.

2. Background and Policy Context

2.1 Public Sector Health Insurance for Colombia’s Poor Prior to the Reform

       Prior to the introduction of the SR in 1993, roughly 25% of Colombians (a subset of

those with formal sector jobs) had any form of explicit health insurance (Pinto 2008). However,

Colombians lacking formal insurance also had a degree of implicit insurance provided through

the public sector. Specifically, they could receive medical care from public sector hospitals and

clinics for a fraction of the full cost of their services; out-of-pocket payments were generally

progressive and loosely based on socio-economic status. Public sector facilities, in turn, covered

their losses with direct transfers from national and local governments, and health care

professionals were typically paid fixed salaries that did not reward productivity. Thus, poor

Colombians effectively had a degree of implicit health insurance coupled with inefficient

provider incentives – and the reform that we study aimed to expand coverage while improving

efficiency.

2.2 Overview of Colombia’s Subsidized Health Insurance Regime for the Poor

       Under Law 100 in 1993, Colombia introduced the SR, a novel form of publicly-financed

health insurance for the poor (Gwatkin et al. 2005, Escobar 2005). Primarily through SR

expansion, formal health insurance coverage in Colombia grew from about 25% of the

population in 1993 to 80% in 2007 (CENDEX 2008). The SR is organized as a variant of the

classical ‘managed competition’ model (Enthoven 1978a and 1978b). Beneficiaries are fully

subsidized to purchase health insurance from competing health plans. During our study period

(the mid-2000s), subsidies were financed by a combination of public resources including payroll

taxes and national and local general revenue. These resources are transferred to county

governments, which in turn are responsible for eligibility determination, enrollment, and



                                                 4
contracting with health plans. This role of local government has important implications for our

empirical analysis.

         Health plans charge county health authorities a government-regulated premium per

enrollee and offer a standardized package of benefits (see Appendix 1 for the details of these

benefits).4 Participating health plans then act as group purchasers of health services for their

enrollees by contracting with a network of health facilities and clinicians. Because premiums

and benefit packages are standardized by law (unlike the classical ‘managed competition’

model), health plans compete for enrollees on the basis of provider networks and service quality.

In practice, however, very few cities had more than one insurer during the years that we study.

         Insurers’ ability to contract with health care providers (hospitals and medical groups) for

more efficient service provision is a central innovation of the SR. Insurers receive premiums

(fixed payments per enrollee per unit time) for all covered services, giving them strong

incentives to constrain total spending. Insurers then (partially) transmit these incentives to

provider organizations through capitated payment contracts, and they have the authority to deny

reimbursement for services deemed inefficient.5

         In the next section we describe the major demand- and supply-side incentive changes

under the SR, and Section 3 then provides predictions based on them for health service use, out-

of-pocket spending on medical care, and health outcomes.




4
  During our study period, the benefits package of the SR (Plan Obligatorio de Salud Subsidiado) emphasized
coverage for primary and basic outpatient services, drugs, and some catastrophic care. There was limited coverage
for specialist services, and there were substantial gaps in coverage for hospital care.
5
  Provider organizations, in turn, must transmit the incentives they face to individual clinicians whom they employ.
Our interviews with stakeholders in the Colombian health care system suggest that organizations solve this agency
problem through non-financial rather than payment-based incentives (systematic data on organizational incentives
and clinician contracts is unfortunately unavailable).

                                                          5
2.3 Changes in Demand- and Supply-Side Incentives under the SR

        There were important changes in both demand- and supply-side incentives with the

introduction of the SR. On the demand-side, out-of-pocket prices for covered curative services

are 10% of the full price (as opposed to 30% for poor uninsured Colombians).6 Moreover, total

out-of-pocket spending per episode of illness each year is capped at half of the monthly

minimum wage for SR beneficiaries – while the same cap is six times as large for uninsured

patients (Decreto 2357 and Acuerdo 260 of the Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Social en Salud).

Notably, preventive services are essentially free regardless of insurance status.

        On the supply-side, changes in provider payment contracts created substantially different

incentives for the provision of health services. Specifically, there are two types of contracts

between insurers and provider organizations under the SR: capitated primary care contracts and

fee-for-service specialty care contracts. For primary care, insurers pay providers fixed amounts

per month for all services used by enrollees (“capitation”). These contracts create strong

incentives for providers to constrain total spending on primary care and have important

implications for both preventive and curative health care (as discussed in the next section).

Importantly, promotion of preventive care can be a central means of reducing total expenditures.7

        For specialty care, insurers generally pay providers a pre-determined fee for each covered

service that they supply (i.e., on a “fee-for-service” basis). These contracts encourage the

provision of all reimbursable services (both efficient and inefficient). However, SR insurers also




6
  The Colombian Ministry of Social Protection maintains a fee schedule (SOAT) regulating out-of-pocket prices.
For example, the full price for a physician consultation was 17,300 pesos in 2007 and 18,460 pesos in 2008
(approximately US $10). Medical facility social workers assess uninsured patients’ “ability to pay” and may charge
them sliding scale out-of-pocket fees (greater than 10% of the full price) on a case-by-case basis.
7
  Many medical professionals believe that increasing prevention reduces overall medical spending – whether or not
this is true depends on prices, the health production function, and competing risks. Cohen, Neumann and Weinstein
(2008) find that 20% of preventive measure in the US are cost saving.

                                                        6
have the authority to deny reimbursement on a case-by-case basis for inefficient specialty care

(termed “utilization review”), allowing them to limit wasteful service use.8

2.4 Eligibility for the SR

        Eligibility for the SR is determined using a poverty-targeting index called SISBEN (or

Sistema de Identificación de Beneficiarios). The original SISBEN index consisted of fourteen

components measuring different aspects of household well-being (such as housing material,

access to public utilities, ownership of durable assets, demographic composition, educational

attainment, and labor force participation – for a complete description, see Appendix 2).9 On each

dimension, households are classified according to mutually exclusive, collectively exhaustive

categories with varying weights assigned to each category; these weights vary between urban

and rural areas. A household’s SISBEN score is then calculated by summing points across

components. Possible scores range from 0 to 100 (with 0 being the most impoverished) and are

divided into six strata. Households scoring in SISBEN strata 1 and 2 (the lowest strata) are

eligible for the SR (below 48 in urban areas, below 31 in rural areas).10

2.5 Eligibility and Enrollment in Practice

        Although eligibility for the SR increases the likelihood of enrollment, neither one

necessarily implies the other for at least three reasons: misclassification or manipulation of




8
  Utilization review does little to promote services traditionally used sub-optimally.
9
  Eligibility also varies within households because certain demographic groups (including pregnant women and
young children) are prioritized for enrollment.
10
   SISBEN eligibility shifts abruptly at each county’s cabecera boundary, an administrative demarcation formally
distinguishing urban and rural parts of each county and loosely corresponding to the fringe of public utility
infrastructure. Distinct urban and rural SISBEN scales are applied to households on corresponding sides of the
boundary, differing both in component parts and in the weighting of response categories for each component. We
implemented a research design exploiting these urban/rural index differences, but inconsistent application of the
rural index and data limitations prevent us from drawing meaningful conclusions from it. In this paper we therefore
focus on urban eligibility.

                                                         7
SISBEN scores, shortfalls in local government revenue, and enrollment that preceded SISBEN

enumeration.11

         First, both local governments and households have incentives to manipulate SISBEN

scores. Local governments receive fixed transfers from the national government for each

resident they enroll, creating incentives to maximize enrollment. The selective enrollment of key

constituents can also provide political benefits (Camacho and Conover 2011). Households prefer

enrollment over “uninsurance” as well because co-payments are lower for SR beneficiaries than

for those lacking formal insurance. Consistent with both types of incentives, there is evidence of

considerable SISBEN score manipulation between 1997 and 2003 (Camacho and Conover

2011).12

         Second, most local governments lack sufficient revenue to finance the enrollment of all

eligible residents. According to law, those with lower SISBEN scores and those belonging to

specific targeted groups (such as children under five and pregnant women) are therefore

prioritized for enrollment.13 This means that many counties use de facto eligibility thresholds

that fall below the uniform national threshold.

         Third, some counties began enrolling residents in the SR before all of their residents had

been classified using SISBEN. These counties instead used other means-test criteria such as

residents’ estrato, a neighbourhood-level measure of socio-economic status used to establish

electricity prices paid by local households.

11
   Administrative mistakes in the enrollment process are also important.
12
   Using results from the 2005 population census, the Colombian newspaper El Tiempo reports that there are more
SR enrollees than residents in some counties (El Tiempo, October 26, 2006). Camacho and Conover (2011) show
that the distribution of official SISBEN scores exhibits both large leftward shifts in density over time and the
formation of a mass point just to the left of the national eligibility threshold in urban areas. Neither are present in
Colombian household surveys. The former suggests misrepresentation by households, while the latter suggests
misrepresentation by enumerators or officials.
13
   The laws formalizing this prioritization are Acuerdos 244 and 253 of the Consejo Nacional de Seguridad Social
en Salud. This prioritization also means that although SISBEN scores are calculated at the level of family
“nucleus,” individuals within families can vary in enrollment status; we observe this in our household survey data.

                                                            8
       In general, these realities of the program’s implementation have two broad implications

for our empirical analyses (which we discuss in greater detail in Section 4.2). One is the

necessity of an empirical strategy that addresses manipulation of SISBEN scores. The other is

that de facto county threshold must be estimated (because they are not officially reported).

2.6 Previous Studies

       Several previous empirical papers have studied Colombia’s SR as well (see Giedion and

Uribe (2009) for a comprehensive review). Trujillo et al. (2005) use propensity score matching

to compare SR enrollees to observationally similar uninsured Colombians, finding that the SR is

associated with greater medical care use. Giedion et al. (2009) also use propensity score

matching and find that SR enrollment is associated with more visits to health care providers,

higher vaccination coverage rates, and fewer reports of not seeking medical care for financial

reasons. Gaviria, Medina, and Mejía (2007) instrument for SR enrollment using length of time a

household head lived in his/her current place of residence and report that SR enrollment is

associated with better self-reported health, more preventive and curative outpatient care, and

fewer hospitalizations. Finally, matching official SISBEN score data with birth records,

Camacho and Conover (2008) use a regression discontinuity design in two samples: a county

lacking clear evidence of manipulation and selected counties observed shortly after SR

implementation. They find that SR enrollment is associated with increased birth weight and

better APGAR scores but not antenatal care use, medical supervision of deliveries, or probability

of hospital delivery. Relative to previous studies of the SR, our paper employs a different

strategy for addressing manipulation of program eligibility, uses an approach that disentangles




                                                9
the role of the SR from other public programs using SISBEN, and studies a broader range of

behavioral responses to health insurance.14



3. Empirical Predictions on the Interaction of Supply- and Demand-Side Incentives

        Although we emphasize the centrality of changes in supply-side incentives under the SR,

out-of-pocket prices for covered services also fell. This section therefore considers the joint

effect of supply- and demand-side changes in formulating predictions about changes in risk

protection, the use of preventive and curative services, and health outcomes. Section 5 then

provides empirical evidence on each.

        Risk Protection and Out-of-Pocket Medical Spending. Protecting households against

medical care costs associated with unexpected illness is a central objective of health insurance.

As Appendix 1 shows, the SR covers many of the most expensive services including trauma

care, dialysis, and major joint replacement (hips and knees, for example). It also caps total out-

of-pocket spending per episode of illness each year at half of the monthly minimum wage. The

SR should therefore reduce the variability of out-of-pocket medical spending. Assuming that the

price elasticity of demand for medical care is less than one, the SR should also reduce total out-

of-pocket spending for medical care.

        Preventive Health Services. Most preventive services in Colombia are free regardless of

insurance status (i.e., free both for SR enrollees and the uninsured), so the main difference in

incentives for preventive care originate on the supply-side. Primary care providers are paid on a

capitated basis, so they have strong incentives to limit total primary care spending. Increasing

14
  See Card, Dobkin, and Maestas (2008), Card, Dobkin, and Maestas (2009), Chandra, Gruber, and McKnight
(2010a), and Anderson, Dobkin, and Gross (2012) for recent regression discontinuity studies of health insurance in
the United States. For recent work on the United States using other methodologies, see Doyle (2005), Dafny and
Gruber (2005), Finkelstein (2007), Finkelstein and McKnight (2008), Kolstad and Kowalski (2010), Chandra,
Gruber, and McKnight (2010b), and Kowalski (2011).

                                                        10
preventive service use can reduce the need for more costly curative care – and can therefore be

cost-saving – so capitated primary care incentives are likely to increase preventive care use.15

         An opposing force at work is ex ante moral hazard: SR enrollees may have weaker

incentives to use preventive services because they pay less for curative care (Nordquist and Wu

1976, Phelps 1978). Although we fail to find evidence of ex ante moral hazard (as shown in

Section 5.5) and there is little evidence of it in other studies (Kenkel 2000), our preventive care

estimates reflect the net effect of these forces.16 Because preventive services generate important

positive externalities (both pecuniary and infectious disease-related), increases in their use

presumably improve welfare.17

         Curative Medical Care. Three changes under the SR are likely to influence the use of

curative medical care: reductions in out-of-pocket prices, increases in the use of preventive

services, and supply-side incentives for limiting total medical spending. First, for negative price

elasticities of demand, reductions in out-of-pocket prices will increase the use of curative care.

This increase is inefficient under standard assumptions (ex post moral hazard); however, curative

care in developing countries may produce positive externalities, and there may also be important

credit constraints. Second, any increases in preventive service use may reduce the use of

curative care (an efficient result). Third, both capitation and utilization review produce

incentives for providers to limit the use of curative medical care. Some reductions may be

efficient (counterbalancing demand-side incentives leading to ex post moral hazard) while others


15
   One randomized controlled trial in the US and another in the UK show that capitation increases preventive service
use (Manning et al. 1984, Lennon et al. 1990). This finding is also consistent with the evidence from observational
studies summarized by Miller and Luft (1994) and more recent research by Keenan et al. (2009).
16
   The RAND Health Insurance Experiment reports no sizeable or significant effect of insurance coverage on health
behaviors (smoking, drinking, and exercise) (Newhouse and the Insurance Experiment Group 1993). Medicare
coverage has also been reported not to increase unhealthy behaviors (Dave and Kaestner 2006).
17
   Popular conditional cash transfer programs – including the Familias en Acción program in Colombia – aim to
increase the use of preventive services even though they are otherwise available for free. At least eleven developing
countries have introduced such conditional cash transfer programs (Fiszbein and Schady 2009).

                                                         11
may be inefficient (leading to “stinting” – see for example Ellis and McGuire (1990), Holmstrom

and Milgrom (1991), Ma and McGuire (1997), and McGuire (2000)). Predictions about changes

in curative care under the SR as well as their welfare implications are therefore ambiguous.

       Health Outcomes. Both preventive and curative services are inputs into health

production. If at least one of these two types of care increases and neither of them decreases,

health should presumably improve to some degree. Alternatively, the prediction is ambiguous if

one type increases and the other decreases. In our empirical analyses, we are able to examine the

prevalence of infectious diseases common among children (diarrhea, cough and fever) as well as

the number of days lost to illness.



4. Data and Empirical Strategy

4.1 Data

       Our empirical approach requires household survey data containing three types of

information: (1) enrollment in the SR, (2) components of the SISBEN index (enabling us to

simulate SR eligibility), and (3) potential behavioral responses and outcomes of interest (both

welfare-improving and distortionary). There are two candidate Colombian household surveys

that meet these criteria: the Encuestas de Calidad de Vida (ECV) and the Demographic and

Health Surveys (DHS). The ECVs are nationally-representative household surveys designed to

measure socio-economic well-being and “quality of life,” broadly defined. The DHS data

reports detailed fertility, health, and socio-economic information for nationally-representative

samples of fertile age women (defined as ages 15-49) and their households. Because the de facto

implementation of the SR occurred in 1996/1997, we use the 2003 ECV and the 2005 DHS for




                                                12
our analyses.18 Table 1 shows descriptive statistics by type of behavior/outcome for the full

samples as well as those with and without SR coverage.

         As our empirical strategy requires, we calculate household-level SISBEN scores to

simulate SR eligibility because simulated eligibility should not reflect manipulation of SISBEN

scores (Camacho and Conover 2011).19 However, not all household surveys contain all

necessary components of the SISBEN index. Appendix 2 provides a complete description of the

SISBEN components present in each survey.20 We impute values using ordered probit models

for the few variables that are missing (firm size and per-capita income in the DHS and primary

roof material in both surveys).

4.2 Empirical Strategy

Instrumenting for Enrollment with Simulated Eligibility

         In principle, the SISBEN index’s SR eligibility threshold can be used to study behavioral

responses associated with SR enrollment. This discontinuity induces an abrupt shift in eligibility

(and enrollment) along otherwise smooth distributions of household characteristics; coincident

shifts in behaviors and outcomes can reasonably be linked to the program. However, adverse or

propitious selection into eligibility – or manipulation according to unobserved household

characteristics, as discussed in Section 2.5 – is likely to bias the estimates of interest (McCrary

2008).

         To circumvent this difficulty, we employ an instrumental variables strategy closely

resembling one proposed by Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw (2001). Conceptually, we seek to


18
   There was also a Colombian DHS survey conducted in 2000, but it is much smaller and contains few outcome
variables of interest. We do not use the 1997 wave of the ECV because SR enrollment was still very low in that
year.
19
   Official SISBEN scores are also not available in the datasets that we use.
20
   In theory, SISBEN scores should be calculated at the family (or “nucleus”) level. However, we treat entire
households as families given reports that SISBEN enumerators adopted this definition in practice due to difficulties
in conforming to the technical definition.

                                                         13
reconstruct ‘true’ SISBEN scores when both official SISBEN scores and observed SR enrollment

reflect manipulation. To do so, we calculate SISBEN scores for each household in the ECV and

DHS data and then use calculated scores to instrument for SR enrollment (for prominent

examples of simulated instruments, see Currie and Gruber (1996a and 1996b), and Cutler and

Gruber (1996), and Hoxby (2001)).21

        Using urban households with simulated SISBEN scores near the urban eligibility

threshold (we do not use rural households because of sufficiently inconsistent application of the

rural scale)22, we could in principle begin by estimating the following first-stage equation for

individuals i in household h:

(1)     enrollih = α + γbelowh + βSISBENh + Σkδkestratohk + εih,

where enroll is an indicator for whether or not individual i is enrolled in the SR, below is an

indicator for simulated SISBEN score lying below the eligibility threshold, SISBEN is simulated

SISBEN score, and estrato is a dummy variable for an estrato category (a neighborhood-level

measure of socio-economic status used to establish electricity prices paid by local households).

Using Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS), we could then estimate the following second-stage

equation:

(2)     outcomeih = φ + λenrollih + θSISBENh + Σkπkestratohk + ξih,

instrumeting for enroll with below. The relationship between behavioral outcomes of interest

(outcome) and SR enrollment would then be captured by estimates of the parameter λ.

21
   We emphasize “old” SISBEN scores – those calculated using the official scale in effect between the beginning of
the SR and 2003. Enrollees eligible only under the old scale were not disenrolled with the introduction of the “new
scale,” and the old (but not the new) eligibility discontinuity is evident in the 2005 DHS.
22
   The combination of smaller sample size and inconsistent application of the scale in rural areas means that our
first-stage relationships are considerably weaker than in urban areas. In the DHS, the first-stage F-statistics are
about 9 for the sample of children (N=574) and about 3 for the sample of mothers (N=302). In the ECV, the first-
stage F-statistics are about 18, but the size of the rural sample is roughly one quarter of the urban one (1318 vs.
4129).



                                                        14
Estimating County-Specific Eligibility Thresholds

        As described in Section 2.5, financial shortfalls led many Colombian counties to use SR

eligibility thresholds at SISBEN scores below the official national threshold. We therefore use

county-specific eligibility thresholds. In addition to improving the strength of our first stage,

this approach offers another key benefit: because some local governments use the official

national threshold for other public benefits, changes in outcomes observed at county-specific SR

thresholds will not reflect behavioral responses to other public programs. (Section 5.1 shows

that participation in other public programs is not discontinuous at county-specific thresholds.)

        Exact county-specific eligibility thresholds are unknown, so we estimate them following

Chay, McEwan, and Urquiola (2005). Specifically, using our full samples, we establish county-

specific breaks in SR eligibility at the SISBEN score that maximize the goodness-of-fit of a

model of SR enrollment as a function of a dichotomous indicator for whether or not a

household’s score falls below the threshold.23 This approach establishes thresholds that

maximize the percentage of individuals correctly classified as eligible in each county. Threshold

means in the ECV and DHS are 45.03 and 45.83, respectively, and their interquantile ranges are

4.96 and 3.89. Intuitively, estimated thresholds are positively correlated with current county

income (the sum of taxes, transfers from the state, and non-tax income) and negatively correlated

with the share of households having unmet basic needs.24


23
   There are 84 counties in the ECV and 220 counties in the DHS. We exclude individuals from a few counties using
two criteria related to having very few observations in some counties. One is having the first percentile in the
SISBEN score distribution lie above the national threshold or the 99th percentile score lie below the national
threshold. The other is having an estimated threshold with those below it having relatively lower SR enrollment
rates than those above it. The total number of observations excluded for these reasons is minor (3.8% of the sample
in the ECV data and 5.2% of the sample in the DHS data). Estimated thresholds are constrained to be lower than 49.
24
   To assess this, we ran an OLS regression of county-specific eligibility thresholds on current county income and
the share of households in the county having unmet basic needs (a composite indicator that collapses across
household population density, water source, toilet availability at home, education of household head, ratio of
employed household members to all household members, and children’s school attendance rate). Using the ECV
sample, the estimate for current county income is 0.0091 with a standard error of 0.004; in the DHS, the estimate is

                                                        15
        We then use county-specific thresholds to re-code the variable below for each individual i

in households h and Colombian counties c and estimate the following first stage equation:

(3)     enrollihc = α + γbelowhc + βSISBENh + φSISBEN_diffhc + Σkδkestratohk + μc + εihc,

where below is now an indicator for whether or not individual i’s simulated SISBEN score falls

below the eligibility threshold in the individual’s county c, SISBEN_diff is the difference

between an individual’s simulated SISBEN score and the estimated eligibility threshold in the

individual’s county (i.e., relative SISBEN score), μc represents county fixed effects (allowing us

to focus on within-county variation in simulated eligibility across county-specific thresholds),

and all other variables are defined as in equation (1). To adhere transparently to the identifying

assumption that individuals with simulated SISBEN scores very near the threshold are

comparable with the exception of their eligibility, we conservatively focus on individuals whose

calculated scores lie within two index points of the county-specific cutoff (our main estimates

persist across various bandwidths, as shown in Section 5.6).25

        Figures 1A and 1B use ECV and DHS data to show SR enrollment and “uninsurance” by

simulated SISBEN score relative to county-specific eligibility thresholds. Each county’s

threshold is normalized to zero, and the figure then shows means and 95% confidence intervals

for each SISBEN index integer relative to the threshold as well as non-parametric kernel density

plots on either side. The figure illustrates large discrete increases in the probability of enrollment

and concomitant decreases in the probability of uninsurance at the threshold ranging between 25

to 30 percentage points. Figures 2A and 2B show the enrollment and “uninsurance” separately


0.0043 with a standard error of 0.002. For the share of households with unmet basic needs, the estimates are -0.0456
and -0.0444 with standard errors of 0.024 and 0.015, respectively.
25
   Because eligibility thresholds vary by county, our approach essentially averages across sample respondents with
different absolute SISBEN scores. To investigate how our estimates vary with absolute SISBEN score, we also
estimate variants of equation (4) below with interactions between SR enrollment and absolute SISBEN score
(instrumenting for this term with interactions between an indicator for falling below county-specific thresholds and
absolute SISBEN score) and find insignificant estimates for this interaction term (see Section 5.7).

                                                        16
by regions of Colombia as well. It is worth noting than SR enrollment falls short of 100% at low

(calculated) SISBEN scores. This may not only be due to mistargeting, but also to our use of

household survey data (rather than official data) to construct SISBEN scores

        Using our re-coded variable below to instrument for enroll, we then estimate the

following equation by 2SLS:

(4)     outcomeihc = φ + λenrollihc + θSISBENh + ψSISBEN_diffhc + Σkπkestratohk + μc + ξihc,

where the estimate of interest is the estimate of λ.26 Section 5.6 shows that our results are robust

across bandwidths to including higher-order relative SISBEN score polynomials, using

interactions between relative SISBEN scores and simulated eligibility, and excluding county

fixed effects. We also estimate λ using local linear regression without any covariates other than

relative SISBEN score.27

Limitations of the Empirical Strategy

        Although our approach addresses key irregularities in SR implementation, it also has

shortcomings. First, because the ECV and DHS household survey data that we use to calculate

SISBEN scores was collected after official SISBEN classification, our calculations presumably

include measurement error (even absent manipulation of official SISBEN status). Second, our

estimates of county-specific eligibility thresholds presumably do not match those used in practice

exactly, introducing additional noise into the relationship between our measure of simulated

eligibility and actual enrollment. Third, manipulation of official SISBEN scores further weakens

the strength of the first stage relationship. Fourth, our sample sizes are relatively small in the

neighborhood of the eligibility thresholds. Overall, these limitations clearly compromise the


26
   We estimate equations (3) and (4) using linear models; marginal probabilities computed using bivariate probit
models yield similar results to the 2SLS estimates for dichotomous outcomes examined throughout the paper. We
calculate our standard errors clustered by county.
27
   For comparison, we also estimate equation (4) by OLS and show the results at the bottom of our tables.

                                                       17
power of our estimates (few are significant at significance thresholds below α=0.10) and suggest

that our results should also be interpreted as lower bounds.



5. Results

         This section presents empirical evidence on a variety of important behavioral responses

to the SR. We begin by demonstrating that both background characteristics not influenced by the

program and participation in other social programs using SISBEN are balanced across estimated

SR eligibility thresholds. We then investigate the effectiveness of health insurance in protecting

households against financial risk (and possibly changing the optimal composition of household

spending and assets). Next, we study changes in the use of traditionally under-utilized

preventive services in light of the SR’s emphasis on allocative efficiency. In doing so, we also

examine changes in health outcomes that are sensitive to the use of important preventive

services. We then analyze how SR enrollment is related to changes in the use of curative

medicine. To investigate possible behavioral distortions, we also test for reductions in private

health investments (ex ante moral hazard) and insurance ‘crowd-out’ associated with SR

enrollment. Finally, we assess the robustness of our estimates through a variety of additional

parametric and non-parametric specifications.28

5.1 Balance across Discontinuous Eligibility Thresholds

         Our empirical approach assumes that no individual or household characteristics – other

than SR enrollment – that could influence the outcomes of interest vary discontinuously across

our estimated eligibility thresholds. To test this assumption, Table 2 shows results obtained by


28
   As expected, power is lower in all analyses if we use the uniform national threshold rather than estimated county-
specific ones. In contrast to the F statistics shown in our main tables, using the uniform national threshold yields
first stage F statics of 4.7 in the ECV and 18 in the DHS. Even so, many of our key results on health care use and
health outcomes are nonetheless present when we use the uniform national threshold.

                                                         18
estimating equations (3) and (4) for individual attributes that could not reasonably change in

response to SR enrollment (such as age or educational attainment among adults). Consistent with

our assumption, the estimates are not generally distinguishable from zero. (Examining the

distribution of simulated SISBEN scores across eligibility discontinuities, Appendix 3 shows

evidence in support of this assumption as well.)

        We then consider whether or not our estimates from equation (4) could be attributed to

participation in other public programs that also use the SISBEN index. Before investigating this

possibility directly, we first note that it is unlikely because these programs use the uniform

national eligibility threshold, while we estimate and utilize de facto county-specific thresholds

for the SR – many of which fall below the uniform national threshold. To confirm this, we re-

estimate equations (3) and (4) using a dichotomous indicator for participation in these other

programs – including job training, home mortgage subsidies, education vouchers, Hogares

Comunitarios (a large child care program), and services provided by the Instituto Colombiano de

Bienestar Familiar (the largest social welfare agency in Colombia) – as the dependent variable in

equation (4).29 Table 2 presents these results, suggesting that participation in other programs is

also balanced across county-specific SR eligibility thresholds.

5.2 Financial Risk Protection and Portfolio Choice

        Although a key innovation of the SR is its emphasis on allocative efficiency, a central

objective of any health insurance program is to provide protection against financial risk. We

therefore begin by examining the relationship between SR enrollment and both level and

29
  The program Empleo en Acción (a workfare program active in 2003 but abolished in 2004) is the only public
program of which we are aware that used the uniform national SISBEN eligibility threshold for which the 2003
ECV does not contain data. Participation in the program was low (only 7.4% of those in SISBEN strata 1 or 2) and
provided no benefits directly related to health (it paid 60% of the minimum wage to individuals who worked on
official program projects an average of at least 30 hours per week for 2.4 months) (IFS-SEI-Econometria 2005). We
do not have information about participation in Familias en Acción, a Colombian conditional cash transfer program,
but the eligibility threshold for this program (36) is considerably lower, falling more than two standard deviations
below the mean of our estimated SR thresholds.

                                                        19
variability of out-of-pocket medical spending. To construct our variability measure, we first

calculate mean individual spending separately among those enrolled and those not enrolled in the

SR. For each individual, we then measure the difference between each individual’s spending and

the mean among those with the same enrollment status, constructing our variability measure as

the absolute value of this difference. We analyze outpatient and inpatient out-of-pocket spending

(within the past twelve months) separately and emphasize the latter because of idiosyncrasies in

how outpatient spending is reported.30

         We first graphically examine shifts in the distribution of medical spending associated

with simulated eligibility for the SR. Figure 3 shows cumulative density functions for inpatient

medical spending in the preceding year separately for those falling above and below county-

specific thresholds (using our sample of those within two index points of the cutoff).31 Both

distributions are heavily right-skewed, but mass in the distribution for those who are eligible

(those below the threshold) falls to the left of the distribution for those who are ineligible. No

clearly comparable pattern is present for outpatient medical spending (Figure 4). Overall, these

figures suggest that SR eligibility is associated with reductions in right-tail inpatient medical

spending – a pattern consistent with risk protection.32

         The first four columns of Panel A in Table 3 then present econometric results obtained by

estimating equations (3) and (4) for medical spending by type. The first row presents IV
30
   The ECV 2003 question about outpatient spending in the preceding 30 days excludes outpatient costs associated
with illness ultimately leading to hospitalization; the inpatient expenditure question asks about all inpatient spending
in the past 12 months.
31
   These graphs do not correspond exactly to our formal RD estimates for several reasons. One is that they only
include observations with positive expenditures and hence do not capture differential selection into any spending
between those above vs. below the eligibility threshold. Another is that using our bandwidth of two sample, they
depict mean differences between those above vs. below the eligibility threshold (rather than differences between the
two groups as one converges to the threshold from above vs. below). Conducting a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for
equality of distributions, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis of equality, presumably because of these
limitations and small sample sizes when conditioning on any spending. They are nonetheless suggestive.
32
   These figures may understate the magnitude of risk protection under the SR for two reasons: (1) some people may
not receive medical care at all, but nonetheless incur non-medical financial expenses due to poor health, and (2) the
figures show densities by eligibility rather than enrollment status (because enrollment is endogenous).

                                                          20
estimates for SR enrollment, and the second row reports intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates for

simulated SR eligibility (estimates for a dummy variable coding whether or not an individual

falls below the eligibility threshold obtained by OLS regressions of outcomes on this dummy and

the other covariates in equation 4). The first column suggests that SR enrollment lowers mean

inpatient spending by about 60,000 pesos (α=0.10), around a 30% reduction among those using

any inpatient services. Perhaps more importantly for assessing protection against financial risk,

the third column shows that SR enrollment is associated with reductions in the variability of

inpatient medical spending (α=0.05).33 There is no statistically significant association for

outpatient care. Appendix 4 Figure 1 graphically shows all outcomes examined in Panel A across

county-specific eligibility thresholds (essentially, graphical versions of our intent-to-treat

analyses).

         Overall, the results shown in Table 3 Panel A suggest that SR enrollment is associated

with meaningful risk protection benefits. By reducing household exposure to financial risk, SR

enrollment could also produce meaningful changes in the composition of household assets,

human capital investments, and household consumption (i.e., portfolio choice effects).

Specifically, it may increase investments not previously undertaken because of costly informal

risk-management activities (such as precautionary saving). Panel B of Table 3 presents estimates

for durable goods not used to construct the SISBEN index (car and radio ownership) as well as

household education and consumption expenditures. In general, it implies that SR enrollment is

not associated with discernible portfolio choice effects (perhaps because the SR falls short of

providing full insurance).


33
  Although this result is unsurprising given that Colombia’s reform caps the amount that SR enrollees are required
to pay out-of-pocket, it cannot be taken for granted in a developing country context. For example, Wagstaff and
Lindelow (2008) find that health insurance in China increases financial risk due to a combination of poor regulation
and asymmetric information.

                                                         21
5.3 Preventive Service Use and Health Status

        As described earlier, a key innovation of the SR is its focus on improving allocative

efficiency in medical care. In particular, increasing the use of highly beneficial preventive

services – many of which produce large positive externalities – is likely to improve welfare.

These externalities are due both to reduced rates of infectious disease transmission and to

reduced curative care costs borne by others through risk pools.

        The first two columns of Table 4 report estimates for different types of preventive care

use obtained from equations (3) and (4) (Appendix 4 Figure 2 shows graphical versions of the

intent-to-treat analyses). In general, they suggest substantial increases in the use of preventive

health care services.34 Specifically, SR enrollment is associated with a 29 percentage point

increase in the probability of a preventive physician visit in the past year (a 75% increase;

α=0.01). Importantly, the SR is also associated with 1.50 more growth-monitoring and well-care

visits in the past year, a 50% increase relative to uninsured children (α=0.05). These well-care

visits are a principal way of addressing important childhood health problems (parents receive

nutritional advice, iron supplements, and de-worming medications, for example – which are

important for strengthening children’s immune systems and making them less susceptible to

major childhood illnesses such as severe diarrhea and acute respiratory infections/pneumonia).35

        We then investigate whether or not health status has improved under the SR – in

particular, dimensions of health that are sensitive to the use of preventive care. Although our

preventive physician visit variable is not service-specific, our measure of childhood growth and

development checks should correspond directly with infectious disease prevalence. Columns


34
   This increase in preventive care use dominates any ex ante moral hazard (which would reduce prevention –
although Section 5.5 suggests no evidence of ex ante moral hazard).
35
   See Fogel (1994), Santos et al. (2001), Alderman (2007), Currie et al. (2008), Galasso and Umapathi (2009), and
Linnemayr and Alderman (2011) on the relationship between preventive care and child health.

                                                        22
three through six of Table 4 show estimates for child health outcomes linked to preventive care

use. SR enrollment is associated with 1.4 fewer child days absent from usual activities due to

illness in the past month (α=0.05). Enrollment is also associated with an 18 percentage point

reduction in the self-reported incidence of cough, fever, or diarrhea among children in the

preceding two weeks (but it is not statistically significant at conventional levels). Appendix 4

Figure 2 shows graphical versions of the intent-to-treat analyses for these health outcomes as

well.36 Because these health gains can be linked to increases in preventive service use, they are

also likely to improve welfare.

5.4 Use of Curative Medical Care

         As Section 3 discusses, there are a variety of competing incentives and other forces

influencing curative medical care under the SR. These include reductions in out-of-pocket

prices, increases in the use of preventive services, and supply-side incentives for limiting total

medical spending. Predictions about changes in curative service use under the SR – and their

welfare implications – are therefore ambiguous, but they remain a central interest of

policymakers and are important for assessing the costs of Colombia’s innovative health

insurance reform.

         Table 5 reports estimates for various categories of curative care obtained from equations

(3) and (4) (Appendix 4 Figure 3 shows graphical versions of the intent-to-treat analyses). We

find that SR enrollment is associated with a 13 percentage point increase in reported physician

visits because of health problems within the past 30 days (α=0.05). There is no change in use of

curative care among children, which may be due to improvements in child health associated with

36
  Interestingly, for some of the more statistically pronounced results (such as physician visits for preventive care
and children’s healthy days lost due to illness), the graphical pattern of results shown in Figure 2 Appendix 4 closely
resemble the graphical pattern enrollment in the SR shown in Figure 1: a more or less flat relationship to the left of
the threshold, and a monotonic relationship to the right of the threshold. Although suggestive, these shape
similarities must still be interpreted cautiously.

                                                          23
SR enrollment (as Table 4 shows). Finally, there is no meaningful relationship at conventional

significance levels between participation in the SR and hospitalizations.

5.5 Ex Ante Moral Hazard and Insurance Crowd-Out

         Protection from financial risk associated with unexpected illness weakens private

incentives for costly health protection (ex ante moral hazard) (Pauly 1968). Because we find

evidence of greater risk protection, we investigate how protective private health behaviors not

directly linked to medical care change with SR enrollment.37 As Table 6 and Appendix 4 Figure

4 show, however, we find no meaningful change in breastfeeding or maternal investments in

fetal health (alcohol, drug, or tobacco use during pregnancy; or prenatal dietary supplementation

with iron, calcium, or folic acid), suggesting little ex ante moral hazard associated with SR

enrollment.38

         Manipulation of official SISBEN scores suggests that Colombians perceive benefits of

SR enrollment, so we also investigate the possibility that SR enrollment displaces other forms of

explicit health insurance.39 Table 6 also presents intent-to-treat (ITT) estimates obtained by

estimating equation (3) with dichotomous indicators for Regimen Contributivo enrollment, other

forms of health insurance (those for the military, police officers, and certain industrial groups

like oil industry workers, for example), and “uninsurance” as dependent variables. The Regimen

Contributivo estimates are generally small (-0.02 in the ECV and -0.05 in the DHS) and the latter

is statistically significant (α=0.05), suggesting that some modest crowding-out of formal

insurance may have occurred.

37
   More generally, private health behaviors and public health services could theoretically be either complements or
substitutes for publicly provided health services. While reductions in the price of medical care may raise the return
to private health investments given competing risks, cheaper health services could also instead ‘crowd-out’ costly
private health behaviors (Dow, Holmes, Philipson, and Sala-i-Martin 1999, Murphy and Topel 2003).
38
   We cannot rule-out the possibility that social desirability bias in reporting might attenuate a true effect.
39
   Formal sector employees are mandated to enroll in an employment-based health insurance system called Regimen
Contributivo. This mandate holds even for individuals with SISBEN scores falling below the SISBEN eligibility
threshold for the SR.

                                                         24
5.6 Robustness

        To investigate the robustness of our results, we estimate a variety of alternative

parametric and non-parametric specifications based on our main estimating equations. First, we

re-estimate equations (3) and (4) using SISBEN score bandwidths ranging between two and four.

Second, at each bandwidth we estimate specifications that include higher order polynomials of

relative SISBEN scores (including squared, cubic, and fourth power terms) as well as models

that include interactions between relative SISBEN scores and simulated eligibility (although

allowing SISBEN gradients to vary on either side of the eligibility threshold should matter little

given our narrow bandwidth). Third, we re-estimate specifications that do not include county

fixed effects (at each bandwidth), allowing us also to make cross-county comparisons among

individuals with identical simulated SISBEN scores but that fall on opposite sides of county-

specific eligibility thresholds. Finally, we also estimate models using non-parametric local linear

regression.40 As Tables 1-4 of Appendix 5 show that our results are generally robust (with some

variation in precision) across these alternative bandwidths and specifications.

5.7 Heterogeneity and External Validity

While RD estimates can have good internal validity, their external validity is often limited

because they typically utilize a sample only in the neighborhood of the discontinuity (Imbens and

Lemieux 2008, Lee and Lemieux 2010). However, because SR eligibility thresholds vary by

county, our empirical strategy allows us to investigate the external validity of our estimates by

extending equation (4) to include interactions between absolute SISBEN score and SR

  Specifically, we use local linear regression functions with triangle kernels to estimate conditional means of
outcome variables (conditioning on SISBEN_diff) on either side of the eligibility threshold, and we repeat this
estimation process for enrollment in the SR. We then construct Wald statistics using differences in the estimated
conditional means of the outcome variable on either side of the threshold as numerators and the difference in the
conditional mean of SR enrollment on either side of the threshold as the denominator. We estimate our standard
errors using 250 bootstrap replications. Details of the implementation can be found in Nichols (2007).

enrollment.41 This allows us to test for heterogeneity by SISBEN score, a summary measure of

socio-economic status. As Appendix 6 Tables 1-4 show, we find little evidence of

heterogeneous effects, suggesting that our estimates are not sensitive to local variation in

SISBEN scores and may therefore apply to a broader range of the Colombian population.42 We

note, however, that the interaction terms’ standard errors are large, so our power to detect

heterogeneity is limited.



6. Conclusion

        This paper studies the role of Colombia’s Régimen Subsidiado in protecting the poor

against financial risk, influencing their use of health services, and ultimately affecting their

health status. Unusual among middle- and low-income countries at the time of its introduction,

the SR is a publicly-financed health insurance program with features of managed care

emphasizing allocative efficiency that are traditionally only found in wealthy countries. We find

evidence that the SR provides some protection against financial risk and is associated with

greater use of preventive services having positive externalities – as well as with measurable

health gains among children.

        Pinpointing the mechanisms through which complex insurance programs such as SR

work is an important topic of future research. In our case, because preventive services are

generally free regardless of insurance status, one plausible interpretation of the increase in

prevention that we observe links them to the SR’s high-powered supply-side incentives (if



41
   Specifically, we estimate: outcomeihc = φ + λenrollihc + θSISBENh +δ(enrollihc×SISBENh) + ψSISBEN_diffhc +
Σkπkestratohk + μc + ξihc, using belowhc and (belowhc×SISBENh) as instruments. All variables are defined as in
equations (3) and (4).
42
   The fifth row of Appendix 6 Tables 1-4 shows implied effects of Subsidized Regime enrollment evaluated at the
average SISBEN score (45) and their accompanying p-values. The magnitude and significance of these effect sizes
generally match the estimates in Tables 3-6.

                                                       26
providers with capitated contracts believe that prevention is cost-saving). Another potentially

important channel is patient substitution from public to private sector providers contracting with

insurance plans under the SR (if private providers were more likely to supply preventive care).

Although we suspect that these two mechanisms may be most salient, we cannot rule out others

(individual feeling more comfortable going to the doctor when insured, the provision of

insurance making the universal entitlement to preventive care more salient, etc.).

       We conclude by emphasizing that the welfare-improving potential of SR has yet to be

fully realized. For example, a variety of political concessions followed the creation of the SR –

including exemptions from the end of government subsidies as well as requirements that insurers

contract with public facilities for a minimum share of the services that they finance. These

concessions presumably limit the ability of health plans to contract with medical care providers

in ways that best encourage higher quality and lower cost services.

Individual-level “urban” data for those within two SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds from the 2003 ECV and 2005 DHS. Dependent variables are shown at the top of each column. The first row shows 2SLS estimates for enrollment in the Subsidized Regime (SR), instrumenting for
SR enrollment using simulated eligibility. The second row shows reduced-form intent-to-treat estimates for simulated SISBEN score falling below the county-specific eligibility threshold. The third row shows first stage estimates from OLS regressions of Subsidized Regime enrollment on an indicator for

Individual-level “urban” data for those within two SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds from the 2003 ECV and 2005 DHS. Dependent variables are
shown at the top of each column. The first row shows 2SLS estimates for enrollment in the Subsidized Regime (SR), instrumenting for SR enrollment using simulated
eligibility. The second row shows reduced-form intent-to-treat estimates for simulated SISBEN score falling below the county specific eligibility threshold. The third row
shows first stage estimates from OLS regressions of Subsidized Regime enrollment on an indicator for falling below the county-specific eligibility threshold. All
specifications also include SISBEN score, distance from the county-specific threshold, estrato dummy variables, and county fixed effects. Standard errors (clustered by
county) are shown in brackets below each estimate. *p<0.10, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01.

Individual-level “urban” data for those within two SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds from the 2003 ECV and 2005 DHS. Dependent variables are shown at the top of each column. The first row shows 2SLS
estimates for enrollment in the Subsidized Regime (SR), instrumenting for SR enrollment using simulated eligibility. The second row shows reduced-form intent-to-treat estimates for simulated SISBEN score falling below the county-
specific eligibility threshold. Intent-to-treat estimates only are reported for the crowd-out analyses of other insurance types (the last six columns). The third row shows first stage estimates from OLS regressions of Subsidized Regime
enrollment on an indicator for falling below the county-specific eligibility threshold. All specifications also include SISBEN score, distance from the county-specific threshold, estrato dummy variables, and county fixed effects. Standard
errors (clustered by household) are shown in brackets below each estimate. *p<0.10, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01.

                  Appendix 3: Sample Density by Simulated SISBEN Score

        The figure in this appendix plots histograms of simulated SISBEN scores relative to
county-specific eligibility thresholds. Using the ECV 2003, density in the distribution of
relative SISBEN scores evolves smoothly across local thresholds. There are some spikes in
density at other scores (-3, 5, and 7 for example) that we presume to be idiosyncratic noise. 1
In the DHS 2005, we observe similar spikes, but one of them coincides with relative score
-1. The magnitude is comparable to those at other scores (4 and 8, for example) as well as
spikes in the ECV 2003. Given balance on observable characteristics across the eligibility
threshold (shown in Table 2) as well as the fact that county-specific thresholds were not
stipulated or even known ex ante, we believe that it is unlikely that simulated SISBEN
scores are manipulated. We also predict values for more index components when
constructing simulated scores in the DHS 2005 than in the ECV 2003.2




1
  We omit observations with values of exactly zero because our estimation of county-specific eligibility
thresholds (producing the best fit between eligibility and actual insurance coverage (Chay, McEwan, and
Urquiola 2005)) mechanically yields differential density.
2
  In the 2005 DHS, we predict values for two SISBEN components: firm size and per-capita income
(variables measuring these components are available in the 2003 ECV). Additionally, response categories in
the 2005 DHS are coarser for four other SISBEN components: social security, number of rooms, water
source, and sewage disposal. See Appendix 2 for more details.

Individual-level “urban” data used from the 2003 ECV and 2005 DHS. Dependent variables are shown at the top of each column; all estimates are 2SLS estimates for enrollment in
the Subsidized Regime (SR), instrumenting for SR enrollment using simulated eligibility. The first three rows report estimates using samples of individuals within two, three, and
four SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds (respectively). The fourth through sixth rows control for squared, cubic, and fourth power terms of SISBEN scores
using samples of individuals within two, three, and four SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds (respectively). The seventh through ninth rows include
interactions between SISBEN scores and an indicator variable for eligibility according to our calculations. The tenth through twelfth rows do not condition on county fixed effects and
use samples of individuals within two, three, and four SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds (respectively). The thirteenth through fifteenth rows report non-
parametric local linear regression estimates obtained through the following process. First, local linear regression functions (with triangle kernels) are used to estimate conditional
means (conditioning only on SISBEN_diff) of outcome variables on either side of the eligibility threshold. Second, this estimation process is repeated for enrollment in the SR.
Finally, Wald statistics are constructed using differences in outcome variable means on either side of the threshold as numerators and the difference in SR enrollment means on either
side of the threshold as the denominator; 250 bootstrap replications are used to estimate standard errors. All specifications otherwise include SISBEN score, distance from the county-
specific threshold, estrato dummy variables, and county fixed effects. Standard errors (clustered by household) are shown in brackets below each estimate. *p<0.10, **p<0.05,

Individual-level “urban” data used from the 2003 ECV and 2005 DHS. Dependent variables are shown at the top of each column; all estimates are 2SLS estimates for
enrollment in the Subsidized Regime (SR), instrumenting for SR enrollment using simulated eligibility. The first three rows report estimates using samples of individuals
within two, three, and four SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds (respectively). The fourth through sixth rows control for squared, cubic, and
fourth power terms of SISBEN scores using samples of individuals within two, three, and four SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds
(respectively). The seventh through ninth rows include interactions between SISBEN scores and an indicator variable for eligibility according to our calculations. The
tenth through twelfth rows do not condition on county fixed effects and use samples of individuals within two, three, and four SISBEN index points of county-specific
eligibility thresholds (respectively). The thirteenth through fifteenth rows report non-parametric local linear regression estimates obtained through the following process.
First, local linear regression functions (with triangle kernels) are used to estimate conditional means (conditioning only on SISBEN_diff) of outcome variables on either
side of the eligibility threshold. Second, this estimation process is repeated for enrollment in the SR. Finally, Wald statistics are constructed using differences in
outcome variable means on either side of the threshold as numerators and the difference in SR enrollment means on either side of the threshold as the denominator; 250
bootstrap replications are used to estimate standard errors. All specifications otherwise include SISBEN score, distance from the county-specific threshold, estrato
dummy variables, and county fixed effects. Standard errors (clustered by household) are shown in brackets below each estimate. *p<0.10, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01.

Individual-level “urban” data used from the 2003 ECV and 2005 DHS. Dependent variables are shown at the top of each column;
all estimates are 2SLS estimates for enrollment in the Subsidized Regime (SR), instrumenting for SR enrollment using simulated
eligibility. The first three rows report estimates using samples of individuals within two, three, and four SISBEN index points of
county-specific eligibility thresholds (respectively). The fourth through sixth rows control for squared, cubic, and fourth power
terms of SISBEN scores using samples of individuals within two, three, and four SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility
thresholds (respectively). The seventh through ninth rows include interactions between SISBEN scores and an indicator variable for
eligibility according to our calculations. The tenth through twelfth rows do not condition on county fixed effects and use samples of
individuals within two, three, and four SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds (respectively). The thirteenth
through fifteenth rows report non-parametric local linear regression estimates obtained through the following process. First, local
linear regression functions (with triangle kernels) are used to estimate conditional means (conditioning only on SISBEN_diff) of
outcome variables on either side of the eligibility threshold. Second, this estimation process is repeated for enrollment in the SR.
Finally, Wald statistics are constructed using differences in outcome variable means on either side of the threshold as numerators
and the difference in SR enrollment means on either side of the threshold as the denominator; 250 bootstrap replications are used to
estimate standard errors. All specifications otherwise include SISBEN score, distance from the county-specific threshold, estrato
dummy variables, and county fixed effects. Standard errors (clustered by household) are shown in brackets below each estimate.

Individual-level “urban” data for those within two SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds from the 2003 ECV and 2005
DHS. Dependent variables are shown at the top of each column. The first two rows shows 2SLS estimates for enrollment in the Subsidized
Regime (SR) and its interaction with simulated SISBEN score, instrumenting both using simulated eligibility and its interaction with simulated
SISBEN score. The third row shows the coefficient associated with simulated SISBEN score, and the fourth row shows the coefficient associated
with distance from the the county-specific threshold. The fifth row shows the effect of being enrolled in SR for those with a SISBEN score of 45,
computed as the coefficient associated with Enrolled Subsidiado -first row- summed to the multiplication of 45 with the coefficient associated
with (Enrolled Subsidiado)*SISBEN -second row- The sixth row shows the P-value that this effect is null. The seventh row shows the number of
observations. All specifications include estrato dummy variables, and county fixed effects. Standard errors (clustered by county) are shown in
brackets below each estimate. *p<0.10, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01.

Individual-level “urban” data for those within two SISBEN index points of county-specific eligibility thresholds
from the 2003 ECV and 2005 DHS. Dependent variables are shown at the top of each column. The first two rows
shows 2SLS estimates for enrollment in the Subsidized Regime (SR) and its interaction with simulated SISBEN
score, instrumenting both using simulated eligibility and its interaction with simulated SISBEN score. The third
row shows the coefficient associated with simulated SISBEN score, and the fourth row shows the coefficient
associated with distance from the the county-specific threshold. The fifth row shows the effect of being enrolled in
SR for those with a SISBEN score of 45, computed as the coefficient associated with Enrolled Subsidiado -first
row- summed to the multiplication of 45 with the coefficient associated with (Enrolled Subsidiado)*SISBEN -
second row- The sixth row shows the P-value that this effect is null. The seventh row shows the number of
observations. All specifications include estrato dummy variables, and county fixed effects. Standard errors
(clustered by county) are shown in brackets below each estimate. *p<0.10, **p<0.05, ***p<0.01.
