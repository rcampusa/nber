                         The OPEC Surplus and US—LDC Trade



                                     ABSTRACT



      This paper explores the connections between the shift of world saving

 toward OPEC and the changing structure of U.S. trade with the non—oil

 developing countries. The basic point of the paper is that during the

 l970s, the U.S. economy has become more interdependent through trade with

 the newly industrializing countries (NICs) in the developing world. The

 shift of world saving toward OPEC in the l97Os effectively international-

 ized the supply of saving, as OPEC places its surplus in the international

financial system. The NICs and other developing countries borrow the surplus

and direct it to domestic investment. Investment in the NICs stimulates

the demand for U.S. capital goods. The reallocation of resources towards

capital goods production in the U.S. stimulates excess demand for consumer

goods, which appear as imports from the NICs. U.S. exports of capital

goods to these countries have grown rapidly in the 197Os, as have U.S.

imports of non—food, non—auto consumer goods from them. Thus the structure

of U.S. trade has been reoriented to become
                                              complementary with the rapidly—

growing developing countries, and perhaps more competitive with Europe

and Japan.

                   THE OPEC SURPLUS AND US-LDC TRADE


I.   Introduction and Summary

     This paper explores the connections between the shift of world saving

toward OPEC and the changing structure of U.S. trade with the non—oil

developing countries. The basic point of the paper is that during the

1970's, the U.S. economy has become more interdependent through trade

with the newly industrializing countries (NICs) in the developing world.

U.S. exports of capital goods to these countries have grown rapidly, as

have U.S. imports of non—food, non—auto consumer goods. Thus the structure

of U.S. trade has been reoriented to become complementary with the rapidly—

growing developing countries. Formulation of U.S. foreign economic policy

should be sensitive to this change.


     The basic facts are presented in tables in the paper. Tables 1 and 2

show the growth of the developing countries in the 1970's, which was not

slowed appreciably by the OECD recession. Table 5 shows the high level of

investment and rapid growth of the NICs, in particular. The extent of bor-

rowing by these countries is well—known, and the numbers are shown in

Tables 3 and 4.   Essentially, the NICs borrowed the OPEC surplus, invested,

and grew. The changing structure of U.S. trade is shown in Tables 6 through

10. In Table 6 we see the shift of U.S. trade toward surpluses in capital

goods and agriculture that approximately finance the deficit on energy.

In Tables 7 and 8 the growth of U.S. exports of capital goods to the de-

veloping countries is shown. From 1975—1980 these grew at an annual rate

of 11.2 percent in real terms. In 1970, 30 percent of U.S. capital goods

exports went to the developing countries; by 1980 the fraction was 42 per-

cent. In Tables 9 and 10 we see a similar development of U.S. imports of
                                                                    2.




non—food, non—auto consumer goods.

     The paper interprets these changes as follows. The shift of world

saving toward OPEC effectively internationalized the supply of saving,

as OPEC places its surplus in the international financial system. The

ICs and other developing countries borrow the surplus and direct it to

domestic investment. Investment in the NICs stimulates the demand for

U.S. capital goods. The reallocation of resources towards capital goods

production in the U.S. stimulates excess demand for consumer goods, which

appear as imports. Thus the resource shifts as the U.S. make its economy

more complementary to the developing countries, and perhaps more conpetitive

with Europe and Japan.

     The structure of the paper is as follows. In section II we briefly

review models of interdependence, and argue that the channel that allocates

world saving to local investment is increasing in importance.   In section


III we show the pattern of borrowing, investment, and growth in developing

countries. Then in section IV we discuss the changing structure of U.S.

 trade. The numbers give the impression of an economy in the process of re-

 source reallocation toward its comparative advantage in a world of inter-

 action between financial flows and trade.

 II. Models of Macroeconomic Interpndence

      A basic argument of this paper is that the rise of OPEC as a supplier

of world saving has made growth in developing countries less dependent on

 the OLCD countries. In this section we will sketch the basic theoretical

framework for studying interdependence between the OECD (and U.S.) and the

developing countries (DCs). We will focus here on "macro—level" inter-

dependence, to draw a distinction with "structural interdependence" between

the U.S. and the DCs, which is discussed below in section IV.

     By interdependence at the macro level we mean interdependence of

aggregate variables such as GNP or the price level between countries

or regions.   At this level, interdependence can work through many channels.

Movements in demand in one country can spill over into demand for another's

exports, and this in turn can feed back into the country originating the

disturbance. There are in the economics literature models with various

levels of complexity that focus on trade as a channel of interdependence.

Examples are found in Robinson (1952) and Branson—Rotemberg (1980). We

will call these "demand side" links.

     Another family of economic models focuses on the world allocation

of saving and investment through international capital markets. In the

extreme version of this model, with "perfect" capital mobility, all saving

flows into a world pool, and is then allocated to national investment

according to relative expected real rates of return. In this model an

increase in saving in the U.S. would show up as an increase in investment

in the developing countries, but increased investment in the U.S. would

draw capital away from the developing countries. We will call this the

"supply—side" link; a good recent paper giving a sophisticated version
                                                                         4.




is Lipton—Sachs (1980). The rise of OPEC as a world investor with capital

seeking a high and safe return has increased the relevance of this model

in the l97Os.

A.   Demand-side Links
     _______________
     To illustrate the variety and complexity of interdependence through

demand—side links, we will summarize three fairly simple models that analyze

interactions between two countries. The first is a one—commodity purchas-

ing—power—parity model, taken from Branson—Rotemberg (1980). The second is

the two—commodity fixed—price model of Robinson (1952).    The last is the

two—commodity model with flexible prices of B,ranson—Rotemberg (1980). Even

in this overly simplified model the complexities are apparent: it is quite

possible that an increase in demand in one area reduces putput in the

other

1.   One commodity with rigid wages

     We begin by describing the simplest macro model that yields interesting

results for the effects of demand policy. We will just outline the argument

and summarize a results here. Technical details are presented in Branson—

Rotemberg (1980).

        Think of a world of two countries, each producing the same good

 (the "schmoo"). Trade is free, so if the price of the good in the tiforeigni?

 country is P, the price the "home" country must be P =

 rate e simply translates the foreign price into the home price. Suppose
                                                                  real

                                   Europe is a good example ——

 wages are fixed by indexation.    But in the home country money wages
                                                                        5.




 ar fixed by custom or contract in the short run. Finally, let us make

 th standard assption that employers viii expand output and empioent

 if their output price rises relative to the wage rate.


      Consider now what happens if demand is expanded, by monetary or

 fiscal policy in Western Europe. This pulls up wages and prices there,

with no effect on output or employment, demand expansion is purely in-

 flationary. But what happens in the United States? The expansion in

demand in Western Europe spills over into demand for U.S. exports. As

U.S. prices rise relative to wage rates, output and employment rise.

Thus this demand stimulus in Western Europe is purely inflationary there.

It reduces the European trade surplus and the U.S. trade deficit. Fi-

nally, the expansion in Europe increases output and employment in the

U.S. It is easy to see why the U.S. argued for demand stimulus in Europe

in 1976 and the Europeans resisted.


     If, however, money wages were sticky in Europe as well as the U.S.,

the result would be different. The demand stimulus in Europe would raise

prices, output, and employment in both Europe and the U.S. The European

trade surplus and the U.S. deficit would be reduced. This is the model

the U.S. side of the 1976—78 discussion probably had in mind. Branson—

Rotemberg (1980) argue that it is not appropriate for most of Europe,

and Japan, where real wage rates tend to be more sticky.

    What is the effect of growth in the developing countries in this

model? If growth rates increast autonomously in the developing world

(due, perhaps, to an improvement in policy or efficiency), demand for the
                                                                           6.




     exports of both the U.S. and Europe will increase. In Europe, with real

     wage rigidity, this will increase the trade surplus and inflation, but

     not employment or output. In the U.S., with sticky money wages, employ—

     ment and output will rise, as well.


2.      Two commodities with rigid prices
       Another model giving the same general and clear—cut result that a demand

expansion in one country raises output in the others through the trade chan-

nel is the two—country multiplier model of Romney Robinson (1952). In Robin—

son's framework, each country produces a different good, or bundle of goods,

but movements of relative prices are suppressed in the analysis, to focus on

the Keynesian demand—side multiplier mechanism.

       In the Robinson model, each country's imports from the other depends on

its own level of output (and income). Each country's exports are the other's

imports. what is the effect of a policy—induced demand expansion in this

model? Suppose demand is stimulated by fiscal or monetary policy in Europe.

  introduce two goods, then relative price changes should also be considered.

 When    the   possibility is allowed, the situation changes substantially,

 however.

 3.     Two    commodities,   flexible prices

        The Robinson model yields clear—cut results for interdependence by

 assuming fixed prices. In that case the international trade feedbacks                add

 to the standard Keynesian multipliers. However, the assumption of fixed

 prices is crucial. In the last half—dozen years, several papers have noted

 that   with   prices adjustin, the cross—country multipliers       can become
 negative:     a demand   expansion in one   country can lead to a contraction of

 output in another. Branson-Rotemberg (1950)         argue   that this may be an im-

 portant element in the relations between the U.S. and the rest of the major

OECD countries (Europe and Japan).

        We can see how this possibility arises just by studying labor supply

and demand in one country. Consider a situation in which each of two countries

specializes in production of one good, and they trade. The relevant price

level for producers on the demand side of the labor market is the price of

the home good P. However, workers consume both goods, the home good with

price P, and the import with price P. The relevant price level for labor

supply decisions is the CPI, which is weighted average of P and P. Thus

the demand for labor depends on P,; as P rises the demand for labor increases.

The supply of labor is responsive to both P and P. When either rises, the

supply curve shifts up as workers demand higher wages. Equilibrium employ-

ment in this situation is shown no N0 in Figure 2.

      Now consider what happens when demand rises abroad, pulling up P

 This increases the CPI, and reduces the real wage labor receives. This

 "terms of trade effect" shifts the labor supply function in Figure 2 up,

 reducing employment and output at home. Thus it is possible that the demand

 expansion in one country reduces output in the other through the terms—of-

 trade effect. This theoretical possibility was noted by Argy and Salop

(1979) and Sachs (1979), and Branson—Rotemberg (1980) argue that it may be

a reasonable characterization of reaction in western Europe and Japan to ex-

pansion in the U.S.


     The relevance of these results for interdependence between the U.S.

and developing countries results from consideration of the US—Europe—Japan

relationship. Assume for a moment that most developing countries and the

U.S. have sticky money wages, but that Europe and Japan follow the model of

Figure 2. Then an expansion of demand in the U.S. could reduce output in

Europe and Japan. The total effect on demand for the output of the develop-

ing countries would be unclear; it would depend on the weights of the U.S.

vs Europe and Japan on their exports. Similarly, the effect of an expansion

in demand in the developing countries on the U.S. would be unclear. The con—

tractionary result in Europe could outweigh the expansionary effect from the

developing countries.

     These complexities and ambiguities arise in the simplest of models when

we consider carefully supply—side effects. Their empirical importance and rel-

evance for policy are not clear now; research in this area is only beginning.—'

But at least this tells us to beware of        reliance on simple demand—side

multiplier models of trade interaction.

(a) Increase in U.S. saving.

     A policy that increases the U.S. saving ratio would increase the

     world saving pool, and increase investment in developing countries

     and in the U.S. by their marginal shares of the pool.

(b) Increase in U.S. investment.

    An increase in U.S. investment could be achieved by increasing

     the U.S. real rate of return, perhaps through tax incentives.

    Through the world saving—investment channel, this would increase

     investment in the U.S. and reduce investment in the developing

    countries, holding world saving constant. Of course, through

     the demand—side links this might be offset by an expansion of

    income and saving in the U.S., which could also offset the ef-

    fect through the saving—investment channel, but only partially.

(c) Increase in developing country productivity.

    This is the effect studied in detail by Lipton—Sachs (1980) in

    their more sophisticated model of the world saving—investment

    mechanism. An increase in the real rate of return in developing

    countries will shift the allocation of saving toward investment

    in the developing countries, and away from investment in the

    U.S.


(d) Shift in world distribution of income.

    The increase in the real price of oil shifted the world dis-

    tribution of income from the U.S. and developing countries and

    toward the oil—exporters. If we assume that the latter's
                                                                        14.




    saving rate exceeds those of the importers, which seems to be

    the case, this will increase the world saving rate. Invest-

    ment in the developing countries will then rise by their mar-

    ginal share of the world saving pooi. This seems to have been

    an important effect in the 197Os, as developing countries main-

    tained investment and growth rates by borrowing in the euro—

    markets while the OECD world went into stagnation. We will re-

    view this evidence more thoroughly in Section III below.

     In addition to the simple effect of an increase in world saving,

the shift of the locus of saving toward OPEC probably increased the im-

portance of the supply—side link by increasing the international mobility

of capital. The OPEC surplus tends to go to the Eurouiarkets which are

major suppliers of funds to the developing countries.   In a sense, the

shift toward OPEC has increased the degree to which saving and investment

are internationalized. This has weakened the dependence of developing

countries on bilateral links and OECD growth.


     Each of the examples (a) —   (d) discussed the effect of a single shift
in saving or investment. One could combine these to analyze the effects

of simultaneous shifts. In general, the results of combinations of events

in one area for growth in other areas of the world will depend on the

originating area's net draw on the world saving pool.    If a change in

tax policy in the U.S. increases saving and investment, U.S. growth

will increase. If saving rises more than investment, the world saving
                                                                         15.




pool will increase, on balance, and investment will rise in the de-

veloping countries. If an increase in efficiency in the developing

countries raises their saving and investment, their growth rates will

rise. The result for U.S. investment and growth will depend on whether

saving increased more than investment in the developing countries. Thus

an event can, in general, benefit all if it raises saving more than invest-

ment locally, adding to the world saving pool on balance.

III. Empirical Evidence from the 1970s

     The demand—side mode? of section Il—A would lead us to expect that

growth in GNP in developing countries would be closely tied to growth in the

industrial countries. The supply—side model of section lI—B would shift

the focus of interdependence toward the international capital markets. It

would suggest more independence of developing country growth rates from

those of industrial countries, and more dependence in international saving

flows. Here we review the evidence from the 1970s, and conclude that a

shift toward thinking along the lines of the supply—side model is appropriate

for the 1980s.

A.   Real Growth Rates and Terms of Trade

     Table 1 presents a sununary of global growth rates for the period

1950—77. In the data on GNP per capita, we see industrialized countries'

growth rising from 2.5 percent per year in the decade 1950-60 to 4 percent

in 1960—70, and then falling back to 2.4 percent in 1970—77. The low—

income developing countries follow a roughly similar pattern, although

their pattern within the 1960—70 decade was quite different from that of

the industrialized countries. It is interesting to note that the 1950—60

and 1970—77 relation between the growth rates of these two areas rates

is identical.

          he                    countries ehibi a quite different
                 ic—income developing

 p€c, :ever. Their per capita growth rate ro• from 2.8 percent
 ir. thc 1950s to 3.5   cnd   4.0   percent in    the first and second halves of
 the 16Ds, respectively, it then          fell to 3.4 percent in 1970—77.

 Thus n the ]950s the middle—income countries grew at a 2.8 percent

 rate when the industrial countries grew at 2.5 percent. However, in

 the ic7s, the middle—income countriec grew at 3.4 percent with an

 industrial country growth rate of 2.4 percent.

        in the breakdown in the bottom half           of   Table 1, we see that the

 slowdown in the 1970s in the industrial countries was followed In

 Africa, South Asia, and Southern Europe, but not in East Asia or

 latin America. This Is consistent with the middle—income vs. low—

Income experience.


        More detail on growth of real GNP        is   given in Table 2.    There

we see that the 1974—75 recession in the Industrial countries was

followed by the African countries, and perhaps with a year's lag In

Latin   America. Oil—importing developing countries, as agroup, show
a mild growth slowdown in 1974—75, in contrast to the industrial

country recession.Low—income countries experienced the slowdown In

1974, and manufactures importers in 1975. But In general, the data

sw much more stable growth in         real output in the oil—importing

developing countries than In the industrial countries In the 1970s.

     At the bottom of Table 2, we shw fluctuations in the terms of

trade In the industrial countries, OPEC, and non—oil developing

countries.     In 1974 we see the junp on the OPEC terms of trade,

reflected in a drop In the other two areas. The recession of 1975 in
                                                                              18.




the industrial countries raised their terms of trade by 2.5 percent,

at the expense of OPEC and the non—oil developing countries. The

recovery of 1976—77 in the industrial countries reduced their terms

of trade, to the benefit of the other two.          In every year from 1975

to   1978 the non—oil developing countries' terms of trade moved in         the


opposite     direction   to the industrial countries!

      The data of Tables 1 and 2 suggest the following generaliza-

tions.

       (a)   In the 1970s, fluctuations in output in the industrial

             countries   caused similar fluctuations in non—oil developing
             countries' terms of trade.
       (b) Fluctuations in      real   output in the non—oil developing
             countries    were much smaller than those in the industrial

             countries.


       (c)   The middle—income developing countries seemed less sensitive
             to output fluctuations in the industrial countries      than were


             the   low—income countries.
      These generalizations imply         that in the 1970s middle—income

developing countries were able to stabilize output growth relative to

industrial countries' fluctuations, which showed up in movements in

the terms of trade. This would be consistent with the supply—side

model. However, the behavior of the low—income countries seems

relatively more consistent with the demand—side model.

B.   External Borrowing

     The data on external borrowing by developing countries in the 1970s

support this conclusion. Over the period since 1973, the cumulative deficit

of the DCs has approximately equalled the cumulative surplus of OPEC. The

data are shown in Table 3, borrowed from Cohn Bradford (1981). The cum-

ulative OPEC surplus is $453.8 billion, and the cumulative DC deficit is

$415.9 billion. Thus in effect, the developing countries borrowed the

OPEC surplus.

     Details for borrowing by the newly industrializing countries (NICs)

among the developing countries (DC—NICs), and a group of countries iden-

tified by Bradford (1981) as "next tier" NICs are shown in Table 4.

There we show external public debt in billions of dollars and as a per-

cent of GNP, and the debt—service ratio, in 1970 and 1978 (end of year)

for low—income and middle income countries.

     Among the 38 countries listed by the World Bank as "low—income,"

India, Pakistan, and Indonesia were by far the major international debtors

in 1979. Their total of $37 billion in 197 was about 63% of the aggregate

$57 billion for low—income countries; the next largest low—income debtor

in 1979 was Zaire, with $3.8 billion.

     In 1970, India, Pakistan, and Indonesia together owed $13.4 billion

Out of an aggregate of approximately $17 billion for the low—income countries.

Thus during the l970s, among the low—income countries the debt of these

"big three" increased from $13.4 to $37 billion; the debt of the rest of

the 38 countries increased from about $3.6 billion to $19 billion. While

India, Pakistan, and Indonesia remained the major borrowers, intexnatinal

debt finance showed a significant increase among the rest of the low—

income group.

       The really major borrowers in the 1970s were, however, the 52

countries listed by the World Bank as "middle—income." Their total

external public debt was approximately $250 billion at the end of 1979.

These countries all show major debt expansion in the 1970s as they

borrowed to finance investment and growth.



 C.     Investment and Growth

        The data on investment and real GDP growth in the NICs and record—

 tier NICs,     are   summarized in Table 5. We show growth rates of real GD?

 and   gross   domestic investment for the decades 1960—70 and 1970—79.—'

 Investment as a percentage of GD? is shown in the last two columns for

 1960 and 1979.

        In more than half the countries in Table 5, the growth rates of real

CDP and real investment rose in the 1970s relative to the 1960s. In almost

all cases, the growth rate of investment was larger than that of GD? in

the 1970s. And in all cases the investment — GD? ratio was larger in 1979

than in 1960, usually showing a big increase.

       The data thus show a substantial rise in investment in the NICs and

next—tier countries in Table 5, financed by the increase in borrowing

shown in Table 4. These coUntries borrowed the OPEC surplus and invested

it. The result was a maintenance or increase in growth in the l970s in

the face of the OECD slowdown.

                                                which we will call
developed another type of interdependence,

'structural interdependence.' This is the type of interdependence

     Iii U.S. trade, however, there is an

      In its trade with developing countries,

 growing exports    of   capital goods and imports of consutnei goods. As

 the developing countries industrialize, they import U.S. capital

 goods. In 1980 the U.S. surplus on trade in capital goods reached

 approximatelY $45 billion. In exchange, the U.S. imports final

 consumer goods. This is an example of comparative advantage at work,

 making the two sets of econcxnies structurally cczipletnefltarY, or

 interdependent. The result is increasing efficiency, in general, but

 if the process moves too quickly it can generate significant adjust

 ment costs.

consumer goods imports. Section D summarizes.

A.   The Composition of U.S. Trade

      At the end of World War II, the pattern of U.S. trade was distorted

by the fact that industrial capacity had been significantly reduced in

the other major advanced countries. Trade in consumcr goods provides a

good example of this distortion. In every year from 1925 to 1938 the

U.S. was a net importer of consumer goods. But in 1946 the U.S. emerged

from the war as a net exporter, and in 197 the surplus on consumer

goods was $1 billion. As industrial capacity was rebuilt in Europe and

Japan, the surplus sbrank teai1v, and in 1959 the U.S. aain bec&me a

ret importer, with a deficit in consumer goods that has grom steadil':

since then. This example is typical of the pattern we see in the

long—run data on the composition of trade. During the years since 1950

the composition of U.S. trade has moved back toward its longer—run base

of comparative advantage. By the mid—l960s we see growing surpluses in

trade in capital goods, chemicals, and agriculture, and deficits in con-

sumer goods and non-agricultural industrial supplies and materials. Trade

in automotive products switched from surplus to deficit in 1968.     The


evolution of the composition of U.S. trade is discussed in detail in

Branson (1980).

     The U.S. trade position in 1980 is an extension of the trends

detailed there; it is summarized in Table 6. There we show

U.. trade in 1979 and 1980, by major end—use categories. The

patterns of surpluses and deficits are instructive.



         The surpluses in capital goods and chemicals have grown since the

period just after World War II. These are clear areas of comparative

advantage. The deficit on consumer goods we already have discussed;

that on autos has existed since 1968. The deficit on petroleum is ob—

vious, and the agricultural surplus became a major element also around

1974.


        If we aggregate the data slightly differently, we see more clearly

 the post—1974 adjustment in U.S. trade. In 1979, the deficit on trade

 in petroleum of $58 billion was substantially offset by surpluses of

 $18 billion in agriculture and $16 billion in non—petroleum manufac-

tures, leaving a net trade deficit of $24 billion. In 1980, the petro-

leum deficit was $76 billion, but the agricultural surplus was $24 billion

and the manufactures surplus was $30 billion, leaving a net deficit of

$22 billion.


        Thus the petrpleum deficit is largely offset by surpluses in agri-

culture and manufacturing. Within maiiufacturing there is a clear division

by comparative advantage, with a very large and gro'ing surplus in capital

goods and smaller but significant deficits on consumer goods and autos

and a surplus in chemicals. In its trade in manufactured goods the U.S.

is becoming increasingly specialized alorg lines of comparative advantage.

     The U.S. economy has responded to the oil price

generating a $76 billion deficit by 1980, by expanding its trade sur-

pluses along its lines of comparative advantage.   The degree of adjust-

ment is indeed quite remarkable; by 1980 the total trade deficit was

$22 billion. The movement in the real exchange rate helped, improving

the U.S. competitive position. Thus it appears that adjustment has

worked well in the U.S.
                                                                         31.




  B. U.S. Exports of Capital Goods to Developing Countries

       A striking development in U.S. trade in the 1970s was the

  acceleration of growth in capital goods exports and the surplus in

  trade in capital goods, which was nearly $45 billion by 1980.    During
  the mid—1970s there was a quantum jump in U.S. exports of capital

 goods to oil exlxrters and to industrializing developing countries

  rFranson (19O), p. 220]. Growth in capital goods exports to these

 countries continues to increase, and should provide an area of

 strength for U.S. trade on the 1980s. Rapid growth in manufacturing

 capacity in the developing countries is clearly good for the exercise

 of U.S. ccparative advantage in capital goods exports.



      Table 7 presents data on U.S. exports of capital goods, in

 constant 1979 dollars. Table 8 presents the growth rate summary of

 the data in Table 7.   In Table 7 we see rapid growth in spurts through-

out the period since 1965. The period 1965—72
                                                saw fairly steady growth
from $13.6 billion to $24 billion (1979 dollars). Then there was a jump

in three years to $43.5 billion in 1975, a pause to 1977, and then an-

other jump to $67.2 billion in 1980.

     The data for exports to the developing countries show
                                                             differing
patterns of growth in the l970s. To Latin America we see a doubling

of exports in 1972—75, a pause,and another jump in 1977—80. The major

period of growth in exports to the Near East ended in 1976. The

growth in South Asia has been irregular, with a surge in 1976—80.

Southeast Asia resembles Latin America, with the jump in 1972—75, a

pause, and another jump in 1977—80. A peak in Africa was reached

in 1976, with a jump in 1980. The general impression is that exports of

capital goods to the Near East and Africa follow jumps in the oil price,

and that exports to Latin Pnerica and South and Southeast Asia are tied

to growth in manufacturing output in those areas. In 1970, exports to

the developing areas shown in Table 7 were 30 percent of total capital

goods exports; in 1973 this share was 32 percent, and by 1980 it was up

to 42 percent.

     Table 8 gives the growth rate summary for total capital goods.

Let us focus on the period 1973—80. During this period U.S. real GNP

grew at an annual rate of 2.4 percent. In Table 8 we see that total capital

goods exports grew at 11.2 percent, substantially faster than total

real demand. Since the share of exports to developing countries was

rising over the period, they were growing faster yet.   As we run across

the columns in Table 8 for 1973—80, we see that exports of capital goods

to each developing—country area except Africa grew faster than the total.

Thus in the 1970s growth in capital goods exports was much faster than

growth in total U.S. demand, and the share of the developing countries

as a market for capital goods exports grew.   Growth in manufacturing

capacity in the developing countries, based significantly on international

borrowing, appeared as demand for exports of capital goods in the U.S.
                                                                       35.




 C. U.S. Imports of Consumer Goods from Developing Countries

      U.S. imports of non—automotive consumer goods have also grown

 increasingly rapidly in the l970s. By 1980 the overall deficit in

 trade in this category was $18 billion, small in cnparison to the

 capital goods surplus, but still significant. U.S. imports from

 developing countries grew from 25 percent of total non—automotive

 consumer goods imports in 1970 to 52 percent in 1980. Thus as U.S.

 imports of consumer goods fr developing countries grew in the

 l970s, U.S. exports to them provided the basis for expanding these

 consumer good industries. To some extent, the growth of consumer

goods imports in the U.S. released resources to provide for the

expansion of capital goods exports. The U.S. economy became

increasingly interdependent with the economies of the developing

countries through this pattern of growth in trade.


     Table 9 presents the data in U.S. imports of non—automotive

consumer goods, in constant 1979 dollars, and Table 10 gIves the

growth rate suixary of the data in Table 9.

     In Table 9 we see fairly steady growth in total imports of

non—automotive consumer goods except the recession year of 1975 and

the growth recession that began in 1979. In the data for imports

from Latin America we see a quadrupling from 1970—74, a drop in 1975

and more gradual growth since. Imports from the Near East and South

Asia slxw steadier growth paths, with South Asia the steeper. Im—

ports from Southeast Asia doubled from 1970—74, paused in 1975, and

then doubled again to 1980. Imports from Africa increased six—fold

composition of U.S. trade, reviewed in subsection A, has moved in-

 creasingly toward export surpluses in capital goods, agricultural
                                                               and
 goods, and chemicals, with deficits in autos, consumer goods,

 fuels. By 1980, the U.S. had surpluses on the order of $25—30 billion

 on manufactured goods and agriculture.

       In its trade with the developing countries, the U.S. Is increas-

ingly an exporter of capital goods and an importer of consumer goods,

with a surplus on this exchange of about $26 billion in 1980. This

fits well with basic notions of comparative advantage, and it

reflects an efficient re—allocation of resources in the U.S.

       This increase in structural interdependence with the developing

countries also fits nicely into the picture of interdependence at the

macro level. As the industrializing developing countries borrow in-

ternationally to finance growth, they buy capital goods from the U.S.

In turn their manufactured consumer goods find a market in the U.S.

The picture of interdependence through capital markets and through

industrial structure is consistent and probably efficient in the long

run.
