       Optimal Liability When the Injurer's Information

             About the Victim's Loss is Imperfect




                           ABSTRACT




A central result in the economic theory of liability is
 that, if an injurer's liability equals the victim's loss,
 then either the rule of strict liability or the rule of
negligence can induce the injurer to behave properly.
However, for this result to hold, the injurer must know
the victim's loss before the injurer decides whether to
engage in the harmful activity and,    fortiori, before any
harm has occurred. This paper reevaluates the rules of
strict liability and negligence when the injurer's
information is imperfect. Two questions are addressed:
Under each rule, should the level of liability imposed on
the injurer still equal the victim's loss? Are the rules
of strict liability and negligence still equally
desirable? With respect to the first question, it is
demonstrated that the optimal level of liability generally
is     equal to the victim's loss. With respect to the
second question, it is shown that if the injurer's
liability equals the victim's loss, then the two rules are
equivalent, but if liability is set optimally under each
rule, then strict liability generally induces the injurer
to behave in a more appropriate way.

  1. Introduction

      A central result in the economic
                                          theory of liability is that, if an
  injurer's liability equals the victim's loss, then either the rule of strict

 liability or the rule of negligence can induce the
                                                       injurer to behave properly. [1]
  To see why, suppose that injurers differ in ternis of their gains from

 engaging in some harmful activity, and that they all know what the victim's

 loss will be if they do
                           engage in the activity. Under the rule of strict
 liability, an injurer would have to compensate the victim for the loss, so

 that only those injurers whose gains exceed the victim's loss will
                                                                    engage in
 the activity. Under the rule of negligence, an injurer would have to

 compensate the victim only if the injurer is
                                                negligent- -that is, only if his
 gain is less than the victim's loss.
                                         Again, only those injurers whose gains
exceed the victim's loss will
                                 engage in the activity. Thus, either remedy can
induce injurers to behave in a
                                 socially appropriate way. [2J
     Note that the preceding
                               argument requires a strong assumption about the
injurers' information: each injurer must know the victim's loss before he

decides whether to engage in the harmful activity and,
                                                           fortiori, before any
harm has occurred. While it is reasonable to assume that injurers have
                                                                       some
information about what the harm would be, it is not realistic to assume that

this information is always accurate.
                                        For example, even if a schedule of the
losses that would be caused by various
                                         types of driving accidents were

regularly published in newspapers or disseminated in other ways, it is clearly

implausible to assume that drivers would remember
                                                    every detail.
    This paper reevaluates the rules of strict
                                                  liability and negligence when
the injurers' information about the victim's loss is imperfect. Two questions

are addressed: Under each rule, should the level
                                                       liability jjnposed

injurer still eciual     victim's   loss?       rules    strict liability


negligence   still eaually desirable? [3]

     With respect to the first question, it will be demonstrated that the

optimal level of liability generally is i equal to the victim's loss.

Whether the optimal level of liability is above or below the loss depends on

the social desirability of the activity--that is, on whether the average gain

of injurers is less than or greater than the victim's loss.

     To see why this is so, suppose that the court makes the injurer liable

exactly for the victim's loss, which will be referred to as compensatory

damages. [4] Consider the effects of this policy under the rule of strict

liability. If an injurer's estimate of the loss is less than the true loss,

that injurer might be underdeterred- -that is, he might engage in the activity

even though his gain is less than the victim's loss. But if an injurer's

estimate of the loss is above the true loss, that injurer might be

overdeterred- -he might not engage in the activity even though his gain exceeds

the victim's loss. Thus, using compensatory damages leads to two possible

errors.

      Suppose, instead of using compensatory damages, the court adjusts

 compensatory damages upward by some amount. Assuming that injurers

 consequently raise their estimates of their liability, this adjustment

 decreases the number of injurers who will be underdeterred but increases the

 number who will be overdeterred. If the gains of most injurers are below the

 victim's loss--that is, if the activity is socially desirable--then the

 imposition of additional damages results in a net social benefit. Conversely,

 if the activity is socially desirable, then it is optimal to impose less than

 compensatory damages on injurers since the benefit from reducing


                                            2
  overdeterrence is more important than the detriment from increasing

  underdeterrence

       An analogous argument for
                                    adjusting compensatory damages can be made
 under the negligence rule. The main difference results from the fact
                                                                       that,
 under this rule, the injurer
                              expects to be liable only if his gain is less
  than his estimate of the victim's loss. For reasons that will be
                                                                   explained
 below, this difference implies that
                                           upward adjustments to compensatory damages
 will not affect injurer behavior, while
                                                 downward adjustments will have the
 same effects as under strict liability.
                                                 Consequently, if the activity is
 socially desirable, it is optimal under the negligence rule to impose less

 than compensatory damages on injurers.

      The second question- -
                               regarding   the relative desirability of strict
 liability and negligencewjl be answered in two contexts, depending on
 whether the court uses
                          compensatory damages or optimally adjusts compensatory
 damages.

      If compensatory damages are used, then the two rules are equivalent. The

reasoning behind this result is essentially the same as in the opening

paragraph- -both rules will lead an injurer to
                                                     engage in the activity if and
only if his gain exceeds his estimate of the victim's loss.

     However, if the court optimally adjusts
                                                    compensatory damages under each
rule, then strict liability
                               generally is preferred to negligence. The
explanation of this result follows from the
                                                   earlier observation that, under
the negligence rule, upward
                               adjustments to compensatory damages have no
effect, while downward adjustments have the same effects as under strict

liability. Thus, if it is optimal to
                                           adjust compensatory damages downward
under strict liability, negligence can do as well. But if it is optimal to


                                             3
adjust damages upward, strict liability is superior to negligence. Stated

somewhat differently, if the activity is socially desirable, then strict

liability and negligence, with damages less than compensatory damages, are

equally good; but if the activity is socially undesirable, then strict

liability should be used and damages should exceed compensatory damages.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 analyzes strict liability

in a general model. Section 3 illustrates the results of section 2 in an

example. Section 4 compares strict liability and negligence. Section 5

contains some concluding remarks.



2. Strict Liability ft the Ceneral Case
     There are many potential injurers, each of whom obtains some gain from

engaging in the harmful activity. In addition, there is a fixed loss that

will result if an injurer engages in the activity. [5]   Under strict

liability, an injurer will engage in the activity if his gain exceeds his

estimate of the sum of the victim's loss and the adjustment to compensatory

damages. It is assumed that the injurer has a point estimate of the victim's

loss, but knows the adjustment to compensatory damages exactly. [6]

     Social welfare is taken to be the sum of the gains to injurers

 (conditional on their engaging in the activity) less the losses to victims.

The court's problem is to choose an adjustment to compensatory damages that

maximizes social welfare (as well as- -see section 4 below- -to choose whether

                                                      this problem, the court is
 to use strict liability or negligence). In solving

 assumed to know the victim's loss, the distribution of the injurers' gains,

 and the distribution of the injurers' estimates of the victim's loss.

      The following notation will be used in the general case:


                                          4
       g             gain of an injurer

       f(g)          density of gains across injurers (0    g1   g   g2)

       d
                  adjustment to compensatory damages (optimal adjustment is d*)
       W(d)       social welfare

 The population will be normalized so that the total number of potential

 injurers is unity.

       Consider the behavior of an injurer whose gain is g and whose loss

 estimate is 1'. That injurer will engage in the activity if and only if g

exceeds l'-i-d, or, equivalently, if 1' < g-d. [8] Therefore, the fraction of

 injurers with gain g who will engage in the activity is H(g-d), where H(.) is

the cumulative distribution of h(.). Note that, since li is the lowest value

of 1', no injurers with gains less than l1+d will engage in the activity;

similarly, all injurers with gains greater than 12+d will engage in the

activity.

      Social welfare can now be expressed as: [9]

                     12±d                              £2
        W(d) —       J H(g-d)f(g)(g-l)dg
(1)
                 1
                                                +   J f(g)(g-l)dg.
                                                    l2+d
The first term represents the gains less the losses of injurers whose gains

are between l1+d and 12÷d, only some of whom will engage in the activity

(those with sufficiently low loss estimates). The second term represents the

gains less the losses of injurers whose gains exceed 12+d, all of whom will

engage in the activity.

      Alternatively, social welfare can be written as the first-best level of

                                            5
social welfare less the sum of the social losses due to underdeterrence and

overdeterrence: [10]

                            £2
       W(d) =           J f(g)(g-l)dg
                        1
(2)
                            1                                12±d
         -    (   -
                        J H(g-d)f(g)(g-1)dg          +       _/ [l-H(g-d)]f(g)(g-l)dg           ).
                                                             1
                      l14-d
The first term represents the level of social welfare that would result if

injurers were to engage in the activity if and only if their gains exceed the

victim's loss. The second term (the first term in braces) represents the

social loss due to some injurers actually engaging in the activity when their

gains are less than the victim's loss. And the third term represents the

social loss due to some injurers not engaging in the activity when their gains

exceed the victim's loss.

      It is apparent from (2) that a policy of awardingcompensatory damages (d

— 0) will not lead to the first-best level of social welfare since both of the

terms in braces will be positive. In other words, some injurers will be

underdeterred and others overdeterred. It is not clear, however, whether it

is desirable to raise or lower the level of liability, since raising liability

will reduce underdeterrence but increase overdeterrence, and lowering

liability will have the opposite effects.

      Assuming that W(.) is a strictly concave function of d, and that d* is an

interior optimum, the sign of the optimal adjustment to compensatory damages

is determined by the sign of W'(d) evaluated at d =                       0.   From (2), this

condition can be expressed as:

          >                          1                   >           12
 (3) d* — 0 as -                 J h(g)f(g)(g-l)dg       —       J h(g)f(g)(g-1)dg.
                                11                       <       1



                                                 6
  The first integral in (3) is the marginal reduction in the social loss due to

  underdeterrence as d is raised, starting at d —
                                                  0; the second integral is the
  corresponding increase in the social loss due to
                                                              overdeterrence. Therefore,
  whether compensatory damages should be adjusted upwards or downwards (or not

  at all) depends on the relative importance
                                                    of underdeterrence and
  overdeterrence

       Since there is no reason to believe that
                                                           the two integrals in (3) are
 equal, it is generally not optimal under strict liability to use compensatory

 damages without adjustment. However, unless some additional assumptions about

 the form of h(.) and/or f(.) are made, not much can be said about when the

 adjustment should be positive or negative.

      Several alternative assumptions
                                              are sufficient to determine the sign of
 d* from (3). Suppose, for example, that the distribution of the
                                                                 injurers'
 loss estimates, h(.), is uniform.
                                   Then, without assuming anything about the
 distribution of gains across injurers,
                                               f(.), condition (3) can be expressed
as:

                       >                  <
                    d* =       0     as g — 1,
                          <               >
(4)
               —               .12                   .12
        where g —     [    J gf(g)dg ] / [ J f(g)dg 1.
                          ii
In other words, if the injurers'
                                       activity is socially undesirable--their
average gain is less than the victim's loss--then
                                                             compensatory damages should
be adjusted upward, while if the activity is socially desirable,
                                                                 compensatory
damages should be adjusted downward. (To be precise, it is the average gain

of injurers conditional on their gains being within the range of the loss

estimates--between ii and l2--that Is relevant.)


                                               7
    Another interesting special case is when the distribution of the

injurers' loss estimates, h(.), is symmetrical around the true loss. Then, if

the distribution of the injurers' gains, f(.), falls monotonically, the

activity is socially undesirable, and (3) implies that d* > 0.     If,


alternatively, f(.) were to rise monotonically, the activity would become

socially desirable and (3) would imply that d* < 0.

     Note that the analysis of strict liability in this section did not assume

anything about whether there is a systematic bias in the injurers' estimates

of the victim's loss--that is, whether the mean of 1' equals 1. Thus, even if

the mean of 1' equals 1, compensatory damages generally are not optimal under

strict liability. This point will be illustrated by the example in the next

section.



3. Strict Liability in the Double-Discrete Example

     The simplest version of the general model consists of having the

injurers' gains and their estimates of the victim's loss each take on two

values. This will be referred to as the double-discrete example.          Let:


     gl,g2         possible gains of injurers (g2 >   gj > 0)

     q             fraction of injurers whose gains are

         l-e,l+e   possible estimates of victim's loss (equally likely)

Since the average loss estimate equals the true loss, none of the results that

follow are due to a systematic bias among injurers in estimating the victim's

loss.

         In order to have both some underdeterrence and some overdeterrence when

compensatory damages are used in the double-discrete example, it is assumed

 that:


                                            8
  (5)
                         l-e<g<l<g2<l+e
         First consider strict liability with
                                                compensatory damages. Given (5),
  injurers whose gains are g1 will engage in the activity if their estimate of

 the victim's loss is l-e, but not if it is l+e. Therefore, half the injurers

 with gains of g1 will engage in the activity. Similarly, half of the injurers

 with gains of g2 will engage in the activity- -also those whose estimate of the

 victim's loss is 1-e. Thus, social welfare under strict liability with

 compensatory damages (d —      0)   is:

 (6)           W(0) —   .5q(g1-l) + .5(l-q)(g2-l).
         It will be useful to
                                compare this level of social welfare to the level of
 social welfare that would occur in the first-best outcome. In the first-best

 outcome, injurers would engage in the activity if and only if their gains

 exceed the victim's loss- -that is, if their gains are g2, but not if they are

g1 (see (5)). Relative to this outcome, using the rule of
                                                                strict liability
with compensatory damages causes two types of errors. The error of

underdeterrence occurs when injurers with gains of g1 think the victim's loss

is l-e. Compared to the first-best outcome, this error lowers social welfare

by -.5q(g1-].). And the error of overdeterrence occurs when injurers with

gains of g2 think the victim's loss is l+e. This error lowers social welfare

by .S(l-q)(g2-l).

        If compensatory damages are adjusted, then the appropriate expression for

social welfare depends on whether the adjustment, d, is positive or negative.

There are two relevant ranges to consider. [11]

        In the first range, d is positive and high enough to eliminate the

problem of underdeterrence that occurs with
                                                compensatory damages, but not so
high as to worsen the problem of overdeterrence.
                                                      Let d+ refer to any d in


                                            9
this range:

(7)                      0 < g1-(l-e)      d < g2-(l-e).

                                    will not engage in the activity even if their
Now, injurers whose gains are

estimate of the victim's loss is l-e, since (l-e)+d          g•     The behavior of

injurers whose gains are g2 is unaffected; they will still engage in the

activity if their estimate is l-e, and they will still not engage if their

estimate is l+e. Therefore, social welfare will be:

(8)                  W(d+) —   .5(l-q)(g-l).
        Similarly, in the second range, d is negative and low enough to eliminate

the problem of overdeterrence that occurs with compensatory damages, but not

so low as to worsen the problem of underdeterrence.         Let d- refer to any d in

this range:

(9)                    g1-(l+e)   d < g2-(l+e) < 0.

Now, injurers whose gains are g will engage in the activity regardless of

their loss estimate. And injurers whose gains are g still will engage in the

activity only if their estimate is l-e. Then social welfare will be:

 (10)              W(d-) —   .5q(g1-l) +   (l-q)(g-l).
        Since g < 1 and g > 1, it is immediately clear from comparing (6), (8),
 and (10) that both W(d+) and W(d-) exceed W(0). In other words, under the

 rule of strict liability, it is never optimal in this example to use

 compensatory damages.

        Whether compensatory damages should be adjusted upward or downward in the

 double-discrete example can be expressed as follows:

                >                          >
 (11)     W(d+) — W(d-)      as -.5q(g1-l) —        .5(l-q)(g-l).
                <                          <

 This result, which is the analogue to (3) in the general case, has the


                                               10
  following interpretation: An appropriate upward adjustment of compensatory

 damages can eliminate the error of underdeterrence, while an appropriate

 downward adjustment can eliminate the error of overdeterrence. [12] Which

 adjustment is most desirable depends on which error Is more important to

 correct. It was shown previously that, relative to the first-best outcome,
 the welfare loss from underdeterrence is
                                               -.5q(g1-l), and the welfare loss from

 overdeterrence is .5(l-q)(g2-].). Thus, (11) states that compensatory damages

 should be adjusted upward if the welfare loss from underdeterrence exceeds the

 welfare loss from overdeterrence, and downward if the reverse is true.

         It will be useful to provide another formulation
                                                            of (11), which can be
 rewritten as:

                >
 (12)     W(d÷) — W(d-)    as g —    1,   where g — qg1 + (1-q)g2.
                <               >
This    result corresponds to (4) in the general case and has the same

 interpretation: If the injurers' activity is socially undesirable (average

gain less than victim's loss), then compensatory damages should be adjusted

upward, while if the activity is socially desirable,
                                                          compensatory damages
should be adjusted downward. [13]



4. Strict Liability Versus Negligence

        Under the negligence rule, an injurer will be found liable only if his

gain is less than the victim's loss (In contrast to the
                                                             strict liability rule,
under which he would be liable regardless of his
                                                     gain). Thus, for the court
to be able to apply the negligence rule, it is necessary to assume that the

court can determine an injurer's gain after the injurer has engaged in the

harmful activity. But it is still assumed that at the time the court chooses


                                          11
the adjustment to compensatory damages, it only knows the distribution of

gains across injurers. [14]

     If compensatory damages are used under both rules, it is easy see that

strict liability and negligence are equivalent. Consider the behavior of an

injurer whose gain is g and whose loss estimate is 1'. If g is greater than

1', that injurer will believe that he will not be found negligent under the

negligence rule; therefore, he will engage in the harmful activity. The same

behavior would result under strict liability. If g is less than 1', the

injurer will expect to be liable under the negligence rule and to have to pay

1'; consequently, he will not engage in the activity. Again, the same

behavior would result under strict liability. Thus, if damages are

compensatory, both rules will lead an injurer to engage in the activity if and

only if his gain exceeds his estimate of the victim's loss.

     However, if damages are set optimally, then the strict liability rule

generally is preferred to the negligence rule.   To understand why, it is

necessary to examine two cases- -when the adjustment to compensatory damages is

positive and negative.

     First suppose that d is positive, and again consider an injurer whose

gain is g and whose estimate of the loss is 1'. It is easy to see that, under

the negligence rule, the injurer will behave just as if compensatory damages

were used. If g is greater than 1', the injurer will believe that he will not

be found negligent; therefore, he will engage in the harmful activity even

though d is positive. And if g is less than 1', the injurer will expect to be

liable under the negligence rule and to have to pay l'+d; consequently, he

will not engage in the activity regardless of whether d is zero or positive.

Thus, if d is positive, injurers will behave under the negligence rule as if


                                        12
 compensatory damages were used.

      Now suppose that d is negative. It will be shown that an injurer's

 behavior will be the same under
                                   negligence and strict liability. If g exceeds
 1', the injurer will engage in the harmful activity under the negligence rule

 since he will believe that he will not be found negligent. The same behavior

 would result under strict liability when d is negative. If g is less than 1',

 the injurer will expect to be liable under the negligence rule and to have to

 pay l'+d; therefore, he will engage in the activity if and only if g >   l'+d.
 Again, the same behavior would result under strict
                                                      liability. Thus, if d is
 negative, the two rules are equivalent.

      It is now easy to see why strict
                                         liability generally is superior to

negligence when damages are set optimally. Suppose it is optimal under strict

liability to adjust compensatory damages upward. Then strict liability

clearly dominates negligence since every possible adjustment to compensatory

damages under the negligence rule is equivalent to the strict liability rule

with either no adjustment or a
                                  negative adjustment. Suppose, alternatively,
that it is optimal under strict
                                   liability to adjust compensatory damages
downward. Then strict liability and negligence are equally desirable (with

the same downward adjustment under the negligence rule). In general,

therefore, strict liability is preferable to negligence.

     It will be useful to relate this discussion to activities characterized

as socially desirable or socially undesirable (in the
                                                        sense previously used).
If the activity is socially desirable, then strict liability and negligence,

with damages less than compensatory damages, are equally good; but if the

activity is socially undesirable, then strict liability should be used and

damages should exceed compensatory damages.


                                         13
5. concluding Remarks
    This section discusses several points related to the interpretation of

the results and some extensions of the model.

     (a) The results comparing strict liability to negligence may not carry

over with a more realistic characterization of the negligence rule. Suppose,

for example, that injurers are uncertain about what the standard of care is

under the negligence rule, or that the courts make mistakes in observing the

injurer's care. Then each injurer will anticipate being found liable with

some probability and, presumably, this probability would fall as the injurer's

care increases. In this framework, the analysis of the negligence rule could

differ substantially from that presented here. Consider, for example, the

effects of adjusting compensatory damages upward. In the model analyzed in

this paper, such an adjustment had no effect. But in a model in which, under

the negligence rule, injurers would be liable with some probability, there

clearly would be some effects. Moreover, these effects could be quite

beneficial precisely because the probability of liability declines with

injurer care. For example, given any upward adjustment, injurers who take low

care (and who might otherwise be underdeterred) will anticipate a greater

increase in expected liability than injurers who take high care (and who might

otherwise be overdeterred). [15]

      (b) The result that it is generally optimal to adjust compensatory

damages also could be affected in a significant way if the court, as well as

 the injurer, were assumed to have imperfect information about the victim's

 loss. For example, consider the rule of strict liability and suppose the

 court's imperfect information takes the same form as the injurers' imperfect


                                        14
  information. In this framework, it can be shown that
                                                             compensatory damages
 without adjustment are optimal. [16] Thus, a crucial assumption in the

 analysis in the paper is that the court has better information about the loss

 than the injurer. This assumption obviously is more realistic in some

 situations than others. For example, a court may deal with some types of
 harms- - such
                 as automobile accidents- -repeatedly, whereas each
                                                                      injurer may only
 be involved with such harms infrequently, if ever.

      (c) Notwithstanding the preceding two comments, the theory developed in

 this paper is broadly consistent with certain doctrines in American law. For

 example, one doctrine holds that activities classified
                                                              as "ultrahazardous" or

 "abnormally dangerous" should be subject to the rule of strict
                                                                      liability
 rather than the rule of negligence. The
                                                analysis here is consistent with this
principle since it was seen that strict liability is
                                                           superior to negligence
when the activity is socially undesirable. [17]

      (d) The results of this paper can be applied, with some modification, to

the use of taxes, fines, or standards to deal with externalities. The

analysis of taxes and fines would be similar to the analysis of strict

liability. If the party subject to the tax or the fine has imperfect

information about its level, then that party may cause too much harm or too

little harm as a result of the incorrect estimate of the tax or the fine.

Depending on the relative importance of the two types of errors, it generally

will be desirable to set the tax or the fine higher or lower than would be

optimal if the party's information were perfect. The analysis of standards

would be similar to the analysis of negligence since, if the standard is not

complied with, the party subject to the standard often is punished by a

financial penalty. It may be optimal to adjust the penalty (and possibly the


                                           15
standard) if the party subject to the standard has imperfect information about

the penalty (or the standard).

     (e) Allowing for the injurer's information about the victim's loss to be

imperfect has some important general implications for the theory of

externalities. In the more commonly analyzed case in which injurers'

information is assumed to be perfect, it is well known that if an injurer is

made to pay for the victim's harm, then the socially desired behavior of the

injurer will result. A corollary to this proposition is that the injurer's

payment should not depend on whether he is engaging in a socially desirable or

socially undesirable activity. For the reasons shown here, neither of these

conclusions continues to hold if the injurer's information is imperfect.

 Stanford. During its preparation, I had the benefit of comments from Lucian

 Bebchuk, Robert Cooter, Richard Craswell, Edward Golding, Alvin Klevorick,

Rogerson, Daniel Rubinfeld, Steven Shavell, and Ewart Thomas.

      [1] See, for example, Brown (1973). He also considers the victim's

behavior, which is an issue that will not be dealt with here.

      [2] This conclusion may not be correct if injurers are risk averse, or

if their "activity level" (e.g., amount of driving) as well as their "care"

(e.g., speed) affects expected accident losses. These issues will not be

considered here.

     [3] Although these questions have not been addressed before in a model

which emphasizes the imperfect information of the injurer, there are some

closely related studies. Most of these studies focus on whether, under the

rule of negligence, an injurer will meet the standard of care when the injurer

has imperfect information about the negligence standard or when the court has

imperfect information about the injurer's care. See, for example, Diamond

(1974), Golding (1982), Grady (1983), and Craswell and Calfee (1986). Some

attention also has been given to the optimal level of liability and the choice

between strict liability and negligence when there is imperfect information.

See, for example, Calabresi and Hirschoff (1972), Cooter (1982), and Landes

and Posner (1983). Much of this literature recently has been synthesized and

extended in Shavell (1987, esp. Chs. 4.C & 6.C).

     [4] Although reference will be made throughout the paper to "the court,"


                                        17
this is meant in a generic sense to refer to whatever institution is

responsible for choosing the level of liability (including a legislature or an

administrative agency).

     [5] In other words, there is no uncertainty about the likelihood or the

magnitude of the loss. It will become clear that the results will generalize

to a model in which both the probability and the magnitude of the loss may be

uncertain.

     [6] More realistically, one could assume that the injurer also has

imperfect information about the adjustment to compensatory damages. This

generalization would not affect the results of the paper (provided, as seems

reasonable, that the average estimate of the adjustment is positively related

to the actual adjustment).

     [7] It is assumed for convenience that the density of loss estimates

across injurers is independent of the density of gains across injurers.

     [8] There is no loss of generality in assuming that the injurer will not

engage in the activity when his gain equals the sum of the loss estimate and

the damage adjustment.

     [9] The following expression assumes that g < 11 and that g2 > 12. If

these conditions do not hold, it will be obvious how the expression for social

welfare is affected.

     [10] It is straightforward to show from (1) that W'(d) < 0 if d > 1-li

and W'(d) > 0 if d < 1-12. Therefore, lpd* < 1 < 12+d*, making the following

decomposition of (1) well defined for the optimal value of d.

     [11] It will become clear from the analysis below that d in one of these

ranges dominates d outside of these ranges. Therefore, values of d outside of

these ranges will not be considered.


                                        18
         [12] Given the assumptions of the double-discrete example, it is

 possible either to eliminate underdeterrence without worsening overdeterrence,

 or to eliminate overdeterrence without worsening underdeterrence. Of course,

 this will not be true in general.

         [13] Richard Craswell has pointed out to me that the results in this

 section do not depend on the distribution of the injurers' estimates of the

victim's loss. This observation does not, however, apply generally.

         [14] The characterization of the negligence rule in this section is

overly simplistic in several respects. For example, in practice the

negligence rule imposes liability on an injurer with some probability that

depends on the injurer's care; see comment (a) in section 5 below.

         [15] In an earlier version of this paper, each injurer's information

about the victim's loss was characterized as a probability distribution rather

than as a point estimate. In that version, strict liability and negligence

were not equivalent when compensatory damages were used (either rule could

dominate), and negligence was superior to strict liability when damages were

set optimally (essentially for the reason suggested in this comment).

     [16] This result is implicit in Shavell (1987, Ch. 6.C).

     [17] To be more precise, it is strict liability with compensatory

damages optimally adjusted upward that is superior to negligence with optimal

damages when the activity is socially undesirable. Unfortunately, there does

not appear to be any evidence that indicates whether liability for

ultrahazardous or abnormally dangerous activities generally exceeds

compensatory damages. I am indebted to Richard Craswell for raising this

point.
