                                              ABSTRACT

A number of theories have been advanced to explain the size and timing of intergenerational
transfers. One factor only recently explored is the effects of taxes, and in particular the estate tax,
on such transfers. This paper represents the first attempt to explore how capital gains and gift taxes,
in addition to the estate tax, interact to influence incentives in the timing of transfers. Using estate
tax data and exploiting variations in state inheritance, gift, and capital gains tax rates, this paper finds
taxes to be an important consideration in the choice between gifts and bequests. In particular, each
of capital gains and gift taxes are found to be important determinants of the timing of transfers.
These findings are robust to a number of specifications that control for borrowing, charitable
bequests, marital status, and the portfolio composition of wealth transfers.

1. Introduction

       Intergenerational transfers may take place during life, as in inter vivos gifts, or as in

bequests at death. A number of factors may explain the size and timing of these transfers. In

particular, the tax treatment of each of these two modes of transfers may influence how total

transfers are allocated between gifts and bequests. If gifts are accorded a preferential

treatment, then more of transfers may take place during life, and vice versa. Of course, non-

tax factors may also influence this allocation and parents may postpone transfers until death

notwithstanding the tax consequences. Parents my give simply because they enjoy giving and

not care much about timing their giving. Parents can also be strategic and may time their

transfers so as to extract services from their children (Bernheim, Shleifer, and Summers,

1985). Indeed, and despite the income tax incentives for instance, the related literature on

charitable giving shows that little of such transfers take place during life (Joulfaian, 2000a,

Table 14; Joulfaian, 2001, Table 8-7).

       Since the enactment of the gift tax in 1932, the decades’ old conventional wisdom

argued for the superiority of gifts over bequests as a tax minimization strategy. In part, this

reflected the fact that gifts were taxed at statutory tax rates set below those of the estate tax

that applied to bequests. 1 There is little doubt that the wealthy, particularly given resources at

their disposal, are likely to consider differences in estate and gift taxes in allocating their

intergenerational transfers between inter-vivos gifts and bequests. They may also consider the



   1
      Through 1976, gift tax rates were set equal to 75 percent of the estate tax. The intent of
the lower rates was to increase short run federal government revenues by accelerating
transfers; effectively prepaying estate taxes. See Harriss (1940, pp 5).

                                                  1

income tax treatment of such transfers. Gifts, for instance, are subject to a gift tax which

effectively applies at a rate below that of the estate tax levied on terminal wealth. In addition,

recipients of gifts carryover the donor’s (adjusted) basis, and may become subject to capital

gains taxes at the future sale or disposal of the underlying asset. In contrast, and under the

income tax, bequests are accorded a step-up in basis; all gains accrued by the donor avoid

capital gains taxes at death. Few studies, however, have examined the combined effects of all

these taxes on the timing of transfers. Adams (1978) and Kuehlwein (1994), for instance,

explore whether bequest and gift taxes are equalized in the timing of transfers. Bernheim

(1987), Page (2003), Poterba (1998), McGarry (2000), and more recently Bernheim, Lemke,

and Scholz (2001) argue that higher estate taxes encourage gifts.

       The purpose of this paper is to examine the pattern of wealth transfers by the very

wealthy, and gauge the effects of capital gains, gift, and estate taxes in contrast to the current

literature which exclusively focuses on the latter. I trace the tax consequences of transfers and

explore the conditions for the superiority of each of gifts and bequests. Next, I empirically

explore whether taxes influence the allocation of transfers between lifetime gifts and bequests

using information from federal estate tax records. In addition, I employ variations in state

estate, gift, and capital gains taxes, the reduce the identification problem (Feenberg, 1987).

       This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief description of the federal

estate, gift, and income tax treatment of transfers. Section 3 analytically explores how taxes

may influence the choice between gifts and bequests. Gift and capital gains taxes raise the

price of gifts, while the estate tax raises the price of bequests. Thus, two individuals with the

same wealth, even same estate tax rate, may face different incentives in timing their transfers.
                                                 3

Contrary to the decades old conventional wisdom, gifts are not necessarily the superior mode

of transfers, particularly in the case of appreciated assets by donors with short life

expectancies and married individuals, and in the presence of state gift taxes. Section 4

describes estate tax data and construction of variables related to modeling the timing of

transfers. The data provide information on bequests in 1989 and cumulative lifetime gifts.

Individuals required to file estate tax returns roughly represent the top two percent of the

population, and are typically under-represented in survey data. 2 Indeed, estate tax returns

provide the only source of information on cumulative lifetime gifts. The latter is not only

important in modeling the pattern of transfers, but is also critical in calculating tax rates.

Again contrary to the conventional wisdom, many in the sample are worse off under a gift

regime. Section 5 provides empirical evidence on the effects of taxes. These are found to be an

important consideration in determining lifetime gifts (Tables 7-9). Simulation results suggest

that about two-thirds of gifts would not take place if estate and gift taxes were repealed. A

concluding comment is provided in section 6.



2. The Tax Treatment of Transfers

       The estate tax applies to stocks, bonds, real estate, businesses, life insurance proceeds,

and pension assets, among other assets held at death. Estate expenses, outstanding debts,



   2
      The projected net worth of individuals potentially required to file estate tax returns in
1992 was $5 trillion, of which $1.5 trillion is in corporate equity; they represent 1.5 percent
of the population (Johnson, 1998). The comparable figures from the Flow of Funds for the
entire household (and nonprofit) sector are $23 trillion and $2.9 trillion, respectively. The
estate tax filing threshold was $600, 000 in 1992.
                                                 4

spousal bequests and charitable bequests are deductible in computing the taxable estate. In

2001, the tax is computed by applying to the taxable estate a rate schedule that ranges from 18

to 55 percent. A surtax of 5 percent applies to taxable estates between $10 million and $17

million, which has the effect of creating a marginal tax rate of 60 percent, as shown in the first

column of Table 1. 3

       The tax is reduced by a number of credits in computing the final tax liability. The

largest tax credit is the unified credit set at a value of $220,550 in 2001, equivalent to an

exemption of $675,000 ($600,000 for the years 1987-1997). The second largest credit is that

for state death taxes. The credit rate ranges from 0 to 16 percent of the federal taxable estate,

as shown in column 2 of Table 1. It has the effect of reducing the maximum statutory federal

estate tax rate to 39 percent, as shown in the last column of Table 1.

       As in the case of bequests, lifetime gifts are also subject to tax. The gift tax is

integrated with the estate tax sharing a common tax rate schedule, and unified credit. The tax

is computed annually by applying the tax rate schedule to gifts cumulated over life, with a

credit for previously paid gift taxes. An unlimited exemption applies to gifts for tuition and

medical expenses, in addition to an annual exemption of $10,000.

       A unique feature of the gift tax is that it applies on a tax exclusive basis. To illustrate

the implications of this, consider an individual with tax rate of 0.5 and wealth of $300. He

transfers $200 to his children and pays $100 in gift tax, for total transfers of $300; the

effective tax rate is 0.33, or 100/300, and not 0.5 as under the estate tax where the tax liability

gift taxes, see Joulfaian (1998).
                                                  5

would be $150. Also in contrast to the estate tax, it does not provide a credit for state gift

taxes.

         The income tax treatment of transfers varies as well. In the case of bequests, accrued

gains on appreciable assets, such as stock, escape capital gains taxation as the donor’s basis in

assets is stepped up to the value at death. In the case of gifts, the beneficiary retains the

donor’s adjusted basis. 4 Consequently, the donor may have to pay capital gains taxes on assets

liquidated to pay the gift tax. In contrast to the gift tax, liquidating assets to pay the estate tax

does not trigger capital gains taxes.



3. How Taxes Influence the Timing of Transfers

         As eluded to earlier, individuals make transfers for a variety of reasons. The motives

for the size and the timing of such transfers can be altruistic or that parents may derive joy

from giving, and not care much about timing. They can also be strategic as parents consider

the services provided by their children, and more likely postpone much of their transfers.

         Consider a very wealthy individual with wealth W, who wishes to transfer it to his

heirs. Assuming the joy of giving is the primary motivation, this individual may time his

transfers so as to maximize the share of W received by his heirs, but is otherwise indifferent to

the timing. Some of these transfers may take place during life, as in inter-vivos gifts (G), or at

death, as in bequests (B). The total amount received or available to the heirs, T, at a cost of W

to the donor, is:


   4
     This basis, however, is stepped up by the amount of the gift tax paid on the accrued gains
share of the asset transferred.
                                                  6

                                                                                                    (1)

or,


                                                                                                   (1' )




where, " is the share of wealth transferred during life, and PG and PB are the gift and bequest

prices, respectively. Following first order conditions, the individual maximizes the size of

transfers T by setting " at the point where P G/PB= 1. Gifts are more attractive when the

relative price of gifts is less than 1, but beyond this point, bequests become more attractive.

         In the case of the wealthy, the measurement of taxes can get pretty complicated as

much of their wealth is held in the form of business, real estate, or publicly traded stocks

(Eller, 1997). If such wealth is held until death, in year n, the estate tax liability is:


                                                                                                    (2)


where J e is the estate tax rate, B is the rate of return or the rate at which assets appreciate, and

*   is the individual discount rate. From (2), it follows that the price of bequests can be defined

as:


                                                                                                    (3)


as in Boskin (1976), or PB = 1/(1-J e) when B = * .

         If instead, the individual transfers his appreciable wealth to the beneficiaries during

life, or year 0, then the expected tax on gifts in period n will be:
                                                   7




                                                                                                      (4)




where J g is the gift tax rate, J c the capital gains tax rate, $ the share of accrued gains, and D

the probability of dying within three years from the date gifts were made. The first term

reflects the gift tax paid by the donor. The second term reflects capital gains taxes that the

donor may have to pay if assets are liquidated to pay the gift tax. The third term reflects

capital gains taxes expected to be paid by the beneficiary on gains accrued by the donor. 5

Such gains, however, are reduced by gift taxes to avoid double taxation. The fourth term

reflects capital gains taxes on gains accrued by the donee. The fifth term accounts for

additional estate taxes on gifts made within three years of the date of death. If the donor dies

within 3 years, the gift tax itself becomes taxable under the estate tax; gifts lose much of the

benefit of getting taxed on a tax exclusive basis. 6 Equation (4) is derived in Appendix A.

         From (4), it follows that the price of gifts is:



                                                                                                      (5)




   5
       Recall that gifts, unlike bequests, do not benefit from a full step up in basis.
   6
     This equation can be further complicated by introducing borrowing and transferring cash
as a way to avoid capital gains taxes (Auten and Joulfaian, 2001), or endogenizing portfolio
allocation between cash or equivalent and appreciable assets.
                                                 8

Using (3) and (5), the relative price of gifts becomes:




                                                                                                  (6)




When the underlying asset is cash or equivalent, and say pays interest as in the case of bonds

and notes, equation (6) simplifies to: 7




                                                                                                 (6' )



or, in the absence of the three year recapture rule, the more familiar:


                                                                                                (6' ’)


At a tax rate of 0. 55, and using (6' ’), the relative price is 0.67 and gifts are the superior mode

of transfers.

       The advantage of one mode of transfer over another critically depends on the values of

the various parameters in (6). Assume away confiscatory taxes (0#J c< 1, 0#J e< 1, and

0#J g< 1 ), set D = 0, and, for notational convenience, define the denominator in (6) as A:



   7
      Here B may denote the interest rate net of ordinary income taxes. To simplify the
analysis, and to the extent that this tax would apply under the two modes of transfers, I assume
this is equivalent to the rate at which assets appreciate. This is irrelevant in case of (6").
                                                  9




which is unambiguously positive (0#$# 1, 0#J c< 1, 0#J e< 1, and 0#J g< 1). Differentiating the

relative price of gifts with respect to the estate, gift, and capital gains tax rates, respectively,

yields,




The relative price of gifts, rises with capital gains and gift tax rates, and declines with the

estate tax rate. The effects of the various taxes on the relative price are further illustrated in

Figure 1, which assumes J e= J g= 0.55, J c= 0.25, n= 20, $ = 0.5, and B = 0.08.

          To numerically compare the advantages of gifts over bequests, I continue to assume

that assets appreciate at the rate B = 0.08. The capital gains tax rate is set at J c= 0.25, which

approximates the combined state and federal tax rates. Federal statutory estate and gift tax
                                                 10

rates are set at 0.55, or J e= J g= 0.55, and D = 0 except when n# 3 where D = 1. Equation (6) is

evaluated using these parameters. Table 2 reports values for the relative price of gifts for

values of $ ranging from 0 to 1, with values of n ranging from 0 to 40 years. When the

relative price equals one, estate and gift tax prices are equalized; bequests are preferable to

gifts when it exceeds one, and when it is less than one, gifts are preferable. As demonstrated,

the advantages of making bequests, or gifts, depend on the size of accrued gains and the length

of n. Gifts are generally preferable, except when n# 3, but their desirability diminishes with

the size of accrued gains, $ , and n.

         The bottom panel of Table 2 replicates the figures in the top panel but sets the capital

gains tax rate to zero (J c= 0). The reported relative price of gifts drops across the board by as

much as a third. 8 Except in the rare case of instant death, n= 0, gifts are by far superior.

Capital gains taxes, and as already demonstrated in Figure 1, go a long way in bridging the

gap between the tax treatments of gifts and bequests.

         The figures in Table 2 provide a measure of the relative price of gifts in the general

case. They do not account for preferential treatment accorded certain transfers, nor do they

account for state gift taxes. In the presence of state gift taxes the relative price of gifts is

likely to be higher; unlike bequests, they do not benefit from a credit for state taxes. In 1999,

for instance, the maximum combined state and federal estate and gift tax rates in New York

were 0. 60 and 0.76, respectively. 9 If Table 2 were to be updated to reflect these tax


   8
    Note that the outcome can be different within the range of the progressive rate schedule
where gifts are made before wealth appreciates in value.
   9
       The maximum estate and gift tax rate in New York was 0.21 before 2000.
                                                 11

parameters, it would show that gifts are inferior to bequests for any combination of n and $ . 10

         Also the analysis thus far compares bequests to gifts. An alternative strategy may

dictate the postponement of gifts until the death of the second spouse. Given the unlimited

marital deduction under the estate tax and step-up in basis at death, bequests to spouse and the

deferral of gifts can be superior to outright gifts to children. If the individual bequeaths his

wealth to his spouse in period n, who in turn transfers them to the children immediately, the

expected tax on such bequests would be:




                                                                                                   (2' )




where D reflects the probability that the surviving spouse dies within three years (m# 3), when

additional estate taxes apply. The tax price becomes:



                                                                                                    (7)




If the death of the surviving spouse occurs after three years (D = 0), this simplifies to:



                                                                                                   (7' )




   10
        These figures are available from the author upon request.
                                                  12

Comparing (7) and particularly (7’) to (5), it is obvious that PW< PG as the numerator is larger

and the denominator smaller in the latter; holding parameters constant, the optimum strategy

for married individuals is to forego (postpone) gifts. As further demonstrated in Table 3, this

strategy is superior to making of noncash gifts by married couples for any set of values for n

and $ . 11



4. Data Sources and Construction of Variables

          The above suggests that the advantages of lifetime gifts decline with gift and capital

gains taxes, and rise with the estate tax. In addition, they suggest that married individuals may

have the least incentive to make gifts of non-cash assets. To empirically gauge how the

wealthy respond to taxes in the timing of transfers, I employ data drawn from the estate tax

returns of decedents in 1989. The sample is limited to the estates of parents with total assets

in excess of $600,000, the filing threshold in 1989. Estate tax returns provide information on

wealth and its composition. Information is available on assets held, debts, funeral expenses,

and expenses of settling the estate such as attorney, and executor commissions. More

importantly, they also provide information on the cumulative amount of lifetime taxable gifts

made from 1977 through 1989. These gifts are transfers in excess of the annual exemption,

and do not include payments for tuition and medical expenses, all of which are tax free.

Demographic information is available on age of the decedent, marital status, gender, and state

of residency. For this data set, the number and relationship of beneficiaries is also available.



    11
         To clarify the comparison, I focus on n$ 5 and m> 3.
                                                 13

          Wealth is defined as the maximum amount that can be transferred, and is measured as

net worth at death less life insurance proceeds and estate expenses, plus lifetime gifts and gift

taxes. 12 I exclude observations with negative wealth. Business ownership is measured as the

fraction of the estate in the form of farm, noncorporate businesses, and closely held corporate

stock.

          Individual annuitant mortality tables are employed in determining life expectancies and

the probability of dying within three years of the date of the gift. 13 The mortality rates in these

tables are lower than those for the general population. Given that the individuals in this sample

represent the wealthiest segment of society using the latter would overstate the mortality rates

(Poterba, 1997).

          For each individual, the marginal federal estate tax rate is computed by adding $1,000

to wealth using 1987 law and assuming all wealth is transferred to the children at death.

Conversely, the marginal federal gift tax rate is computed assuming all wealth is transferred

during life. The federal capital gains tax rate is set equal to the maximum statutory rate of

0.28.

          Many of the years prior to 1987 represent a transition period. The Economic Recovery

Tax Act (ERTA) of 1981 increased the size of gifts and bequests exempt from taxation, in

steps over six years, from $175,625 in 1981 to $600,000 in 1987. Thus, gifts (or bequests) in

the amount of $600,000 in 1987 would be fully exempt, but would be partially taxable if made


   12
         These gifts are in nominal values as the years when the gifts were made are not known.
   13
     The rates for males and females rates are obtained from the 1983 Individual Annuitant
Mortality (IAM) table from www.soa.org.
                                                 14

in earlier years. Similarly, ERTA lowered tax rates from a maximum of 70 percent down to 50

percent. Thus gifts made in 1981 would be subject to a maximum tax rate of 70 percent, while

gifts or bequests in 1984 would be taxed at a rate of 55 percent. Given these rate differentials,

it is easy to demonstrate the inferiority of gifts and the wisdom of scaling back of such

transfers. While this can be used to debunk the conventional wisdom, one needs to look

beyond the transition period, where many may have postponed gifts, and hence my choice of

1987.

        A common problem encountered in studies of the effects of taxes on economic behavior

is how to identify the tax price effects separately from the effects of income (Feenberg, 1987),

or, in this case, wealth. This problem arises because the marginal tax rate can be determined

by other regressors, wealth in particular, which confounds the measurement of tax effects.

Consequently, I employ state taxes which introduce variations in tax rates independent of

wealth, especially in the case of the gift tax which applies in seven states (see Table 4). 14 In

addition, I employ relative prices constructed with maximum tax rates as instruments, which

should be completely independent of wealth.

        Federal tax rates are augmented with state estate, gift, and capital gains tax rates also in

effect in 1987. 15 For each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, I compute the estate

tax rate net of the federal credit for state death taxes. All jurisdictions tax bequests as they set


   14
      States with gift taxes account for about 17 percent of the national terminal wealth
reported on estate tax returns. See Eller (1997, Table 5, column 2).
   15
       The results reported below change very little when 1989 law, the year of death, is used.
The 1987 and 1989 state and federal laws are similar except for Wisconsin which phased out
its gift tax over the period 1988 through 1992.
                                                15

the federal credit as their minimum tax. In 1987, twenty-five states employed a “pick-up” tax

where the state rate is set equal to the maximum available federal tax credit. 16 The net tax rate

for these jurisdictions is zero. Seven states levied their own estate taxes, while the remaining

19 states levied inheritance type taxes; all employ the federal credit as their alternative

minimum tax. Table 4 provides the maximum estate and gift tax rates for these states, before

applying the federal credit. 17 The capital gains tax rate is set equal to the maximum tax rate in

effect in each of the 51 jurisdictions. These are also reported in Table 4. The combined

federal and state capital gains tax rate is computed as 0.28 + (1-0.28)J , which accounts for the

deductibility of state income taxes.

        The computed tax rates and mortality rates are incorporated in equation (6) to compute

the relative price of gifts. This measure, however, is likely to be sensitive to the composition

of wealth. If wealth is mostly cash or equivalent, then $ = J c= 0 as in (6' ) and (6' ’). Thus, the

price is computed as a weighted average price of cash and noncash transfers using estate

portfolio shares as weights. 18 For non-cash assets, the share of accrued gains ($ ) is set equal




   16
     These states are Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, District of
Colombia, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Nevada, New
Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia,
and Wyoming.

      Detailed estate and gift tax rate schedules are available upon request. Both schedules are
obtained from the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (1987, p. 71).
   18
      Ideally, the share of assets in the estate plus those transferred during life should be used.
The assets composition of the latter, however, is not observed. Anecdotal evidence suggests
that gifts by the very wealthy are more likely to be non-cash in nature. To test for the
robustness of the results, I assume all gifts are cash in an alternative set of estimates.
                                                 16

to 0.5. 19 Furthermore, assets are assumed to appreciate at the rate B = 0.08 over individual life

expectancies.

        The share of wealth held in the form of business assets is employed as a control

variable. Business assets are defined to include farms, noncorporate businesses, and closely

held stock. 20 These assets may represent the source of livelihood of the parent, and thus reflect

some measure of unwillingness to part with them or give up control. Unfortunately, we do not

observe the asset composition of gifts made during life, and consequently the share in terminal

wealth is employed.

        Table 5 provides sample statistics for select variables. For the sample of 2361 estates,

we observe mean wealth of $10.7 million, with a standard deviation of $23. 5 million. The

mean gift is $0.3 million, which represents about 2 percent of wealth. 21 The average age is

77.5 years, measured at 1987 levels, with 45 percent of the individuals widowed. The gift tax

rate is about 55 percent, the estate tax rate is 0.52, and the capital gain tax rate is 31 percent;

the average price of gifts is 0.95. On average, business assets represent about 14 percent of

the gross estate.



   19
       This is based on data from long-term gains realized in 1985 (Auten and Wilson, 1999,
pp. 125). The observed value does not vary with age, contrary to expectations, which perhaps
is a reflection of a portfolio optimization strategy. Following a tax minimization strategy, as in
Balcer and Judd (1987), individuals may sell asset with high basis and hold those with low
basis until death. This assumption is relaxed in sensitivity analyses below.
   20
      Closely held stock includes ownership of a minimum of 20 percent of a firm, publicly
traded or otherwise.
   21
     Recall that these gifts are in excess of the annual exclusion ($10,000 or $3, 000 pre-1982)
and do not include transfers to cover medical and tuition expenses.

5. Empirical Findings

5.1. Basic Statistics

       Columns 2 and 3 of Table 5 provide statistics on the attributes of those with and

without gifts. About 60 percent of the sample, or 1, 433 estates, did not report lifetime gifts.

Their mean wealth is $8 million. On average, these individuals are 74. 4 years old, with 41

percent widowed. In contrast, those who reported gifts are much wealthier and slightly older.

The mean wealth is $14.4 million with mean age of 77.3 years. They are also more likely to

be widowed consistent with the expectations in Table 3. The average gift is about $0.74

million, with a ratio of gifts to wealth of 5.2 percent. The estate and gift tax rates are slightly

larger and the capital gains tax rate slightly smaller, but, given the large standard deviations,

not statistically different from non-donors. Similarly, little variation is observed in the

business share of wealth. Most importantly, the relative tax price of gifts is 0.91, smaller than

the price of 0.98 for non-donors.

       Table 6 provides further detail on the pattern of gifts disaggregated by size of wealth.

The top panel shows the pattern of giving and the associated attributes of donors. The average

gift rises with wealth, but without a clear pattern for the fraction of wealth transferred. When

compared to the tabulations in the middle panel, donors are more likely to be widowed, and

are slightly older. They face higher gift tax rates, but also face higher estate tax rates with

slightly lower capital gains rates. One striking difference between the two groups is that

donors face a lower relative price of gifts than non-donors at every wealth level.

       Turning to all individuals in the sample, the bottom panel of Table 6 shows that the

relative frequency of gifts rises with wealth. In addition, the amount, but not the share of
                                                 18

wealth, transferred during life rises with wealth, consistent with the top panel of Table 6.

These figures also show the share of business assets to rise with wealth.

        Tables 5 and 6 show that those who make lifetime gifts face lower prices of gifts

relative to bequests. Table 7 provides further evidence on the effects of the tax price on the

probability of making gifts. It breaks down the sample by size of the relative price of gifts,

ranging from a price below 0.80 to a price above 1. 15. Over half of those who face a price

below 0.8 provide for lifetime gifts. This fraction gradually declines to a low of 5 percent

when the price is over 1.15, a pattern pointing to the disincentive effects of taxation.



5.2. Multivariate Analyses

        While the above basic statistics, particularly Table 7, suggest that taxes are an

important consideration, I resort to multivariate analysis to shed further light on the

determinants of gifts and gauge the effects of taxes. I estimate a number of equations to

explore the determinants of lifetime gifts, and report the results in Table 8. While the tax

price is the primary variable of interest, the explanatory or control variables include wealth,

marital status, gender, age, number of children, and business ownership.

        Column 1 of Table 8 provides Probit IV estimates of the probability of making gifts.

The instrument is the relative price of gifts measured using the maximum values of state and

federal capital gains, estate and gift tax rates. 22 The estimates in this criterion equation show

that the probability of making gifts rises with wealth. The estimated coefficient is 0.42 with a


   22
     The simple correlation coefficient between the tax price and wealth is 0.57, compared to
0.002 for wealth and the price constructed using maximum tax rates.
                                                19

corrected standard error of 0.04. This suggests that the probability of making a gift rises by

0.15 percentage points for every one percent increase in wealth.

       Married parents are less likely to engage in lifetime transfers than their widowed

counterparts, consistent with theory and the pattern reported in Tables 3 and 6. The estimated

coefficient is -0.22 with standard error of 0.07. When compared to widowed individuals, the

probability of making gifts is 8 percentage points lower. Similarly, male individuals seem the

least likely to give; the estimated coefficient is -0.18 with a standard error of 0.07. Compared

to their female counterparts, the probability of giving is 7 percentage points smaller. The

probability of making gifts rises with age as well, but at a declining rate. The number of

children and business ownership have positive, albeit imprecisely measured, effect on giving.

       Turning to the key finding of interest, the probability of reporting gifts declines with

the relative tax price, consistent with a tax minimization strategy and the pattern observed in

Table 7. The estimated coefficient is -1.16 with a standard error of 0.38. The marginal effect

is -0.43; for every 10 percent increase in the relative price, the probability of making gifts

drops by 4.3 percentage points.

       The second column of Table 8 reports 2SLS estimates of the level of gifts, augmented

with the inverse mill’s ratio and corrected standard errors, following Lee, Maddala, and Trost

(1980) extension of Heckman (1979). The estimated coefficient on the share of wealth

transferred during life seems unaffected by the size of wealth. This is consistent with the

pattern reported in Table 6. As with the Probit estimates, gifts are greatest for widowed

individuals; the fraction of wealth transferred is four percentage points lower for married

individuals. Business ownership and the number of children seem to have little effect on
                                                 20

giving.

          Again highlighting the importance of taxes, the estimated coefficient on the price of

gifts is -0.17 with a standard error of 0.06; the implied elasticity with respect to the price is -

2.9, evaluated at mean values. For the most part, these findings are reinforced in the Tobit

(FIML) estimates reported in the last column of Table 8. The estimated coefficient on price is

-0.15 with a standard error of 0.03, which implies a price elasticity of -2.3.



A. Alternative Estimates

          In the earlier estimates, the price constructed using the maximum values of estate and

gift tax rates was used as an instrument. Now, as an alternative, consider the use of the actual

tax parameters directly. As shown in the first panel of Table 9, the Probit and Tobit

coefficients are slightly smaller than the estimates reported in Table 8 and continue to be

significant, unlike the estimated coefficient in the level equation. Moving to the second panel

of Table 9, however, reveals that the estimates are little affected when the maximum estate and

gift tax rates are used directly in constructing the relative price.

          A primary assumption in the above estimates is that parents choose between

transferring their wealth to their children during life and at death. No allowance is made for

inter-spousal transfers as in (7' ), or the consumption of wealth by the surviving spouse. The

latter may reduce the size of wealth available for intergenerational transfers, and, by reducing

the size of taxable estate, may also lead to an erroneous measure of the tax price. 23 As a


   23
     Note, however, that much of the spousal bequests of the wealthy take the form of trusts
(QTIP) intended to benefit the children. See the last column of Table 9 in Joulfaian (2000a).
                                                21

robustness check on the estimates, and their sensitivity to the treatment of spouses, Table 8 is

reproduced by dropping married individuals from the sample. For the sub-sample of 1,056

widowed individuals, and as shown in panel 3 of Table 9, the estimated coefficients on price

continue to be negative and significant but slightly larger than those reported in Table 8.

       The earlier estimates in Table 8 are also potentially biased if some individuals have

changed their state of residence. In this case, an individual may have made gifts as a resident

of one state but retired and died in another state which is recorded as the state of residence. In

a not too unrealistic example, consider the case of a New York resident, a state with a gift tax,

who makes lifetime gifts and then retires to sunny Florida, a state without a gift tax. The

maximum state and federal gift tax rate in New York is 0.76 compared to 0.55 in Florida;

0.60 and 0. 55 for the estate tax. The data would show a Florida resident to have made lifetime

gifts and lead to an erroneous measure of the gift tax. As a test of the robustness of the above

results, I exclude estates with reported Florida residency, some 293 observations. The

estimated coefficient on the price for this sub-sample, and as shown in panel 4, remain

virtually identical to those reported in Table 8.

       Charitable bequests may also complicate the picture. These transfers are part of the

wealth variable but are not received by the beneficiaries in life or at death. If these transfers

are tax motivated perhaps the treatment thus far is reasonable. Alternatively, individuals may

set aside funds for charity without any consideration for the heirs or taxes (Joulfaian, 2000b).

In this case, both the dependent variable and the wealth variable on the right hand side are

potentially measured with errors. This error can be compounded by the fact that lifetime

charitable contributions, which are not observed, are already excluded from wealth. As a
                                                 22

robustness check on the estimates, wealth is reduced by the full amount of charitable

bequests. 24 As reported in panel 5 of Table 9, the estimated coefficients on the price are

identical to those reported in Table 8.

         To the extent that we do not observe the composition of gifts, the price is potentially

measured with error if this composition deviates from that observed for terminal wealth, used

to construct price measure. In an additional experiment, the price is measured by assuming all

gifts are cash in nature. Such transfers are added to terminal wealth, and the cash share is re-

calculated. 25 Using this alternative measure of price, the estimated coefficients are qualitatively

similar to those reported earlier, albeit larger in absolute value (panel 6).

         Borrowing is another consideration as it represents one approach to avoiding capital

gains taxes (Auten and Joulfaian, 2001). An individual may borrow against his assets without

having to liquidate them, and transfer the proceeds during life. At death, the assets, fully

stepped up, may be sold to settle the debts. To control for such strategy, the regressors in

Table 8 are augmented with the ratio of debts to assets held at death, plus gifts. 26 As can be

seen for the figures reported in panel 7 of Table 9, the basic set of estimates remain

unaffected.

         The federal progressive rate schedule, and the combined nature of the estate and gift

tax, may introduce incentives for early transfers as a means of “freezing” the estate and


   24
        The mean of the dependent variable becomes 0.0219 (se= 0.0631).
   25
        The mean share slightly increases to 0.2874 (se= 0.2376).
   26
      The mean value of this ratio is 0.0401 (se= 0.0894). Large donors during life seem to
carry greater debts.
                                                 23

avoiding estate taxes on future appreciation. Given the aggregate nature of the data, such

behavior may introduce errors in measurement, particularly of wealth. As such, I exclude all

observations with wealth under $3.5 million, some $0.5 million above the level which triggers

the maximum federal tax rate in 1987. Gauging from the estimates reported in panel 8 of

Table 9, this treatment has little effect on the earlier estimates.

         The estimated equations in Table 8 are further replicated by replacing the relative price

of gifts with the maximum gift tax rate (panel 9) and alternatively with the maximum capital

gains tax rate (panel 10). These variables certainly do not capture all the tax consequences of

transfers, especially as they ignore the tax treatment of bequests. However, they are

unaffected by any of the assumptions related to appreciation rates and intergenerational

portfolio preferences made in constructing the relative price. These estimates, which ignore

life expectancies and the interaction between the various taxes implicit in (6) and (6' ), are

qualitatively similar to those reported in Table 8, and continue to highlight the importance of

taxes.



B. Some Simulations

         Using equation (6), I employ the parameters from Table 8 to simulate the effects of a

number of tax regimes on the pattern of gifts observed in the sample. First, I set estate, gift,

and capital gains tax rates to the values reported in Table 5, or 0. 5231, 0.5477, and 0.3140,

respectively. I assume a time horizon of 20 years (n= 20, D = 0), $ = 0.5, and the sample mean

cash share of wealth of 0.28.

         The estimated coefficients in the Tobit equation suggest that repealing estate and gift
                                                 24

taxes would reduce gifts by about 64 percent. Here assets are passed to the heirs free of

capital gains and estate taxes at death, but continue to be exposed to capital gains taxes when

transferred during life as basis is carried over. On the other hand, if, in addition, capital gains

taxes were also repealed, then gift would decline by only 7 percent.

         If instead, gifts were to be taxed on a tax inclusive basis, lifetime transfers would

decline by some 71 percent. This would also require setting the statutory gift tax rate to 110

percent, which is equivalent to an estate tax rate of 52.31 percent on a tax inclusive basis.

While this regime equalizes estate and gift taxes, capital gains taxes continue to apply in the

case of gifts. In contrast, repealing the capital gains tax only (J c= 0) would increase gifts by

64 percent. This change would significantly reduce the price of gifts as shown in the bottom

panel of Table 2. 27

         Not surprisingly, these estimates suggest that estate and gift taxes have significant

implications for lifetime transfers by the wealthy. These estimated effects are in harmony with

the observed historical pattern of gifts. In 1976, for instance, the maximum gift tax rate was

increased from 0.5775 to 0.7, and the estate tax rate reduced from 0.77 to 0.70. In

anticipation of the increase in gift tax rates at the beginning of 1977, gifts increased

substantially in 1976. Gift tax receipts were $1.8 billion in 1976 (1977 fiscal year) compared

to only $0.4 billion in 1975, and $0.16 billion in 1977. 28 Similarly, gift tax receipts in New

York dropped by some 36 percent in 1999 (FY2000), from $125 to $79. 5 million, as the gift

      While the selection variable is not precisely measured, the simulated effects from the
level equation are slightly larger than those derived from the Tobit estimates.

tax expired in 2000. 29

        While these findings suggest that taxes are an important consideration in the timing of

transfers, they are subject to a number of caveats. Because gifts in this data represent

transfers over a lifetime, the resulting aggregation bias may preempt us from accurately

gauging the effects of taxes and determinants of gifts in general. On the other hand, and

notwithstanding the aggregation bias, cumulative lifetime transfers are essential in computing

tax rates. More importantly, they are likely to be more informative than gifts reported in a

single year.



6. Conclusion

        This paper explores the tax treatment of different modes of wealth transfers, with a

special emphasis on the behavioral responses of the rich. It traces the effects of income,

estate, and gift taxes on the price of wealth transfers. Capital gains taxes, in addition to gift

taxes, are shown to significantly raise the cost of lifetime gifts. In contrast to the conventional

wisdom, gifts are not universally superior.

        The empirical results demonstrate that taxes have significant effects on the timing of

transfers. This finding suggests that the wealthy are influenced by taxes in setting their

lifetime transfers, which adds another dimension to the literature on intergenerational

transfers. While addressing how taxes influence the disposition of wealth, however, the paper

does not examine how wealth accumulation itself, and consequently overall transfers, might be

                                            Appendix A


        In the case of the wealthy, who hold very little of their assets in the form of cash,
capital gains taxes may apply in addition to gift taxes. The donor (donee) pays the gift tax,
TG, by selling a fraction of the asset, which also results in capital gains tax T D . The latter is
defined as:

                                                                                                (A1)

or,

                                                                                               (A1' )


where J c is the capital gains tax rate, and $ is the appreciation component or accrued gains
share of the asset. The gift tax paid, TG, depends on the applicable gift tax rate, J g, and the
amount received by the beneficiary, W-TG -TD . The tax is defined as:

                                                                                                (A2)

or,


                                                                                               (A2' )




        Capital gains taxes, T B, may apply at the disposition of the assets by the beneficiaries,
n years in the future. These taxes apply to gains accrued by the donor in the past, and gains
accrued by the donee over n years. As stated earlier, the donee retains the donor’s basis
adjusted for gift taxes. The adjustment is equal to the amount of the gift tax attributable to the
amount of gains accrued by the donor, $ TG. More specifically, the present value of future
capital gains taxes is defined as:


                                                                                                (A3)


or, using (A1' ) and (A2' ),
                                              A-2




                                                                                           (A3' )




where B is the rate at which the asset appreciates, and * the discount rate. The first term
measures the capital gains tax on gains accrued by the donor and the second term the tax on
gains accrued by the beneficiary.
       If the donor dies within three years form the date of making the gifts, the gift tax is
added to the taxable estate, and additional estate taxes may apply. This additional tax, with
probability of D dying within three years, is defined as TE,G= DJ eTG/(1+ * )n.
       The combined sum of capital gains and gift taxes is TD + TG+ TB + TE,G, or:




                                                                                            (A4)
