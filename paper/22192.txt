The quantity theory of money is applied to the paper money regimes of seven of the nine British
North American colonies south of New England. Individual colonies, and regional groupings of
contiguous colonies treated as one monetary unit, are tested. Little to no statistical relationship,
and little to no magnitude of influence, between the quantities of paper money in circulation and
prices are found. The failure of the quantity theory of money to explain the value and
performance of colonial paper money is a general and widespread result, and not an isolated and
anomalous phenomenon.

        The quantity theory of money is applied to the paper money regimes of seven of the nine
        British North American colonies south of New England. Individual colonies, and regional
        groupings of contiguous colonies treated as one monetary unit, are tested. Little to no
        statistical relationship, and little to no magnitude of influence, between the quantities of
        paper money in circulation and prices are found. The failure of the quantity theory of
        money to explain the value and performance of colonial paper money is a general and
        widespread result, and not a rare and isolated phenomenon.

1       Introduction

The British North American colonies were the first Western economies to emit sizable amounts

of paper money—called bills of credit. Colonial legislatures printed bills and placed these bills in

their treasuries. They directly spent these bills on soldiers’ pay, military provisions, salaries, and

so on. Some colonies at various times loaned bills to their subjects who pledged their lands as

collateral. Prior to emitting paper money, the media of exchange used in domestic transactions

consisted of barter, typically involving book-credit or tobacco; personal bills of exchange and

promissory notes; and foreign specie coins. The composition of this media is unknown, though

specie coins were considered scarce (Grubb 2012). Legislature-issued paper monies became an

important part of the circulating medium of exchange in many colonies. No public or private

incorporated banks issuing banknote monies existed in colonial America (Brock 1975; Grubb

2016a; Hammond 1991, pp. 3-67; Newman 2008).

        What explains the value and performance of these paper monies and, with it, the inferred

political and monetary intentions of colonial legislature? An important economic tool of

explanation is the quantity theory of money. The spending and loaning into circulation of sizable

quantities of paper money by colonial legislatures should have affected local prices, and thus the

real value of the paper monies so emitted, through a quantity-theory-of-money mechanism.

       The quantity theory of money, at least a prominent version, takes the equation-of-

exchange identity, MV ≡ PY, as expressed in growth rates, lnM + lnV ≡ lnP + lnY, and by

assuming that lnV and lnY are long-run constants, transforms it into the quantity “theory” of

money [lnP = some constant + lnM]; where M = the money supply, V = the velocity of that

money’s circulation, P = prices in that money, and Y = traded real output (Bordo 1987, Fisher

1912). West (1978) applied this theory separately to four colonies, namely Massachusetts, New

York, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina. He set M equal to the paper money placed in

circulation by each colony and estimated lnPt = some constant + lnMt, including one- and two-

year lags of M to capture delayed transmission effects of M on P. The price index (P) was

expressed in that respective colony’s paper money unit-of-account and was taken from data on

local prices in that respective colony. In the colonies south of New England, he found no

systematic relationship between prices and the quantities of paper monies in circulation—a

puzzling result for the quantity theory of money.

       One question that has not been previously addressed is whether these findings are

indicative of a general and widespread condition or are limited to a few isolated locations. West

(1978) only tested the quantity theory of money on 3 of the 8 mainland colonies south of New

England, comprising only 38.5 percent of the white (free) population therein—as measured in

1770 (Carter, et al. 2006, V, p. 652). In addition, the price indices used by West (1978) were

from the port cities of New York City, Philadelphia, and Charleston, whereas the paper money

used by West (1978) circulated at least throughout the colonies of New York, Pennsylvania, and



                                                                                                    2
South Carolina.

       West (1978) confined his study to New York, Pennsylvania, and South Carolina because,

at that time, price indices were only available in the secondary literature for these colonies. Since

his study in 1978, commodity and exchange rate price information has become available for

other colonies. I use these price data to test the quantity theory of money in the mainland

colonies south of New England where it has not been previously tested, namely in New Jersey,

Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina. I also retest the quantity theory of money for New York

and Pennsylvania, because I use these colonies in regional grouping tests. My applications, along

with those by West (1978), cover 7 of the 8 of the mainland colonies south of New England,

comprising 95.8 percent of the white (free) population therein. The results show whether the

failure of the quantity theory of money, when applied to the paper monies issued by the

American colonies, is a widespread and general phenomena or just an isolated and odd outcome.

       In the process, I construct more geographically diverse price indices for Maryland and

Virginia than the single-port price indices used by West (1978). I also use prices for sterling bills

of exchange drawn on London to create purchasing power parity (PPP) consistent price measures

for each colony, thus providing an additional and alternative specification vehicle. For New

Jersey and North Carolina, PPP prices are the only price measures currently available. I also

provide improved data on the quantities of paper money in circulation for several colonies,

namely for New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia. Finally, I test the quantity theory of money for

regional groupings of contiguous colonies, treating them as one monetary unit. Such has never

been done before. Whether colonial borders mattered to paper money circulation in a quantity-

theory-of-money framework can be explored with these regional-grouping tests.




                                                                                                    3
2      Data Limitations

Statistical testing is limited by the availability of annual data on the amounts of paper money in

circulation and on commodity prices. Paper money emissions began in 1709 in New Jersey and

New York, 1712 in North Carolina, 1723 in Pennsylvania, 1733 in Maryland, and 1755 in

Virginia. Once initiated, with minor exceptions, each colony maintained some amount of its

paper money in circulation through 1774. Annual data on the amounts in circulation, however,

currently exist for New York only after 1745 and for North Carolina only after 1747. For North

Carolina, this evidence ends in 1768 rather than in 1774 as it does for the other colonies. Finally,

commodity price evidence for New York only begins in 1748. Thus, the annual data useable for

New York span from 1748 to 1774, for New Jersey from 1709 to 1774, for Pennsylvania from

1723 to 1774, for Maryland from 1735 to 1774, for Virginia from 1755 to 1774, and for North

Carolina from 1748 to 1768. Out of 308 colony-years when paper money was in circulation,

usable annual data for testing the quantity theory of money on a colony-specific level exist for 74

percent of these years—a reasonably comprehensive coverage. The useable data span for various

colonial groupings, however, is further limited by the extent of their data overlap.

       Besides local commodity price indices, PPP price indices are constructed for each colony.

PPP implies that EXXX = PXX/PUK, namely the exchange rate (EX) of colony XX’s paper money to

pounds sterling must equal the ratio of prices in colony XX, expressed in colony XX’s paper

money (PXX), to prices in England expressed in pounds sterling (PUK). Taking the natural log of

both sides and rearranging terms yields ln(PXX) = ln(EXXX) + in(PUK). Data on EXXX are taken

from McCusker (1978) and Grubb (2015b), and data on PUK are taken from Schumpeter (1938,

p. 35). A PPP version of ln(PXX) is constructed for each colony. It is denoted as ln(PXXX) in all

tables and figures hereafter, see the notes to Appendix Table 1.



                                                                                                     4
       Using the above price and exchange rate data, PPP has been shown to hold for all

colonies where colony-specific commodity price indices exist between that colony and England

and between that colony and all other colonies with commodity price indices, namely for

Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, South Carolina, Montreal, and

Quebec (Grubb 2003, p. 1786; 2005a, p. 1346; 2010, pp. 132-135). If PPP holds for these

colonies, then it is reasonable to assume that it holds for New Jersey and North Carolina when

using the same data sources. Using PPP price indices in the quantity-theory-of-money

framework provides an alternative check on the results using commodity price indices for the

colonies of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia. The exchange rates for

constructing PPP prices come from the prices in local paper money for purchasing sterling bills

of exchange drawn on London (McCusker 1978). As such, PPP prices can be considered as the

local prices of sterling bills of exchange drawn on London, i.e. not that different conceptually

from using local wheat or tobacco prices to create a commodity price index.

       The commodity price indices for New York and Pennsylvania are the same as used by

West (1978), namely from Bezanson, Gray, and Hussey (1935, pp. 6, 433) and Cole (1938, pp.

11, 120-121). These price indices consist of the unweighted averages of 20 commodities for

Pennsylvania and 15 commodities for New York. These commodities are import and export

goods in the port cities of Philadelphia and New York City, respectively.

       For Maryland and Virginia, I construct unweighted price indices from annual data on the

prices of wheat, corn, and tobacco. While these indices involve fewer commodities than the

indices for Pennsylvania and New York, these three commodities are the most ubiquitously

traded local goods in Maryland and Virginia. In addition, I take the raw price data from several

counties spanning each colony. Thus, they represent a more colony-wide price effect than the



                                                                                                   5
single-port price indices West (1978) used for Pennsylvania and New York.2



3       Data Patterns and Estimation Procedures

The data are presented in Appendix Table 2 and displayed by individual colony in Figures 1, 2,

3, 4, 5, and 6. The figures show that movements in the quantities of paper money are not small. If

these movements were only, say, 5, 10, or 20 percent up or down over time, then finding a

systematic relationship between paper money and prices might be difficult given noisy price

data. The movement in the quantities of paper money in all six colonies, however, are large—

doubling, tripling, or even quadrupling up or down over short spans of time. Even given noisy

price data, applying the quantity theory of money should reveal substantial positive relationships

between movements in paper money and prices. However, the figures also show that paper

money and prices do not track each other well. A poor statistically fit seems likely.

                                             [Place Figure 1 Here]

                                             [Place Figure 2 Here]

                                             [Place Figure 3 Here]

                                             [Place Figure 4 Here]

                                             [Place Figure 6 Here]

        The quantity theory of money is a theory about magnitudes. When estimating

relationships between paper money and prices, focusing solely on statistical significance is

misplaced. At best, statistical significance is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition, for the

theory to be a useful explanatory tool. When estimating lnPt = a + blnMt, the quantity theory of

  They are also superior to the price indices used by West (1978, pp. 3-5) for Massachusetts (Boston), where he
found statistically significant and reasonably large associations between paper money and prices.

                                                                                                                  6
money holds perfectly if b = 1 and doesn’t hold at all is b = 0. No one expects the theory to hold

perfectly. Systematic short-run, business cycle-like movements in V and Y, namely deviations

from their assumed constant growth values of lnV and lnY, are expected (Fisher 1912; Lucas

1980). Such movements, however, are limited, especially in the face of large changes in M.

Resource, technological, and production constraints limit how much Y can move, and

transactions costs limit how much V can move. Y or V doubling or tripling over a short span of

years stretches credulity. Given sizable movements in M, b should be relatively large, much

closer to 1 than to 0 for the quantity theory of money to be a useful theory for explaining the

value and performance of M. Therefore, the magnitude of b, and whether it is unbiased and

consistently estimated, is the key concern.3

         To have comparable results, I use the econometric specifications in West (1978, p. 4),

namely lnPt = a + blnMt, including regressions with one- and two-year lags of M, where M = the

paper money supply. See also comparable specifications in Grubb (2004, p. 349) and Rousseau

(2007, p. 267). Out of the 90 regressions run on the six individual colonies and their various

groupings, 77 exhibit serial correlation, see Appendix Table 1. Statistical theory establishes that

coefficients are unbiased and consistently estimated in the presence of serial correlation, but the

standard errors are biased down, thus overstating statistical significance. Because the focus of the

quantity theory of money is on estimating the magnitude of b as an unbiased and consistent

coefficient, regressions uncorrected for serial correlation still have a valid interpretation

regarding b. If b is close to zero, it doesn’t matter whether serial correlation is corrected or not,




3
  The price indices and exchange rates used here are stationary series, see Grubb (2003, pp. 1784, 1786; 2016a, p.
182). From the figures, the money series appear to be non-stationary. If so, then using OLS to regress M on P might
yield spurious results—meaning a non-trivial b where in fact no relationship exists. Therefore, if the OLS estimates
in fact show that b is zero or trivial in magnitude, then we can still be confident that no relationship in fact exists.
Adding a trend to the quantity-theory-of-money specification would by itself invalidate the theory, so none is added.

                                                                                                                       7
the quantity theory of money is not telling us much about the value and performance of colonial

paper monies. In addition, if b is not statistically significant, then we can be certain that it is not

statistically significant whether or not serial correlation is corrected. Regressions uncorrected for

serial correlation still have a valid interpretation for statistically insignificant coefficients.

        Correcting for serial correlation is only relevant to the quantity theory of money if b is

both relatively large and statistically significant. In such cases, correcting for serial correlation is

required to avoid erroneously finding statistical significance where it is not. The regressions in

Appendix Table 1 show that these conditions are not manifest in any of the regressions.

        In any event, for the 77 regressions that exhibit serial correlation, I report regressions that

correct that serial correlation by adding lags of the dependent variable until Durbin’s Alternative

Test for serial correlation fails to reject the hypothesis of no serial correlation. These regressions

are reported immediately below the uncorrected regressions in Appendix Table 1. The effect of

lagged P on these quantity-theory-of-money regressions has an interesting interpretation for the

colonial economy that is explored in section 5 below.



4       Regression Results

Table 1 summarizes the results from the regressions reported in Appendix Table 1 that are

uncorrected for serial correlation. For individual colony-specific tests, only 7 of the 30

regressions have statistically significant coefficients on M—again a biased high count. Only

Pennsylvania and North Carolina have these statistically significant coefficients. Thus, the lack

of any relationship between P and M for New York, New Jersey, Maryland, and Virginia can be

accepted with confidence. For Pennsylvania and North Carolina, the magnitude of the

relationship between P and M for the statistically significant coefficients is trivial. A 10 percent



                                                                                                          8
increase in M corresponds to a 1.1 and 2.1 percent increase P, respectively.

                                            [Place Table 1 Here]

        On the individual colony level among the mainland colonies south of New England, the

lack of positive statistical significant and quantitatively meaningful relationships between the

quantities of paper monies in circulation and prices are a general and widespread phenomena,

and not just confined to the port cities of New York City, Philadelphia, and Charleston. As such,

the quantity theory of money is not a useful tool for explaining the value and performance of

individual colony’s paper money regimes for the colonies south of New England. Correcting for

serial correction cannot change this conclusion.

        Colonies south of New England did not make the paper money of their neighboring

colonies a legal tender within their own jurisdictions. The paper money of each colony was

uniquely and easily distinguishable (Newman 2008). Nevertheless, some scholars have asserted

that paper monies circulated across colonial borders, particularly between New York, New

Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and between Maryland and Pennsylvania.4 One explanation for the

lack of a statistical association between paper money and prices at the individual colony level, as

summarized in Table 1, is that the paper money supply is incorrectly measured. The relevant

paper money supply might be the combination of the paper monies of contiguous colonies. Such

a combination of paper monies could yield a positive statistically significant association of

relevant magnitudes between prices and the quantity of paper money in circulation.

        Table 1 summarizes the results from the regressions in Appendix Table 1 for the

combined paper money supplies of various groupings of colonies. All contiguous pairs of

 For example, see Brock (1975, pp. 87-89, 92-93, 398; 1992, pp. 89-90, 111-113); Michener (1987, pp. 236, 275).
For a debate on the evidence involved, see Grubb (2006a, pp. 46-47, 63-66; 2006b, pp. 487-489, 491-497, 504-505);

                                                                                                                9
colonies in the sample are tested as through the pairs are one monetary unit. The same is done for

all contiguous triplets of colonies in the sample, and for four and five contiguous groupings

running from New York south. The price variables are the unweighted average of the commodity

price indices, and the unweighted average of the PPP price indices, available for each grouping.

Paper money values are converted to be in comparable units, namely Proclamation values, and

price indices are set to 100 in the same year for the colonies so grouped together, see the notes to

Appendix Table 1.

       For contiguous pairs of colonies treated as single monetary units, 9 out of 30 regressions

have statistically significant coefficients on M—again a biased high count. All but one are due to

including Pennsylvania or North Carolina, with their individual colony level statistically

significant coefficient on M, in the pair. As such, little is gained by treating neighboring colonies

as one monetary unit. Only the New York-New Jersey pair adds a new statistically significant

positive coefficient on M beyond what exists on the individual colony level.

       The magnitude of the relationship between P and M for the statistically significant

coefficients among the colonial pairs is trivial. A 10 percent increase in M corresponds to an

average increase in P of between 1.3 and 1.9 percent—the maximum being only 2.8 percent. The

hypothesis that contiguous pairs of colonies formed one monetary unit, and that such mattered to

prices, finds little support in the evidence. As such, the irrelevance of cross-border circulation of

paper monies among contiguous pairs of colonies cannot be rejected with confidence.

       Table 1 also summarizes the results from the regressions in Appendix Table 1 for

contiguous triplet colonial groupings, under the hypothesis that the monetary unit might be larger

than just neighboring colonies. Out of 18 regressions, only 3 have statistically significant

coefficients on M—again a biased high count. All three are due to including Pennsylvania or



                                                                                                   10
North Carolina, with their individual colony level statistically significant coefficient on M, in

their grouping. Thus, nothing is gained by treating contiguous triplets of colonies as one

monetary unit. In addition, the magnitude of the relationship between P and M for the

statistically significant coefficients among the triplets is trivial. A 10 percent increase in M

corresponds to an average increase in P of 2.1 percent—the maximum being only 3 percent.

       Lastly, Table 1 summarizes the results from the regressions in Appendix Table 1 for

contiguous four and five colonial groupings, spanning from New York to Maryland and from

New York to Virginia, under the hypothesis that the monetary unit might be even larger than just

contiguous triplet colonial groupings. Out of 12 regressions, only 3 have statistically significant

coefficients on M—again a biased high count. All three are due to including Pennsylvania, with

its individual colony level statistically significant coefficient on M, in their grouping. Thus,

nothing is gained by larger contiguous groupings of colonies as one monetary unit. In addition,

the magnitude of the relationship between P and M for the statistically significant coefficients

among these larger groupings is trivial. A 10 percent increase in M corresponds to an average

increase in P of 0.9 percent—the maximum being only 1.8 percent. The hypothesis that the

relevant monetary unit extends across numerous contiguous colonies, and that such mattered to

prices, finds little support in the evidence. Again, the irrelevance of cross-border circulation of

paper monies among the colonies south of New England cannot be rejected with confidence.

       The classical quantity of money assumes that lnV and lnY are long-run constants. The

constant term in the regressions in Appendix Table 1 estimates the difference in these long-run

constants, namely [lnV – lnY]. In all 90 regressions this constant term is positive, relatively

large, and statistically significant. In 35 out of the 77 regression that were corrected for serial

correlation this constant term remains positive and statistically significant—the biggest exception



                                                                                                      11
being for New York and for any group that includes New York. Therefore, the conclusion that

lnV > lnY in terms of their long-run growth rates can be accepted with confidence. This is an

important outcome of applying the quantity theory of money to colonial paper money regimes as

it bares on interpretative issues discussed in the next section.

        Finally, the magnitude of the constant term creates an accounting problem. The long-run

growth of colonial Y per capita per year for the relevant period is thought to be between 0 and

0.6 percent (Egnal 1998, p. 43; Mancall and Weiss 1999, pp. 18, 36; McCusker and Menard

1985, pp. 53-58). Thus, the long-run yearly growth rate in Y is approximately the same as the

long-run yearly growth rate of the population. Yearly population growth rates for the relevant

period are approximately 6 percent for New York, 8 percent for New Jersey, 14 percent for

Pennsylvania, 3 percent for Maryland, 5 percent for Virginia, and 7 percent for North Carolina

(derived from Carter, et al 2006, v. 5, pp. 682-687). Using these numbers for lnY and setting

[lnV – lnY] equal to the constant terms in the regressions in Appendix Table 1 yields what might

be considered impossibly high values for lnV. This observation raises the possibly of an

accounting problem in the equation of exchange identity, and thus the possibility that M or P are

incorrectly measured. Such issues are taken up next.



5       Interpretations, Discussions, and Directions for Future Research

        After West (1978) reported his results a number of studies presented alternative

approaches to account for the lack of a meaningful relationship between paper money and prices

in the colonies south of New England.5 Given the above results, these studies are not irrelevant

exercises. They are addressing a widespread and general phenomenon and not some minor and

localized events. I briefly assess these alternative approach to determine the best direction for

future research into what explains the value and performance of colonial paper monies.

       The classical quantity theory of money assumes that lnV and lnY are long-run constants.

Thus, a natural place to start is to relax that assumption and let either lnV or lnY vary in the

short-run to account for changes in M not accounted for by changes in P. Given shocks to M, the

classical quantity theory of money allows for short-run variation in Y and V through a business

cycle-like transition process (Fisher 1912). For the colonies south of New England, increases in

M could be accounted for by short-run increases in Y or short-run decreases in V, such that P is

left unchanged.

       The problem with applying this approach to colonial paper money regimes is one of

magnitudes. The equation of exchange is an identity. The magnitudes must sum up. Finding

statistically significant positive relationships between M and Y, or negative relationships

between M and V, are unimportant if the magnitudes are trivial in the face of large movements in

M. For example, the growth rate of M for New York between 1754 and 1759 averages 47

percent per year, for New Jersey between 1732 and 1762 it averages 66 percent per year, for

Pennsylvania between 1723 and 1760 it averages 83 percent per year, for Maryland between

1764 and 1774 it averages 39 percent per year, and for Virginia between 1755 and 1760 it

averaged 116 percent per year. From the estimates in Appendix Table 1, the growth rate of P in

Pennsylvania is at best 1.4 percent per year, and is zero for New York, New Jersey, Maryland,

and Virginia. To make the equation of exchange identity sum up, the positive growth rates in Y

(or negative growth rates in V) would have to be in the 40 to 116 percent per year range during

these periods in these colonies—an absurd outcome.

       Measuring Y in colonial economies is difficult. Some direct evidence on imports and



                                                                                                    13
exports is available, but the rest of Y has to be conjectured. Using real exports as a proxy for Y

for Pennsylvania, Rousseau (2007) found a statistically significant positive relationship between

M and Y, thus accounting for some of the gap between changes in M and changes in P in the

equation of exchange for Pennsylvania. Given the size of the accounting gap, the amount

accounted for, however, is relatively trivial. Developing better measures of Y, and exploring to

what extent changes in M could increase Y by reducing transactions costs, are in themselves

important pursuits. However, the likelihood that movements in Y can add much to explaining the

value and performance of paper money is doubtful. The magnitudes are too small.

       A similar problem exists when focusing on changes in V as the solution to the lack of a

relationship between M and P. Some scholars have hypothesized that, given how colonial

legislatures structured their paper money, citizens were induced to hold and not spend their paper

money (reduce V) as a direct reaction to increases M, and vice versa. Therefore, lnM = -lnV.

Because the M spent by the legislature would have to be paid back to the legislature in taxes in

the near future, and because M borrowed by citizens from the treasury would have to be paid

back to the treasury with interest in the near future, citizens being paid in M or borrowing M

would not spend it, but simply hold it in order to make these future payments. This possibility is

only a hypothesis because direct evidence on V does not currently exist (Grubb 2005b; Smith

1985a, 1985b, 1988; Wicker 1985).

       Indirect evidence on V, however, indicates that this avenue of research is problematic. No

literary or anecdotal evidence has been found that shows large-scale hoarding of M in the face of

large expansions in M in any of the colonies south of New England. In fact, paper money

suffered substantial wear and tear from excessive hand-to-hand circulation as judged by the

amounts of paper money held in reserve by colonial treasuries to replace worn and torn bills that



                                                                                                     14
could not continue in circulation (Grubb 2016a, pp. 155-156; Hanson 1979). The logic of such

hoarding behavior is also questionable. In many of the colonies, M was put into circulation by

citizens borrowing it from the treasury. That citizens would borrow M and just hold it because

they knew they would have to repay the loan with interest in the near future would be an

irrational act. Finally, the size of hypothesized movements in V needed to fully offset

movements in M is inconsistent with the large positive lnV estimated in the regressions in

Appendix Table 1. How legislatures structured their paper money may matter. Legislatures did

spent substantial amounts of time and legal space detailing how their paper money was to

perform. That structure, however, does not matter in term of changing V in a way to make the

equation of exchange sum up when there is little relationship between M and P.

       Another possible explanation for the lack of relationship between M and P in the classic

quantity theory of money estimation is that M or P are erroneously measured. The recent

demonstration that PPP holds between colonies, and also holds between England and each

colony, indicates that poorly measured prices and exchange rates are likely not the problem

(Grubb 2003, p. 1786; 2005a, p. 1346; 2010, pp. 132-135). While the price data are somewhat

noisy, the market arbitrage that makes PPP hold is consistent with reliable measures of prices

and exchange rates.

       Mismeasurement of M is another issue. For example, equating M with only paper money

misses the possibility that other monies, namely foreign specie coins, were in use. If exchange

rates between paper money and foreign specie coins were fixed, and enough specie monies were

present in the economy, then as paper money increased, specie money would exit the colony in a

perfect one-for-one displacement. This action would leave the total money supply, and thus P,

constant. As a result, increases and decreases in the paper money supply would be unrelated to



                                                                                                  15
changes in prices (McCallum 1992; Michener 1987, 1988, 2015; Michener and Wright 2005,

2006a, 2006b).

       This explanation is problematic for several reason. First, reliable and direct quantitative

data on specie monies do not currently exist, and so the hypothesized effect cannot be

systematically tested. Second, the institutional apparatus needed to execute a fixed exchange rate

regime was not present, and the exchange rate evidence is more consistent with a flexible than a

fixed exchange rate regime. Third, the literary and anecdotal evidence is ubiquitous and

overwhelming in its insistence that specie monies were scarce, and that it was the absence of

specie monies that led to paper money being emitted and not the emission of paper money that

led to specie monies becoming scarce. Finally, efforts to indirectly estimate the level and change

in specie monies for Pennsylvania finds no systematic displacement of specie money by paper

money, and sometimes the opposite, namely that paper money and specie monies moved

together (Grubb 2004, 2006a, 2006b. 2012).

        Mismeasurement of M, however, may still be the culprit, but in a more fundamental way

than just unmeasured components of the money supply. The equation of exchange and the

quantity theory of money assumes a fully monetized economy. Yet, the colonial economy was

far from fully monetized. Many transactions were executed via barter structures, book credits,

personal promissory notes, etc., with no “money” changing hands. These transactions were

priced in the paper money’s unit of account, but with no paper money changing hands to

consummate the trade (for examples see Baxter 1965, Callister Papers, and William Fitzhugh

Ledgers, 1761-1774). Thus, Y and P contain a lot of activity that is not captured by M. The

equation of exchange as an accounting identity is broken at this juncture.




                                                                                                     16
       Increases in M may simply displace barter transactions with little net gain in economic

activity, thus causing little change in P. The small gains in transaction costs that accompany

using M rather than barter structures to execute trades may explain the small increases in Y

associated with increases in M found in some studies (Rousseau 2007). If P is being determined

primarily in trades taking place without the use of M in an economy with little technological or

productivity changes, then P this year should be strongly determined by P from prior years, with

M having little influence.

       This outcome can be seen by comparing the uncorrected with the corrected regressions

for serial correlation reported in Appendix Table 1. Adding lagged values of P as independent

variables until serial correlation is eliminated substantially improves the regression fit in terms of

R2 and F-statistic measures. Adding lagged values of P also biases the coefficients on the other

independent regressors down, in effect lagged P absorbs their influence (Achen 2000). Prices

through time appear to be determined largely by the constancy of the barter part of the economy.

This view implies that the quantity theory of money, and even more generally the equation of

exchange, are not useful tools for explaining the value and performance of colonial paper

monies. No improvement in the measurements of M, P, Y and V, or adding specie monies to M,

will change this. A different evaluative approach is needed.

       Colonial legislature structured their M to be more like a barter asset than a money (that is

as we typically think of money today). Most often M was structured like a zero-coupon bond

with variable and fuzzy maturity dates (Grubb 2016a). M competed with other barter assets and

credits in the economy for how transactions would be executed. As such, explaining M’s value

and performance requires a different approach than that derived from the equation of exchange.

One such approach is to use M in an asset pricing model to track it present value over time as a



                                                                                                   17
real barter asset, and then to measure its market performance against its expected risk-free

present value baseline. This approach has shown promise when applied to the colonial paper

monies of New Jersey, Virginia, and post-Seven Year’s War Maryland (Celia and Grubb 2016;

Grubb 2015b, 2016a, 2016b). Application of this approach to other colonies will have to be

completed before this approach can be considered as a generally superior method for

determining the value and performance of colonial paper monies.



6      Conclusions

For the British mainland colonies south of New England, using a quantity-theory-of-money

framework derived from the equation of exchange, I show that the lack of a statistical and

relevant quantitative relationship between paper money and prices is a general and widespread

phenomena, and not just a limited or rare event. I show this for individual colonies, as well as for

contiguous colonies treated as a single monetary unit.

       These results have several implications regarding the direction of future research. First,

why the British government, as well as some pamphleteers and essayists, failed to grasp that

colonial legislatures, at least those south of New England, could emit more or less paper money

without systematically effecting prices or exchange rates needs to be better explained. Was it just

a case where simplistic and inapplicable theoretical notions trumped the facts on the ground, or

was the information available at the time just not sufficient to see what we see in our quantitative

estimates? Second, what explains the difference in the relationship between paper money and

prices in New England compared with the rest of the colonies south of New England (Officer

2005; West 1978, p. 4)? Were the paper monies structured differently? Did the economies

perform differently? Could an asset-pricing model explain the value and performance of New



                                                                                                    18
England paper money just as well as the quantity theory of money does? Finally, the results here

indicate that the quantity theory of money, and more generally the equation of exchange, are

poor tools for evaluating the value and performance of colonial paper monies. Developing other

approaches, such as asset-pricing models applied to M, would seem warranted. Clearly there are

many puzzles still to solved and room for more research into colonial paper money regimes.

Notes: Data are annual. Standard errors (SE) are in parentheses. The regression specification is taken from West
(1978, p. 4). All regressions were run in Stata. Linear interpolated values are used in the data where necessary.
Colonies are designated by ‘XX‘, where NY = New York, NJ = New Jersey, PA = Pennsylvania, MD = Maryland,
VA = Virginia, NC = North Carolina. For Maryland, M is from the MMGp column in Appendix Table B of Grubb
(2005b) and from Celia and Grubb (2016). For Virginia, M is taken from Grubb (2015b), and for New Jersey from
Grubb (2015a). For New York, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, M is taken from Brock (1975, pp. 82-83, 346-
347, 386-387, 436-437). The M for colony groupings are the simple sum of the individual M for the colonies listed
when converted to face value Proclamation equivalents. Proclamation value was 1.33 paper pounds equaled 1 pound

                                                                                                                  32
sterling. PXX = that colony’s commodity price index expressed in that colony’s paper money unit of account,
respectively. Colony-specific commodity price indices do not yet exist for New Jersey and North Carolina. For
Maryland, PMD is an unweighted price index composed of Talbot and Kent County tobacco, wheat, and corn prices.
The raw data are taken from Clemens (1980, pp. 226-227). For Virginia, PVA is an unweighted price index
composed of York and Rappahannock River Basins tobacco prices, York River corn prices, and James River wheat
prices. The raw data are taken from Carter, et al (2006, v. 5, pp. 682-687). The commodity price index for
Pennsylvania is taken from Bezanson, Gray, and Hussey (1935, p. 433), and the commodity price index for New
York is taken from Cole (1938, pp. 120-121). All price indices are converted to 1766 = 100. PXXX are alternative
purchasing power parity price indices. I construct them as ln(PXXX)t = ln(EXXX)t + ln(PUK)t for each colony. PUK = a
price index of English consumer goods in pounds sterling taken from Schumpeter (1938, p. 35). EXXX = the price of
sterling bills of exchange drawn on London in each colony’s paper money unit-of-account. EX is considered the
exchange rate of a colony’s paper money to pounds sterling. These exchange rates, divided by 100, are taken from
McCusker (1978), and for New Jersey form Grubb (2015b). Using PXNY adds one more observation year (1747) to
the New York data compared with using PNY. I converted Virginia’s paper money to the face value of the other
colonies’ paper monies by multiplying its face value by 1.062—0.8 times the face value of Virginia’s paper money
equal pounds sterling which equals 0.7533 times the face value of the other colonies’ paper monies at their
Proclamation value. Proclamation value was 1.33 paper pounds being equal to 1 pound sterling. The same is done to
Maryland’s post-1765 exchange rate to pounds sterling (EX MD) and to Virginia’s exchange rate to pounds sterling
(EXVA). Maryland paper money post-1765 was denominated in Spanish silver dollars. I converted it into Maryland
paper money pre-1766 that is denominated in Maryland pounds by multiplying the post-1765 money by 0.2987. One
Maryland pound pre-1766 equaled 0.7533 pounds sterling at face value. A Spanish silver dollar equaled 0.225
pounds sterling. The complete grouping of New York through North Carolina was not estimated because of reduced
degrees of freedom.
          Regressions with zero lags are OLS results unadjusted for serial correlation. All regressions were tested
using Durbin’s Alternative Test for serial correlation. When the hypothesis of no serial correlation could not be
rejected, lags of the dependent variable were added to the specification (coefficients not reported) until Durbin’s
Alternative Test for serial correlation failed to reject the hypothesis of no serial correlation above the 0.1 level.
These corrected regressions are reported immediately below the zero-lag regression only for regressions where serial
correlation could not be rejected. See text for discussion of what the lagged dependent variable is likely capturing.
