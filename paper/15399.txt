                                               ABSTRACT

To construct a business cycle model consistent with the observed behavior of asset prices, and study
the effect of shocks to aggregate uncertainty, I introduce a small, time-varying risk of economic disaster
in a standard real business cycle model. The paper establishes two simple theoretical results: first,
when the probability of disaster is constant, the risk of disaster does not affect the path of macroeconomic
aggregates - a "separation theorem" between macroeconomic quantities and asset prices in the spirit
of Tallarini (2000). Second, shocks to the probability of disaster, which generate variation in risk premia
over time, are observationally equivalent to preference shocks. An increase in the perceived probability
of disaster leads to a collapse of investment and a recession, an increase in risk spreads, and a decrease
in the yield on safe assets. To assess the empirical validity of the model, I infer the probability of disaster
from observed asset prices and feed it into the model. The variation over time in this probability appears
to account for a significant fraction of business cycle dynamics, especially sharp downturns in investment
and output such as 2008-IV.

1      Introduction
The empirical …nance literature has provided substantial evidence that risk premia are time-varying (see
for instance Campbell and Shiller (1988), Fama and French (1989), Ferson and Harvey (1991), Cochrane
(2005)). Yet, standard business cycle models such as the real business cycle model, or the DSGE models
used for monetary policy analysis, largely fail to replicate the level, the volatility, and the cyclicality of
risk premia. This seems an important neglect, since empirical work suggests a tight connection between
risk premia and economic activity. For instance, Philippon (2008) and Gilchrist and Zakrajsek (2007)
show that corporate bonds spreads are highly correlated with real physical investment, both in the time
series and in the cross-section. A large research, summarized in Backus, Routledge and Zin (2008),
shows that the stock market, the term premium, and (negatively) the short rate all lead the business
cycle.1
     I introduce time-varying risk premia in a standard real business cycle model, through a small, sto-
chastically time-varying risk of economic “disaster”, following the work of Rietz (1988), Barro (2006),
and Gabaix (2007). Existing work has so far been con…ned to endowment economies, and hence does not
consider the feedback from time-varying risk premia to macroeconomic activity. I prove two theoretical
results, which hold under the assumption that a disaster reduces total factor productivity (TFP) and
the capital stock by the same amount. First, when the risk of disaster is constant, the path for macro-
economic quantities implied by the model is the same as that implied by a model with no disasters,
but a di¤erent discount factor           . This “observational equivalence” (in a sample without disasters) is
similar to Tallarini (2000): macroeconomic dynamics are essentially una¤ected by the amount of risk or
the degree of risk aversion. Second, when the risk of disaster is time-varying, an increase in probability
of disaster is observationally equivalent to a preference shock. This is interesting since these shocks
appear to be important in accounting for the data, according to estimation of DSGE models with mul-
tiple shocks such as Smets and Wouters (2003). An increase in the perceived probability of disaster
can create a collapse of investment and a recession, as risk premia rise, increasing the cost of capital.
Demand for precautionary savings increase, leading the yield on less risky assets to fall, while spreads
on risky securities increase. These business cycle dynamics occur with no change in current or future
total factor productivity.
     Quantitatively, I …nd that this parsimonious model can match many asset pricing facts - the mean,
volatility, and predictability of returns - while maintaining the basic success of the RBC model in
accounting for quantities. This is important since many asset pricing models which are successful in
endowment economies do not generalize well to production economies (as explained in Jermann (1998),
Lettau and Uhlig (2001), Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2008)). This second shock also substantially
increases the correlation between asset prices (or risk premia) and economic activity, making it closer
to the data.
     One obvious limitation of the paper is that the probability of disaster is hard to observe. As an
empirical exercise, I infer the probability of disaster from asset prices. I then feed into the model this
estimated probability of disaster. The variation over time in this probability appears to account for a
    1 Schwert   (1989) and Bloom (2008) also show that stock market volatility negatively leads economic activity.

signi…cant fraction of business cycle dynamics, and it especially helps matching sharp downturns.
       This risk of an economic disaster could be a strictly rational expectation, or more generally it could
re‡ect a time-varying belief, which may di¤er from the objective probability - i.e., waves of optimism
or pessimism (see e.g. Jouini and Napp (2008)). For instance, during the recent …nancial crisis, many
commentators, including well-known macroeconomists2 , have highlighted the possibility that the U.S.
economy could fall into another Great Depression. My model studies the macroeconomic e¤ect of such
time-varying beliefs.3 This simple modeling device captures the idea that aggregate uncertainty is
sometimes high, i.e. people sometimes worry about the possibility of a deep recession. It also captures
the idea that there are some asset price changes which are not obviously related to current or future
TFP, i.e. “bubbles”, “animal spirits”, and which in turn a¤ect the macroeconomy.
       Introducing time-varying risk premia requires solving a model using nonlinear methods, i.e. going
beyond the …rst-order approximation and considering “higher order terms”. Researchers disagree on
the importance of these higher order terms, and a fairly common view is that they are irrelevant for
macroeconomic quantities. Lucas (2003) summarizes: “Tallarini uses preferences of the Epstein-Zin
type, with an intertemporal substitution elasticity of one, to construct a real business cycle model of
the U.S. economy. He …nds an astonishing separation of quantity and asset price determination: The
behavior of aggregate quantities depends hardly at all on attitudes toward risk, so the coe¢ cient of risk
aversion is left free to account for the equity premium perfectly.”4 My results show, however, that these
higher-order terms can have a signi…cant e¤ect on macroeconomic dynamics, when we consider shocks
to the probability of disaster.5
       The paper is organized as follows: the rest of the introduction reviews the literature. Section 2
studies a simple analytical example in an AK model which can be solved in closed form and yields the
central intuition for the results. Section 3 gives the setup of the full model and presents some analytical
results. Section 4 studies the quantitative implications of the model numerically. Section 5 considers
   2   Greg Mankiw (NYT, Oct 25, 2008): "Looking back at [the great Depression], it’s hard to avoid seeing parallels to
the current situation. (...) Like Mr. Blanchard at the I.M.F., I am not predicting another Great Depression. But you
should take that economic forecast, like all others, with more than a single grain of salt.”

Robert Barro (WSJ, March 4, 2009): “... there is ample reason to worry about slipping into a depression. There is a
roughly one-in-…ve chance that U.S. GDP and consumption will fall by 10% or more, something not seen since the early
1930s.”

Paul Krugman (NYT, Jan 4, 2009): “This looks an awful lot like the beginning of a second Great Depression.”
  3 Of course in reality this change in probability of disaster may be an endogenous variable and not an exogenous shock.

But it is useful to understand the e¤ect of an increase in aggregate risk (premia) on the macroeconomy.
  4 Note that Tallarini (2000) actually picks the risk aversion coe¢ cient to match the Sharpe ratio of equity. Since return

volatility is very low in his model - there are no capital adjustment costs - he misses the equity premium by several order
of magnitudes.
   5 Cochrane    (2005, p. 296-297) also discusses in detail the Tallarini (2000) result: “Tallarini explores a di¤erent
possibility, one that I think we should keep in mind; that maybe the divorce between real business cycle macro-
economics and …nance isn’t that short-sighted after all (at least leaving out welfare questions, in which case
models with identical dynamics can make wildly di¤erent predictions). (...) The Epstein–Zin preferences allow
him to raise risk aversion while keeping intertemporal substitution constant. As he does so, he is better able
to account for the market price of risk (...) but the quantity dynamics remain almost unchanged. In Tallarini’s
world, macroeconomists might well not have noticed the need for large risk aversion.”

some extensions of the baseline model. Section 6 presents the empirical evaluation of the model, backing
out the probability of disaster from asset prices.
    Related Literature
    Gabaix (2009) independently obtained some related results in contemporaneous work. His study has
more analytical results, including some interesting examples where ‡uctuations in risk premia have no
macroeconomic consequences. My paper has a more quantitative focus, using Epstein-Zin utility, and
focuses on the traditional RBC setup, where a shock to the probability of disaster is equivalent to a
preference shock.
    This paper is mostly related to three strands of literature. First, a large literature in …nance builds
and estimates models which attempt to match not only the equity premium and the risk-free rate, but
also the predictability of returns and potentially the term structure. Two prominent examples are Bansal
and Yaron (2004) and Campbell and Cochrane (1999). However, this literature is limited to endowment
economies, and hence is of limited use to analyze the business cycle or to study policy questions.
    Second, a smaller literature studies business cycle models (i.e. they endogenize consumption, in-
vestment and output), and attempts to match not only business cycle statistics but also asset returns
…rst and second moments. My project is closely related to these papers (A non-exhaustive list would
include Jermann (1998), Tallarini (2000), Boldrin, Christiano and Fisher (2001), Lettau and Uhlig
(2001), Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2008), Campanele et al. (2008), Croce (2005), Gourio (2008c),
Papanikolaou (2008), Kuehn (2008), Uhlig (2006), Jaccard (2008), Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2008)).
Most of these papers consider only the implications of productivity shocks, and generally study only the
mean and standard deviations of return. In contrast, my model generates a large variation of economic
risk premia, consistent with the empirical …nance …ndings. Many of these papers abstract from hours
variation. Several of these papers note that quantities dynamics are una¤ected by risk aversion,6 hence
it is sometimes said that asset prices can be discarded. The recent studies of Swanson and Rudebusch
(2008a and 2008b) are exceptions on all these counts. The long-run target is to build a medium-scale
DSGE model (as in Smets and Wouters (2003) or Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005)) that is
roughly consistent with asset prices.
    Finally, the paper draws from the recent literature on “disasters” or rare events (Rietz (1988),
Barro (2006), Barro and Ursua (2008), Farhi and Gabaix (2008), Gabaix (2007), Gourio (2008a,2008b),
Julliard and Ghosh (2008), Martin (2007), Santa Clara and Yan (2008), Wachter (2008), Weitzmann
(2007)). Disasters are a powerful way to generate large risk premia. Moreover, as we will see, disasters
are relatively easy to embed into a standard macroeconomic model.
    There has been much interest lately in the evidence that the stock market leads TFP and GDP,
which has motivated introducing “news shocks”(e.g., Beaudry and Portier (2006), Jaimovich and Rebelo
(2008)), but my model suggests that this same evidence could also be rationalized by variations in risk
premia due to changes in the probability of disasters.
    Last, the paper has the same ‡avor as Bloom (2008) in that an increase in aggregate uncertainty
creates a recession, but the mechanism and the focus (asset prices here) is di¤erent. Fernandez-Villaverde
   6 Fernandez-Villaverde   et al. (2008) use perturbation methods and report that the …rst three terms, which are calculated
symbolically by the computer, are independent of risk aversion (there is, of course, a steady-state adjustment).

et al. (2009) also study the e¤ect of shocks to risk in macro models, but they focus on open economy
issues.



2          A simple analytical example in an AK economy
To highlight the key mechanism of the paper, consider a simple economy with a representative consumer
who has power utility:
                                                               1
                                                               X         1
                                                                      t Ct
                                                     U = E0                   ;
                                                               t=0
                                                                       1

where Ct is consumption and                is the risk aversion coe¢ cient (and also the inverse of the the intertem-
poral elasticity of substitution of consumption). This consumer operates an AK technology:

                                                           Yt = AKt ;

where Yt is output, Kt is capital, and A is productivity, which is assumed to be constant.7 The resource
constraint is:
                                                        Ct + It       AKt :

The economy is randomly hit by disasters. A disaster destroys a share bk of the capital stock. This
could be due to a war which physically destroys capital, but there are alternative interpretations. For
instance, bk could re‡ect expropriation of capital holders (if the capital is taken away and then not
used as e¤ectively), or it could be a “technological revolution” that makes a large share of the capital
worthless. It could also be that even though physical capital is not literally destroyed, some intangible
capital (such as matches between …rms, employees, and customers) is lost. Finally, one can imagine a
situation where the demand for some goods falls sharply, rendering worthless the factories which produce
them.8
     Finally, the probability of a disaster varies over time. To maintain tractability I assume in this
section that it is i:i:d:: pt , the probability of a disaster at time t + 1; is drawn at the beginning of time
t from a constant cumulative distribution function F: The law of accumulation for capital is thus:

                              Kt+1     =    (1     )Kt + It ; if xt+1 = 0; (no disaster)

                                       =    ((1     )Kt + It ) (1     bk ), if xt+1 = 1; (disaster)

where xt+1 is a binomial variable which is 1 with probability pt and 0 with probability 1                       pt : A disaster
does not a¤ect productivity A. I will relax this assumption in section 3.9 Finally, I assume that the
two random variables pt+1 ; and xt+1 are independent. I also discuss this assumption in more detail in
section 3.
    7 It   is easy to extend this example to the case where A is stochastic; this does not a¤ect the results, so in the interest
of simplicity I omit this extension in the example and consider it in the full model of section 3.
   8 In a large downturn, the demand for some luxury goods such as boats, private airplanes, etc. would likely fall sharply.

If this situation were to last, the boats-producing factories would never operate at capacity.
    9 In an AK model, a permanent reduction in productivity would lead to a permanent reduction in the growth rate of

the economy, since permanent shocks to A a¤ect the growth rate of output permanently.

    This model has one endogenous state K and one exogenous state p; and there is one control variable
C: There are two shocks: the realization of disaster x0 2 f0; 1g ; and the draw of a new probability of

The assumptions made ensure that V is homogeneous, i.e. we can guess and verify that V is of the form

V (K; p) =      1     g(p); where g is de…ned through the Bellman equation:
                               (                                                  1

               I
where i =      K   is the investment rate. This implies that consumption and investment are both proportional
to the current stock of capital, but they typically depend on the probability of disaster as well:

                                                               Ct           = f (pt )Kt ;

                                                                   It       = h(pt )Kt :

As a result, when a disaster occurs and the capital stock falls by a factor bk , both consumption and
investment also fall by a factor bk : Given that there are no adjustment costs, the value of capital is equal
to the quantity of capital, and hence it falls also by a factor bk in a downturn. Finally, the return on an
all-equity …nanced …rm is:
                                                    e
                                                   Rt;t+1 = (1                   + A) (1      xt+1 bk );

i.e. it is 1         + A if there is no disaster, and (1                               + A) (1        bk ) if there is a disaster. Clearly, the
equity premium will be high, since the equity return and consumption are correlated and are a¤ected
by large shocks. Moreover, the equity premium is larger when pt is higher, since risk is higher.10
    Let us …nally turn to the e¤ect of p on the consumption-savings decision. Using equation (1), the
…rst-order condition with respect to i yields, after rearranging:

                                       A     i
                                                          =             1     p + p(1        bk )1        (Ep0 g(p0 )) :
                                   1         +i

Given that p is i:i:d:, the expectation of g on the right-hand side is independent of the current p. The
left-hand side is an increasing function of i: The term (1                                    bk )1       is greater than unity if and only if
  > 1: Hence, i is increasing in p if                    > 1; it is decreasing in p if                      < 1; and it is independent of p if
  = 1:
    The intuition for this result is as follows: if p goes up, investment in physical capital becomes more
risky and hence less attractive, i.e. the risk-adjusted return goes down.11 The e¤ect of a change in the

disasters. Adding leverage can create substantial volatility.

return on the consumption-savings choice depends on the value of the IES, because of o¤setting wealth
and substitution e¤ects. If the IES is unity (i.e. utility is log), savings are unchanged and thus the
savings or investment rate does not respond to a change in the probability of disaster. But if the IES
is larger than unity, i.e.            < 1, the substitution e¤ect dominates, and i is decreasing in p. Hence, an
increase in the probability of disaster leads initially, in this model, to a decrease in investment, and an
increase in consumption, since output is unchanged on impact. Next period, the decrease in investment
leads to a decrease in the capital stock and hence in output. This simple analytical example thus shows
that a change in the perceived probability of disaster can lead to a decline in investment and output.
The key mechanism is the e¤ect of rate-of-return uncertainty on the optimal savings decision.
    Extension to Epstein-Zin preferences
    To illuminate the respective role of risk aversion and the intertemporal elasticity of substitution, it is
useful to extend the preceding example to the case of Epstein-Zin utility. Assume, then, that the utility
Vt satis…es the recursion:
                                                                                              1
                                                                                    1     1
                                        Vt =       (1   )Ct1        +          1
                                                                          Et Vt+1   1
                                                                                                  ;                            (2)

where        measures risk aversion towards static gambles,                  is the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of
substitution (IES) and            re‡ects time preference. It is straightforward to extend the results above; the
…rst-order condition now reads
                                                                                                             1
                             A   i                                                  1                 1      1
                                           =            1       p + p(1     bk )1   1
                                                                                          Ep0 g(p0 ) 1           ;
                         1       +i            1

and we can apply the same argument as above, in the realistic case where                                  1 : the now risk-adjusted
                                                            1
                                                   1    1
return on capital is 1           p + p(1       bk )             ; it falls as p rises; an increase in the probability of disaster
will hence reduce investment if and only if the IES is larger than unity.12 Hence, the parameter which
determines the sign of the response is the IES, and the risk aversion coe¢ cient (as long as it is greater
than unity) determines the magnitude of the response only. While this example is revealing,13 it has a
number of simplifying features, which lead us to turn now to a quantitative model.



3      A Real Business Cycle model with Time-Varying Risk of Dis-
       asters
This section introduces a real business cycle model with time-varying risk of disaster and study its
implications, …rst analytically, and then numerically. This model extends the simple example of the
previous section in the following dimensions: (a) the probability of disaster is persistent instead of i:i:d:;
(b) the production function is neoclassical and a¤ected by standard TFP shocks; (c) labor is elastically
  1 2 The   disaster reduces the mean return itself, but this is actually not important. We could assume that there is a small
probability of a “capital windfall”so that a change in p does not a¤ect the mean return on capital. Crucially, what matters
                                                                1
here is the risk-adjusted return on capital, E(R1 ) 1 ; and a higher risk reduces this return.
  1 3 This example is related to work by Epaulard and Pommeret (2003), Jones, Manuelli and Siu (2005a, 2005b), and to

the earlier work of Obstfeld (1994). It is easy to extend the example to the case of stochatic productivity A, which does
not a¤ect the results at all.




                                                                      7
supplied; (d) disasters may a¤ect total factor productivity as well as capital; (e) there can be capital
adjustment costs.


3.1      Model Setup

The representative consumer has preferences of the Epstein-Zin form, and the utility index incorporates
hours worked Nt as well as consumption Ct :
                                                                                                     1
                                                                                           1     1
                                                                          1
                                     Vt =          u(Ct ; Nt )1    + Et Vt+1               1
                                                                                                         ;                   (3)

where14 the per period felicity function u(C; N ) is assumed to have the following form:

                                                     u(C; N ) = C (1               N )1    :

Note that         is the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES), and                        measures risk
aversion towards static gambles, because u is homogeneous of degree one. But this is risk aversion over
the bundle of consumption and leisure.
    There is a representative …rm, which produces output using a standard Cobb-Douglas production
function:
                                                                                  1
                                                         Yt = Kt (zt Nt )              ;

where zt is total factor productivity (TFP), to be described below. The …rm accumulates capital subject
to adjustment costs:

                                                                   It
                           Kt+1      =       (1       )Kt +             Kt ; if xt+1 = 0;
                                                                   Kt
                                                                     It
                                     =        (1        )Kt +            Kt (1 bk ), if xt+1 = 1;
                                                                    Kt

where        is an increasing and concave function, which curvature captures adjustment costs, and xt+1 is
1 if there is a disaster at time t + 1 (with probability pt ) and 0 otherwise (probability 1                        pt ). At this
stage bk is a parameter, which could be zero - i.e., a disaster only a¤ects TFP. We explore quantitatively
the role of bk in section 5.
    The resource constraint is
                                                              Ct + It           Yt :

Aggregate investment cannot be negative:
                                                                  It       0:

Finally, we describe the shock processes. Total factor productivity is a¤ected by the “normal shocks”
"t as well as the disasters. A disaster reduces TFP by a permanent amount btf p :

                          log zt+1       =        log zt +    + "t+1 ; if xt+1 = 0;

                                         =        log zt +    + "t+1 + log(1               btf p ); if xt+1 = 1,
  1 4 Note   that it is commonplace to have a (1              ) factor in front of u(C; N ) in equation (3), but this is merely a
normalization, which it is useful to forgo in this case.




                                                                       8
where        is the drift of TFP, and               is the standard deviation of “normal shocks”. Here too, we will
consider various values for btf p ; including possibly zero - i.e., a disaster only destroys capital. Last, pt
follows a stationary Markov process with transition function Q: In the quantitative application, I will
simply assume that the log of pt follows an AR(1) process.
   I assume that pt+1 ; "t+1 ; and xt+1 are independent conditional on pt : This assumption requires
that the occurrence of a disaster today does not a¤ect the probability of a disaster tomorrow. This
assumption could be wrong either way: a disaster today may indicate that the economy is entering a
phase of low growth or is less resilient than thought, leading agents to revise upward the probability of
disaster, following the occurrence of a disaster; but on the other hand, if a disaster occurred today, and
capital or TFP fell by a large amount, it is unlikely that they will fall again by a large amount next year.
Rather, historical evidence suggests that the economy is likely to grow above trend for a while (Gourio
(2008a), Barro et al. (2009)). In section 5, I extend the model to consider these di¤erent scenarios.


3.2      Bellman Equation

This model has three states: capital K, technology z and probability of disaster p; two independent
controls: consumption C and hours worked N ; and three shocks: the realization of disaster x0 2 f0; 1g ;
the draw of the new probability of disaster p0 , and the “normal shock” "0 : The …rst welfare theorem
holds, hence the competitive equilibrium is equivalent to a social planner problem, which is easier to
solve. Denote V (K; z; p) the value function, and de…ne W (K; z; p) = V (K; z; p)1                                           : The social planning

 1 5 Because     we take a power 1        of the value function, if            > 1, the max must be transformed into a min.

3.3     Asset Prices

It is straightforward to compute asset prices in this economy. The stochastic discount factor is given by
the formula
                                                                                                             0                        1
                                               (1   ) 1                                    (1      )(1   )
                                   Ct+1                       1     Nt+1                                     @         Vt+1           A
                    Mt;t+1 =                                                                                                      1        :          (6)
                                    Ct                            1 Nt                                                1
                                                                                                                 Et Vt+1      1



The price of a one-period risk-free bond is
                                                                                         def
                                               Prf;t = Et (Mt;t+1 ) = Prf (k; p):

This risk-free asset may not have an observable counterpart. Following Barro (2006), I will assume that
government bonds are not risk-free but are subject to default risk during disasters.16 More precisely, if
there is a disaster, then with probability q the bonds will default and the recovery rate will be r: The
T-Bill price can then be easily computed as
                                                                                                         def
                                   P1;t = Et (Mt;t+1 (1                    xt+1 q(1                r))) = P1 (k; p):

Computing the yield curve is conceptually easy using the standard recursion for zero-coupon bonds:
                                                                                                                 def
                              Pn;t = Et (Mt;t+1 Pn            1;t+1 (1              xt+1 q(1             r)) = Pn (k; p):

Here I assume that a disaster simply reduces the face value of the bond (and does not a¤ect its maturity).
The ex-dividend value of the …rm assets Ft is de…ned through the value recursion:

                                               Ft = Et (Mt;t+1 (Dt+1 + Ft+1 )) ;

where Dt = F (Kt ; zt Nt )         wt Nt       It is the payout of the representative …rm, and wt is the wage rate,
given by the marginal rate of substitution of the representative consumer between consumption and
leisure. The equity return is then
                                                                           Dt+1 + Ft+1
                                                     Rt;t+1 =                          :
                                                                               Ft
There is an alternative derivation of …rm value and returns. Using the Q-theory, we see that

                                                         (1           )Kt + (It =Kt )Kt
                                                Ft =                                                         ;
                                                                             0      It
                                                                                    Kt
                                             Kt+1
where (1       )Kt + (It =Kt )Kt =         1 xt+1 bk      is the capital if no disaster occurs. (In the standard model,
pt = 0, but here the amount of capital available tomorrow is unknown, since some capital is destroyed
in the event of a disaster.) As a result, we can …nd an equivalent expression for the equity return, often
known as the investment return, which holds as long as investment is positive:
                                                    (1    )Kt+1 + (It+1 =Kt+1 )Kt+1
                                                                       0    It+1                          + Dt+1
                             Ft+1 + Dt+1                                    Kt+1
           Rt;t+1       =                =                        (1        )Kt + (It =Kt )Kt
                                  Ft                                                0
                                                                                        ( KItt )
                                                              2                              It+1

 1 6 Empirically,   default often takes the form of high rates of in‡ation which reduces the real value of nominal government
debt.


                                                                            10
This expression is similar to that in Jermann (1998) or Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2008), but for the
presence of the term (1                   xt+1 bk ), which re‡ects the capital destruction following a disaster. Finally, I
will also compute the price of a leveraged claim on consumption, de…ned by its payo¤ Ct , where                                                                                         is a
leverage parameter. The motivation is that the dividend process implied by the model does not match
well the dividend process in the data. In the real world, …rms have …nancial leverage and operating
leverage (e.g. …xed costs and labor contracts). This is a substantial source of pro…t volatility, which
is not present in the model. Under some conditions, the only e¤ect of this leverage is to modify the
payout process. In the quantitative section I will use the model-implied price of a leveraged claim to
consumption as the counterpart to the real-world equity.17


3.4         Analytical results

In this section, and before turning to the numerical analysis, we establish two simple, yet important,
analytical results which follow directly from equation (5).

Proposition 1 Assume that the probability of disaster p is constant, and that bk = btf p i.e. productivity
and capital fall by the same amount if there is a disaster. Then, in a sample without disasters, the
quantities implied by the model (consumption, investment, hours, output and capital) are the same
as those implied by a model with no disasters (p = 0), but a di¤ erent time discount factor                                                                                              =
                                              1
                                 (1   )
 (1      p + p(1          bk )            )   1        : Assuming                  1; we have                             if and only if                         < 1: Asset prices,
however, will be di¤ erent under the two models; in particular, let R be the gross return on equity in
normal times, and let d be the dividend-capital ratio, then in a disaster, the return is R (1                                                                               bk ) + bk d;
which is low, leading to a large equity premium.
                                                                           ((1          )k+      ( ki )k)
Proof. Notice that if bk = btf p ; then k 0 =                                          e    + "0               is independent of the realization of disaster
x0 : Hence, we can rewrite the Bellman equation by decomposing the expectation of future values,

We see that this is the same Bellman equation as the one in a standard neoclassical model, with discount
rate        : As a result, the policy functions c = C=z, i = I=z; etc. are the same, so the implied quantities
are the same, as long as no disaster occurs.18 Asset prices, on the other hand, are driven by the stochastic
  1 7 The   results are very similar if one de…nes dividends as a levered claim on output rather than consumption. The results
are also similar, at least qualitatively, if one computes the levered return using the equity and long-term (…ve years) bond
return, assuming that …rms maintain a constant market or a constant bok leverage.
  1 8 Even after a disaster, the policy functions are the same, i.e. given the new levels of k and p (or K; z; and p), the two

models predict the same quantities. However, the destruction of capital in a disaster is not possible in the model with
p = 0 - the capital accumulation equation must hold without shocks (the large TFP decline is highly unlikely if shocks are
normally distributed, but it is possible). If the capital stock is not observed, the observational equivalence result extends
to any sample, including disasters or not.

and since the investment and the capital stock fall by the same amount, the investment rate is una¤ected
by the disaster; as a result the return is the same as if no disaster occurs, except for the term 1                                                  bk ;
the dividend rate (pro…t less investment over capital) is itself unchanged.
    Discussion of Result 1: This result is in the spirit of Tallarini (2000): …xing the asset pricing prop-
erties of a RBC model need not change the quantity dynamics. An economy with a high equity risk
premium due to disasters (p > 0) is observationally equivalent to the standard stochastic growth model
(p = 0), with a di¤erent               : One possible calibration of the model without disasters (e.g., Cooley and
Prescott (1995)) is to pick             to match the observed return on stocks. This calibration would pick                                          and
hence yield exactly the same implications as the model with disasters. Without the adjustment of , the
quantity implications are very slightly di¤erent. This is illustrated in the top panel of Figure 2 which
depicts the impulse response of quantities to a TFP shock in three models: (a) the model with p = 0,
(b) the model with constant positive p, and (c) the benchmark calibration with time-varying p: The
di¤erences can be seen in the scale (y-axis), but they are tiny. For this calibration, we have                                                   = :993;
and             :9924. Of course, asset prices will be di¤erent, and in particular the equity premium will be
higher, as seen in the bottom panel of Figure 1 - the average returns are very di¤erent across the three
models. The observational equivalence is broken in a long enough sample since disasters must occur.
(The observational equivalence would also be broken if one observes assets contingent on disasters, since
the prices would be di¤erent under the two models.)
    The assumption bk = btf p ; simpli…es the analysis substantially: the steady-state of the economy
shifts due to a change in z, but the ratio of capital to productivity is una¤ected by the disaster, i.e. the
economy is in the same position relative to its steady-state after the disaster and before the disaster.
As a result, a disaster will simply reduce investment, output, and consumption by a factor bk = btf p ,
and hours will be una¤ected. The economy jumps from one steady-state to another steady-state, and
there are no further transitional dynamics. Obviously, the possibility of disaster a¤ects the choice of
how much to save, and hence it changes ; but the response to a standard TFP shock is not a¤ected.
As emphasized by Cochrane (2005), in a RBC model there is little that agents can do to increase or
decrease the amount of uncertainty that they face.19
  1 9 An   interesting extension of the model is to have technologies with di¤erent levels of riskiness, i.e. di¤erent exposures
to disasters. Then, an economy with high p would be di¤erent than an economy with low p in a more complex way, since
agents would like to pick safer, lower-mean technologies.



                                                                                  12
    This same result implies that the “steady-state” level of capital stock will be a¤ected.20 If risk
aversion       is greater than unity, and the IES is above unity, then                             < , leading people to save less
and the steady-state capital stock is lower than in a model without disasters. While higher risk to
productivity leads to higher precautionary savings, it is well known since Sandmo (1970) that rate-of-
return risk can reduce savings (see Angeletos (2007), and Weil (1989) for related analysis).
    While this …rst result is interesting, it is not fully satisfactory however, since the constant probability
of disaster implies (nearly) constant risk premia, and hence P-D ratios are too smooth, and returns not
volatile enough.21 This motivates extending the result for a time-varying p:

Proposition 2 Assume still that bk = btf p ; but that p follows a stationary Markov process. Then, in a
sample without disaster, the quantities implied by the model are the same as those implied by a model
with no disasters, but with stochastic discounting (i.e.                          follows a stationary Markov process).

Proof. This follows from a similar argument: rewrite the Bellman equation as:

i.e. the Bellman equation of a model with time-varying , but no disasters.
    Discussion of result 2: Result 2 shows that the time-varying risk of disaster has the same implications
for quantities as a preference shock. It is well known that these shocks have signi…cant e¤ect on
macroeconomic quantities (a point that we will quantify later). In a sense, this version of the model
breaks the “separation theorem”of Tallarini (2000): the source of time-varying risk premia in the model
will a¤ect quantity dynamics.
    This result is interesting in light of the empirical literature which suggests that “preference shocks”
or “equity premium shocks” may be important (Smets and Wouters (2003) and the many papers that
follow). Chari, Kehoe and McGrattan (2009) complain that these shocks lack microfoundations. My
model provides a simple microfoundation, which allows to tie these shocks to asset prices precisely. Of
course, my model is much “smaller” than the medium-scale models of Smets and Wouters (2003), or
Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (2005), but I conjecture that this equivalence should hold in larger
versions.
  2 0 By   steady-state we mean the level to which the capital stock converges in the absence of small shocks " and if no
disasters are realized. Intuitively, the same result should hold for the average (ergodic) capital stock, with the shocks "
being realized.
  2 1 In an endowment economy where consumption and dividends follow random walk processes, these statements are

exact. In our case, the processes are not exactly random walk, because of the TFP shock. However, the general intuition
carries over, as we will see in the quantitative section.



                                                                          13
    Interestingly, this suggests that it is technically feasible to make DSGE models consistent with risk
premia. A full non-linear solution of a medium-scale DSGE model is daunting. But under this result,
we can solve the quantities of the model for p = 0 and a shock process for       ; which we know is well
approximated with a log-linear approximation. Appendix 1 details this solution method.
    Note that Propositions 1 and 2 require that bk = btf p ; analytical results are impossible without this
assumption. Numerical results suggest that tesult 1 is robust to this assumption, in that the dynamic
response to a TFP shock is largely una¤ected by the presence of disasters. Result 2, however, relies on
this assumption more heavily.. If disasters a¤ect only TFP, then an increase in p will lead people to
want to hold more capital, for standard precautionary savings reasons. This is true regardless of the
IES. We discuss further and relax the assumption bk = btf p in Section 5.



4     Quantitative Results
In general, the model cannot be solved analytically, so I resort to a numerical approximation. Of course,
a nonlinear method is crucial to analyze time-varying risk premia. I use a standard policy function
iteration algorithm, which is described in detail in appendix 2.
    This section …rst presents the calibration. Next, I study the implications of the model for business
cycle quantities and for the …rst and second moments of asset returns, as well as for the predictability
of stock returns. Finally, I discuss the cyclicality of asset prices.


4.1    Calibration

Parameters are listed in Table 1. The period is one quarter. Many parameters follow the business cycle
literature (Cooley and Prescott (1995)). Risk aversion is 6, but note that this is the risk aversion over
the consumption-hours bundle. Since the share of consumption in the utility index is .3, the e¤ective risk
aversion to a consumption gamble is 1:8. (For the baseline calibration, hours worked do not change when
there is a disaster, hence this utility index is three times less volatile than consumption in disasters.)
Adjustment costs are zero in the baseline model, as in the standard RBC model.
    The intertemporal elasticity of substitution of consumption (IES) is set equal to 2. There is a large
debate regarding the value of the IES. Most direct estimates using aggregate data …nd low numbers
(e.g. Hall (1988)), but this view has been challenged by several authors (see among others Bansal and
Yaron (2004), Guvenen (2006), Mulligan (2004), Vissing-Jorgensen (2002)). As emphasized by Bansal
and Yaron (2004), a low IES has the counterintuitive e¤ects that higher expected growth lowers asset
prices, and higher uncertainty increases asset prices. The IES plays a key role for only one part of my
results, namely the response of macroeconomic quantities to an increase in the probability of disaster.
    One crucial element of the calibration is the probability and size of disaster. I assume that bk =
btf p = :43 and the probability is :017 per year on average. These numbers are motivated by the evidence
in Barro (2006) who reports this unconditional probability, and the risk-adjusted size of disaster is on
average 43%. In my model, with bk = btf p = :43; both consumption and output fall by 43% if there
is a disaster. (Barro actually uses the historical distribution of sizes of disaster. In his model, this



                                                      14
distribution is equivalent to a single disaster with size 43%.) Note that since TFP is z 1                    ; the actual
drop in TFP is 30:2%.
    Whether one should model a disaster as a capital destruction or a reduction in TFP is an important
question. Clearly some disasters, e.g. in South America since 1945, or Russia 1917, a¤ected TFP,
perhaps by introducing an ine¢ cient government and poor policies. On the other hand, World War II
led in many countries to massive destructions and losses of human capital. It would be interesting to
gather further evidence on disasters, and measure bk and btf p directly. This is beyond the scope of this
paper, and I will hence consider di¤erent values for these parameters in section 5 as a robustness test.
As I discuss there, the benchmark case bk = btf p is parsimonious and makes the model consistent with
several aspects of the data.
    The second crucial element is the persistence and volatility of movements in this probability of
disaster. I assume that the log of the probability follows an AR(1) process:

                                    log pt+1 =   p   log pt + (1   p ) log p   +       p "p;t+1 ;


where "p;t+1 is i:i:d: N (0; 1): The parameter p is picked so that the average probability is :017 per year,
and I set      p   = :96 and the unconditional standard deviation p            p
                                                                                   2
                                                                                       = 1:5, which allows the model to …t
                                                                           1       p
                                                                            22
reasonably well the volatility and predictability of risk premia.                  Regarding the default of government
bonds during disasters, I follow the work of Barro (2006): conditional on a disaster, government bonds
default with probability :6; and the default rate is the size of the disaster. For simplicity, I assume that
all bonds (no matter their maturity) default by the same amount if there is a disaster.23 Finally, the
leverage parameters          is set to 3, a standard value in the literature.
    On top of this benchmark calibration, I will also present results from di¤erent calibrations (no
disasters, constant probability of disasters, and in section 5 more extensions) to illustrate the sensitivity
of the results.
    Some may argue that this calibration of disasters is extreme. A few remarks are in order. First, a
long historical view makes this calibration sound more reasonable, as shown by Barro (2006) and Barro
and Ursua (2008). An example is the U.K., which sounded very safe in 1900, but experienced a variety
of very large negative shocks during the century. As shown by Martin (2008), the key ingredient is that
there is a tiny probability of a very large shock.
    The key assumption is that beliefs regarding the possibility of large drops in GDP vary over time.
The recent …nancial crisis o¤ers an illustration, with many investors and economists worrying about a
new Great Depression. Over the past year, some very prominent macroeconomists suggested that a new
Great Depression is a distinct possibility, as illustrated by the quotes in the introduction. Clearly, some
investors decided to pull out of the stock market in Fall 2008, partly out of the fear that the economy
might continue to go down for a few more years, as it did in 1929. The recent crisis also illustrates some
large declines in consumption or GDP: for instance, real consumption in Iceland is expected to drop
  2 2 See   Gabaix (2007), Gourio (2008b), and Wachter (2008) for a similar calibration of the endowment economy model.
Also, this equation allows the probability to be greater than one, however I will approximate this process with a …nite
Markov chain, which ensures that 0 < pt < 1 for all t 0:
 2 3 Gabaix (2007) shows that if a disaster leads to a jump in in‡ation, then long-term bonds are more risky than short-term

bonds, which can explain a variety of facts regarding the yield curve.


                                                              15
by 7.1% in 2008 and 24.1% in 2009, according to the o¢ cial government forecast (as of January 2009).
According to the IMF World economic outlook (April 2009), output in Germany, Ireland, Ukraine,
Japan, Latvia, Singapore, Taiwan, are expected to contract by respectively 5.6%, 8.0%, 8.0%, 6.2%,
12.0%, 10.0%, 7.5% in 2009 alone.
    It is also possible to change the calibration - e.g., increase risk aversion, which is only 2, and reduce
the size of disasters. One can also employ fairly standard devices to boost the equity premium, and
reduce the probability of disaster - e.g., the disasters may be concentrated on a limited set of agents, or
some agents may have background risk (private businesses); or idiosyncratic risk might be countercyclical
(becoming unemployed during the Great Depression was no fun). These features could all be added to
the model, at a cost in terms of complexity, and would likely reduce the magnitude of disasters required
to make the model …t the data.


4.2      Response to shocks

4.2.1         The dynamic e¤ect of a disaster

Figures 1 presents the dynamics of quantities following a disaster, for each of the three possible types
of disasters: the benchmark model (bk = btf p = :43 as in the baseline calibration); a capital disaster
(bk = :43 and btf p = 0) whereby capital is destroyed but TFP is una¤ected; and a TFP disaster
(btf p = :43 and bk = 0). Of course, in post WWII U.S., no disasters have occurred, so these pictures are
not to be matched to any data. Yet, they matter, because the properties of asset prices and quantities are
driven by what would happen if there was a disaster. For instance, to generate a large equity premium,
a model must endogenously generate that consumption and stock returns are extremely low during
disasters.24 In the benchmark model, as implied by proposition 2, there are no transitional dynamics
following the disaster: consumption drops by a factor 1                   bk ; just like in the endowment economy of
Rietz (1988) and Barro (2006); and the return on capital is approximately 1                         bk due to the capital
destruction, hence the model is successful in generating an equity premium.
    The case of a capital disaster is interesting because it leads endogenously to a recovery. The tran-
sitional dynamics here are exactly that of the standard Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model (e.g., King and
Rebelo (1993)). The return on capital is low on impact because of the destruction, but consumption
does not fall as much as in the …rst case, given the anticipated recovery. Adding adjustment costs
slows down the recovery, but makes the return on capital not as bad since Tobin’s Q increases after the
disaster.
    Finally, a TFP disaster without a capital destruction leads to an excess of capital relative to its
productivity. Investment falls to zero: the aggregate irreversibility constraint binds. Consumption and
output then decline over time. In that case, the initial low return on capital is solely due to the binding
irreversibility constraint - there is no capital destruction.
  2 4 Since   leisure enters the utility function, low hours worked could also potentially help. Moreover, Epstein-Zin utility
implies that state prices are also determined by continuation utility, (expected future consumption and hours worked), i.e.
the full path of transitional dynamics following a disaster.




                                                               16
4.2.2        The dynamic e¤ect of a TFP shock

As illustrated in …gure 2, and discussed in the previous section, the dynamics of quantities in response
to a TFP shock are similar to those of a standard model without disasters. Consumption, investment
and employment are procyclical, and investment is the most volatile series. The model hence reproduces
the basic success of the RBC model, and has the same de…ciencies, e.g. employment is less volatile than
in the data. The T-bill rate and the levered equity return are procyclical, but the return on physical
capital is very smooth since there are no adjustment costs to capital adjustment.25 These dynamics are
very similar for all the possible calibrations of the model, except when adjustment costs are large. The
fact that the response to a TFP shock is unaltered is an attractive property of the model, since most
business cycle models which try to match asset prices have undesirable quantity implications.26


4.2.3        An increase in the probability of a disaster

We can now perform the key experiment of an increase in the probability of disaster, which leads to
an increase in risk premia. Figure 3 plots the impulse response function to such a shock. For this
experiment, I assume that the probability of disaster is initially at its long-run average (.017% per
year or 0.00425% per quarter) and doubles at time t = 6:27 Investment decreases, and consumption
increases, as in the analytical example of section 2, since the elasticity of substitution is assumed to
be greater than unity. Employment decreases too, through an intertemporal substitution e¤ect: the
risk-adjusted return to savings is low and thus working today is less attractive. (This is in spite of a
negative wealth e¤ect which tends to push employment up; given the large IES the substitution e¤ect
overwhelms the wealth e¤ect both for consumption and for leisure.) Hence, output decreases because
both employment and the capital stock decrease, even though there is no change in current or future
total factor productivity. This is one of the main result of the paper: this shock to the “perceived risk”
leads to a recession. After impact, consumption starts falling. These results are robust to changes in
parameter values, except of course for the IES which crucially determines the sign of the responses, and
the assumption that bk = btf p (as we discuss in section 5.1 below). The size of adjustment costs, and
the level of risk aversion, a¤ect only the magnitude of the response of investment and hours. These
…gures are consistent with proposition 2: the shock is equivalent, for quantities, to a preference shock
to :
    The model predicts some negative comovement between consumption and investment, which may
  2 5 This   model generate some positive autocorrelation of consumption growth, due to capital accumulation, hence the
dynamics of consumption are qualitatively similar to those in Bansal and Yaron (2004). This could in principle generate
larger risk premia, however, as argued by Kaltenbrunner and Lochstoer (2008), this e¤ect is not quantitatively very
important if shocks are permanent and the IES is not small.
  2 6 For instance, Jermann (1998) assumes …xed labor, since labor would be countercyclical if it was allowed to vary.

Boldrin et al. (2001) resolve this by making assumptions regarding the timing of decisions.
 2 7 For clarity, to compute this …gure, I assume that there are no realized disaster. The simulation is started of after the

economy has been at rest for a long time (i.e. no realized disasters, no normal shocks, and no change in the probability
of disaster). I obtain this …gure by averaging out over 100,000 simulations which start at t = 6 in the same position, but
then have further shocks to " or p: Alternatively, one could compute a full non-linear impulse response function, which
would take into account that the response of the economy depends also on the initial position, but this picture is meant
as a mere illustration of the model mechanism.


                                                             17
seem undesirable. I discuss this further in Section 5.3, but note that the perfect correlation implied by
the RBC model is at odds with the data (Table 3).
    Regarding asset prices, …gure 4 reveals that following the shock, the risk premium on equity increases
(the spread between the red–crosses line and the black full line becomes larger), and the short rate
decreases, as investors try to shift their portfolio towards safer assets - a “‡ight to quality”.. Hence, in
the model, an increase in risk premia coincides with an economic expansion. On impact (at t = 6); the
increase in the risk premium lowers equity prices substantially, since the discount rate increases. Here
too, the return on physical capital is very smooth, since there are no adjustment costs.28
    To conclude this section, …gures 5 give a snapshot of a simulation for quantities. This …gure illustrates
the key simpli…cation of the model when bk = btf p - the time series (in log) of quantities, except hours,
all shift down by the factor 1        bk when there is a disaster.


4.3      First and second moments of quantities and asset returns

Table 2 reports the standard business cycle moments obtained from model simulations for a sample
without disasters. Table 3 presents the same statistics in a full sample, i.e. a sample with disasters. Row
2 shows the model when bk = btf p = 0, i.e. a standard RBC model with an elasticity of substitution of 2.
The success of the basic RBC model is clear: consumption is less volatile than output, and investment
is more volatile than output. The volatility of hours is on the low side, a standard defect of the basic
RBC model given the utility function.
    Introducing a constant probability of disaster, in row 3, does not change the moments signi…cantly,
consistent with the impulse responses shown in the previous section, and with proposition 1. However,
the presence of the new shock - the change in the probability of disaster - leads to additional dynamics,
which are visible in row 4. Speci…cally, the correlation of consumption with output is reduced. Total
volatility increases, since there is an additional shock, but this is especially true for investment and
employment. Overall, the model overshoots the volatility of investment, but gets closer to the data for
the other moments.
    Turning to returns, tables 4 and 5 show that the benchmark model (row 4) can generate a large
equity premium: 1.7% (=4*(.95-.52)) per year for unlevered equity and about 5% per year for a levered
equity. Note that these risk premium are obtained with a risk aversion over consumption equal to 1.8.
Moreover, these risk premia are computed over short-term government bonds, which are not riskless in
the model. Whether these risk premia are calculated in a sample with disasters or without disasters
does not matter much quantitatively - the risk premia are reduced by 10–30 basis point per quarter (see
table 5). Note that the risk aversion is lower than in Barro (2006), because changes in the probability
of disaster are an additional new source of risk.
    Table 6 shows that the model also does not generate enough volatility in unlevered equity returns
(only 8 basis points in a sample without disasters). The intuition from the consumption-based model
is that shocks to the probability of disaster a¤ect the risk-free rate and the equity premium by the
 28 A   di¤erent calibration with substantial adjustment costs can generate some return volatility. However, large adjust-
ment costs have undesirable implications for business cycle dynamics.




                                                            18
same amount, so that equity prices and average returns are not much a¤ected by it. The intuition
from the production-based point of view is that the return on capital is simply 1                      + M P Kt+1 , since
there are no adjustment costs in the benchmark calibration. The volatility is signi…cantly higher in a
sample with disasters (2.05% per quarter, see Table 7). Adding some …nancial or operating leverage,
and possibly some wage rigidities may increase the return volatility. Rather than incorporating in detail
all these mechanisms, I consider the implications of the model for a claim to levered consumption. In
this case, we …nd that the volatility is of the right order of magnitude: 6.23% per quarter. Importantly,
the model matches the low volatility of short-term interest rates, an improvement over Jermann (1998)
and Boldrin, Christiano and Fisher (2001). Overall, I conclude that the model does a good job at …tting
the …rst two moments of asset returns, if one allows for leverage.
    Term Premium
    The model generates a negative term premium, consistent with the evidence for indexed bonds in the
US and UK. This negative term premium is not due to what happens during disasters, since short-term
bonds and long-term bonds are assumed to default by the same amount. As usual, TFP shocks generate
very small risk premia. The term premium is thus driven by the third shock, i.e. the shock to the
probability of disaster. An increase in the probability of disaster reduces interest rates, as the demand
for precautionary savings rises. As a result, long-term bond prices rise. Hence, long term bonds hedge
against the shock to the probability of disaster, they have lower average return than the short-term
bonds, and the yield curve is on average downward sloping.29 However, the model does not generate
enough volatility in the term premium, compared to that observed in the (nominal) Treasuries market.
These results for the yield curve are similar to those in Gabaix (2007) and are highly dependent on the
assumption that all bonds default by the same amount in disasters.


4.4      Time series predictability of returns

This section studies the ability of the model to match the evidence that equity returns are predictable,
but dividends are not. Table 8 presents the evidence by showing the slope coe¢ cients, t-stat and R2 of
the basic regression
                                          e           f                  Dt
                                         Rt!t+k      Rt!t+k =       +       + "t+k ;
                                                                         Pt
for di¤erent values of the horizon k, ranging from one to …ve years. As is well known, the slope
coe¢ cient        is positive, signi…cant, and it increases with horizon, as does the regression R2 :30 The same
table reports the results from running these regressions in simulated data from the model. As can be
seen, the model also generates a positive slope, which increases with the horizon, as does the R2 : When
  2 9 Note   that states of nature with high probability of disaster are "bad states", even though consumption goes up. This
is because the stochastic discount factor also includes current hours and future utility, and the higher uncertainty reduces
the value due to risk aversion.
  3 0 Of course, these regression results are somewhat fragile, as shown by Stambaugh (1999), Ang and Bekaert (2007),

Boudoukh, Richardson and Whitelaw (2008), and Goyal and Welch (2008) among others. Yet, this regression has motivated
the development of models with time-varying risk premia such as Campbell and Cochrane (1999) or Bansal and Yaron
(2004). Finally and most importantly, these results show that the volatility of the price-dividend ratio is largely due to
the volatility of expected returns rather than dividends.




                                                              19
the probability of disaster is high, the dividend yield is high (prices are low), and expected returns are
high. The model regressions, however, yield higher R2 and coe¢ cients than the data regressions.
    Table 9 studies dividend predictability by showing the slope coe¢ cients, t-stat and R2 of the regres-
sion:
                                                 Dt+k              Dt
                                                      =      +        + "t+k ;
                                                  Dt               Pt
again for horizons ranging from 1 to 5 years. In the data, there is essentially no predictability in
dividends - the t-stat are less all than 1.2 and the R2 less than 2%. In the model, the coe¢ cient                         is
also insigni…cantly di¤erent from zero, and the R2 is no higher than 12%. The model actually predicts
negative dividend growth, consistent with the impulse response of quantities (…gure 3). Overall, even
though the quantitative match is not perfect, I conclude that both in the model and in the data, return
predictability is much larger than dividend predictability.31


4.5      The relation between the stock market and output

While most of the research has focused on the equity premium and the stock market volatility puzzle,
the cyclicality of asset prices is also intriguing. Here I concentrate on one measure, the covariogram of
HP-…ltered output, denoted yt ; and the stock market, measured as the price-dividend ratio. Figure 6
shows the quantity

                                                k   = Cov(yt+k ; log(Pt =Dt ));

for k =        12; 11; :::; 0; :::; 12 quarters. The black (full) line shows the data, re‡ecting the well-known
pattern that output and the stock market are positively correlated. More precisely, the stock market
leads GDP, so this covariance is highest for k = 2 quarters.
    The blue line (circles) presents the covariogram for the model with only TFP shock, i.e. the basic
RBC model. The model generates a positive covariance between the price-dividend ratio and output,
because TFP shocks increase future cash ‡ows, hence leading to an increase in the P-D ratio since the
discount rate does not increase too much.32 The volatility of the P-D ratio is quite small however, but
the correlation between changes in the P-D ratio and changes in output is high, since there is only one
shock. Finally, note that the model cannot replicate the fact that the stock market leads GDP - the
largest covariance is on impact.
    The red line (crosses) shows the covariogram for the benchmark model, i.e. including both TFP
shocks and shocks to the probability of disaster. The key result is that the covariance is now about
three times larger for low values of k. Hence, the model becomes closer to the data. The P-D ratio is
substantially more volatile, but the covariance is only three times larger, because the e¤ect of a shock
to p on output is not very large, and the correlation of the two variables is now imperfect since there
are two shocks. Very similar results are obtained if one uses investment instead of GDP in these …gures.
  3 1 This   generalizes the results of Gabaix (2007), Gourio (2008b), and Wachter (2008) in endowment economies to a full-
‡edged production economy. In these models, there is exactly zero dividend predictability in a sample without disasters.
In my model, due to quantity dynamics following a change in pt , there is some predictability in dividends.
  3 2 Note that in some versions of the model, this covariance is actually negative since procyclical discount rates make the

P-D ratio countercyclical.

Finally, the model is still unable to replicate the fact that the stock market leads GDP, because the
transitional dynamics are small compared to the response on impact.33



5      Robustness
In this section, I discuss several extensions of the baseline model.


5.1         TFP disasters vs. capital disasters

An interesting issue is whether one should model disasters as reductions in TFP or destructions of
the existing capital stock. Decreases in TFP arise for instance because of poor government policies or
extreme misallocation, while destructions of the capital stock can be due to wars, expropriations, or
other e¤ects (see the discussion in section 2). Tables 10 through 12 study the sensitivity of the key
results to this assumption.
    When disasters a¤ect solely TFP, the model generates a sizeable equity premium, but it underpredicts
somewhat the volatility of returns. This is to some extent a calibration issue, since capital is now less
risky - it does not vanish during disasters. The key di¤erence is that an increase in the probability of
disaster now leads to an increase in the capital stock for precautionary savings reasons. As a result,
in this case, and regardless of the IES, an increase in the probability of disaster leads to a boom in
investment and output, i.e. the sign of the impulse response of 3 is reversed. The assumption bk = btf p
ensures that the return on capital will be low if there is a disaster, and hence it makes agents reluctant
to hold physical capital.
    When disasters solely a¤ect the capital stock, the model does not generate a signi…cant equity
premium. There are two main reasons: …rst, consumption on impact does not fall by a very large
amount, as consumers anticipate the recovery; second, with Epstein-Zin utility future utility values
matter, and in this instance they indicate that a recovery will soon erase the e¤ects of the disaster. This
is all in spite of a rise in hours on impact. Hence, it appears that capital disasters alone do not allow to
match asset pricing facts.


5.2         Disasters Dynamics

As pointed out by Constantinides (2008), it is inadequate to model disasters as one-time jumps, since
in reality they last more than a year. Barro et al. (2009) estimate a time-series process for disasters
which takes into account the fact that after disasters start, they may continue for several years, and a
recovery might then follow. In the spirit of this exercise, I consider the following variation on the model:
a disaster leads only to a 20% drop in both productivity and the capital stock. However, a disaster also
makes the probability of a disaster next period increase to 50%. Next period, either a disaster occurs,
in which case the probability of a further disaster remains at 50%, or it doesn’t, in which case this
  3 3 One   could also try and replicate a similar pattern with the short rate and the term spread, emphasized by Backus,
Routledge and Zin (2008). However these implications are sensitive to the (extraneous) assumptions made regarding
in‡ation during disasters.




                                                            21
probability shifts back to a standard value. Tables 10 through 12 show the impact of this modi…cation.
While the disaster is substantially smaller (and the other parameters are kept constant), the model still
generates a signi…cant ex-ante equity premium - the fear of further disasters leads to an increase in the
risk premium, and a further decline in asset prices, during the disaster. The model also gets reasonable
return volatility. Figure 7 presents the response of macro quantities to a disaster (which is in this case
not followed by a further disaster). Interestingly, this variation on the model makes investment drop by
more than consumption, generating dynamics similar to the U.S. Great Depression. The key lesson from
this illustrative computation is that adding some fear of further disasters is a very powerful ingredient.
   Another possible extension is to try and match the evidence that output rebounds in the aftermath
of a disaster (Gourio (2008b), Barro et al. (2009)). When the disaster is modeled as a pure destruction
of capital (btf p = 0) this rebound is an outcome of the model - the usual neoclassical transitional
dynamics bring back the economy to its initial balanced growth path. However, when the disaster is
modeled as a permanent reduction in total factor productivity (btf p > 0), there is no tendency for the
economy to recover. To generate a recovery, one must assume that TFP itself will - perhaps randomly-
recover. This is an interesting extension. The key issue is the behavior of real interest rates during the
disaster. If they rise substantially, stock prices fall further, making the disaster even more risky ex-ante.
Inversely, with Epstein-Zin utility and a high elasticity of substitution, interest rates will not rise much,
and consumers understand that they are likely to enjoy a recovery, which will diminish somewhat the
riskiness of disasters. From a calibration point of view, this would require to increase risk aversion
somewhat. However, the other predictions of the model regarding the volatility and predictability of
returns, and the macroeconomic e¤ects of a change in the probability of disaster, would be largely
una¤ected.


5.3    Comovement of consumption and investment

An implication of the model that may seem odd is that, when the probability of disaster rises, con-
sumption initially increases, while output, employment and investment fall. The wealth e¤ect of the
increase in the probability of disaster is for hours to go up, and for consumption to go down; but the
substitution e¤ect overwhelms this wealth e¤ect, hence hours go down and consumption goes up. Given
that productivity does not change, and the capital stock adjusts gradually, the labor demand schedule
(marginal product of labor) is unchanged initially, and, as explained by Barro and King (1984), this
makes it impossible to generate positive comovement.
   It is not clear that this lack of comovement is necessarily a de…ciency of the model. Consumption,
investment, and hours are far from perfectly correlated in the data (see Table 3), which means that
any model needs a shock which pushes consumption and investment in opposite directions sometimes.
Indeed, we see in Table 3 that adding the shock to the probability of disaster brings the model closer to
the data regarding the correlations. Moreover, while the impact response displays negative comovement,
consumption eventually falls, although after a long delay.
   Alternatively, there are some extensions of the model which may overturn this result. Here I discuss
intuitively some possibilities.



                                                     22
    Disasters are modeled for convenience as jumps, but in reality the contraction is not instantaneous.
As a result, it is sometimes di¢ cult for consumers and …rms to determine if a decrease in productivity
and output is a standard recession (a shock " in our setup) or is the start of a large depression. A possible
model is to assume that disasters last two periods; they are recognized as disasters only after they have
ended. In real time, agents only observe productivity, which is driven by both shocks. As a result, a
large decrease in productivity, due either to a disaster or to a large negative shock "; will lead agents
to anticipate a further decrease next period. Intuitively, the e¤ect will be to make " and p negatively
correlated. Hence, consumption and output would be more correlated. This learning mechanism could
hence attenuate the comovement puzzle.
    Alternatively, it may be possible to employ non-standard preferences or adjustment cost formulations,
as in Jaimovich and Rebelo (2009) for instance.
    Finally and probably more interestingly, adding sticky prices might alter this result. Suppose that
we embed the model in a standard New Keynesian setup. A perfect monetary policy could replicate
the ‡exible price allocation, i.e. the results of this paper. In this case, an increase in the probability
of disaster would require the central bank to decrease short-term interest rates. If, for some reason,
monetary policy is not accomodative enough, or it is impossible to decrease interest rates because of
the zero lower bound, then consumption would have to adjust. Since the real interest rate is too high,
consumption would fall. This intuition suggests that this (very substantial) extension of the model may
resolve the comovement puzzle.34



6       An Empirical Test
Disasters are di¢ cult to measure, and shocks to the probability of disasters are almost impossible
to observe. I have shown above that a simple, parsimonious framework can account for a variety of
business cycle and asset pricing facts. However one may remain skeptical since these shocks are not
directly measurable.
    One indirect piece of evidence is that estimated DSGE models give a signi…cant role to shocks to
in accounting for business cycle ‡uctuations.35 However these shocks are picked without restrictions.
My model suggests a natural restriction - shocks to the probability of disaster have a powerful e¤ect
on asset prices. This section provides a more precise test of the model by “backing out” the implied
probability of disaster from observed asset prices, and feeding this implied probability of disaster in the
model. The aim is to compare the quantity dynamics implied by the model with and without this new
shock. Does the …t improves compared to a model with only the standard TFP shock? The asset-price
that I use is the most natural one in the model, i.e. the price-dividend ratio.
    The methodology is as follows. In the model, given a vector of parameters                       , the price-dividend
          Pt                           Kt
ratio     Dt   is a function of kt =   zt   (where Kt is the capital stock and zt is TFP) and of the probability
of disaster pt :
                                                    Pt
                                                       =     (kt ; pt ; ) :
                                                    Dt

 3 5 Or   to shocks to the relative price of investment goods, which have similar dynamic properties.


                                                             23
Using data from the BEA, I can measure Kt and zt ; hence kt : I then calculate, for each date, the value
of the probability of disaster pbt which allows to match exactly the observed price-dividend ratio in the
data.36
    Next, I feed this probability of disaster in the model, together with the measured TFP. For instance,
the policy functions imply that aggregate non-durable consumption is Ct = zt c(kt ; pt ) which I can now
compute. Finally, the implied series for consumption, investment, output and employment are HP-
…ltered and compared to the data and to the baseline RBC model (i.e. pt = 0 for all t). The data is
from 1948q1 to 2008q4.
    Figure 8 presents the underlying probability of disaster. Given the methodology, this time series is
                                                          Pt
a nonlinear function of the price-dividend ratio          Dt   and the detrended capital stock kt . The short-run
‡uctuations hence mostly re‡ect changes in the stock market value. Interestingly, the highest probability
of disaster is estimated to occur at the very end of the sample, in the last quarter of 2008.
    Figure 9 presents the quantity implications (this …gure is best viewed with colors). Note that the
RBC model does a reasonable job at matching macroeconomic aggregates, given TFP, until 1985, even
if it does not generate quite enough volatility. The model with disaster risk is able to improve in some
dimensions, e.g. investment and employment, by creating sharp downturns which help account for some
big recessions, such as the mid-1970s and early 1980s episodes. A particularly interesting example is the
current recession. Figure 10 “zooms in”on the most recent data. Little happens to TFP in 2008, hence
the RBC model does not predict anything like the current recession.                   My model, however, generates
a large drop in output, investment, and employment through the shock to pt , as inferred from the
stock market value. The comovement problem comes back with a vengeance, however, since the model
suggests that consumption in 2008q4 should have gone up, while it fell markedly. As discussed in section
5.3, a richer version of the model may be able to account for this comovement.
                                                                                  Cov(m o del, data)
    Table 13 summarizes these results by computing a measure of …t,                  V ar(data)      ;for   each of the two
models. A close look at …gure9 suggests that the model with the two shocks does much better if one
introduces a lag between the model and the data. Hence, I also report this measure of …t when the
model series are lagged by 2 quarters. There may well be delays to decisions and various adjustment
costs which create such a delay, not captured in the simple version of the model. Finally, I report the
same statistic for the subsample of recessions - which I de…ned as GDP 1.5% or more below the HP-
…lter trend. The table reveals, that, especially with the 2-quarter lag, the model provides a substantial
improvement over the RBC model in terms of matching investment, and to some extent employment
and output. The …t is especially good when one looks at the recessions. The model is, however, a step
back for non-durable consumption, where the negative comovement implied by the model is too strong
compared to the data. Overall I conclude from this exercise that shocks to the probability of disaster,
as restricted by asset prices data, appear to help the RBC model …t the data, especially during severe
 3 6 The   price-dividend ratio is from CRSP. (Similar results are obtained using the Shiller data.) As is standard in the
literature, I divided the price by the sum of the last four quarters of dividends, given the substantial seasonality of
dividends. Because of changes over the sample period in the distribution of equity payout between dividends and share
repurchases, there are lower-frequency movements in the price-dividend ratio. Hence, I …rst removed these low-frequency
movements using a HP …lter (the smoothing parameter does not a¤ect the results signi…cantly, provided it is above 1600).

recessions, arguably the most interesting episodes.
    This result should not be too surprising in light of the empirical …ndings that the stock market is
correlated with GDP and investment. Intuitively, section 4 shows that the model generates a reasonable
relation between asset prices and investment or output. Hence, feeding in asset prices from the data
(through pt ) allows the model to improve quantities by using the empirical explanatory power of the
stock market for investment or GDP.



7     Conclusion
This work shows how introducing disasters into a standard RBC model improves its …t of asset return
data, preserves its relative success for quantity dynamics in response to TFP shocks, and …nally creates
some interesting new macroeconomic dynamics linked to the variation of risk premia. This parsimonious
setup has the advantage of being tractable, which allows to derive some analytical results and makes
it easy to embed it into richer models: researchers studying the connection between business cycle
dynamics and risk premia may …nd this a useful modeling tool. For instance, much of the research on
…nancial frictions has taken place in models which largely abstract from macroeconomic risk premia - a
potentially signi…cant limitation which been driven largely by technical considerations, and by the lack
of setups with large and volatile risk premia.
    As a result, there are many possible interesting extensions. First, it would be interesting to consider
the e¤ect of a time-varying risk of disaster in a richer business cycle model, e.g. one with collateral
constraints or choice of …nancial leverage, or a standard New Keynesian model. Disaster risk seems
also important for many emerging markets. Second, it would be interesting to consider richer dynamics
for disasters - such as these sketched in section 5 - in more detail. Third, a change in the aggregate
risk a¤ects macroeconomic aggregates also by a¤ecting the willingness to take on risk. This seems an
interesting mechanism to explore: faced with an increase in the probability of an economic disaster,
investors shift resources to technologies and projects which are less exposed to disasters. In doing
so, they move the economy alongside a risk-return frontier, and pick projects which are less risky but
also have lower expected returns. As a result, the expected output of the economy falls, and so does
productivity.

8.1          A simple method to solve models with time-varying risk premia

The model in this paper is simple enough that a full nonlinear solution is easy and relatively fast to
implement. However, many interesting extensions would require to add more state variables, making a
full non-linear solution di¢ cult. Results 1 and 2 of this paper, however, suggest a simple two-step solution
method: under the assumption that bk = btf p ; the model has the same implications for quantities than a
model without disaster, but with a di¤erent, and time-varying discount factor : As we know this model
can be solved precisely using a standard …rst-order linearization. Hence, the proposed methodology is
as follows:
                                                                  R                    R                               (1      )
                                                                                                                                    1
      (1) Change the average value of ; using                 =        (p)d (p) =           (1    p + p(1       bk )               )1   d (p)
where         is the invariant distribution of p:
      (2) Solve for the policy functions c(k; p); N (k; p) using the equivalent model: c(k; ); N (k; ) and a
standard log-linearization.
      (3) Solve for asset prices using the standard recursions. For simplicity I present them in the expected
utility case:
    (a) Equity paying out a process Dt = zt d(kt ; pt ); the price-dividend ratio f (pt ; kt ) = Pt =Dt satis…es:
                                     Z Z
                        + (1   ) 1          u1 (c(k 0 ; p0 ); N (k 0 ; p0 )) D(k 0 ; p0 )
f (p; k) = (1 p+p(1 b)             )                                                      (f (p0 ; k 0 ) + 1) dQ(p0 jp)dH("0 );
                                      "0 p0  u1 (c(k; p); N (k; p)) D(k; p)

where H is the c.d.f. of the normal shock "; and Q is the transition function of the process fpt g :
      (b) Yield curve: the price of a zero-coupon bond maturing in n periods satis…es:


                                                                       Z Z
    (n)                       (1   ) 1                                           u1 (C(k 0 ; p0 ); N (k 0 ; p0 )) (n   1)
q         (k; p) = p(1   b)              (1   q(1   r)) + 1     p                                                q          (k 0 ; p0 )dH("0 )dQ(p0 jp);
                                                                       "0   p0   u1 (C(k; p); N (k; p))

                                               (C N 1   )1
with q (0) (k; p) = 1 and u(C; N ) =               1          : This simpli…cation relies on this form of preferences,
which are consistent with balanced growth. These two recursions can be solved given the policy functions
C(k; p); N (k; p), and D(k; p) which are now known.
      With recursive utility, the same procedure works, but one also needs to compute the value function,
since it appears in the stochastic discount factor and hence in the asset price recursions. The value
function can be computed easily once the policy functions are known, or it can be computed inexpensively
using second-order perturbation methods as in Fernandez-Villaverde et al. (2008).
      In general, for any given model, one should check that the equivalence results 1 and 2 hold, but I
conjecture that they would in many models, and hence this opens the door to solving medium-scale
macro model with time-varying risk premia.


8.2          Computational Method

This method used in the paper is presented for the case of a Cobb-Douglas production function, and a
Cobb-Douglas utility function, but it can be used for arbitrary homogeneous of degree one production

function and utility function. Also, this presentation does not allow for correlation between p and ",
and for recoveries, but it is straightforward to modify the method to allow for this.

Because we take a power          1       of the value function, the max needs to be transformed in a min if                                              > 1:
To approximate numerically the solution of this problem, I proceed as follows:
   (1) Pick a grid for k; and a grid for i, and approximate the process for p with a Markov chain with
transition matrix Q: Discretize the normal shock ", with probabilities ("): I used 120 points for the grid
for k, 1200 points for the grid for i, and 5 points for the grid for ": Finally Q is picked as in Rouwenhorst
(1995). That method is a better approximation for highly persistent processes. I used 9 points for the
grid for p:
   (2) Compute for any k; i in the grid the value N (k; i) which solves

                                         R(k; i) = max k N 1               i       (1       N )(1    )
                                                                                                         :
                                                           N

   (3) The state space and action space are now discrete, so this is a standard discrete dynamic pro-
graming problem, which can be rewritten as follows, with one endogenous state, one exogenous state,
and two additional shocks: a binomial variable x equal to one if a disaster occurs (with probability p)
and the normal shock ":

modi…ed policy iteration37 (Judd (1998), p. 416), starting with a guess value close to zero. Recursive
utility implies that the Blackwell su¢ cient conditions do not hold here, hence it is not obvious that
the Bellman operator is a contraction. However, convergence occurs in practice as long as                                                         and the
probability of disasters are not too large. Note that to compute the expectation, we need the value
function outside the grid points. I use linear interpolation in the early steps of the iteration, then switch
to spline interpolation. The motivation is that linear interpolation is more robust, hence it is easier to
make the iterations converge; but spline interpolation is more precise.

     (4) Given g; we have V (K; z; p) = z g(k; p) 1                                                : We also obtain the policy functions C = zc(k; p),
I = zi(k; p); N = N (k; p); and the output policy function Y = zk N (k; p)1                                                                                                     : Because these policy
functions are de…ned on a discrete grid, I use interpolation in the simulations and impulse responses to
obtain more accurate results. (Linear or spline interpolations yield nearly the same results.)
     (5) To compute asset prices, we need the stochastic discount factor, which is given by the standard
formula:                                                                                                                                   0                                       1

Note that we …rst need to compute the conditional expectation which appears on the denominator of the
last term. Denote k 0 = j(k; p; "0 ; x0 ) the detrended capital next period, wich depends on the detrended
investment i(k; p) and on the realization of the shocks next period "0 and x0 (but not p0 ). The conditional
expectation is obtained as:

     (7) Next, we can obtain the term structure of interest rates on government bonds, using the recursion:

                            Pn (k; p) = Ex0 ;p0 ;"0 (M (s; s0 ; x0 ; "0 ) ((1                                         x0 q(1               r)) Pn              1 (k
                                                                                                                                                                      0
                                                                                                                                                                          ; p0 ))) ;

                                                                                                   33
where q(1        r) is the expected loss rate of government bonds during disasters. It is assumed that
government bonds are risk-free if there is no disaster.
   (8), Finally, we can compute the price of equity claims. I consider three types of “equities”. De…ne
the representative …rm’s dividend as earnings less investment:

                                                              Dt = Yt                wt Nt                It :

The …rst equity is simply a claim to the stream fDt g : Let Ft denote its price, which satis…es the standard
recursion:
                                               Ft = Et (Mt;t+1 (Ft+1 + Dt+1 )) :

Note that Dt can be written as Dt = zt d(kt ; pt ); where d(k; p) =                                                            k N1                i(k; p): Hence, we can
rewrite the …rm value recursion as:


                              zf (k; p) = Es0 js (M (s; s0 )                          (z 0 d(k 0 ; p0 ) + z 0 f (k 0 ; p0 ))) ;                                               (7)

where Ft = zt f (kt ; pt ). The equity return is then

                                     e                    Ft+1 + Dt+1
                                    Rt+1           =                                                                                                                          (8)
                                                               Ft
                                                          zt+1 f (kt+1 ; pt+1 ) + d(kt+1 ; pt+1 )
                                                   =                                              :
                                                           zt              f (kt ; pt )

To solve the recursion 7 in practice, I iterate starting with an initial guess f (k; p) = 0: The recursion
can be rewritten as:


                                    z0
      f (k; p)   = Es0 js M (s; s0 ) (d(k 0 ; p0 ) + f (k 0 ; p0 ))

   Note that the return computed by solving this recursion for …rm value can be compared to the
expression obtained by the investment return. The two must give the same result. In practice it is a
useful numerical check to perform.

   Finally, The levered equity assumes that the payo¤ streams is Ct        : It is easy to adapt the same
method to price the claims to these assets. Finally, I obtain the model statistics by simulating 1000
samples of length 400, started at the nonstochastic steady-state, and cutting o¤ the …rst 200 periods.

8.3    Data Sources

Business cycle and return moments of Tables 2-7: consumption is nondurable + services consump-
tion, investment is …xed investment, and output is GDP, from the NIPA Table 1.1.3, quarterly data
1947q1-2008q4. Hours is nonfarm business hours from the BLS productivity program (through FRED:
HOABNS). The return data is from Ken French’s webpage, (benchmark factors, aggregated to quarterly
frequency, and de‡ated by the CPI (CPIAUCSL through FRED)).
   Table 8: the data is taken from John Cochrane’s webpage (Cochrane, 2008) and the regression results
replicate exactly his speci…cation (for the simple regression of return on dividend yield last year). This
is also the CRSP value weighted return, and the risk-free rate is from Ibottson.
   Section 6: the price-dividend ratio is from CRSP. The capital stock is obtained from the annual …xed
assets tables, and is interpolated. TFP is computed as output divided by labor to the power 2/3 and
capital to the power 1/3.

Figure 9: Time-series of Consumption, Investment, Employment and Output, in the data,
in the RBC model, and in the benchmark model. This picture plots the data, together with the
model-implied time series for macro aggregates for the RBC model (when TFP is fed into the model)
and for the benchmark model (when both TFP and the probability of disaster are fed into the model).
See section 6 for details. All series are logged and HP-…ltered, 1947q1-2008q4.

Figure 10: Time-series of Consumption, Investment, Employment and Output, in the data,
in the RBC model, and in the benchmark model, from 2005q1 to 2008q4. This picture is a
zoomed-in version of the previous …gure, and displays the data, the model-implied time series for macro
aggregates for the RBC model (when TFP is fed into the model) and for the benchmark model (when
both TFP and the probability of disaster are fed into the model). See section 6 for details. All series
are logged and HP-…ltered, over 1947q1-2008q4, then cut from 2005q1 onwards.
