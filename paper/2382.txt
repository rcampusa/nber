                 Social Security Reforms and Poverty
                   Among Older Dual-Earner Couples




                              ABSTRACT




     Most retirement studies examine older married couples in which
the husband is the sole earner. This paper extends the focus of
analysis to examine older dual—earner couples. It further evaluates
the impact of Social Security reforms on older working couples'
retirement ages and retirement incomes.

      Specifically, we examine two questions:  (1) What are the
likely effects of changes in Social Security rules on the retirement
decisions of older working women and their husbands? and (2) How are
these changes likely to alter the incidence of poverty among retired
dual—earner couples? The evidence suggests that benefit reforms
intended to bolster the Social Security Administration's financial
position are also likely to worsen the economic Status of an
important minority of dual—earner couples.

      In   the United States, Social Security benefits constitute a
significant source of retirement income: more than 90% of the aged
are paid benefits under the program, and almost two—thirds of

elderly households receive half or more of their income from Social
Security (Upp, 1983; Andrews, 1984) .    It   is therefore important to
ascertain how Social Security benefit reforms such as those recently

enacted will affect older peoples' income. The impact of benefit

reductions on older persons! living standards depends on two
factors: the size of the Social Security benefit cuts; and whether

older workers counteract lower retirement benefits by working

longer. This paper extends past research by evaluat±zg the signs
and magnitudes of working couples' responses to Social Security
reforms.1 Two central questions guided the analysis:      (1) What is
the anticipated impact of recent changes in Social Security rules on

the retirement decisions of older working couples? and (2) How are
these new rules likely to alter the incidence of poverty among

retired dual-earner couples, taking into account induced changes in
retirement behavior?

     Sections I and II sketch the retirement incentives facing older

couples prior to and after Social Security reforms similar to those

actually legislated in 1983, as well as several others under current
discussion. Section III describes a model of the dual—earner

retirement research. Recent life cycle models of males' retirement
patterns include Fields and Mitchell (1984a), Gustman and Steinmeier
(1986), Burtless and Moffitt (1984). Older women's employment is
examined by Clark et al (1980), Hanoch and Honig (1983), Henretta
and O'Rand (1980, 1983), and Honig (1985). None of these studies
estimates a life—cycle model for dual—earner couples.

couples'   retirement decision, and indicates the weight older couples

appear to accord to income and leisure time. Sections IV and V
report estimated changes in income and poverty status under the

simulated reforms. Throughout, a partial equilibrium approach is
used; behavioral estimates assume that earnings and private pension
income remain unaffected by these reforms. A final section presents

conclusions.



I.   Retirement Incentives Prior to the Reforms
     Recent data do not exist with which to assess directly how

Social Security reforms actually enacted are affecting current
retirement behavior and retiree income. It is thus necessary to
update an older but a nationally representative data set known as

the Longitudinal Retirement History Survey (LRHS) covering workers
retiring during the 1970's. For the purpose of this study, dual—
earner couples in the LRHS are identified as those in which both
husbands and wives are employed in the paid labor market in 1969.2

Our sample   is   limited to private sector wage and salary workers

since no pension data are available for government or military
employees. The study is also restricted to couples in which the
husbands were age 59-61 in 1969, and where the wives were age 54—62




2Singles of both sexes are also included in the LRHS but are not the
focus here; see Honig (1985)
                                                                 3


 in   that same year.3 The resulting data set consists of 139 dual—
 earner couples, followed over a ten year period.4
        The LRHS and the earnings records which supplement it provide

 extensive information on income opportunities available to working
 couples. These are used to generate predicted earnings, pension,

 and Social Security income measures for the original 1970's data
 file. Earnings histories for both men and women are employed to
predict what each worker could have earned if he or she remained
employed from 1969 forward. Private pension data are difficult to
obtain for both sexes. Since the LRHS Only indicates when a pension

is received, industry—level benefits for age-65 retirees reported by
Kotlikoff and Smith (1983) are employed as proxies for benefit

amounts. Actuarial reductions for other retirement dates are

available from Schulz and Leavitt (reported in Burkhauser and Quinn,
1980) . Women's benefit levels are further reduced by a factor of

22%, based on evidence from Lazear and Rosen (1987) on sex

differentials in pension benefit amounts.

       Social Security benefits for the 1970's data file are computed
based on rules in effect when the workers make their retirement

decisions. This is assumed to be when the husband attains age 60, in

3The women and their husbands are present in all waves of the LRHS
between 1969 and 1979.

4 This group is smaller than the group of 1,024 while married males
examined in our previous analysis (Fields and Mitchell, 1984a)
However, most of those men were married to women who ere not
employed for pay at the time the husband was making his retirement
decision. Pozzebon and Mitchell (1986) describe how the subsample
of dual—earner couples is extracted from the larger group, and
emphasize important sirnularities between the larger sample and that
used here insofar as education, age, husband's income and husband's
retirement age.
                                                               4


accordance with previous research (Fields and Mitchell, 1984b)
Computations for women are complicated by the fact that a wife's

retirement benefits can be based either on her own earnings record

or her husband's, whichever are larger. To carry out this

computation, it is necessary to determine whether the husband is

retired at each possible retirement date open to the wife.

Consequently wives are posited to make their retirement decisions

contingent on their husbands' retirement decisions. This "wife as

follower" formulation is justified by the empirical impossibility of
specifying a fully simultaneous budget constraint where husbands
react to wives' retirement behavior, and vice versa. In addition,
it seems plausible to formulate wives' retirement decisions as

conditional on their husbands', at least for the cohort of women

retiring during the 1970's. Whether this model will be as fitting
for women retiring in the 1980's and beyond is, as yet, unknown.
     To assess the likely impact of the several Social Security
reforms considered here, the 1970's LRHS data file is updated to

represent the retirement opportunities facing dual—earner couples
reaching retirement age in 1982 and beyond. Three data modification

steps are required, following the procedure sketched by Fields and
Mitchell (1984a)
     1. Earnings: Pre—tax earnings for both members of the dual—

earner couple are updated by applying an economy—wide wage growth
factor, on the assumption that older workers share proportionately

in productivity increases over time. Federal income tax and Social

Security contribution formulas in effect in 1982 are applied to

create net earnings of the husband and/or wife, if employed.
                                                                 5


      2.   Pensions: Company—provided pension amounts are updated to
1982 dollars, on the assumption that pre—retirement pension profiles

during the 1970's did not grow in real terms. After retirement,

benefits are assumed to be constant in nominal terms as was true for

many plans during the 1970's (Clark and McDermed, 1982). Federal

income tax is subtracted from gross pension amounts to arrive at net
real pension benefits for alternative retirement dates.

      3. Social Seourity: Real Social Security benefits for both
members of the dual-earner couple are computed according to the

rules in effect in 1982, taking into account that payments rise in
proportion to increases in the consumer price index.

      Components of the baseline income opportunity set for married

men and their wives contemplating retirement in 1982 are displayed
in the Appendix Table. These income amounts are computed as of the

point when the husbands turn age 60, that is, when both members of
the couple are expected to be making their retirement decisions.

Present values of annual payments are adjusted by a real discount
rate of 2%, as well as standard mortality figures which differ by

age and sex provided by the US Department of Health and Human
Services .5

II.    Reform Seenarios
      Four Social Security reforms are examined in this paper: an
increase in the normal retirement are, an increase in the late


5Stochastic events other than death are assumed to have no influence
on income opportunities. While the certainty assumption has been
relaxed in a few recent retirement models, they cannot readily
incorporate the complexities of the sequentially determined budget
constraint in the dual-earner case (Diamond and Hausman, 1984)
                                                                      6


retirement credit, a rise in the early retirement penalty, and a

delay in the cost—of living adjustment. Before describing their
particulars, it is useful to remind the reader how Social Security

benefits are computed.6
     The first step in deriving retirement benefits is to determine

a worker's Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) .    This     is derived

by indexing earnings up to the Social Security taxable ceiling
between 1951 and the year in which he/she turns age 60. Low years

are dropped, and the remaining ones averaged.

     The second step is to find the worker's Primary Insurance

znount (PIA) .   This   is determined using the following formula, with

"Bend Point 1" set to $230 and "Bend Point 2" set to $1388 in 1982

(both Bend Point rise over time with the Consumer Price Index)

     90% of AIME to "Bend Point 1"

     plus
     32% of AIME between "Bend Point 1" and "Bend Point 2"

     plus
     15% of AIME above "Bend Point 2".

     The third step is to compute the Social Security benefit a

retired worker could receive as a multiple of his/her own PIA, which

depends on his/her retirement age: Benefit =    Multiple   *   PIA.   The

Multiple is equal to 1.0 for a worker retiring at age 65, with

smaller multiples applied to early retirees, and larger ones to
those delaying retirement. Specifically, the early retirement

Security rules.
                                                                  7


 reduction factor in 1982 was 6.66% per year, and the delayed

 retirement credit 3% per year (figured to the month, in practice)
      The final step in computing benefits is to determine the

 spouse's benefit, if any. A wife may receive benefits based on her
 own earnings history or on her husband's if he is retired, whichever
 is greater.7 If the wife is 65 and her husband is retired, she

 receives 50% of his PIA; if she retires before age 65, this amount

 is reduced. If the husband is not yet retired at the wife's

 retirement date, she may file for benefits on the basis of her own
 record and these may be increased where appropriate on her husband's
 retirement.

      The four Social Security experiments examined here operate by
 altering the multiples associated with benefit computations.

 Experiment A increases the normal retirement age by changing the
 formula so that the multiple equals 1 for retirement at age 67,
 instead of at age 65 (as in 1982). Congress has actually

implemented this change, phasing in age 67 as the new normal age by
the year 2027 (the simulations below abstract from the phase—in

period). Experiment B delays the cost of living adjustment applied
to benefits by six months. This policy is identical to that enacted
in 1983, and has the effect of decreasing real benefits by just over

two percent (half the prevailing inflation rate at the time)
Experiment C increases the late retirement credit by raising
benefits 6 2/3 percent for each year worked beyond age 65. This

•contrasts with the three percent increment for delayed retirement in

11n principle, a husband might receive more on his wife's record than
on his own, but the chances are sufficiently remote for this to
occur that the possibility is ignored in computations below.
                                                                8


effect prior to 1983.   Experiment D increases the penalty for

retiring early. Specifically, early benefits are reduced by 15
percent for each year prior to 65, instead of the current 6 2/3

percent. This proposal was advocated by the Reagan Administration
in the early 1980's but has not yet been implemented.

     Tables 1 and 2 report how each of the policy reforms alter

annual and present values of Social Security benefits at different

retirement ages, from the vantage point of 1982. Results for
husbands of dual—earner couples in the LRHS sample are provided for

their 60th, 62nd, 65th, and 67th birthdays; data for married women

are given on the wives' 60th, 62nd, 65th, and 67th birthdays. Both
Tables hold constant retirement behavior; the next section explores

possible behavioral changes in retirement resulting from these

policy changes.
     Increasing the normal retirement age as in Experiment A,
reduces both men's and women's Social Security benefits

substantially, regardless of when the workers retire. Annual

payments for husbands fall by a larger amount ($400-l,400) than do

wives' ($300—900), though percentage reductions are about the same.
The dollar difference in benefit reductions across males and females
is attributable to the fact that wives may receive their own

benefits or roughly half of their husbands', whichever is greater.

This somewhat softens the impact of reductions in their own PIA.

Discounted Social Security benefits decline sharply for men, falling

by over $17,000 for early retirement dates, and by more than $11,000
for those retiring at 65. Hence the experiment "tilts" the structure
of Social Security benefits in such as way as to reward deferred

retirement more powerfully than in the baseline scenario. Wives'

benefits under Experiment A are also reduced, but by roughly
constant amounts for retirement ages 60—65. Hence the experiment

do: not sharply alter the tilt of discounted Social Security
benefits, in contrast to the men's case. For both groups the

e'p. imntal budget structure is roughly neutral for retirement
          65, in contrast with the baseline figures.

     xeriment B defers the Social Security cost of living
adjustment, reducing real annual and discounted benefits only
slighti'. or both sexes. Annual benefits fall by about $100 and
TD.: decline by about $1500, for both men and women. Evidently
     experiment does not substantially alter Social Security benefit
levels or incentives for deferring retirement.

     Raising the late retirement credit, as in Experiment C, leaves

annual and discounted benefits unchanged for those who retire at age

65 or younger. For men deferring retirement to age 67, annual
benefits are increased by about $500 producing a discounted stream

which is higher by $4000. Women's annual payments rise by only $300
for retirement at 67, which translates into a PDV increase of just
over $3000. Because the reform alters only post—65 benefits, and

because the magnitudes are small, it does not have a strong impact
on retirement incentives for either member of the dual—earner

couple.

     Experiment D has the largest impact on post—reform incomes, as

it imposes a severe penalty on early retirement; benefits for
retirement at and beyond age 65 are not affected. A married man
retiring at age 62 under this scenario would experience a $1,700
                                                                10


fall in annual benefits, yielding a discounted income stream lower

by $21,000. Experiment D thus implies strong new incentives to
defer retirement; the benefit tilt is such that discounted benefits

rise almost 50 percent if the husband were to retire at 65 instead

of 62. For wives, the effects are similar in character though
smaller. For retirement at 62, annual benefits fall by $1000, and

PDVSS falls by about $12,000. The gain to deferring retirement to
age 65 is now about 40 percent, or about $17,000. Because of the

magnitudes of the benefit cuts involved, and because of the dramatic

changes in gains to deferring retirement, this reform would be

expected to have the largest effect on retirement behavior, as
compared to the other three described above.

     On balance, then, raising the normal retirement age and




                               -
reducing early retirement benefits produce the largest drop in
annual retiree income, for both husbands and wives. Intermediate

effects are discerned for delaying the cost of living adjustment,

and increases in the late retirement credit.



III. __.
     To predict whether dual—earner couples will retire later or

earlier under the four Social Security reforms just described, it is

necessary to predict behavioral responses to the new budget sets.

Earlier research suggests that a discrete choice framework is
empirically useful in modelling both married men's retirement
behavior (Fields and Mitchell, 1984a) and that of their wives

(Pozzebon and Mitchell, 1986). In this framework, the utility of
retirement at age j is associated with the discounted income stream
                                                                 11


 (PDVY) and the remaining leisure time (RET) associated with that

retirement choice:
          = [13 in PDVYI + A
                             in RET±   )   + ejj
Parameter estimates of 13 and A, obtained using a Logit maximization

approach, indicate the relative weight older workers associate with
income and leisure opportunities.

      Using this model, Pozzebon and Mitchell (1986) find that older
female employees appear to value leisure relative to income more

strongly than do their husbands. On the basis of this finding, it
is anticipated that wivest responses to Social Security reforms
described here would be smaller than for their husbands. This

surmise may be evaluated empirically by using behavioral parameter

estimates to predict changes in retirement patterns resulting from
the four experimental scenarios. To this task we turn next.


IV.    Effects of the Reforms on Retirement Ages
      Consistent with the approach throughout, analysis of the
effects of the four reforms on retirement ages assumes that wives

make their retirement decisions subsequent to those of their

husbands. Several computational steps are required to obtain the
desired results. First, males' retirement responses to each of the

experiments are predicted, by combining retirement coefficients8 for


8Males' Logit estimates are derived as described in Fields and
Mitchell (1984b) . The coefficients used here differ in the second
decimal place from those used in the earlier paper, since reanalysis
of the original datset indicated that males' pension values had been
computed using too high a discount rate in the previous study.
Applying a corrected discount rate raised the present value of total
income figures for males by 1 to 2 percent, hence the negligible
change in behavioral parameters.
                                                                12


the LRHS husbands with income streams under each of the reform

scenarios. Next, it is determined whether changes in males'

retirement ages are substantial enough to alter the retirement

income opportunities available to their wives, insofar as wives'

benefits depend on their husbands'. Having done this, wives'

responses to these new budget sets are computed using behavioral
estimates derived by Pozzebon and Mitchell (1986)

      It would be anticipated that males' retirement responses to

Social Security reforms would be the largest under Experiment D.

Compared with the other three cases considered, this reform reduces

Social Security benefits by a greater amount, and tilts the PDV
structure more steeply. Indeed this expectation is borne out by the

results in Table 3, though augmenting the early retirement penalty
produces very small changes in male retirement ages overall —— on
the order of three months. The other experiments have even smaller

impacts on male retirement, delaying it by 0.1 to 2 months on
average. In general, married men do not appear to extend their
worklives by very much when confronted with changes in retirement
opportunities as described here.9

     Table 3 also shows how women's retirement behavior changes

under each of the reforms. As noted earlier, in principle it is

necessary to take husbands' changes in retirement ages into account

when computing wives' post-reform budget constraints. However, this
proves to be unnecessary under the present experiments, because



9Responses of this magnitude are similar to those reported by
Burtless and Moffitt (1984), Gustrnan and Steinme.ier (1986), Hausman
and Wise (1985), and Zabaiza and Piachaud (1981)
                                 Table 3.

                                Predicted Changes in Retirement Age of:

men's retirement responses are so small.10 Consequently wives'

responses to their new budget sets are computed directly using

behavioral parameters described above, assuming that their husbands'

retirement ages are given.
     Results for wives in Table 3 are, in most cases, reminiscent of

the findings for married men in terms of the direction and the

ranking of responses. As was true for men, the largest estimated

response among women occurs under Experiment D, which lowers early
retirement benefits and increases the reward to deferring

retirement. The women's response is, however, much smaller; wives
are predicted to delay retirement under this scenario by only 0.7

months, whereas the figure for men is 3.1 months. Also smaller are
the women's responses to the other three experiments, as compared to

men's. Experiments A and C have tiny positive effects: increasing
the normal retirement age is predicted to push back wives'

retirement by 0.4 months, and raising the late retirement credit
would induce only a 0.1 month delay. A small response of -0.5
months is predicted for Experiment B. The fact that women's
retirement responses are lower than men's is attributable to two

factors: (1) parameter estimates indicate women weigh income

relatively less, and leisure more strongly, than do men; and (2) the
Social Security experiments themselves have a somewhat smaller
impact on women's incomes, as compared to men's.

10Budget set figures for husbands are defined at each birthday;
consequently, changes in retirement ages of less than a full year
are too small to change computed figures for husbands' retirement
incomes. Inspection of the disperson of individual males'
retirement age responses confirms that in no case does the estimated
change in a husband's retirement age equal or exceed six months as a
result of the four experiments.
                                                                14



V.    Effects of the Reforms on Retirement Incomes and Poverty
      Whether and how these changes in retirement income policy

affect poverty among dual-earner couples is addressed using Table 4.
This table compares family income to the official poverty line11 for
two—member households at various dates. For example, family income

on the husband's 60th birthday is computed as the sum of his and/or
her earnings (if either is employed at the time), plus Social

Security and pension benefits (if either or both members of the

couple are eligible). Similar computations are performed for the

couple when the husband turns age 62, 65, and 67, to determine the
dynamics of income patterns as the dual—earner couples age.

     Two cautions regarding the findings are in order. First,
poverty computations are only carried out between the husband's 60th
and 67th birthdays. This is felt to be the relevant range for the

purposes of retirement policy research, since it seems unlikely that
most older individuals could be induced to defer retirement beyond

age 67 (the average retirement age for men is now about age 63;
Fields and Mitchell, 1984b). As such, the present analysis does not
speak to qestions of poverty among retirees in their 70's and
beyond. A second caveat is that only earnings and retirement


Poverty lines for two-person households are taken from the Social
Security Bulletin (US Department of Health and Human Services). For
future years, the nominal poverty line is projected using the 4.8%
inflation rate used throughout the study. We do not use the poverty
line for elderly (age 65+) households because husbands in the LRHS
sample are age 60 initially, and their wives tend to be even
younger. The poverty line for the elderly is about 10% lower than
for rionelderly households, so using the overall poverty line
produces upper bound estimates of the actual incidence of low income
in the LRHS sample of dual-earner retired couples.
                                                               15


benefits   are considered in the computations, while other forms of

income are ignored. This is necessitated by the poor quality of
asset data in the LRHS. Since many older couples hold few assets
other than their homes, money income figures are probably not very
skewed by this omission.
     The first line of Table 4 indicates that family income for the

average dual—earner couple is quite substantial at the husband's

60th birthday. This is true irrespective of whether one examines
the baseline or the four experimental scenarios. Because husbands
and wives are working at that date and earnings are relatively high,

income exceeds at least twice the poverty line for all families.
Essentially the same pattern prevails at the husbands' 62nd

birthday; at that age most husbands, and almost 80 percent of their
wives are still employed.

     However by the time the husbands attain age 65, a different

picture begins to emerge. By now, most of the husbands and two—
thirds of the wives have retired. The baseline scenario shows that

11 percent of families are now below the poverty line, and another

26 percent are quite close (twice the poverty line). This picture is
essentially reproduced under Experiments B and C. In contrast,
Experiments A and D have more severe effects. Raising the normal

retirement age (as implemented in 1983) and lowering early
retirement benefits raise the incidence of poverty by 45 percent

(relative to the husband's 65th baseline income). Near-poverty,
measured as having family income between 1 and 2 times poverty,

rises by more than 25 percent.

     When the husband is age 67, poverty rates using the baseline

model as well as Experiments B and C increase somewhat, to 14

percent (from 11 percent at age 65). This is mainly explained by the
earnings decline for both members of the couple, exacerbated by

falling real pension benefits as they are eroded by inflation.
Results for Experiments A and D are even more striking than before,

with a 57 percent increase in the incidence of poverty and roughly a
50 percent increase in near—poverty.

     It should be recognized that most dual—earner retired families
in the age range examined are actually rather well—off. All of the

sample couples are above the poverty line when the husband turns age
60. Between the husbands' 60th and 67th birthdays, 83 percent of all
families receive income greater than the poverty line in all years,

using the baseline projections. The proportion non—poor in all
years between the husband's 60th and 67th birthday is still as high

as 73 percent even under the most stringent reform, Experiment D.

Nevertheless, it is evident that poverty grows more prevalent as

couples age, even for this relatively well-off group.
     In sum, the evidence suggests that altering Social Security

benefits has virtually no impact on retirement ages for most dual—

earner couples. Indeed, the responses of older working wives prove
to be even smaller than those of their husbands. All four
experiments predict a negative effect on retirement income. Raising

the normal retirement age and/or augmenting the early retirement

penalty are two reforms which greatly increase the incidence of

poverty and near-poverty among dual—earner retired couples.
                                                                 17


VI.    Conclusion arid Discussion

      Retirement decisions of older dual—earner couples are the focus

of analysis in the present paper. Specifically, two questions are
addressed:   (1) What are the likely effects of changes in Social
Security rules on the retirement decisions of older working women

and their husbands? and (2) How are these changes likely to alter

the incidence of poverty among retired dual—earner couples?

      The evidence indicates that raising the normal retirement age

and reducing early retirement benefits produce the largest drop in

annual retiree income, for both husbands and wives. Intermediate

effects are discerned for delaying the cost of living adjustment,
and increases in the late retirement credit. In all four cases,

retirement responses are extremely small for both members of the

dual—earner couples. At the same time, at least two of the reforms
greatly increase the incidence of poverty and near—poverty among

such couples: raising the normal retirement age and augmenting the
early retirement penalty.

      These findings imply a rather pessimistic assessment of the
Social Security reforms enacted in 1983, as well as those which were
discussed but not yet enacted. All of the reforms diminish the

living standards of many couples who reached retirement age in

relatively good standing, though they have virtually no impact on
retirement patterns. It appears that benefit reforms intended to
bolster the Social Security Administration's financial position are

also likely to worsen the economic status of an important minority
of dual-earner couples.

aThese figures differ slightly from those in Tl0.l, p. 113 of Fields

working wives. In addition the present value of pension benefits is
higher here due to an adjustment in the discounting procedure.

husband's record at his retirement date.

CComputations assume that the wife receives Social Security based on
her own record or that of her husband, whichever is higher.
