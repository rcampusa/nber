                                               ABSTRACT

This paper documents several new patterns associated with firms issuing stocks and bonds in foreign
markets that motivate the need for and help guide the direction of future research. Three major patterns
stand out. (1) A large and growing fraction of capital raisings, especially debt issuances, occurs in
international markets, but a very small number of firms accounts for the bulk of international capital
raisings, highlighting the cross-firm heterogeneity in financial globalization. (2) Changes in firm performance
following equity and debt issuances in international markets are qualitatively similar to those following
domestic issuances, suggesting that capital raisings abroad are not intrinsically different from those
in domestic markets. (3) Firms continue to issue securities both abroad and at home after accessing
international markets, suggesting that international and domestic markets are complements, not substitutes.
Existing theories do not fully account for these patterns.

1. Introduction

         Financial globalization has reshaped international and corporate finance over the last two

decades. About 30 percent of all capital raised by firms through stock and bond issues over the

period 1991-2005 occurred in securities markets outside their home countries. Obstfeld and

Taylor (2004) show that a historically unprecedented percentage of the world’s financial capital

now flows across international borders. Furthermore, the amount raised by firms in foreign

markets has grown almost four-fold since 1991, approaching one trillion U.S. dollars in 2005.

         Yet, basic questions about the internationalization of capital markets remain incompletely

answered. Why do firms sell stocks and bonds in foreign markets? What are the effects of

issuing securities in foreign markets on firm performance? What are the cross-firm distributional

effects from international capital raisings? The lack of firm-level information on equity and debt

issuances in both foreign and domestic markets limits our understanding of the causes and effects

of financial globalization at the macro and micro level.

         To help address these questions, we provide the first documentation of several salient

firm-level patterns associated with international capital raisings.1 First, we illustrate the

characteristics of firms that raise capital through the issuance of equity and debt abroad and

document how these firms differ from both firms that only raise capital domestically and firms

that do not issue securities locally or internationally. We analyze numerous firm-level

characteristics, including firm size, growth, investment, profitability, capital structure, and

corporate valuation. Second, we show what happens to firms after issuing equity or debt abroad

and compare these patterns to firms that raise capital domestically. Third, we compare how firms

1
  The international finance literature increasingly stresses the desirability of using firm-level evidence to understand
the underpinning of financial globalization, which has been studied extensively at the aggregate level. See, for
example, Forbes (2007), Henry (2007), and Kose, Prasad, Rogoff, and Wei (2009). Moreover, a separate, though
complementary, literature studies firm-level patterns in international trade. For a survey, see Bernard, Jensen,
Redding, and Schott (2007).


                                                           1
use domestic bond and equity markets before and after they internationalize. Rather than testing

hypotheses or formulating new theories, we contribute to the literature by documenting new

patterns and relating them to existing theories. As a result, our research both advertises the need

for and helps guide the direction of future research.

       To analyze the firm-level patterns associated with international capital raisings, we

construct a new database. The dataset includes 168,513 equity and debt issues in domestic and

international capital markets, conducted by 45,969 firms from 116 countries, and covers the

period 1991-2005. We match these data with comprehensive information on firm balance sheets

and income statements for 38,801 firms.

       Three broad categories of findings emerge from our analysis. We first summarize the

findings and then relate them to existing theoretical and empirical work on capital raisings and

international financial integration.

       First, a large and growing fraction of capital raisings, especially debt issuances, is

conducted in international markets, but only a small proportion of firms actually uses

international markets, and of this small fraction, a very small sub-sample accounts for the bulk of

international capital raisings. Of the total capital raised through security issuances in capital

markets in 2005, firms from developing and developed countries raised, respectively, 51 and 39

percent outside their home countries. This share is higher for debt than for equity issues. Debt

issuances abroad accounted for 35 percent of the total amount raised through debt issuances in

capital markets over the period 1991-2005, while equity issues abroad represented ten percent of

total amount raised through equity issues over the same period. Furthermore, about 15 percent of

the almost 46,000 firms that issued any securities in public markets during our sample period

accessed international markets, and only one-tenth of these firms (less than 700 firms) collected




                                                 2
about two-thirds of all the funds raised internationally. Finally, firms raising capital abroad are

larger, slower growing, and more leveraged than firms that only raise capital domestically.

        Second, changes in firm performance following equity and debt issues in international

markets are qualitatively similar to those that follow the issuance of securities in domestic

markets. Whether firms issue securities in domestic or international markets, they tend to

become larger and experience a decrease in their growth rate and profitability following capital

raisings. These patterns suggest that issues in international markets are not intrinsically different

from those in domestic markets. Furthermore, the differences between firms that raise capital

abroad and those that only issue securities domestically exist many years before firms actually

access international markets.

        Third, although issues abroad tend to be significantly larger than issues at home, firms (1)

continue to issue securities in both international and domestic markets after accessing

international markets and (2) increase the amount of money raised in domestic markets after

internationalizing. In particular, for firms from developing (developed) countries, the median

issuance in international markets is about 18 (two) times larger than the median issuance in

domestic markets. Furthermore, firms do not opt out of domestic markets once they

internationalize. To the contrary, while continuing to use international markets, firms

significantly increase their capital raisings at home. For example, following internationalization,

the typical developed country firm more than triples the average annual amount raised in

domestic markets, increases the amount raised domestically relative to assets, and also captures a

larger fraction of the total capital raising activity in its domestic market.

        Our findings relate to three theories of the causes and effects of international capital

raisings. First, the segmentation view argues that firms internationalize to circumvent




                                                   3
regulations, poor accounting systems, taxes, and illiquid domestic markets that discourage

foreign investors from purchasing their shares (Black, 1974; Solnik, 1974; Stapleton and

Subrahmanyam, 1977; Errunza and Losq, 1985; Alexander, Eun, and Janakiramanan, 1987; and

Domowitz, Glen, and Madhavan, 1998). Thus, firms internationalize to gain access to less

expensive capital (Foerster and Karolyi, 1999, and Miller, 1999). Second, the ‘‘bonding’’ view

argues that firms internationalize to bond themselves to a better corporate governance framework

that limits the extraction of private benefits by corporate insiders (Stulz, 1999; Coffee, 2002;

Reese and Weisbach, 2002; and Doidge, Karolyi, and Stulz, 2004). This makes firms more

attractive to potential investors, reducing their cost of capital, and inducing an enduring

improvement in firm performance. Third, the market timing view suggests that firms raise capital

abroad to exploit temporarily high prices for their securities during ‘‘hot’’ markets (Errunza and

Miller, 2000 and Henderson, Jegadeesh, and Weisbach, 2006).

      While the patterns we document do not formally reject or confirm existing theories, they

suggest that there are large gaps in the ability of these theories to account for noteworthy features

of international capital raisings. For instance, the finding that the changes in firm characteristics

following international capital raisings are qualitatively similar to those that follow domestic

capital raisings are difficult to reconcile with the bonding view, which argues that capital raisings

in international markets are intrinsically different from capital raisings in domestic markets and

should therefore have qualitatively different effects on firm performance. Similarly, our finding

that firms do not opt out of domestic markets after raising capital abroad, but actually increase

their participation in these capital markets, does not fit the predictions of simple segmentation

arguments that international markets offer unambiguously better services and/or less expensive

capital than local markets (once firms meet the conditions required for going abroad). In terms of




                                                 4
market timing, the argument that hot international markets for firms’ securities are driving the

decision to raise capital abroad does not fully explain why only very few firms actually raise

capital abroad.2

       Furthermore, theories of internationalization and corporate finance need to account for

three patterns associated with international capital raisings that are not the focus of existing

research. First, debt markets tend to be more internationalized than equity markets. Second, firms

that raise capital abroad are different from firms that only raise capital at home before they

internationalize; these differences in firm characteristics do not emerge after firms

internationalize. Third, firms raise capital in both international and domestic markets after

accessing international markets. In sum, our findings indicate that current theories have

substantive limitations in accounting for firm-level experiences and highlight directions for

developing more precise theories of the internationalization process and its implications.

        In addition, our paper extends several strands of empirical literature related to capital

market internationalization. Henderson, Jegadeesh, and Weisbach (2006) analyze aggregate

patterns of capital raising activity around the world and document how internationalization varies

across security types and regions. We expand their work by analyzing the extent of

internationalization at the firm level. Several other papers analyze the characteristics of firms that

list their shares abroad, through either direct cross-listings or depositary receipts (see, for

example, Pagano, Roell, and Zechner, 2002; Lang, Lins, and Miller, 2003; Lang, Raedy, and

Yetman, 2003; Claessens and Schmukler, 2007; and Gozzi, Levine, and Schmukler, 2008). In

contrast, we focus on capital raisings, not on equity market cross-listings. Moreover, while most

studies ignore debt issuances, we analyze both equity and debt markets. Indeed, we find that debt

2
  DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and Stulz (2007) make a similar argument when analyzing SEOs in the U.S., highlighting
that many firms do not issue stocks during an open financing window, which is inconsistent with theories that stress
the role of market timing as the driving force for stock issues.


                                                         5
issues in public markets are a much more important source of capital for firms than equity issues,

and debt markets are far more internationalized than equity markets. Our paper also relates to

research on the firm-level effects of lowering barriers to international capital flows (see, for

example, Chari and Henry, 2004, 2008; Patro and Wald, 2005; and Schmukler and Vesperoni,

2006). However, we do not directly study the effects of relaxing those barriers. Instead, we

analyze the changes in firm performance and capital raising activity associated with security

issuances in international capital markets.

       This paper also identifies patterns relevant for the large corporate finance literature on the

motivations for issuing debt and equity (see, for example, Loughran and Ritter, 1995, 1997;

Pagano, Panetta, and Zingales, 1998; Baker and Wurgler, 2000, 2002; DeAngelo, DeAngelo, and

Stulz, 2007; and Kim and Weisbach, 2008). We contribute to this literature by tracing the

evolution of firm characteristics, including capital structure, investment, and profitability, after

firms issue debt and equity securities in domestic and international markets. These time-series

patterns for a broad array of firms from around the world provide new evidence regarding the

motivations for security issuances. Furthermore, the finding that firms issue debt and equity

securities in both domestic and foreign markets following internationalization suggests that

future research needs to account for these corporate financing patterns.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section

3 documents the extent of internationalization of securities markets and analyzes the

characteristics of those firms that raise capital abroad. Section 4 analyzes the evolution of firm

characteristics and performance following capital raisings in international markets and compares

these patterns to firms that only raise capital in domestic securities markets. Section 5 examines




                                                 6
the international and domestic capital raising activity of firms that have accessed international

markets. We conclude in Section 6.



2. Data

     To document patterns of international capital raisings and analyze the characteristics and

performance of firms that raise capital through security issues in international capital markets,

we assemble a comprehensive dataset on firms’ security issuances in capital markets around the

world and match this information with balance sheet and income statement data.

       We focus our analysis of international capital raisings on security issuances in public

capital markets. Firms may also access foreign financing by, among other things, borrowing

directly from foreign banks and issuing syndicated loans abroad. These financing alternatives

constitute a significant source of cross-border capital for firms and have been the focus of

substantial previous research (see Carey and Nini, 2007 for a general overview of international

syndicated loan markets; Claessens, 2006 reviews the literature on cross-border banking). In this

paper, we analyze security issuances in public capital markets, rather than relationship lending

associated with syndicated bank loans, because basic questions and theories of the causes and

consequences of these capital raisings remain incompletely addressed.

       Our data on firms’ capital raising activity come from Security Data Corporation’s (SDC)

New Issues Database, which provides transaction-level information on new issues of common

and preferred equity and bonds with an original maturity of more than one year, starting in the

1970s. Given that SDC does not collect data on debt issues with a maturity of less than one year,

our dataset does not include commercial paper issues with such short-term maturities.




                                               7
       The SDC database is divided into twelve regional sub-databases covering different

markets: Asian Pacific Domestic (Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore,

Taiwan, and Thailand,); Australian/New Zealand Domestic (Australia, New Zealand, and Papua

New Guinea); Canadian Domestic (Canada); Continental European Domestic (Austria, Belgium,

Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy,

Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, and

Switzerland); Indian and Subcontinent (Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka);

International (Eurobonds and other cross-border issues); Japanese Domestic (Japan); Korean

Domestic (South Korea); Latin American Domestic (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa

Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Panama, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela); United States

(United States); United Kingdom Domestic (United Kingdom); and Rest of the World (countries

not included in other SDC regional sub-databases, such as China). The academic version of SDC

to which we have access does not include the Canadian and Korean Domestic sub-databases.

Therefore, we exclude all Canadian and South Korean firms from our analysis. While data for

public issues in the U.S. start in the 1970s, coverage of other markets starts later, with most

regional databases starting in 1991. Therefore, we restrict our sample to the period 1991-2005.

      SDC collects data on security issuances mostly from filings with local regulatory agencies

and stock exchanges. These data are augmented with data from other sources such as offering

circulars, prospectus, surveys of investment banks, brokers, and other financial advisors, news

sources, trade publications, and wires. Although SDC constitutes the most comprehensive

databases on security issuances around the world, SDC’s coverage may be less comprehensive

for those regions for which it relies mostly on informal sources, instead of collecting data from

filings with regulatory agencies and stock exchanges.




                                                8
        Since our analysis focuses on corporate capital raising activity, we exclude all public

sector bond issuances, comprising debt issued by national, local, and regional governments,

government agencies, regional agencies, and multilateral organizations. We also exclude security

issuances by investment funds, investment companies, and real estate investment trusts (REITs),

as well as mortgage-backed securities and other asset-backed securities. Moreover, since we

focus on capital raising activity in public markets we exclude all private placements.3 After these

exclusions, we are left with a database covering 168,513 security issuances by 45,969 firms from

116 economies over the period 1991-2005. Appendix Table 1 lists the economies included in our

dataset and their regional and income level classification. Appendix Table 2 presents data on the

number of observations by region and income level.

       To classify security issuances as domestic or international, we consider the main exchange

where the issues are listed and compare it to the issuing firm’s nationality.4 For offerings that

take place in more than one market, we consider issues in each market as separate issues. In the

case of subsidiaries, one could consider the nationality of the firm’s parent company instead of

its own nationality for classifying issues as foreign or domestic. For instance, an equity issue by

a British subsidiary of a U.S. firm in the London Stock Exchange would be classified as

international, instead of domestic as in our classification. Which approach provides a better

criterion for classifying security issues depends on the degree of integration of financing

decisions between firms and their subsidiaries, among other factors. If financial decisions are

highly integrated, considering firms’ parent nationality may provide a more accurate

3
  Excluding private placements may affect the observed regional patterns of capital raising activity, as some regions
may have more active private markets than others. This may be particularly relevant for debt markets, as private
bond markets in some regions are as active, or even more active, than public bond markets.
4
  SDC classifies Eurobonds as being listed on the Luxembourg exchange, although these securities are issued all
over Europe and trade mostly over the counter. This implies that Eurobond issues by firms from Luxembourg are
classified as domestic issues, even though they may trade in other European countries. However, the number of
firms from Luxembourg carrying out bond issuances at home according to SDC is relatively low. We re-did all our
analyses excluding these firms and obtained results similar to those reported below.


                                                         9
classification of security issuances. But if financing decisions are relatively decentralized,

considering subsidiaries’ own nationality may be a better criterion. Actual decision-making

policies may lie somewhere in-between these two extremes, with multinational firms possibly

coordinating financing decisions with their subsidiaries across several markets. All the results

reported in the paper are obtained classifying issues as foreign or domestic based on subsidiaries’

nationality. In unreported robustness tests, we classified issues by subsidiaries based on their

parents’ nationality and obtained results similar to those reported throughout the paper.

       To analyze the characteristics and performance of firms that raise capital through security

issues in international capital markets, and compare them to firms that raise capital in domestic

markets and to firms that do not raise capital during our sample period, we match the data on

security issuances from SDC with firm-level accounting and income statement data. These data

come from Compustat North America for U.S. firms and Worldscope for firms from the rest of

the world. We combine both datasets because Worldscope’s coverage of U.S. firms is very

limited. To ameliorate possible concerns about data comparability and to control for any

differences across datasets, we include country- or firm-level fixed effects in our analyses. We

also conducted all our analyses using only data from Worldscope and excluding U.S. firms,

obtaining results similar to those reported throughout the paper. In addition, we conducted these

analyses including the small sample of U.S. firms with firm-level data available from

Worldscope and also obtained similar results.

       After eliminating firms with missing data, outliers, and firms with less than three annual

observations for our variables of interest, we are left with a sample of 38,801 firms from 60

economies covering the period 1991-2005, totaling 335,539 firm-year observations.5, 6 Of these

 Appendix Table 3 shows the number of observations and firms classified by their capital raising activity by region
and income level.


                                                        10
firms, 21,634 issued securities in public markets over the sample period according to SDC, while

the remaining 17,167 did not raise capital in public capital markets over this period.7

        Throughout the paper we group issues into equity and debt. Equity issues include initial

public offerings (IPOs) and seasoned equity offerings (SEOs). Debt issues include convertible

and non-convertible debt issues and preferred shares issues. Preferred shares have features of

both equity and debt securities and therefore could be classified in either of the two categories.

Given that these issues represent a relatively low percentage of capital raisings, the criterion used

to classify them does not affect the observed patterns of capital raising activity. All the results

reported in the paper classify preferred shares issues as debt issues. As a robustness test, we

classified preferred shares issues as equity issues and obtained results similar to those reported

throughout the paper.



3. Which Firms Raise Capital Abroad?

       This section analyzes the extent of internationalization of capital raising activity around the

world and the characteristics of those firms that issue securities in international capital markets.

In particular, we address three questions. First, what is the role of international capital markets

relative to domestic markets in providing firm financing and has this changed over time? Second,

what fraction of firms raises capital in international markets? Third, what are the characteristics

of firms that raise capital abroad, compared to firms that only raise capital domestically and to

firms that are listed in their domestic stock markets but do not raise capital by issuing securities

over our sample period?

6
  Firms from the U.S. and Japan represent about 39 and 13 percent of the observations in our dataset of firm-level
characteristics, respectively. Excluding firms from both countries does not affect our conclusions.
7
  The number of firms with capital raising activity in our merged dataset is lower than the number of firms included
in the SDC dataset because many firms that raise capital through security issuances according to SDC do not have
accounting data available from Worldscope or Compustat North America.


                                                        11
3.1 Patterns of Global Capital Raising Activity

      As a first step towards analyzing the extent of internationalization of capital markets,

Figure 1 shows the evolution of the aggregate amount of capital raised by firms from developed

and developing economies through security issues in public markets over the period 1991-2005,

differentiating between issues at home and abroad.

      Figure 1 shows that the aggregate amount of capital raised in public markets by firms from

developed and developing economies increased significantly over our sample period. The total

amount raised by firms from developed economies increased from 826 billion U.S. dollars at

2005 prices in 1991 to more than two trillion U.S. dollars in 2005. The amount of capital raised

in public capital markets by firms from developing economies over this period showed

significant volatility, with large decreases associated with the 1994-1995 Mexican crisis, the

1997-1998 East Asian and Russian crises, and the 2001 Argentine crisis. Despite these setbacks,

the total amount raised in capital markets by firms from developing economies increased more

than three-fold over the sample period, from 42 billion U.S. dollars at 2005 prices in 1991 to 138

billion U.S. dollars in 2005.

      Figure 1 also shows that security issuances abroad grew faster than issuances in domestic

markets over the period 1991-2005. This pattern was particularly marked in the case of

developing economies, where the aggregate ratio of the amount of capital raised abroad to total

capital raised increased from 25.3 percent in 1991 to 50.8 percent in 2005. In the case of

developed economies, the aggregate share of capital raised abroad increased from 25.3 in 1991 to

39.4 percent in 2005. For both groups of countries, issuances in international capital markets

represent a significant share of the total amount raised by firms in public markets.

       Figure 2 indicates that debt markets are more internationalized than equity markets, and

that developing country firms are more intensive users of international markets than firms from


                                                12
developed economies. Figure 2 presents data on the aggregate share of capital raised abroad for

developing and developed economies for selected years, differentiating between equity and debt

issues. The top panel of Figure 2 shows that equity issues by developing country firms are far

more internationalized than those of firms from developed economies. Also, the degree of

internationalization of equity issues for developing economies has increased over our sample

period. The amount raised through equity issues outside firms’ home country represented 15

percent of the total amount raised through equity issues by developing country firms in 1995, and

this ratio increased to 59.4 percent in 2005. In the case of developed economies, the share of

equity issues abroad has remained relatively stable over this period, standing at nine percent in

1995 and 8.6 percent in 2005.

      The bottom panel of Figure 2 shows that debt issues are highly internationalized in both

developed and developing economies. For both groups of countries the amount raised through

corporate debt offerings abroad represented almost half of the total amount raised through

corporate debt issues in 2005, reaching 46.1 percent in the case of developed economies and 43.5

percent for developing economies.

      Table 1 further stresses the importance of international securities markets for capital

raisings and the comparatively high degree of internationalization of debt markets relative to

equity markets, while also showing that debt markets are a much larger source of corporate

finance than equity markets around the world. Table 1 provides information on the aggregate

amounts raised through security issuances in domestic and international markets over the period

1991-2005 for different regions, differentiating between equity and debt issues. Three main

features of the aggregate patterns of capital raisings are visible from the data.




                                                 13
       First, debt issues in public markets are a more important source of capital for firms than

equity issues at the aggregate level during our sample period. Firms raised 19.8 trillion U.S.

dollars at 2005 prices between 1991 and 2005 through debt issues in public markets, which

represents 80 percent of the total amount raised through security issues over this period.8

       Second, consistent with the patterns shown in Figure 1, international markets account for a

large share of capital raising activity, both for developing and developed economies. Firms from

developed economies raised about 7 trillion U.S. dollars at 2005 prices in international capital

markets over our sample period, which represents 29.7 percent of the total amount they raised in

public markets. In the case of developing country firms, capital raised outside their home

countries between 1991 and 2005 totaled 459.5 billion U.S. dollars at 2005 prices, representing

37.9 percent of the total amount raised through security issuances during this period.

         Finally, as highlighted by Figure 2, debt markets are more internationalized than equity

markets. In the case of developed countries, the total amount raised through equity issues abroad

represents 7.8 percent of the total amount raised through equity issues over our sample period.

This statistic is over four times higher in the case of debt offerings, reaching 34.7 percent. For

developing country firms, the share of equity issues abroad over the 1991-2005 period reached

27.8 percent, compared to 47.3 percent in the case of debt issuances. Moreover, the higher

degree of debt market internationalization, compared to equity markets, is a consistent pattern

across all regions shown in Table 1.9,10


8
   The value of debt issues is not directly comparable to that of equity issues, since equity issues have no maturity,
while debt issues must be repaid. Part of the proceeds from debt issues are typically used to repay maturing debt and
therefore only a fraction of debt issues can be considered new capital. Henderson, Jegadeesh, and Weisbach (2006)
try to adjust the data on debt issues to take this fact into account and conclude that even with these adjustments debt
issues constitute a larger source of new capital than equity issues at the aggregate level.
9
   Out of 99 economies for which we have data on bond issuances, the internationalization of equity markets is
higher than the internationalization of debt markets in only nine countries.
10
   One could argue that we may observe a higher share of international debt issues in the aggregate data not due to
underlying differences between equity and debt issuances, but rather because those firms that tend to access


                                                         14
3.2 Firms’ Access to International Markets

       Although the aggregate patterns documented in Section 3.1 show that equity and debt

markets are highly internationalized and that the amount of capital raised in international markets

has grown significantly over the last 15 years, these observations do not provide information on

developments at the firm level. To address this issue, this section describes firms’ access to

international capital markets.

       The results presented in Table 2 show that, among those firms that issue securities in

capital markets, the proportion that do so outside their home countries is relatively low,

suggesting that internationalization is restricted to a small set of firms. Table 2 provides

information on the total number of firms that issued securities in domestic and international

markets over the period 1991-2005 for different regions, differentiating between equity and debt

issues. Out of a total of 45,969 firms raising capital in public markets between 1991 and 2005,

only 6,661 (14.5 percent) issued securities outside their home market.

       Differentiating by type of security issuance, Table 2 shows that a very small percentage of

those firms that issue equity tend to do so in international markets, while a larger proportion of

firms that issue debt conduct these operations in international markets. Only 5.2 percent of the

firms from developed economies that raised capital through equity issues did so through

offerings outside their home markets. In the case of developing countries, this statistic reaches

6.3 percent. This suggests that only a relatively small set of firms may be able to meet the

requirements to access equity markets outside their home country. The percentage of firms

raising capital abroad through debt issues is much higher. For developed countries, 36.3 percent



international markets are also more likely to issue debt securities, both at home and abroad. However, when
analyzing only those firms that raise capital outside their home countries we find that the share of capital raised
abroad is on average higher for debt than for equity issues. This suggests that debt issuances abroad may be less
costly and/or more beneficial for firms than equity issues in international markets.


                                                        15
of the firms that issued debt securities during our sample period conducted these operations

abroad. In the case of developing countries, the share of firms issuing debt abroad during our

sample period stands at 26.6 percent.

      Figure 3 shows that capital raising activity in international markets is highly concentrated

among the small proportion of firms that access international markets. Figure 3 shows the

distribution of the total amount raised abroad between 1991 and 2005 among those firms that

access international capital markets at some point during this period for developed and

developing economies. For developed economies, the top ten (20) percent of firms accounted for

69.4 (82.7) percent of the total capital raised abroad by developed country firms over our sample

period. A similar pattern is visible in the case of developing economies, with the top ten (20)

percent of firms accounting for 53.9 (69.5) of the total amount raised abroad by developing

country firms over the 1991-2005 period.

      In sum, the data presented in Table 2 and Figure 3 indicate that (1) few firms access

international markets, and (2) of those few firms that raise capital abroad, a very small fraction

accounts for most of the cross-border capital raising activity. These results suggest that a better

understanding of the characteristics of those firms that issue securities in international capital

markets and how they may differ from firms that only raise capital at home may provide useful

insights regarding the internationalization process. We now turn to this issue.


3.3 Characteristics of Firms that Raise Capital Abroad vs. Those that Do Not

       This section analyzes the characteristics of firms that raise capital through security issues

in international capital markets, comparing them to firms that only raise capital in domestic

markets and to firms that are listed in their domestic stock markets but do not raise capital over




                                                16
our sample period. We analyze a broad set of firm-level characteristics, including measures of

size, growth, investment, profitability, capital structure, and valuation.

         Table 3 presents the medians of several firm-level variables for different groups of firms

classified according to their capital raising activity. Similar patterns are visible for most firm

characteristics if we compare means across the different groups of firms instead of medians. A

possible concern when comparing different groups of firms is that differences in firm-level

characteristics may reflect differences in the nationality and industry of firms. To account for

this, Table 3 reports median regressions of the different firm characteristics on country and

industry dummies and a dummy variable that equals one for those firms that raise capital abroad

and zero otherwise.11 This variable captures differences between firms that raise capital abroad

and other groups of firms classified according to their capital raising activity (firms that are listed

in their domestic stock markets but do not raise capital over our sample period in column (a) and

firms that only raise capital in domestic markets during our sample period in column (b)).

Appendix Table 4 presents the definition of the different variables used in the analysis.

         Two patterns emerge. First, firms that raise capital abroad are very different from those

that are listed in local stock markets but do not issue securities in either domestic or foreign

markets over the 1991-2005 period.12 In particular, firms that raise capital abroad tend to be

larger, grow at a faster pace, have higher capital expenditures and R&D investments, and are

more profitable. Firms that raise capital abroad also differ from non-capital raising firms in

terms of their capital structure. They have higher levels of indebtedness and their debt tends to

11
   These regressions are estimated adjusting the standard errors for clustering at the firm level. Since there is no
analytical solution for estimating clustered standard errors in quantile regressions, we estimate the standard errors
through bootstrapping with clustering at the firm level. Similar results are obtained if we use standard errors that are
robust to heteroskedasticity of unknown form.
12
   Similar differences are visible between firms that only raise capital at home and firms that do not raise capital
during our sample period. In unreported robustness tests, we found that most of the differences between these two
groups of firms observable in Table 3 are statistically significant, after controlling for country and industry
dummies.


                                                          17
have a longer maturity (a lower ratio of short-term debt to total debt). Also, firms that raise

capital abroad tend to have higher valuations, as measured by Tobin’s q.

       Second, Table 3 indicates that there are significant differences between firms that raise

capital at home and abroad. Firms that raise capital abroad are significantly larger than firms that

only raise capital at home, with the difference in median assets between both sets of firms

reaching 1.6 billion U.S. dollars. Firms that raise capital abroad also tend to grow slower than

firms that only raise capital in domestic markets. In terms of their investment, firms that raise

capital in international markets show higher capital expenditures and R&D investments. Firms

that raise capital abroad also show higher levels of indebtedness and exhibit longer debt

maturities. Finally, as shown in the last column of Table 3, when we condition on industry and

country fixed effects, firms that raise capital outside their home countries have significantly

higher median Tobin's q than firms that only raise capital at home.

       The differences between firms that raise capital abroad and the other groups of firms

reported in Table 3 do not simply reflect differences between larger and smaller firms. In

unreported robustness tests, we found that our conclusions hold when we analyze only those

firms in the top quartile according to firm size (as measured by total assets in U.S. dollars).



4. What Happens to Firms after Raising Capital Abroad?

       This section analyzes the evolution of the characteristics and performance of firms that

raise capital through debt and equity issuances. First, we compare the characteristics of firms that

raise capital abroad relative to firms that only raise capital in domestic markets, making these

comparisons before and after firms first access international markets. By tracing firms through

time, we are able to test whether firms that raise capital abroad differ from firms that only raise




                                                 18
capital at home before they actually access international capital markets or whether the cross-

firm differences we observe in Table 3 materialize after internationalization. Second, we provide

a detailed dynamic analysis by tracing the performance of firms over time after capital raisings,

differentiating between equity and debt issues and capital raisings at home and abroad. This

analysis allows us to better understand how raising capital abroad affects firms and whether these

effects differ from those of domestic capital raisings.


4.1 Changes in Firm-Level Variables after Raising Capital Abroad

         Tables 4 and 5 present regressions of the firm-level characteristics analyzed in Table 3 on

dummies that identify firms’ activity in international capital markets for SEOs and debt issues,

respectively. These regressions include both those firms that conduct the specific type of capital

raising under analysis in each case and a control group. In the case of SEOs abroad, the control

group includes those firms that conduct SEOs in their home markets. Similarly, in the case of

debt issues abroad, the control group includes those firms that issue debt securities at home.13

These regressions include country-year dummies to control for cross-country differences,

industry dummies to account for cross-industry differences, and two dummy variables that

identify firm’s capital raising activity in international markets.14 The first one is a dummy

variable that captures the period after capital raisings abroad, which equals one on the year of the

first capital raising abroad of each type and in all subsequent years. This dummy variable equals

zero before firms raise capital in international markets and for firms that do not raise capital

abroad. This variable captures differences between firms that raise capital abroad and the control

group after capital raisings outside firms’ home country. The second dummy variable equals one
13
   Similar results are obtained if we use as a control group firms that conduct any type of capital raising at home or if
we use as control group both firms that raise capital at home and firms that are listed in their domestic stock markets
but do not raise capital over our sample period.
14
   These regressions are estimated with standard errors adjusted for clustering at the firm level. Similar results are
obtained if we adjust the standard errors for clustering at the country level.


                                                          19
before firms raise capital in international markets and zero afterwards. It is zero for those firms

in the control group. This dummy captures differences between firms that raise capital abroad

and firms in the control group that existed before accessing international markets.

       The results in Tables 4 and 5 indicate that most of the differences between firms that raise

capital abroad and those that issue securities domestically exist before these firms access

international securities markets. In particular, both firms that conduct SEOs and debt issuances

abroad are larger and have higher capital expenditures and R&D investments than firms that only

raise capital at home before actually going abroad. Also, firms that raise capital abroad have

higher valuations than firms that only raise capital in local markets before accessing international

markets.

       The results in Tables 4 and 5 also show that capital raisings in international markets are

related to significant changes in firm-level characteristics. For example, firms that conduct SEOs

abroad tend to have higher growth and higher Tobin’s q before going abroad than firms that only

conduct SEOs at home, but not afterwards. Firms that issue debt in international markets tend to

have faster growth rates, greater profits, and larger Tobin’s q ratios before going abroad than

firms that issue debt in local market. But these differences become smaller (or even disappear)

following debt issuances in international markets.

       Moreover, we find no support for the view that the decision to raise capital abroad in the

future induces a firm to change before it actually internationalizes and that this behavior drives

the patterns we observe. For instance, the prospect of issuing securities abroad may allow firms

to raise more capital domestically and expand. Therefore, the finding that firms that raise capital

abroad are larger than domestic firms before actually going abroad could be explained by the

decision to internationalize, and not be a pre-existing difference across firms. To address this




                                                20
concern, in unreported robustness tests we estimated the regressions in Tables 4 and 5 using

different dummies for each year before and after capital raisings in international markets. These

robustness tests indicate that the observed differences between firms that raise capital abroad and

at home generally existed three or more years before these firms actually issued securities in

international markets, suggesting that the results in Tables 4 and 5 are largely capturing pre-

existing differences across firms.


4.2 Time Patterns of Firm-Level Variables Following Capital Raising Activity

       An important and yet incompletely answered question regarding the process of

internationalization is whether capital raisings abroad have different effects than domestic capital

raisings. In this section, we compare the evolution of firm characteristics following capital

raisings at home and abroad. Note, however, that we do not attempt to deal formally with

identifying the exogenous effects of international capital raisings on firm performance.

Therefore, the patterns presented in this section are only a first step towards addressing this

question.

       Tables 6 and 7 analyze the time-series patterns of firm-level variables following SEOs at

home and abroad, respectively. Tables 8 and 9 show similar data for debt issuances in domestic

and international markets. Specifically, these tables present regressions of firm characteristics on

a series of dummy variables that trace out annual patterns after capital raisings. The variable

“Year of SEO at home dummy,” for instance, equals one on the year that a firm conducts a SEO

in its domestic market, and zero otherwise. Similarly the “More than three years after SEO at

home dummy” equals one more than three years after a firm conducts a SEO at home and zero

afterwards. We construct corresponding dummy variables for the years following each type of

capital raising. The sample in these regressions includes only the firms that conduct the specific



                                                21
type of capital raising under analysis in each case. Since we want to focus on the within-firm

changes that follow the different types of capital raisings, these regressions include firm-level

fixed effects. Therefore, we are comparing each firm to itself before raising capital. The

regressions also include year dummies to control for global time effects.

        The regression results in Tables 6 to 9 indicate that the time-series patterns of firm-level

variables are broadly similar for issues at home and abroad. In the case of SEOs, Tables 6 and 7

show that firms expand following both SEOs at home and abroad. Also, firms tend to experience

a long-term decrease in growth and profitability (measured by return on equity) following SEOs.

Loughran and Ritter (1997) also find evidence of a decrease in profitability following domestic

SEOs by U.S. firms. They interpret this evidence as consistent with market timing arguments

that emphasize that firms raise capital after periods of high performance, which may make their

securities more attractive to investors. The observed worsening of firm performance could also

be the result of earnings management, as insiders may have incentives to window-dress company

accounts before raising capital (Rangan, 1998 and Teoh, Welch, and Wong, 1998).15 In terms of

investment, although the absolute size of capital expenditures and R&D investments increases,

when scaling expenditures by sales the results show that investment does not increase

permanently (and even tends to decrease) following SEOs both at home and abroad. The results

also indicate that firm valuation, as measured by Tobin’s q, decreases in the long run following

SEOs.

        In the case of debt issuances, Tables 8 and 9 show that the time patterns of firm-level

variables are broadly similar for issues at home and abroad. Firms tend to expand following debt

15
  Inflated expectations by investors and earnings management that leads investors to overestimate the earnings
potential of issuing firms are not the only possible reason for poor post-issue operating performance. Jensen and
Meckling (1976) argue that the interests of managers and other stockholders become less closely aligned as
managers’ stakes decline and ownership becomes more disperse. These increased agency problems may result in
worse post-issue performance.


                                                       22
issues and experience a long-term decrease in profitability and growth. Debt issues, both at home

and abroad, are associated with increases in indebtedness levels, improvements in debt maturity

profiles, and decreases in Tobin’s q. As mentioned above, the finding that the changes in firm

performance that follow equity and debt issuances in international markets are broadly similar to

those that follow equity and debt issuances at home suggests that issues in international markets

are not intrinsically different from issues in the domestic market.16

         A possible concern regarding the patterns presented in Tables 6 to 9 is whether they are

affected by other capital raisings coinciding with the timing of the specific issuances analyzed in

these tables. For instance, if following capital raisings abroad firms also issue securities at home,

then the observed patterns of firm performance may be partially reflecting the effects of these

subsequent domestic capital raisings. To address this concern, we re-estimated all the regressions

from Tables 6 to 9 including only capital raisings that took place without other concurrent

security issuances. Specifically, we considered only those capital raisings in which firms did not

carry out other security issuances in a five-year window around the capital raising under

analysis. The results obtained using this reduced sample of capital raisings are qualitatively

similar to those reported in Tables 6 to 9. Firms tend to expand and experience a decrease in their

growth rate and profitability following capital raisings. Moreover, the time-series patterns of

firm-level variables are broadly similar for issues at home and abroad.




16
   As a robustness test, we estimated the regressions of the evolution of firm performance following SEOs and debt
issues abroad reported in Tables 7 and 9 restricting the sample to issuances by foreign firms in U.S. capital markets.
If U.S. markets have a particularly effective investor protection environment, then focusing on the U.S. would
provide a more powerful test of whether firms that internationalize into stronger investor protection regimes
experience an enduring improvement in firm performance, as bonding arguments predict. When restricting the
sample to foreign issues in U.S. markets, we find results similar to those reported in Tables 7 and 9, that is, firms
tend to expand following capital raisings and experience a long-term decrease in profitability and growth.


                                                         23
5. The Capital Raising Activity of Firms that Raise Capital Abroad

       This section addresses three broad questions about internationalization: Are issues in

international markets different from domestic issues in terms of their size? How do firms that

raise capital abroad distribute their capital raising activity between domestic and international

markets? After firms raise capital abroad, does their use of domestic capital markets change? If

so, how?


5.1 Size Differences between Issues at Home and Abroad

      Although the aggregate evidence presented in Tables 1 and 2 suggests that issues in

international markets are larger than domestic issues, we now provide more direct evidence in

this regard by analyzing the distribution of the amount raised per issue for issues at home and

abroad and comparing median issue sizes across markets. Figure 4 shows the cumulative

distribution of the amount raised per issue by firms from developed and developing economies,

differentiating between issues at home and abroad.

      Figure 4 shows that issues at home tend to be smaller than issues abroad. In the case of

developed country firms, for instance, while 63 percent of issues at home during our sample

period raised 100 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices or less, only 39.6 percent of issues abroad

were below this size threshold. In the case of firms from developing economies, more than 91

percent of issues at home during our sample period raised 100 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices

or less. In the case of issues abroad, only 49.5 percent of issues by developing country firms

were below this size threshold.

      To analyze the size differences between issues abroad and at home in more detail, Table 10

compares the median proceeds of issues in domestic and international markets for firms from



                                               24
developed and developing economies, differentiating between equity and debt issues. Similar

results are obtained when using means instead of medians. A possible concern regarding these

comparisons is that they may reflect differences in the nationality and industry of those firms that

raise capital in the different markets and not actual differences between cross-border and

domestic issues. For instance, firms that raise capital abroad may come mostly from industries

that tend to make larger issuances. To address this concern, Table 10 reports median regressions

of the amount raised per issue on country and industry dummies and a dummy variable that

equals one if the issue was conducted abroad and zero otherwise.17 This variable captures

differences between issues abroad and at home.

       Table 10 shows that when analyzing all issues, those conducted abroad tend to be

significantly larger than those conducted at home, consistent with the results displayed in Figure

4. In the case of developed economies, the median proceeds from equity issues at home over the

1991-2005 period were 26.9 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices, compared to 54.3 million for

equity issues abroad. In the case of debt, the median amount raised per debt issue at home was

85.1 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices, while the same statistic reached 138 million in the case

of debt issues abroad. In both cases, the differences between issues at home and abroad are

statistically significant at the one percent level, after controlling for country and industry

dummies. Even larger differences between issues at home and abroad are visible in the case of

developing economies. The median amount raised per equity issue abroad by developing country

firms over our sample period was more than 16 times higher than the median amount raised per




17
   These regressions are estimated adjusting the standard errors for clustering at the firm level. Since there is no
analytical solution for estimating clustered standard errors in quantile regressions, we estimate the standard errors
through bootstrapping with clustering at the firm level. Similar results are obtained if we use standard errors that are
robust to heteroskedasticity of unknown form.


                                                          25
equity issue at home (62 and 3.8 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices, respectively).18 Similar

differences across markets are visible in the case of debt issues by developing country firms. All

these differences are robust to controlling for country and industry dummies and are statistically

significant at the one percent level.

       The larger size of issues abroad does not simply reflect the fact that firms that raise capital

abroad are different, and in particular larger, than firms that raise capital at home. In particular,

Table 10 shows the median amount raised per issue in domestic and international markets,

restricting the sample to issues by firms that raise capital both at home and abroad at some point

during our sample period.19 The results show that in the case of developed economies, the

median amount raised per equity issue at home over the 1991-2005 period by these firms was

126.5 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices, compared to 116.2 million for equity issues abroad.

However, once we control for country and industry dummies we find that equity issues abroad

tend to be larger than issues at home and this difference is statically significant at the one percent

level. In the case of debt issues, the median amount raised per issue at home by these firms was

105.9 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices, while the same statistic reached 155.8 million in the

case of debt issues abroad, with the difference being statistically significant at the one percent

level. In the case of developing economies, Table 10 shows that both equity and debt issues

abroad are larger than issues at home when analyzing only issues by firms that raise capital both
18
   Although part of the size difference between equity issues abroad and at home can be explained by the fact that
the latter include a larger share of IPOs (which tend to be smaller than SEOs), there are large differences in issue
sizes across markets even if we compare SEOs and IPOs separately. For developing country firms, IPOs at home
over our sample period have a median size of 1.8 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices, compared to 61.5 million for
IPOs abroad. In the case of SEOs, the differences are smaller but still quite large and statistically significant at the
one percent level, with the median size of SEOs in domestic securities markets by developing country firms
reaching 16.3 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices, compared to 62.6 million for SEOs in international markets.
19
   In the results reported in Table 10, issues at home by firms that raise capital both at home and abroad include
issues carried out by these firms before their first capital raising abroad. These issues may not be directly
comparable to issues abroad by these firms, as firms may change after accessing international markets, which might
affect the size of their domestic and international security issues. As a robustness test, we restricted the sample of
domestic issues by these firms only to issues carried out after their first capital raising in international markets and
obtained results similar to those reported in Table 10.


                                                          26
at home and abroad. In sum, the results indicate that even if we restrict the sample to issues by

firms that raise capital both at home and abroad, issues abroad tend to be larger than domestic

ones.20


5.2 Where Do Firms Raise Capital After Internationalizing?

       This section analyzes how firms divide their capital raisings between domestic and

international markets after their first capital raising abroad. Table 11 shows the average across

firms of the ratio of capital raised at home to total capital raised in public markets for each year

following firms’ first capital raising abroad, differentiating between equity and debt issues.

       The Table 11 results indicate that while firms raise most of their capital abroad in the year

when they first access international markets, the share of capital raised at home subsequently

increases, remaining quite high in the long run. In the case of firms from developed economies,

the results show that in the year when they first raise capital abroad, firms raise on average only

18 and eight percent of their equity and debt capital in domestic markets, respectively. However,

the share of capital raised at home increases significantly in subsequent years. In the case of

equity issues, firms conduct most of their subsequent capital raisings at home, with domestic

issues accounting on average for 87 percent of the total amount raised through equity issuances

more than three years after firms first access international markets. In the case of debt issues,

firms that internationalize tend to conduct most of their issuances in international markets, but


20
   We also conducted other robustness tests to analyze whether issues abroad are larger than issues at home when
comparing issues by the same firm. First, we estimated ordinary least squares regressions of the amount raised per
issue on firm-level dummies, year dummies, and a dummy identifying whether issues were conducted at home or
abroad, including only firms that raise capital both at home and abroad at some point during our sample period.
Second, for each firm that raised capital both at home and abroad at some point during our sample period we
calculated the difference in proceeds between issues in domestic and international markets conducted in the same
year and averaged these differences at the firm level. We then tested whether the median and mean across firms of
this variable are different from zero. Both types of analysis indicate that, in most cases, issues abroad tend to be
larger than domestic issues, consistent with the idea that firms raise larger amounts when issuing securities in
international markets.


                                                        27
domestic markets remain significant, accounting on average for 40 percent of the total amount

raised by these firms through debt issues more than three years after internationalizing. Similar

patterns are visible in the case of developing economies. Firms from developing economies that

access international markets tend to raise most of their capital at home in the long run, with the

average ratio of capital raised at home to total capital raised in public markets reaching 60 (63)

percent for equity (debt) issues more than three years after firms first raise capital abroad.

      The results from Table 11 indicate that firms that access international capital markets

remain active in domestic markets, conducting a significant share of their capital raisings in these

markets. This suggests that these firms are not just opting out of domestic markets, but rather that

they are choosing to use both domestic and international markets. This is consistent with the idea

that these markets may provide different services and firms will access one or the other

depending on their particular financing needs and market conditions.


5.3 Changes in Capital Raising Activity in Domestic Markets after Raising Capital Abroad

      Having shown that firms continue using domestic capital markets quite actively after they

access international markets, we now test whether firms change their use of domestic markets

after raising capital abroad. Table 12 compares the amount raised domestically per year by firms

that raise capital abroad before and after they first access international markets, differentiating

between equity and debt issues. Since the amount raised per year is censored at zero, Table 3

displays Tobit regressions of this variable on a dummy variable that equals one on the year of the




                                                 28
first capital raising abroad and in all subsequent years, and zero before.21 This variable captures

changes in capital raising activity in domestic markets following internationalization.22

       Table 12 shows that there is an increase in the amount of capital raised in domestic markets

per year after a firm first raises capital abroad. In the case of developed economies, the amount

raised at home per year through equity issues by these firms averages 7.7 million U.S. dollars at

2005 prices before raising capital abroad and jumps to 20.5 million afterwards. A similar pattern

is visible for debt issues, with the average amount raised per year by firms that issue securities

abroad increasing from 36.8 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices to 129.8 million following

internationalization. In both cases, the Tobit regressions show that these differences are positive

and significant at the one percent level. Similar results are obtained in the case of firms from

developing economies. For equity issues, the average amount raised per year by firms that raise

capital abroad increases from 3.2 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices to 5.6 million following

internationalization. Similarly, the average amount raised at home per year through debt

issuances by these firms increases more than four-fold after firms’ first capital raising abroad,

from 1.6 million U.S. dollars at 2005 prices to 6.9 million.

       The increase in the domestic capital raisings of firms that access international markets does

not simply reflect the fact that firms grow after raising capital abroad. In particular, Table 12

reports data on the amount raised per year in domestic markets divided by the firms’ assets at the

moment of the capital raising. The Tobit regressions show that, even when scaling the amount




21
  These regressions are estimated with standard errors adjusted for clustering at the firm level.
22
  The displayed coefficients in Table 12 are the effects of discrete changes in the dummy variable on the expected
value of the observed dependent variable. Similar conclusions are obtained if we analyze the effects of these
changes on the expected value of the observed dependent variable conditional on being uncensored.


                                                       29
raised at home by the firms’ assets, we still find evidence of a significant increase in firms’

capital raisings at home.23

       While these results indicate that firms tend to raise more capital in their domestic markets

after accessing international markets, both in absolute terms and relative to firm size, this does

not necessarily imply that firms increase their participation in domestic capital raising activity

after they internationalize, relative to other firms. In other words, do firms capture a larger share

of total domestic market capital raising activity following security issuances in international

markets?

       The results from Table 12 show that firms are indeed capturing a larger percentage of total

domestic market capital raising activity following their first capital raising abroad. In the case of

developed economies, each firm that raises capital abroad accounts on average for 0.1 percent of

the total capital raised in their domestic markets per year before internationalization and this

share increases to 0.3 percent afterwards. A similar pattern is visible in the case of developing

economies, with the average share of domestic market activity accounted by each firm that raises

capital in international markets increasing from 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent following the first

capital raising abroad. In all cases, the Tobit regressions show that there is a statistically

significant increase in the relative participation of firms in domestic capital markets following

internationalization.24



23
   The results reported in Table 12 show that for the amount raised at home through equity issues scaled by assets for
developing country firms and the amount raised at home through debt issues over asset for firms from developing
economies the mean for the period before the first capital raising abroad is larger than the mean for the period
following internationalization. However, the tobit regression results, which account for the censored nature of the
data, show a significant increase in both of these variables following internationalization.
24
   A possible concern regarding the results reported in Table 12 is that we are pooling all the firms that raise capital
abroad at some point during our sample period. As a robustness check, we analyzed the within-firm change in
capital raising activity in domestic markets following internationalization. To do this, we estimated for each firm
that raises capital abroad the difference between the average amount raised at home before and after going abroad
and then tested whether the mean across firms of this variable is different from zero. The results are broadly similar


                                                          30
6. Conclusions

        In this paper, we characterize patterns of equity and debt issuance activities in domestic

and international capital markets, and also document the dynamics of firm performance

following these distinct corporate financing activities. To do so, we compile a new database on

worldwide capital raisings that allows us to compare firms that issue securities abroad with firms

that issue securities domestically. We also compare these capital raising firms with corporations

that are listed in the local stock markets but do not issue new securities over our sample period.

This provides new firm-level information about the patterns of international capital raisings.

        Several findings relate to existing theories of international finance and motivate future

research. First, debt markets dwarf equity markets both in terms of how corporations raise capital

and in terms of the internationalization of securities markets. Over the period 1991-2005,

corporations raised almost four times more money through bond sales relative to equity issues.

Moreover, bonds markets are more internationalized. About 35 percent of all capital raised

through debt issues was raised in markets other than the firm’s home market, while the

corresponding figure for equity issues is ten percent. Since most empirical studies of financial

globalization ignore debt markets and since major theories, such as market segmentation,

bonding, and market timing, focus on the cross-listing of equities and the integration of equity

markets, our findings (1) indicate that financial markets are more internationalized than

suggested by only considering equity markets and (2) advertise the need for additional work that

accounts for the internationalization of debt markets.




to those reported in Table 12, that is, firms increase the amount raised at home and tend to capture a larger share of
domestic market activity following internationalization.


                                                         31
       Second, while firms expand and invest more after raising debt or equity abroad, they (1)

do not become more profitable or experience an increase in valuation and (2) these changes in

firm performance are qualitatively similar to the changes that firms experience when they issue

debt or equity domestically. These findings suggest that firms get bigger, but not necessarily

“better” following internationalization. Furthermore, they suggest that capital raisings abroad are

not intrinsically different from capital raisings at home. While capital raisings abroad are bigger,

the changes in firm performance following debt and equity issuance in international markets are

broadly similar to those in domestic markets. These findings are difficult to reconcile with

arguments that firms access international markets to bond themselves to a better corporate

governance system because internationalization does not seem to spark enduring improvements

in corporate performance that differ from the dynamics that follow domestic issuances

       Third, firms continue to use domestic debt and equity markets after they raise capital

abroad and indeed significantly expand their use of domestic securities markets. Thus, after firms

internationalize, they issue debt and equity securities in both the domestic and foreign markets,

using foreign markets for relatively larger issuances. These observations are difficult to reconcile

with the view that international markets provide less expensive capital, but there are high fixed

costs associated with initially accessing these markets. Furthermore, these patterns complicate

the study of corporate finance since firms participate in multiple debt and equity markets

simultaneously, which is not the focus of research on the determinants of corporate financing

choices.

       Finally, very few firms use international markets, and of the few that access international

debt or equity markets, a very small number raises most of the capital garnered through the sale

of securities in international markets. As emphasized by Levine and Schmukler (2006, 2007),




                                                32
this suggests that financial internationalization could have cross-firm distributional effects that

affect those firms that rely solely on local markets. Firms that access international markets both

grow relative to other corporations in the local market and account for a higher percentage of the

total capital raised in domestic markets following internationalization. Future research could

assess whether these changes affect the ability of smaller firms to obtain financing for growth.

                                       Number of Firms Raising Capital in Public Markets by Issuer Country/Region and Type of Issue
This table shows the number of firms from each country/region conducting different types of security issues in public markets over the 1991-2005 period. Issues at home are those carried out in a
public market in the firm's home country. Issues abroad are those carried out in a public market outside the firm's home country. Since firms may conduct several different types of issues in different
markets, the number of firms in the total columns may differ from the sum of the different columns. See Appendix Table 1 for a list of the economies included in each region and income group.

This table reports the median of different firm-level characteristics for different groups of firms classified according to their capital raising activity over the 1991-2005 period. Firms with no
capital raising activity are those that do not raise capital through security issues in public markets neither at home nor abroad over the sample period. Firms that only raise capital at home are
those that raise capital through security issues in public markets in their home country at some point during the sample period but that do not raise capital through security issues outside their
home country during the sample period. Firms that raise capital abroad are those that raise capital through security issues in public markets outside their home country at some point during
the sample period. These include firms that raise capital both at home and abroad. The number of observations used to calculate the medians in each case is in parentheses. Columns (a) and
(b) report the results of median regressions of the different firm characteristics on a dummy identifying firms that raise capital abroad, country dummies, and industry dummies. Only the
coefficient on the abroad dummy is reported. Standard errors are estimated through bootstrapping with clustering at the firm level. z-statistics are in brackets. See Appendix Table 4 for the
definition of the variables. *, **, *** mean significance at ten, five, and one percent, respectively.

                                   Before and After Comparisons between Firms Conducting Seasoned Equity Offerings at Home and Abroad
This table reports ordinary least square regressions of different firm-level characteristics on dummies that identify the capital raising activity of firms in international markets over the 1991-2005
period. The sample includes both firms that conduct seasoned equity offerings (SEOs) abroad at some point during the sample period and firms that conduct SEOs at home at some point during
the sample period. The before SEO abroad dummy equals one before a firm raises capital through an SEO in a public market outside its home country and zero otherwise. The after SEO abroad
dummy equals one on and after the year when a firm raises capital through an SEO in a public market outside its home country and zero otherwise. Both dummies equal zero for firms that only
conduct SEOs at home. The first seasoned equity offering in a public market outside firms' home country during the sample period is used to identify firms' capital raising activitiy abroad. Column
(c) reports the difference between the coefficients on the after SEO abroad dummy and the before SEO abroad dummy and the result of a Wald test of equality of these coefficients. F-statistics
from these tests are in parentheses. All regressions include country-year dummies and industry dummies. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the firm level. t-statistics are in brackets. See
Appendix Table 4 for the definition of the variables. *, **, *** mean significance at ten, five, and one percent, respectively.

                                              Before and After Comparisons between Firms Conducting Debt Issues at Home and Abroad
This table reports ordinary least square regressions of different firm-level characteristics on dummies that identify the capital raising activity of firms in international markets over the 1991-2005
period. The sample includes both firms that raise capital through debt issues abroad at some point during the sample period and firms that raise capital through debt issues at home at some point
during the sample period. The before debt issue abroad dummy equals one before a firm raises capital through a debt issue in a public market outside its home country and zero otherwise. The
after debt issue abroad dummy equals one on and after the year when a firm raises capital through a debt issue in a public market outside its home country and zero otherwise. Both dummies equal
zero for firms that only issue debt at home. The first debt issue in a public market outside firms' home country during the sample period is used to identify firms' capital raising activity abroad.
Column (c) reports the difference between the coefficients on the after debt issue abroad dummy and the before debt issue abroad dummy and the result of a Wald test of equality of these
coefficients. F-statistics from these tests are in parentheses. All regressions include country-year dummies and industry dummies. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the firm level. t-
statistics are in brackets. See Appendix Table 4 for the definition of the variables. *, **, *** mean significance at ten, five, and one percent, respectively.

This table reports regressions of firm-level characteristics on dummies that identify the capital raising activity of firms. The first four dummy variables equal one in the designated year and zero otherwise. The
more than three years after SEO abroad dummy equals one after the third year following a seasoned equity offering (SEO) abroad and zero before. The sample includes only firms that conduct SEOs in a
public market outside their home country at some point during the sample period. The first SEO abroad during the sample period is used to identify firms' capital raising activity. The regressions are estimated
with fixed effects at the firm level. All regressions include year dummies. t-statistics are in brackets. See Appendix Table 4 for the definition of the variables. *, **, *** mean significance at ten, five, and one
percent, respectively.

This table reports regressions of firm-level characteristics on dummies that identify the capital raising activity of firms. The first four dummy variables equal one in the designated year and zero otherwise. The
more than three years after debt issue at home dummy equals one after the third year after a firm raises capital through a debt issue at home and zero before. The sample includes only firms that raise capital
through a debt issue in a public market in their home country at some point during the sample period. The first debt issue at home during the sample period is used to identify firms' capital raising activity. The
regressions are estimated with fixed effects at the firm level. All regressions include year dummies. t-statistics are in brackets. See Appendix Table 4 for the definition of the variables. *, **, *** mean

This table shows the median amount raised per security issue for different types of issues in public markets over the 1991-2005 period. The number of observations used to calculate the medians
in each case is in parentheses. Issues at home are those carried out in a public market in the firm's home country. Issues abroad are those carried out in a public market outside the firm's home
country. Firms that raise capital both at home and abroad are those that issue securities both outside their home country and in their home country at some point during the sample period.
Columns (a), (b), and (c) report the results of median regressions of the amount raised per security issue on a dummy identifying issues abroad, country dummies, and industry dummies. Only the
coefficient on the issue abroad dummy is reported. Standard errors are estimated through bootstrapping with clustering at the firm level. z-statistics are in brackets. See Appendix Table 1 for a list
of the economies included in each income group. *, **, *** mean significance at ten, five, and one percent, respectively.

            Capital Raising Activity in Domestic Markets Following Capital Raisings Abroad
This table analyzes the capital raising activity in domestic markets of firms that raise capital through security issues in
public markets abroad at some point during the 1991-2005 period. The displayed variable is the average across these firms
of the ratio of capital raised at home to total capital raised in public markets in each year following their first capital raising
abroad. The number of observations used to calculate the averages in each case is in parentheses. Issues at home are those
carried out in a public market in the firm's home country. Issues abroad are those carried out in a public market outside the
firm's home country. See Appendix Table 1 for a list of the economies included in each income group.

                                                      Capital Raising Activity in Domestic Markets of Firms that Raise Capital Abroad
This table analyzes the capital raising activity in domestic markets of firms that raise capital through security issues in public markets abroad at some point during the 1991-2005 period. The first variable
analyzed is the amount raised in domestic capital markets per year by these firms before and after their first capital raising abroad. The second variable analyzed is the amount raised in domestic capital
markets divided by total assets before raising capital per year before and after their first capital raising abroad. The third variable analyzed is the ratio of the amount raised in domestic capital markets per firm
to the total amount raised in these markets per year before and after their first capital raising abroad. For firms with multiple security issues in the same year, the amount raised divided by assets before raising
capital is calculated as the weighted average of the ratio of amount raised to total assets for each issue in the year, weighted by the amount raised per issue. For the three variables, years without capital
raising activity are assigned a zero. Issues abroad are those carried out in a public market outside the firm's home country. Columns (a), (b), and (c) report the results of tobit regressions of the different
variables on a dummy identifying the period after the first capital raising abroad and a constant. The effect of a discrete change in the dummy variable on the expected value of the observed dependent
variable is reported. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering at the firm level. t-statistics are in brackets. See Appendix Table 1 for a list of the economies included in each income group. *, **, *** mean

                                       Size Differences Among Issues at Home and Abroad
This figure shows the cumulative distribution of the amount raised per security issue in public markets by firms from developed and
developing economies over the 1991-2005 period. Issues with size above the 95th percentile are excluded. Issues at home are those
carried out in a public market in the firm's home country. Issues abroad are those carried out in a public market outside the firm's home
country. See Appendix Table 1 for a list of the economies included in each income group.

This table presents the list of economies included in the different regions and their classification by income level. Economies are classified as developed or developing based on income level in
2005. Developed economies correspond to high-income economies according to the World Bank classification, which are economies with a GNI per capita of 10,725 U.S. dollars or higher in 2005.
Developing economies correspond to low- and middle-income ecoonomies according to the World Bank classification, which are economies with a GNI per capita below 10,725 U.S. dollars in
2005. * means the economy is classified as developed.

This table shows the number of observations from each country/region included in our dataset on
capital raising activity. The data cover the period 1991-2005. The dataset includes only security issues
by firms in public markets. Each observation corresponds to a security issue. Issues at home are those
carried out in a public market in the firm's home country. Issues abroad are those carried out in a
public market outside the firm's home country. See Appendix Table 1 for a list of the economies
included in each region and income group.

This table shows the number of observations and firms from each country/region included in our analyses of firm-level characteristics. The data cover the period 1991-2005. Firms with capital raising activity are
those that raise capital through security issues in public markets at some point during the sample period. Firms with capital raisings at home are those that raise capital through security issues in public markets in
their home country at some point during the sample period. Firms with capital raisings abroad are those that raise capital through security issues in public markets outside their home country at some point during the
sample period. Since firms may raise capital both at home and abroad, the number of observations and firms in columns (b) and (e) may differ from the sum of the capital raising activity at home and capital raising
activity abroad columns. See Appendix Table 1 for a list of the economies included in each region and income group.
