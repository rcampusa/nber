                      Economic Development, Infant Mortality, and
                           Their Dynamics in Latin America

                                         ABSTRACT


     The main issue of this paper is to study infant mortality in Latin America in
recent decades. In so doing, two questions must be answered: First, how large is
the economic loss in terms of net national -product due to child mortality under the
age   of.15 and what are the major causes of death?. Second, has the decline of infant
mortality been principally a product of economic development in Latin American
countries?

       Surprisingly enough, there is significant variation of economic losses across
Latin American countries, such as from 0.99% of the net national product In Uruguay
to 18.93% in Haiti. Eleven among the nineteen countries in Latin America show their
economic losses to be more than 3% of the net national product in recent years in
marked contrast to those values found by Kuznets (1980) for Egypt (2.68%) and the
Netherlands (0.17%) in 1937. As the major causes of death in Latin America, these
diseases —— influenza and pneumonia, enteritis and other diarrheal diseases, and other
infective   and parasitic diseases ——   account for one—third or more of total deaths
for many Latin American countries. Being provided with the fact that the proportion
of infant mortality only is roughly about 20 — 30% of total deaths across the
countries, we speculate that these above diseases will be- exclusively responsible
for the high mortality in childhood in latin America.

    The Cranger—Sims dynamic system showS that economic development in latin
America does not have strong explanatory power in accounting for the behavior of
infant mortality rate in recent decades. Therefore, the empirical results seem to
support the view that medical and health technological development is the major
cause of the reduction in infant mortality rates in Latin American countries in
recent decades. However, when economic development Granger—causes infant mortality
as observed for only two countries, the former becomes the main source of variation
of the latter over long horizons.

             ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, INFANT MORTALITY, AND
                  THEIR DYNAMICS IN LATIN AMERICA

                                  Tadashi Yarnadat


         During the l930s through 1950s, the average life expectancy
at birth in Latin America substantially, increased from 32.8 to

55.1 years due to the unprecendentéd decline of mortality rates.'
Despite the reduction in the latter, the birth rates have not been
so responsive that the population trends in Latin American countries

are characterized by high rates of population growth, e.g., 2.5%
per, annum or more, (see Table 10 in appendbc).                       '




         As for the economic development in Latin America, the 2.5%

of population growth per annum normally requires a high rate of
annual capital investment, e.g., 7.5% of the national income, to

keep real per capita income constant, when the capital—output ratio
is assumed to be 3, as' in other less developed countries (Notestein

1966). However, the high rate of annual capital investment is
often hindered by the large, proportion of children under 15 years

old in Latin America, e.g., about 145% of total population (see

Table 10: P0—14). 'The large proportion of children usually implies
more consumption and less capital investment of national income,
which leads to lower economic growth than otherwise.
                                —2—


       Demographers often attribute the causes of mortality
reduction in less developed countries (LDC5) to medical and

health technological development imported from more developed
countries (MOCs),   which is considered independent ofeconomic
development in   the   case of Latin America (Arriaga and Davis 1969).
On the .other hand, some international cross—sectional studiEs show

that 20 to 50% of the gain in life expectancy at birth between
1940 and 1970 results from the changes in per capita income in.

LDCS and MDCs (Preston 1975 and 1980). Along the same line as
Preston, Fuchs (1980) finds almost 30% of the observed change in
life expectancy at birth in LDC5 attributable to the growth of

per capita income during the period of 19110 through 1970.
Therefore, this paper reexamine the question of whether economic

development has any power to explain infant mortality behavior
in Latin America by using time—series causality techniques
developed by Granger and Sims. The importance of such a study
is underscored by Preston (1980), who states: "Considerable dispute
remains about whether the decline (of mortality) has been
principally a by—product of social and economic development
or whether it was primarily produced by social policy measures

with an unprecendented scope or efficacy."2
       The intent of this paper is, first, to calculate economic
loss due to child mortality under the age of 15 by using

the Kuznets method (1980), and, second, to examine whether
                             —3—



the decline of infant mortality has been principally a product

of economic development in Latin American countries. The rationale
for using the infant mortality rate rather than life expectancy at
birth in this time—series analysis is   As mortality rates have
declined in Latin America in recent decades, the infant mortality

rate has become one of the predominant rates in determining the life
expectancy at birth.

       Section I illustrates the calculation of economic loss and
the results in addition to the data for the major causes of death

and medical aspects in Latin America. Section II describes briefly
the statistical techniques to observe dynamic relationships among

variables, i.e., infant mortality rate, birth rate, and real per
capita income (as a proxy variable for economic development)

Section III reports the empirical results. Finally, section IV
gives a summary of the findings of this study.

I. CAUSES OF MORTALITY, MEDICAL ASPECTS, AJ4D ECONOMIC LOSS
The purpose of this section is to facilitate the understanding of

durrent demographic situations in Latin America, focusing in
particular on the economic loss due to child mortality under
the age of 15. Although the topics in this section are related
to the primary question in this paper about whether the decline

of infant mortality has been principally a product of economic
development in Latin America, it may be appropritate to treat
this section as independent of the following sections II and III.

       Despite the dramatic decline in infant mortality in Latin
American countries in recent decades, the current rate of infant

mortality is still surprisingly high —— 20 points or.more per
thousand live births above the infant mortality rate in the United

States in 1975 (see INF197S in Table 10). In order to explain
the reasons for the high infant mortality rate, it is necessary to
investigate the causes of death. Table 11 in appendix show
the proportions of major causes of the total deaths in the country.

The listed causes of death give valuable information about
the causes of infant mortality because the proportion of infant
mortality accounts for 20 — 30% of total deaths in Latin American

countries (see INFD/TD in Table 10).
        Compared with the causes of death in the United States,

 the proportion of heart diseases is substantially lower in Latin
 American countries, probably because of their diet (see Table 11).
                                        —5—



On the other• hand, the proportions of the last three groups of diseases
 in the table ——    influenza    and pneumonia, enteritis and othe± diarrhea].

 diseases, and other infective and parasitic diseases ——                are much
 hi4her than those proportions in the United States and may bear                     1




 exclusive responsibility for the high infant mortality rate in
 the Latin American countries. The influenza and pneumonia explains
 the   roughly   more than 10% of total deaths for Guatemala (15.7%),

 Mexibo (13.1%) ,    Chile   (9.7%) ,   cuador    (9.5%) ,.   and Peru (20.5%)
                                                                                 -
 Also, 12 — 18% of total deaths are caused by enteritis and

 other   diarrhea]. diseases for El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras,

 Mexico, Nicaragua, Ecuador, and Peru. In addtion, other infective
 and parasitic diseases constitute a             significant     proportion of
 total deaths for Guatemala (20.5%), Honduras (10.0%), EcuadOr
 (13.2%), and Peru (12.1%). Consequently, these three groups of
 diseases —-     influenza   and pneumonia, enteritis and other diarrheal

 diseases, and other infective and parasitic diseases —— account
 for one—third or more of total deaths for the following countries:

 Guatemala (54.5%), Honduras (28.5%), Mexico (32.0%), Nicaragua
 (30.4%), Ecuador (34.6%), and Peru (44.2%) when we add the figures
 of different years as an approximation. As Preston (1980) describes,
 these diseases will be prevented by immunization, identification

 and isolation, purification and increased supply of water, sewage
• disposal, and personal sanitation. Antibiotics, chemotherapy, and
 rehydration are the major medical treatments.

       Table. 12 includes information on medical aspects in Latin

American countries ——    the number of hospital beds per thousand
population in each country and the number of inhabitants per
medical. doctor in cities with over 100,000 population as well as

in each country. As we note, all countries except Argentina
(5.4 beds) and Uruguay (5.7 beds) have 4 beds or fewer per thousand
population. The number of beds in Haiti in 1976 shows a surprisingly

small figure ——   0.8   beds per thousand population in contrast to

6.3 beds in the United States in 1977.

       Medical doctors, i.e., physicians, are heavily distributed
in cities with over 100,000 population, relative to rural areas.3
The average number of inhabitants per doctor in the cities is

861 (not shown in Table 12) in the period of 1968—1971, while
the average overall of country is 2,877 (also not shown in the
table).4 The figures in Haiti present the most strikingly unequal
distribution of doctors such that the number of inhabitants per
doctor in the cities and in the country as a whole are 1,382. and

15,750, respectively. The ratio of 15,750 to 1,382 is 11.4, which
is listed in the last column in Table 12. This value, means that
the inhabitants in rural areas are at least 11.4 times more
difficult to reach with medical services than the inhabitants

in cities with over 100,000 population. This unequal distribution
of medical services seems to explain partially why infant mortality
risk is much higher in rural areas than in urban areas in Latin

l½nierica.5

      We speculated earlier about influenza and other diseases

responsible for the high infant mortality in Latin Mierican countries.
High morbidity in childhood and adulthood certainly has a negative
impact on one's economic productivity at home and in the labor

market. When death takes! place in childhood, before one produces
goods and services sufficient for offsetting the past consumption
of resources, the economic loss due to the death may be calculated

in terms of consumption of resources, i.e., net national product.
By calculating the economic loss represented by child mortality
under the age of 15, Kuznets (1980) intends to answer the following

questions: "What unoffset consumption inputs might have been
avoided if the children and yound adults whose deaths we are

donsidering had never been born?"6
       For illustration of economic loss, we use the following
demographic data for Costa Rica in Tables 1 and 2:

    Therefore, the figures in 1975 are used as an approximation
    for the calculation of economic loss in 1976.

       Kuznets (1980) assumes that total income (or net products
of the nation) is the sum of all consumption: Consumption per child

under the age of 15 is 0.5 of that (=1.0) per adult of working ages
15 — 64 and consumption per adult aged 65 and over is 0.75 of

that per adult of working ages 15 — 64.      Then, economic loss is
defined as follows:


                           0. 5rXPASDR
Economic Loss =                                  -

        By using the demographic data for Costa Rica in Tables 1
and 2, we obtain the economic loss in 1976 as follows:

      The last column in Table 10 shows the economic loss of
child mortality under the age of 15 for the nineteen Latin

American countries for the specified years. Surprisingly enough,
there is significant variation for the economic loss across
the countries —— from 0.99%(Uruguay) to 18.93% (Haiti) of net

national products. Some economic losses are substantially larger
in recent years than those values found by Kuznets (1980) for
Egypt (2.68%) and the Netherlands (0.17%) in 1937. In the case
of Haiti (18.93%), we notice that the distribution of doctors
between the cities with over 100,000 and the country as a whole
is. the most unequal among the Latin American countries (see

the last column of Table 12), and the fractions of urban population
in 1960 and 1980 are much smaller than in any other countries
in Latin America (see Table 13: P1960 and P1980). Since the fraction
of infant mortality in total deaths is relatively small in Haiti
(see Table 10: INFD/TD = 5% in 1972), the large economic loss in

Haiti is mainly due to the child mortality between ages 1 and 14.
Therefore, for Haiti and other Latin American countries as well
the reduction in high morbidity and mortality rates in childhood
and young adulthood will benefit various economic and social

groups and consequently lead to their economic development.
       In summary, this section presents recent cross—sectional data
for major causes of deathandfor some medical aspects in Latin

America.   Three groups, of diseases ——   influenza   and pneumonia,
enteritis and other, diarrheal diseases, and other infective and

parasitic diseases ——   are.in   strikingly larger proportion in
the total death rate than those same groups in the United.States.
For example, those. 'three 'groups of diseases account for one—third

or more of total deaths for many Latin American countries, .sfle
they account for only about 4% of the total deaths in the United
States in 1975. Also, we note that medical doctors are heavily
distributed in 'cities with over 100,000 population, relative to

rural areas. The average number of inhabitants per doctor in
the cities is 861 in the period of 1968—1971, while the average
overall of country is 2,877 in the same period. Finally,
the economic loss due to child mortality under the age of 15 in
Latin American countries is calculated on the basis of the Kuznets
method (1980) and points out a significant variation from 0.99%
of the net national product in Uruguay to 18.93% .in Haiti.

Surprisingly enough, eleven of the nineteen Latin American countries
show their economic losses to be more than 3% of their net national
products in recent years, in contrast to those values found
by Kuznets (1980) for Egypt (2.68%) and the Netherlands (0.17%)
in 1937.

II. STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES OF A DYNAMIC MODEL

Granger (1969) defines causality between two, stationary stochastic
time series, X(t) and Y(t), within a set of information in
•the universe as follows: A time series X causes another time
series Yif the current value of Y is more accurately predicted by

using the information which includes at least the own—past series
of Y and the past series of X, than by using the information which
excludes the past series of X.

         By using a logarithmic specification, the following linear
model is estimated:




                 =      +
                               1
                                   >    (s)   X(t_s) +tT               (1)




where'S, , andtarethe least—square estimates; X represents
infant mortality rate, birth rate, and real per capita income for
g = 3; and T is a linear time trend. In 'order to identify         -




the   Granger—causality from X. to X.,, j   i,. in equation (1),
the null hypothesis is that the set of parameters a.(s), s =l,...,n,
should be zero if there is no Granger-causality from
                                                         X1 to X.
         With respect to dynamic relationships between   X and
i     j, the estimated coefficients on successive lags include

complicated cross—equation feedbacks and, therefore, summing
                                  — 13




the distributediagged coefficients, e.g., a(s)1 is quite
misleading (Sims 1980). Therefore, the moving average
representation is an alternative method to observe the effects
              8
of X. on

         Let ?(t) represent the. best linear forecast of X(t) based

on its past series X(t—s), s.0, where X(t) is an q x 1 vector
stationary stochastic time series. Then, the innovation in
X(t), U(t), is defined as

combination of current and     past   values of X(t) for all t.

Then, X(t) can be expressed as a linear combination of innovation

U(t—s), s     0. However, if components of U are contemporaneously
correlated, it is not possible to partition            the variance of X

into pieces accounted for by each innovation. Therefore,
an orthogonalizing transformation to U is required to obtain

E(t) =   TU(t),   where T is a lower triangular matrix with zero

elements 'above the diagonal elements, which makes the covariance

matrix of E(t) the identity matrix. The final equation to
estimate is as follows:

III. EMPIRICAJJ RESULTS

111—1. Granger—Causal,ity Tests

Granger—causality tests.among infaxtt.niortality rate, birth rate,
and   real   per capita income are performed using the annual time—
series data., for the eleven. Latin American countries          Real per
capita income is used as. a proxy variable for economic development

in. each.country, which is, in fact,, the best.single economic

variable representing the level of standards of livi.ng. in

the country (Preston 1975). Birth rate is. alsp included in
the system because the rates are typically high in. Latin American

countries.. The logarithmic results of.four lag distributions are
reported in Tables 4 and 5
         Table 4 contains, the F-statistics on the four lag coefficients

of the explanatory variables, infant mortality rate (INF), birth

rate (SIR)., and real per capita income, (INC), when infant mortality
rate is the dependent variable and other two, are the causal
variables.         On the other hand,, Table, 5 lists the F-statistics
               ,




when birth rate is the dependent variable and other two are
the causal variables.,           ,




         Concerning the issue of Granger—causality from real per
capita income (INC) to infant mortality rate (fl4F) in Table 4,

there are only two countries,. Costa. Rica and Mexico, that show

the Granger—causality from economic development to infant mortality.
                            — 1.6 —




Of the two countries, Costa Rica has a result that is marginally
significant at the 10% significance level. Therefore, these
overall results do not reject the demographer's viewpoint that
the economic developments in Latin American countries have been

a minor contributing factor in reducing the infant mortality rates

in recent decades.
       Similarly, a Malthusian argument is not found in many Latin
American countries: A higher birth rate results in a higher infant

mortality rate. Birth rate (BIR) Granger—causes infant mortality
rate (IN?) only for these three countries: Honduras, Mexico, and
Chile, of which the results of Mexico and Chile indicate relatively

large F—statistics, 7.366 and 6.241, respectively. Therefore,
reducing their birth rates probably can help to lower the infant
mortality rates in these countries.

       With respect to the issue of Granger—causality from real

per capita income (INF) or infant mortality rate (IN?) to birth

rate (BIR) in Table 5, the economic development Granger—causes
the birth rates in Honduras, Chile, Ecuador, and Uruguay.
In terms of the number of statistically significant countries,
the economic developments seem to have reduced the birth rates

rather than the infant mortality rates.

       In the theory of demographic transition, mortality rates
decline prior to a fall in birth rate. However, the response in
                                 — 17 —




birth   rate to the decline in infant mortality rate does not

strongly support the idea of demographic transition in Latin
America. That is, the birth rates in Latin America have not been
very responsive to the fall in the infant mortality rates in
recent decades. On the other hand, the birth rates are fairly
well explained by their own past behaviors for many countries

such as Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico, Chile, and Uruguay.
        As a summary of Granger-causality tests for the causes
of the fall in the     infant   mortality rates in Latin America,
the empirical results seem to support the view that medical and

health technological development is the major cause of the reduction
in infant mortality rates in recent decades. In some Latin

American countries, a fall in birth rate probably lowers infant
mortality rate, while the former is strongly influenced by its
own   past   behavior and economic development.

111—2. Dynamic Responses of Infant Mortality Rate

In the previous section, it was argued that real per capita income
as a proxy variable for economic development has little power to
explain the infant mortality behavior in Latin America.

only.the results of Costa Rica and Mexico indicate Granger—causality

from ecOnomic development to infant mortality rate, although

the former is marginally significant at the 10% significance level;

In this section, rather than depicting the dynamic relationships
among real per capita income, infant mortality rate, and birth
rat& for the eleven Latin American countries, I present the dynamic

responses of infant mortality rate to realper capita income and,
birth rate of Costa Rica and   Mexico in the forms of charts (Tables
6 and 7) and decomposition of variance of infant mortality rate

(Tables 8 and 9).
       First, concerning the case of Costa Rica, Table 6 shows

the responses of infant mortality rate to real per capita income

innovation, birth innovation, and infant mortality innovation;
Table 8 indicateS the corresponding variance decomposition of
infant mortality explained by each innovation. As we can see
in the top chart of real per capita income innovation in Table 6,
positive random shocks of •one standard deviation in the innovation

tend persistently to decrease the infant mortality at the time

horizons shown,, and the dynamic effects seem to complete in
                                — 21 —




the eighth year. On the other hand, the birth innovation tends to
decrease temporarily the infant mortality below trend level and

increase, eventually above trend level, although the importance is
negligible on the basis of the Granger—causality test. Table 8
provides the, decomposition of variance of infant, mortality.

The, infant mortality initially has 60% of its variance accounted

for by its own innovation, while the rest is explained by the birth
innovation at k =   1.   The proportion explained by its own innovation
diminishes as more futur,e is forecast, e.g., only 8% of the variance

of infant mortality being explained by its own    innovation   at k = 8.
However, the income innovation explains 75% of the variance of infant
mortality at k =    8.   Therefore, over long horizons the ecdnomic
development (the real per capita income) is the main source of
variation in infant mortality in 'Costa Rica.

       Second, with respect to the result of Mexico in Table 7,
the income innovation shown in the top chart generates a large
fluctuation in the infant mortality and the former decreases
the latter below trend level over long horizons, It is a little
puzzling why the infant mortality increases above trend level
at k = 3 through k = 6 after initial random shocks in the income

innovation. In the middle chart, the birth innovation is followed
by an apparent increase in the infant mortality at k = 5 and after.
According to the decomposition of variance of infant mortality
                            — 22 —




shown Sri Táblé9, the infant mortality has 77% of its variance
at k = 1 but has only 8% at k    8 accounted for by its own
innovation, indicating that: the dynamic effects from the other

two variables are significantly strong. Over the long horizons
shown, the main source of variation in infant mortality comes

from the fluctuations in real per capita income and birth innovatIons.
       As a summary for this section, when economic development
Granger—causes infant mortality, the former becomes the main sOurce
of variation in the latter over long horizons. Also, an increase
in birth seems to have a corresponding increase in infant mortality
with a lag over long horizons.

IV.   SUMMARY

Despite the unprecedented fall in infant mortality rate in Latin
America in recent decades, the infant mortality rate is still
substantially higher than the rate in Weste±n. countries.

The aim of this study is twofold: One is to calculate econOmic loss

in terms of net national product due to child mortality under
the age of 15, and another is to answer empirically the question
of whether the decline of infant mortality has been principally
a product of economic development in Latin America in recent

decades.
         with respect to the economic loss represented by child
mortality under the age of 15, there is significant variation
from 0.99 to 18.93% of net national products across Latin American
countries, of which eleven show their economic losses to be more

than 3% of the net national.product. The high mortality in childhood,
reflecting the high economic losses, seems to result largely from
the following diseases: influenza and pneumonia, enteritis and
other diarrheal diseases, and other infective and parasitic diseases.
In explaining the high morbidity and child mortality rates, we
note that there exist significant differeñtiàls in medical services,
distribution of population, and literacy rate between urban and

rural areas in Latin America.

      The   Granger—Sims dynamic system shows that economic
development   in Latin America does not have strong explanatory
power in accounting for the behavior of infant mortality rate

in recent decades. Therefore, the empirical results seem to
support the view that medical and health technological development
is the major bause of the reduction in infant mortality rates
in Latin American countries in recent decades. However, when

economic development Granger—causes infant mortality as observed
for only two countries, the former becomes the main source of

variation of the latter over long horizons.

       3The source is Statistical Abstract of Latin America,
Vol.21, Table 6 Social..Indicators, 20L, 1960—79,. p.7, which does
not specify whether doctor means. physician or not. However,
the comparable data are listed in the same source in Table 800
Population per Physician, 20L, 1960—77, p.116. Therefore,
I assume "doctor" equivalent to "physician."
       4The average number of inhabitants per physician of
overall country in Latin America in 1975 is about 1606, which,
however, does not include the statistics of the following countries:
Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti,
Mexico, and Peru. Since these countries show relatively large
numbers of inhabitants per physician in 1969 or 1970, the above
overall average, 1606, in 1975 may not be. directly comparable to
the figure 2,877 in 1968—1971 in the text. The source is
Statistical Abstract of Latin America, pp.7 and 116.

       5'rable 13 lists proportion of urban population and
annual growth rate of urban population for two different periods.
Urban is defined as areas with over 20,000 inhabitants. Since
a national growth rate of population (see Table 10) is a weighted
average of urban and rural growth rates of population, the growth
rate of urban population seems at least twice as high as that of
rural population. This seems to result from heavy migration
from rural to urban areas (Cabello 1966) and lower mortality
rates in urban areas. Another datum listed in Table 13 ——
the literacy differential between urban and rural people ——
indicates the significant differentials between urban and rural
females for Mexico, Nicaragua, Brazil, Chile, and Peru.
These differentials in population and literacy rate between urban
and rural areas probably help to explain partially the differential
in infant mortality risk between the two areas.

       7"Causality" in Granger's model means "linear causality
between variables within a given set of information in a universe."
See Granger (196.9), p.430. Blinder (1982) states that "Granger—
causation has nothing to do with äausation in the usual sense
It means that X adds to the ability to predict Y, no more and
no less (pp.15—16)."

the limitation of these above data, the following countries are
possible to be examined by Granger—causality tests: Costa Rica,
Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico,
Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela. For obvious
reasons of scarce and incomplete data of Latin American countries,
and answer to the question by Granger—causality tests should be
speculative.
