               Protection and the Product Line:
                 Monopoly and Product Quality

                               ABSTRACT


     There   are three points made in this paper. The first is that the
question concerning choice of a product line by a monopolist is similar
in structure to other adverse selection problems —   and   can be analyzed
in an elementary way by adapting techniques recently developed for such
problems. Such an analysis is developed in the first section.
     The second is that when a foreign monopolist produces a product

line, protection will change the composition of the entire product line.

The nature of such effects Is studied in the second section and this

analysis is greatly simplified by the results of the first sectton. In

line with empirical work on the subject, quotas are shown to raise the

average quality of imports, while the effects of tariffs are ambiguous.

     The third concerns the possibility of profit shifting protection

which is welfare increasing. The welfare consequences of protection are

analyzed in the third section, and are shown to depend crucially on the

distribution   of consumers.

    P)TECTION AND THE P)DUCT LINE: MONOPOLY AND PRODUCT QUALITY


                               Introduction


     This paper deals with the effects of protection on the product line
selected by a foreign monppolist, on his pricing policy for the product
line, and therefore on national welfare. While trade restrictions tend
to raise domestic prices, harm consumers, and thereby lower national wel-
fare, they also transfer profits from the foreign monopolist to the govern-
ment in the form of revenues collected. This raises national welfare.
This profit shifting motive for trade restrictions has aroused considerable
interest lately.1 This paper explores the possibilities for such welfare
increasing profit shifting, in the scenario where the foreign producer
decides   on a pricing policy for the entire product line.

     Existing work in the trade literature on the effects of trade restric-

tions with endogenous quality focuses mainly on the nature of these effects

in a competitive world. The specifications of the models are therefore

particularly suited to the perfectly competitive paradigm. Unfortunately,

they also tend to, obscure some significant aspects of firm behavior in an

imperfectly   competitive world.
     Falvey   (1979) considers the effect of trade restrictions on the pro-

duct line. He argues that specific tariffs and quotas raise the quality

composition of imports, while ad—valorem tariffs do not. The essence of

his argument is that prices are closely related to costs. Specific tar-

iffs, or quotas implemented by the   sale of licenses, raise all   prices by
                                        —2—



the same amount. Thus, the relative price of higher quality goods
falls. If relative demand depends inversely on relative price, the re-
lative demand for higher quality products rises and this raises the
quality composition of imports. Ad—valorem tariffs do not change rela-
tive prices and so have rio effect on the composition of imports.
       While the argument is relatively plausible in the context of a
competitive      market structure, it is less so when market power on the

part of the producer exists. In such cases, the prices of goods of

different   qualities must be    set together to allow the producer to discrim-

inate   between consumers. It is therefore essential to study the pricing
of   an entire product line, as is done in this paper.

       The idea that a monopolist might       want to   produce a   product line is
captured   by allowing the monopolist to differentiate his products. I

assume    that   there is a continuum of products, indexed by their quality,

which are "vertically" differentiated. By this I mean that while all
consumers agree on the ranking of the products in terms of their quality,

they choose to buy different qualities because of their differing prefer-
ences over income and the products.
        The kind of protection I will consider is a uniform ad—valorem           or

specific    tariff (or a quota implemented by the sale of licenses as dis-
cussed in Krishna (1984)) on the entire product line, This is a common
feature of trade restrictions as they are usually imposed on broad catego-
ries    of products since quality is not costlessly observable by the govern—

ment, as well as for reasons      of   administrative convenience.

        The monopoly pricing problem2 was       first   solved by Mussa   and   Rosen

(1978) .     As the monopolist's problem is that of maximizing profits by
                                             —3—


 choosing      a price quality function, the problem is one of maximization
 in an infinite dimensional space. Even though they ass tune that all con-
 sumers either purchase one unit of some good or none, and a specific

 utility function,        the analysis is nonetheless quite complicated. I pre-

 sent an elementary analysis of their problem for a slightly more general

 utility function. The technique is based               on the   work of Myerson (1981)
 and    Baron and Myerson (1982).          The simplicity of the technique         allows me
 to consider the effect of parameter changes on the solution and therefore
 on welfare. In particular, I analyze the effects of a quota and tariff
 on the profit maximizing choice of the monopolist. In addition, the
wlfare       effects of   both   a small    quota and   tariff   are calculated. I show
 that   a quota does     not   affect the    quality   chosen by each     type   of consumer,

but removes consumers with a low valuation of quality who purchase low

quality products, from the          market,   and raises the      price   of all qualities

by the same amount. Thus, average quality rises. A tariff, on the other

hand, lowers the quality chosen by each consumer, thus reducing average

quality.       In   addition, it   removes   consumers   with    a low valuation of quality

from the market, which         tends   to raise average quality. The effect on

average quality is therefore ambiguous.

        In   addition, I show that     the effect on welfare,        of   a slightly

restrictive quota, or amall specific tax on imports, depends on the

distribution of constuners and the market served by the monopolist. When

constuners, indexed by e , are          distributed as f(8) , and            0* is the

marginal constuner, who is indifferent between purchasing and not

purchasing, then as long as 1f) >                           ,    prices   rise by less than

the specific tariff and elf are increases, The reason is that while
the marginal consumer is removed from the market by the imposition of
the    special   tariff, he derives no-surplus and this does not affect
welfare. However, the government collects more in revenue than con-
atmrs pay due to increased prices as the increase in price is less
than    the specific tariff. This shifts part of the foreign monopolist's

profits into the hands of the government, which raises national welfare.

        The welfare effects of an ad—valorem tariff are less easy to

interpret because the quality chosen by each consumer     is   affected by

the    tariff.   Although the direct effect on welfare of an increase in t

is    shown to be beneficial, the tariff always causes a lower quality       to
be purchased by individuals in the market and decreases the size of the

market. These effects are shown to be harmful and the total effect of

a tariff on welfare is aithiguous.

                                     The Problem



         The odel I viii present here is basically that of )4issa and Rosen

 (1979).     There is a continuum of consumers, indexed by 8 •              The distri-

 bution of 8 is given by f(8) ,              which is assumed to be continuous and
 differentiable over [80, 8] C R+ , the range of 8 •                  All   consumers

 either purchase one unit of the good or none. a1ity is indexed by

     ,    with higher   values of q denoting higher qualities. There is a

constant marginal cotof producing a unit of output of quality q

given by c(q) ,       which is assumed to be increasing and strictly convex
in q •      The consumer of type 8          derives utility U(8,q) from con—

suming the good of quality q •          I   assume that U(e,q) — Oh(q)      + g(q) + n    ,


where      n" is the constmiption of a competitively produced numeraire

good. It is assumed that h,g > 0 ,                h',g'   > 0 ,       < 0 ,    so that

the utility function is non—negative, increasing and concave. Consumers

have an endowment, I ,       of   the numeraire good and maximize expected

utility, subject to their budget constraint.

     The monopolist. is aware of the distribution of 8            ,   and of the

preferences of all types of consumers. However, he is unable to

directly identify consumers by their types. Thus, he cannot choose his

allocation to consumers on the basis of their "type" unless the alloca-

tion offered to each type of consumer is actually his choice among all

possible allocations offered. In other words, the problem may be posed

as a maximization problem, subject to the usual self selection and indi-

vidual rationality constraints.

                                                                                          p is the

good of the given quality at the given price. It will become apparent
that     •    has   only   a notational role.

       Let     S(e/8) denote      the surplus       of       the conster of type 0 with

the    allocation A(0) .         By definition

                              (8/e) — [u(0,q(6))                  p($)J$(6)

 The    incentive       copatibility condition then requires that for all

 B £    [80,81]     ,   the following condition holds:


 (1.1)                         s(8)      s(8/8)      max s(8/0)
                                                         e


 In    addition, individual rationality, requires that:


 (1.2)                            s(8)      0            0        [0, e]
 since consters cannot be forced to be in the market. Finally, as
 is a probability:


 (1.3)                           0 (9) 1                      8   . ['     01]



 An allocation, A(8)             <p(e), q(0), 4(e)> ,               is   said to be      "feasible"   if


 it satisfies conditions (1,1),             (1.2)    and (1,3). The monopolist has to

 find the feasible policy that maximizes his profits. Such a policy is

 constructed in the next section.

                                        The Solution


        The solution is derived by using a series of lemmas which allow the

profit function of the monopolist to be written in a form where the

solution to the problem is apparent by inspectIon. The solution

technique is based on the rk of Baron and Myerson (1982). The first

Lemma 2.1: An allocation Is feasible, if and only if, it satisfies the

following conditions for all 0 c [00,011


(2.1)                                   0     4(8)          i


                                              e
(2.2)                  s(6)        s(0)     + f h(q(9))(9)dO


(2.3)                  h(0)(8)          h(9) (e)
and

(2,4)                                                  0



Proof: First we show that conditions (1.l)—(L3) imply conditions

(2.1)-(2.4). Condition (1.1) requires that:


                     (8/8) )       s(8/0)          ,       0 c [00, 81)



Subtracting s(8/8) from both sides and simplifying yields


(2.5)                s(e)   — s(8)        (8 —    8) h(q(9))(@)
                                              —B--



performing the se operation with              the roles    of 8 and 0 reversed

shows that:

(2.6)                 s(8) —   s(6)   )   (6 —   8)h(q(8))(9)

Combining (2.5) and (2.6) gives:


(2.7)         (8 —   8)h(q(8))(6)     )   s(O) — s(6)       (6 -   O)h(q(6))(O)

        Equation (2.7) shows that for 6 ) 6              condition (2.3) holds.

Since h(q(8))(9) is a non—decreasing function of 8 ,                     it    must be con-

tinuous almost everywhere in °o'                     .   Thus, if we divide by (6 — 6)

and take the limit as 8 • 8           we get:


                               ds(8) -
                                           h(q(8))(O)

        Integrating this equation gives condition (2.2). Condition (2.1)

is just condition (1.3) and condition (2.4) is implied by condition

(1.2).

        Next we show that conditions (2.l)—(2.4) imply conditions (1.1)—

(1.3).

        As condition (1.2) is implied by conditions (2.2) and (2.4), it

only remains to show that conditions (2.2) -and (2.3) imply condition

(1.1).

        Using condition (2.2) gives,


             s(8) -   s(8/8)   -   s(8)   +   f h(q(e))(e)     dO -   s(&/8)


Mding and subtracting s(6) from the right—hand aide and simplifying
                                                  —9

shows that:
                                         8
                 .(e) — s(8f8)       —
                                         f h(q(8))$(8)dO — f        h(q(8))$(e)dO
                                         Go


                                     + (8 —

This   expression 18 always non—negative for the following reason. Ii

             s(8)    —
                         s(0/0)      f h(q(8))(8)d8 —        (8 —   e)h(q(e))$(e)


By condition (2.3) h(q(6))4(e) is                    non—decreasing, and this expression

must   be non—negative. If 8 ( 0


             s(6)   —    s(8/0)      —
                                         J h(q(e))4(8)d6 + (8 —       8)h(q(efl(e)
                                         0


Again, by condition (2.3) this expression is non—negative.

       The next lemma derives an expression for profits when                   the   foreign

monopolist is faced with a specific and an ad—valorem tariff at the

rates m and t , respectively.                      As a quota Implemented by selling

import licenses acts like a specific tariff, the effects of a specific

tariff    may be equated with those of a quota. (See Krishna 0.984) for details).

Lemma 2.2:       For     any   feasible      Outcome function, the profit f.mction of
the   monopolist faced with an ad—valorem tariff at the rate t and a

specific tariff at rate m is given by:

Then the optimal feasible outcome function is given                                 by <q*(6), p*(e),

                                                         0
Proof: Equation (2.8)               is maximized by setting a(6) at its lowest

feasible value, zero. The integral in (2.8) is of a simple form                                           and is
maximized by setting q*(0) to maximize the terms in curly                                            brackets for
                                             -12—


each     e ,   and giving the value 1 to ,*(8) if the maximized value is

positive, and zero otherwise. The aestsaption that z'($)                            0 ensures

that v'(O) is           0 as the envelope theor shows that                  v'(O) —

b'(q*(e))z'(e) .        The definition of $*(8) ensures that those terms

making a positive       contribution to the integral, are included with                   as
atkh weight given to them as possible, and that •*(e)                         is   non-

decreasing in 0

       As

(2.13)         dg*(9)                  h'(q*(0))z'(e)(l_t)
                dO        _[z(8)h"(q*(O)) + g"(q*(e))(1t) —                c"(q*(e))J

q*(8) is non—decreasing in 8 given the assumptions of the theorex.

Thus, •*(8)h(q*(e)) is non—decreasing in 8 ,                     and condition (2.3) is

met. As p*(O) is defined using condition (2.2), this condition is

automatically satisfied. Thus, the outcome function constructed is both

feasible and optimal.

       It is instructive to compare the monopolist's choice when he can

costlessly identify consers by their types to the situation we have

been studying, where he cannot do so. In the former case, he could

charge each type of consinner the entire utility derived from any

quality. Thus, as is usual with a perfectly discriminating monopolist,

the quality assigned to each type of conster uld be optimal, but                               the
monopolist iuld appropriate the entire surplus. In this case the mono-

polist uld       set    qM(O)    to   maximize   u(8,q)    —   c(q)    ,   and uld serve

the   constmer of type 8 if u(8,qM(O)) - c(qM(O))                     > 0 •    This   is exactly

the assignment a planner with perfect and costless information u1d
                                         -13-

 make, by pricing at marginal cost.

      In this case, qM($) is determined by:


 (2.14)          eh(qM(e)) + g(qM(8)) — ct(qM(O)) — 0


 Comparing (2,12) to this (with t — m           0) shows that z(8) plays the

 se role in (2.12) as 8 does in (2.14). Thus,                          z(8) — 8

 can be thought of as the implicit cost borne by the monopolist because

 of his inability to directly identify constmiers by their types.

      Nov    return to the analysis of the profit maximizing outcome

 function for the monopolist. If z(8) is not monotonic, the solution

outlined in Theorem 1 does not meet condition (2.3), and is therefore

•not feasible. In order to derive the optimal policy In this case we

need more machinery. We will construct a function T(6) from z(O)

which is nnotonIc and is, in a way, closest to z(6)          ,   and show that it

plays the same role as z(8)

     Let L() be a function defined over the interval [0,1] .               £    is

constructed from z as follows:




Thus, if at a given 8 — 0   ,    as the value of z is z(8) , the same

value will be assigned to the ntmber F(8) by the function £ .             (This
is Illustrated in DIagram 1.) Define:


                                L(*)     f   L(*)dp
                                         0

Let t()     be the greatest convex function that lies below         L($) on    the

interval 18o'°i1 .   Let   i(*)        be the slope of t()   . Now let i(8)

i(F(8)). )tice that the construction of z(0)                         ensures that z(6) is

made up of segments of (6) connected by flat portions, and that (8)

is   non-decreasing   in in 8 , as portrayed in Diagram 1.

      The following lemma (due to Myerson (1981)) is of use in deriving

the optimal policy.


Lemma 23: Define 0(8) — L(F(8)) —t(F(8)) .                           0(6)        is a continuous

non—negative function. (8) is a non-decreasing function and is

locally constant if 0(0) > 0 •              If        0(8)     0 ,   then       z(8) —   1(e)
In addition, if z(0) is non-decreasing ,                       z(8) —1(8) . Also,

The last equality follows because L(80)               t(80) and L(e1)                1(e1) as
the convex hull of a continuous function always equals the function at

t,he end points of the domain in R

       Now we can use Lemma 2.3 and condition (2.3) to rewrite equation

(2.8), the profits for a feasible outcome function, as:


(2.15) fl(t,m)       5   {[i(8)h(q(e)) + g(q(8)))(1—t)            —   c(q(e))


                     m} f(8)(8)de — (l—t)            C(8)d[h(q(8))(e)]          —
                                                5                                    (1—t)s(80)
                                                00


This is possible because feasibility implies h(q(0))(O) is a non—

decreasing function so that h(q(8))(8) can be used in place of A(O)

The profit maximizing outcome function is aow apparent.


Theorem 2.2: The optimal outcome function is derived as in Theorem 2.1

when     z(8) is replaced by •(8) .        Let      this   be denoted by <p*(0),

q*(e),     +*(8)>.

Proof: This choice of q(0) maximizes the value of the                     first      integral in 2.15

by arguments identical to those of Theorem 2.1. In addition, as i(8) is
                                          —16-


non—decreasing, condition (2.3) is automatically met.                The value of the

second integral mist be non—negative. If q(8) is chosen to maximize

the   first integral, the value of the second integral is sero which              is
its lowest possible value. (This is ensured as h[q*(8)J*(O) is

locally constant whenever C(S) is positive and whenever h[q*(8)]4>*(8)

is increasing, C(S)      is   zero.)             is   set at zero, which   is   its

lowest   value.   This concludes the proof.


       Some comparIsons of the monopoly outcome and the outcome under com-

petition are rth noting. These results are due to ?ssa and Rosen

(1978), though the proofs differ. They are provided for the sake of

completeness.


Theorem 2.3: (Nussa and Rosen (1978)) A comparison of the monopolist's

quality choice, to that under competition shows:


       (1) The monopolist assigns a lower quality to each type of

             constner   served in both markets,
       (2)   The same quality is assigned in both          markets   to the consumer

             of type Si
       (3) The monopolist      serves a   smaller     market than under competition.

(Proof in the appendix.)

       liaving characterized    the profit maximizing outcome function,                are

in    a position to evaluate    the effects of specific and ad—valorsm
tariffs on the quality cice of the monopolist. This is the                  topic     of

the next section.

                              Specif Ic and M—Valorem Tariffs


        The imposition of an ad—valorem tariff, or a quota Implemented by

the sale of licenses, which acts like a specific tariff, changes the

profit maximizing policy of the monopolist. In the previous section,

we derived the monopolist's profit function over feasible outcome func-

tions. This had built into it the parameters "t                   and "ni" which

represented a uniform ad—valoreni tariff and specific tariff on goods of

all qualities.               From this we calculated the monopolist's optimal

policy.

        Consider   the profit function, fl(ni,t)          when the specific tariff

"ni"    and ad—valorem tariff "t" is imposed.

                         81

                     —
                         s(60)(l—t) — (l—t) f G(8)dh(q(8))(8)


        Whatever be the level of ni        or     t ,   the last term is Identically
equal to zero as G(9)dh(q(6))$(8) is equal to zero for each 8 in

[80,81] when       the   monopolist maximizes profits over the set of feasible

policies. The effect of changing in or t on the profit maximizing

policy may be      calculated     by deriving the effect, of changes           in   a and
t   , on the value of the optimal feasible q(e), q*(0)               .   The   effects   on

price and on custors served, of changes in in                  and       t can be derived
                                         —18-


from the effects on q*(e) , and using the characterization of the opti—

*al policy in terms of q*(8) as provided by Theor 2.2.

        In order to simplify the notation in what follows, I define 8* as

the lowest type of constzner served, and use it to drop the variable •(8)

from the expression previously derived. 8* is defined by equation

(3.2) below.


(3.2)      {h(q*(8*))'(8*) + g(q*(8*))](l_t) —          c(q*(8*)) —      m}
                                                                              —


where     q*(8) is the optimal choice of q on the part of the monopolist,

and where

(3.3)           [h'(q*(6))z(0) + g'(q*(0))](l.t) —           c'(q*(O))    — 0


defines q*(0)

        An examination of equation (3.3) reveals that q*(6) does not

depend on in    , only   on t .   Recognizing this dependence, define
q*(0,t) to capture it. Similarly, 8* depends on both in and

as shown by equation (3.2) and the properties of 8*(m,t) may be

derived by using this equation. In addition, p*(e) is defined by:

                                                        8
                                                    —             h(q*(8))de

p* is affected by both in and         t •   Because     in   only affects 0* ,       and

not q* , the change inprice due to a change in in                 is   a constant,

independent of 8 •       This Is not the case when t changes, as both q*
and 8* change in this case. The function p*(m,t) is implicitly

defined by equation (3.4).

     A technical problem needs to be taken care of before the effect of

pareter changes on the solution can be calculated. If the maximized

value of profits gained by serving type 0 ,            when restricted to

feasible policies, is zero, or,


        [h(q*(0))(0) + g(q(0))](1t) —           c(q*(0)) —   in   v(8)      — 0


for an interval of 9's , say        (0,T) ,     then the monopolist is indif-

to charge a lower price. In this case a continui.mi of equilibria exist

and it is not possible to estimate the effect of changing parameters,

as this depends on which equilibriim is taken as the initial point. I

will asste that •(9) — 0        unless v(6) is positive. This means that

in such cases, T      is   taken as the initial point. Thus, for increases

in in   , i'(O*(m))    is by definition not equal to zero. We are now in

a position to determine the effects of an increase in in ,                 or     t



Theorem 3.1: An increase in in        has the following effects:

     (1)   It leaves the quality assigned to all types of consiers, who

           remain   in the market, unaffected.

     (2)   It reduces the size of the market by raising 9*

     (3) It increases price for eachquality by a uniform amount.


Proof: The first point is apparent as equation (3.3) defines q* for

every value of 0 .      Equation (3.2) defines 0* for each a and t
Implicitly differentiating it gives:
                                        —20—.


                   dO*                          1

                          —                                          > 0



Note that the first t points imply that average quality must                    rise,
as    each q*(8) is unaffected by m , q*(e)              is non—decreasing in S

and   as   consiners with low 0's are eliminated from the market.

Differentiating equation (3.4), wtdch       defines       p*(e)      for   each value of

m and t gives

(3.6)
                d*

                                                                                 -
                dm                                  dm          z'(6*(m,t))


which is a positive constant independent of 0 •                It   follows that

surplus for each type of S          falls as well,


Theorem 3.2: ki     increase   in t has the following effects:

        (1) The quality assigned to each type of conser remaining

             in the market falls.

        (2) The size of the market falls.

        (3) The surplus associated with each type of conser remaining

             in the market falls.


Proof: The effect on q*(0) of an increase in t is obtained by dif—

ferentiating equation (3.3). This shows that,


(3.7)       dq*(9,t) —              h'(q*(0,t))i
                                             (8)+ g'(g*(e,t))                              < o
               dt      [{h"(q*(B,t))z(8) + g(q*(e,t))}(1t) —                c(q*(9,t))]

as the ninerator is equal to             by (3.3) and the denoinator is nega-

tive by a2sption. 0* is determined by equation (3.2). Differen-

tiating this gives:
                                              —21—


    (3.8)           de*(,t)        h(q*(8*))T(e*) g(g*(6*)) >
                         dt               '(O*)(i—t)


    Using equation (3.4) shows that,

                dB(O) —                                               dg*(O,t) d6 < 0
                          _h(q*(e*))           f          h'(q*(e))
                                               O*(in,t)


    so surplus must     fall.   !btice also that the fall in surplus is increasing

    In 6

         Note   that   it Is not   possIble   to say that the price paid by each

    type rises, as the quality assigned to each type also falls,                 However,

    as surplus falls for each 6 , the price assigned to each quality must

    rise. The effect on average quality of an Increase in t                Is   unclear.

    The Increase in t lowers the quality purchased by each conser

    remaining in the market. This lowers average quality. However, con—

    sers with low values of 8 , who buy low quality products, leave the

-
    market,   and this raises average quality.

         Even though conser surplus falls as m or t rise, It could be

    In the interests of national lfare to levy such taxes if value of the

    gain in revenue was larger than the value of the loss in consner surplus.

    The conditions under which this is likely are investigated next.

                                           Section 4

                                     Welfare Effects


        In this section I will consider the effect of a saall ad—valorem

or specific tariff on ie1fare when the initial situation is that of free

trade. Thus, the initial levels of t and in                         are set at zero.

        In the previous section, the assumption made (which is maintained

throughout) was that revenue raised by the government is either returned

to consumers in a lump sum fashion or that the goverruent acts like a

separate    consumer with    the    utility function given by revenue raised.

The existence of a numeraire good ensures that lump sum transfers do not

affect    demand.

        Making this assumption, the national welfare function is given by:


                                                         — p(O)J   + R(t,m,O)}f(6)d8
(4.1)          W(m,t)        f    {[u(e,q(6))
                          0*(m,t)


where R(t,tn,9) is the revenue raised by the government,                      from the con-

sumer of type 0       •   Total    revenue is given by summing             R(t,m,0)    over

the consumers in the market to be:

                                           01
                          R(m,t)                  (in   + tp*(8)]f(0)dO
                                     0*(m,t)


and is the utility derived by the government.

        I will only   consider     the effect on welfare of raising t or in

from zero. If only in         is    raised, welfare is given by:


                             W(m)      f        [s(6)    + m]f(8)dO
                                                         —23—



 Using condition (1.6) •(0) — 0 , and integrating by parts gives:



                W(m)          [ f h(q*(8))dO]f(e)de + [1—p'(e*())]
                                01
                                f
                        0*(m) O*(m)
                                             e




                            o                           —         81         0
                       —
                            f         h(q*(0))d8F(e) J        h(q*(8))F(8)de
                                                                         —

                        0*(m)                     6*(m) 8*(m)

                       + m[i         —   F(8*(m))]

Rearranging    this gives:

                        01
(4.2)          W(m) —   f        (1          F(e))h(q*(e))de + mEl -. F(e*(m))J


Differentiating    the above and using equation (3.5) yields:


(4.3)           dW(m)_ [1 - F(O*(m))]                           [i *               _____


                            — [l         —
                                             F(8*(m))] [i —                            .
                                                                        z' (8*(m)) }

        When the monopolist was                  indifferent      between serving and not serving

a   group of consers, we asstned he did not serve them. This means that
for increases in m ,
                                                  — z' > 0        and

            f(8*) > — ('(0*)                      dW(m)
Thus,                                                       >
           l—F(0*)              f(0*)              dm

        Equation (4.3) is easy to interpret. It rely States that                      welfare
rises if the loss in welfare due to higher prices falls short of the

revenue extracted by the tax.                  As the magnitude of both these terms is

independent of 0 , the effect on a given conser may                       be   blown up by

the ni.miber of constaers served (1 —                P(8*))   .   What is different about

this result from the standard results on incidence of a tax, is that the

incidence is identified with the distribution of the characteristic 0

The parameter 8 is often thought of as being associated with income.

The distribution of 0 might                thus    be thought to be related to the

Pareto or log—normal distributions. f(8*) would then be positive if

8*   was relatively low. This interpretation of 8 would suggest that

using a specific tax on a foreign monopolist who produces a range of

qualities, and serves most            of   the population would be beneficial, while

taxing a monopolist serving the upper end                 of the market would     not.
        The effects of    a tariff        on   welfare are less clear—cut. The welfare
function    is given by:

                                      Oi
(4.5)                    W(t) —       f        [s(8) + tp*(8)]f(8)dO
                                     8*(t)

                                 —    f        [u(8,q*(e,t)) — (lt)p*(8,t)]f(0)d8
                                     0*(t)


Using equation (3.5) and integrating the second term by parts gives


                   ei
(4.6)     W(t) —   f     {[8t   4-                                   + tg(q*(8,t))} f(8)dO
                8*(t)
                                          —25—

Notice that    W   depends on t in three ways.            First, there     is the

direct effect of t ;        second, there is the effect via changes           in
q (8,t) induced by changes in t ; and last, the effect via                   8*(t)
Differentiating (4.6) gives

the expression is the direct effect on welfare            via   the ad—valorem

tariff t •    It   is positive as z(e)       can be replaced by i(O)           in   the

above integral by using Leia 2.3 and Theor 2.2. As v(8) is non-

negative for all 8 greater than or equal to O*(t) ,               the     first term in

the above expression must be positive. The second term in the expres-

sion is the effect of welfare via induced changes in q(O,t) of an

increase in t , and is negative as q falls as it rises, The third

term is the effect on welfare via the change in the market served. This

is again negative. The overall effect is ambiguous.

                                   Conclusion

     Although the effects of trade restrictions with endogenous quality
have been previously studied, the specification of the structures
analyzed have been particularly suited to the paradigm of perfect
competition.
     In   an iAperfecCly competitive world, a large number of questions

arise which do not have corresponding analogues in a competitive world.

In order to study such questions, it is important to develop simple

models to capture, possible in isolation, the factors which might   be
important in answering such questions. This paper is to be viewed as

an attempt at doing just   this.
     This paper analyzed the effect of trade restrictions on the product

line. A nopolist who produces a line of products will price them jointly

so as to extract the maximum profit from the whole market. He will be

limited in how much surplus he can extract, by the fact that he cannot

perfectly price discriminate since he cannot identify consumers by their

"types"

     In this paper I have tried to see whether the analysis of a simple

model, capturing this stylized fact, leads to any predictions about the

behavior of such a foreign monopolist when faced with a specific or ad—

valorem tariff, and what policy prescriptions might be derived for such

situations.

     However, to the extent that variety is expensive, a producer would

try and target a product to groups of consumers as discussed in Krishna

1984. As shown there, protection has different effects on such a model.
                                   —27 —




Future   research might be directed to analyzing such questions in less
simple market structures, and in a unified framework where the existence
of product sped.fic fixed costs would limit the number of products offered.

       (1)   The monopolist assigns a lower quality to each type of
             conster served in both markets,
       (2)   The same quality is assigned in both markets to the                      consner

             of type 8ii
       (3) The monopolist serves a smaller market than under conpetition.


Proof: (This uses the characterization of the monopoly solution pro-

vided in Theorem 2.2, by setting t                m — 0    .)




       (1)   The competitive quality assignment is given by qC(6) , and

 the lowest 8 served by O .               These are defined by


                    ehe(qC(e)) + g?(qC(9)) —             c(qC(8))         0


 and

              8h(q (0 ))    + g(q (9 )) — c(q       (9    ))    — V(0 )       0

 respectively. (V(0) = V(0,qC(8)) jq the surolus of the consumer of
 type 0 under competition.) The quality assignments under monopoly are
 the solutions q*(0) ,       9*   , to:


                  i(e)h'(q*(O)) + g(q*(8)) — c'(q*(O))                        0

 and
              (O'h(q*(8) + g(q*(0*)) — c(q*(8*))                   v(8*)          0
                                                       — 29 —




v(8)   is defined in the text.                        v(0,q) =      (0)h(q)        + g(q) —    c(q)   and

v(o,q*(o))         =       v(8)    is its   value     fi.niction. Notice that by definition,

z(0)     0 .           Also,      note that as         (8) consists of increasing segments

of z(0)        ,           connected by flat portions, z(8)                    0 .     This,    combined

with the definitions of qc(e),q*(e) together with the asst.nnptions made

in Theorems 2.1, 2.2 on the concavity of v(e,q) in q for all 8 proves (1).

         (2) Note that for 8 close to 81, z'(8) must be positive.

This means that L(*) is convex about i = 1                                 .   Therefore,
t'(p)        L'(p) around                i, — 1   ,    and   80 (8) z(0) for 0 close
to 01 .        But as 0 gets close to 1 z(0) approaches 8                                       •     As

z(0) ( i(0)                 8     for   all 8 close to 6i ,                i(0)      must approach 8
as well. This, combined with                       the     definition of q*(8)            qC(0)
proves (2).


       (3)     If we show:

                                         V(OC) B 0 B>        v(05     < 0,

Then 6C            8* and (3) is true.


                                — 0%(qC(8C)) + g(qC(8C) — c(qC(OC)) = 0

As     V(85        is the maximized value of V(OC,q)
                       C           C          * C
                   0   h(q*(e ))        + g(q (8      ))   — c(q*(6   ))       0

As   (8C)

                (85h(q*(05) + g(q*(e*)) — c(q*(85)                                 0

Hence,         V(8C) < 0

           See kander      and Spencer (1982) on this possibility as   well   as
Dixit (1983) for a discusøion of recent work on trade policy in oligopo—
listic markets.


       The tendency is for the monopolist to produce lower quality goods,
       2

compared to competition so as to extract more surplus from consi.ers who
have greater willingness to pay. lips (1983, pp. 215—216) points out
that   the idea is not a new one:


       As for the relationship between quality choices and price
       discrimination, I know of only three references.    The first
       one is a fascinating remark made by IXipuit in his discussion of
       railroad tariffs for passenger traffic. The following excerpt,
       taken from Ekelund, introduces the idea of a reduction in
       quality (of the lower—quality goods) as a market segmentation
       technique:

             It is not because of the few thousand francs which would
             have to be spent to put a roof over the third—class
             carriages or to upholster the third—class seats that
             some company or other has open carriages with wooden
             benches... What the company is trying to do is to prevent
             the passengers who can pay the second—class fare from
             traveling third—class; it hits the poor, not because      it
             wants   to   hurt them, but to frighten the rich... And it
             isagain for the seme reason that the companies, having
            proved almost cruel to third—class passengers and mean to
            second—class one, become lavish in dealing with first—
           class passengers. Raving refused the poor what is
           necessary, they give the rich what is superfluous. [1979,
           p. 275]

       Dupuit     did not work out an analytical solution to the problen,
       nor   did Ekelund."
           Later work includes that of Maskin and Riley (1982) who point out
the similarities in various adverse selection problems.

         A special case     of this ight be when

                   h(q)e   + g(q) —   (aj   + b1q) + (a2 + b2q)e

so that the functions h(q), g(q) are linear. The specification I use
is not really much more general as the curvature of h(q) is limited by
se'cond order conditions to be fairly small. !bwever, this specification
is used as it is notationally more convenient, and is slightly more
general. P&issa and Rosen assiane that u(e ,q) —

     S
         If    g and h are linear this condition is automatically met.
This condition restricts the curvature of h(q)            ,   and this is why the
specification is not really much more general than that of Mussa and
Rosen.
