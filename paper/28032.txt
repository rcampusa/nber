                                          ABSTRACT

Enacted March 27, 2020, the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was the most ambitious and
creative fiscal policy response to the Pandemic Recession in the United States. PPP offers
forgivable loans — essentially grants — to businesses with 500 or fewer employees that meet
certain requirements. In this paper, we present evidence that PPP has substantially increased the
employment, financial health, and survival of small businesses, using data from the Dun &
Bradstreet Corporation. We use event studies and standard difference-in-difference models to
estimate the effect of a small business applying for larger PPP loans and of a small business being
eligible for PPP based on size. While our findings are informative, we believe it is too early to
issue conclusive judgment on PPP’s success. We offer lessons for the future from the PPP
experience thus far.

1. Introduction
       The Paycheck Protection Program was the most ambitious and creative — and,
potentially, the most important — fiscal policy response to the Pandemic Recession in the United
States. With a $669 billion budget, the program is the largest single component of the nation’s
fiscal policy response to the crisis, and by itself approaches the total amount spent by Congress
on the 2009 Recovery Act response to the Great Recession.
       It was enacted on March 27, 2020, as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic
Security (CARES) Act, the $1.8-trillion “Phase 3” response to the pandemic crisis. An entirely
new program, it began issuing loans seven days later, on April 3. It offers forgivable loans —
essentially, grants — to businesses with 500 or fewer employees that meet certain requirements,
including maintaining employment at pre-pandemic levels.
       Has it succeeded? In this paper, we present evidence that PPP has substantially increased
the employment, financial health, and survival of small businesses. In addition, we find that the
effect of PPP on small business outcomes is increasing over time, with larger effects in August
than in April or May. We also find some evidence to suggest that PPP was most effective for
relatively smaller firms. We use data from the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation for our analysis,
employing standard difference-in-difference models to estimate the effects of a small business
applying for a PPP loan of greater than $150,000 (we only observe PPP applications for loans of
that size) and of a small business being eligible for PPP based on size, and using event studies to
trace the dynamic effects of PPP.
       Despite this finding, our ultimate conclusion is that it is too early to issue any definitive
judgment on PPP’s success. The program had important short-run goals, to be sure. These
include supporting employment and replacing worker wages, maintaining worker-firm
attachments, boosting consumer spending, and ensuring small business continuity during the
shutdown. But the program had important medium-run goals, as well, including preventing a
wave of bankruptcies once the economy partially reopened, increasing productivity by
preserving firm-specific human capital, worker-firm matches, and networks, and helping the
economy recover faster by keeping workers off the unemployment rolls. Our data run through
August, and we cannot adequately investigate any of these outcomes. The effects of PPP are
unfolding, and it will be particularly important to see what happens to businesses that received
PPP and the workers they employ once they have exhausted their forgivable loan.
         PPP is a novel program, and many standard intuitions about fiscal policy do not apply to
it. It was not a stimulus program in the sense that its purpose was not to ‘stimulate’ the economy;
that is, it is not a program calling for a measure of the multiplier. Instead, its purpose was to
preserve the productive capacity of the small-business sector and to shorten the transition to a
new, post-virus equilibrium by supporting labor demand over the medium term, allowing for a
more rapid economic recovery. It was not a jobs program in the sense that its goal was not
exclusively to preserve employment. Instead, its goals were to maintain worker-firm
attachments, particularly during the shutdown, and to ensure small business continuity. It
intentionally did not attempt to exclude inframarginal recipients because the unique
circumstances under which it was enacted made this impractical. In the early days of the
shutdown, how could the government have known which firms were inframarginal? And given
the numerous goals of the program, it’s not clear how ‘marginal’ would be defined in this
context. These design features affect intuitive measures of ‘cost per job saved,’ as we describe
later.
         In this paper, we discuss the need for, goals of, and key design features in a small
business revenue replacement program (Section 3). We then describe PPP, and contrast select
features of the program to what we view as the best design (Section 4). We discuss the program’s
implementation challenges — extensively covered in the press — and offer qualitative analysis
of PPP (Section 5). In Section 6, we present our empirical analysis of PPP. In Section 7, we offer
a retrospective and discuss lessons for the future.


2. The Pandemic Recession and Potential Policy Responses
         The Pandemic Recession is remarkable in both its suddenness and depth. In the week
ending March 14, 2020, there were 282,000 initial claims for unemployment insurance benefits,
about one-third higher than the average number of new claims over the preceding three months.
The next week, there were 3.3 million initial claims, shattering the previous record of 695,000
new claims, set in October 1982. The week after that, ending on March 28, there were 6.9
million initial claims. At the time of this writing, there are still well over 800,000 new claims
each week.
         The unemployment rate in February 2020 was 3.5 percent. In March, the first month of
the Pandemic Recession, it stood at 4.4 percent. In April, it hit its peak of 14.7 percent, the
highest rate since the Great Depression. 1 In two months, the official unemployment rate
increased by a factor of four. For comparison, during the Great Recession it took nearly two
years for the unemployment rate to double, from five percent when the recession began in
December 2007 to its peak of 10 percent in October 2009.2
         The pandemic’s economic devastation extended beyond the labor market. Real GDP
contracted at a 31.4 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 2020. Using the same measure,
the worst quarter in the Great Recession saw an 8.4 percent decline, and the only quarter since
the Great Depression to register a double-digit contraction was 1958 Q1, at 10 percent. Relative
to the same quarter one year prior, 2020 Q1 real GDP contracted by nine percent. The peak
contraction using this metric in the Great Recession was 2008 Q3’s 3.9 percent.
         In a situation like this, there are standard roles for monetary policy and social insurance
and safety net programs. It is even straightforward to execute lending programs to large
businesses.
         But policy to support small and mid-size businesses is less straightforward to formulate.
The need for a prolonged shutdown made interruption loans for such businesses inadequate to
policymakers’ goals of supporting employment and ensuring small business continuity. And
even with a more conventional loan many businesses would likely not be able to survive. Firms
needed more equity to shore up weakening balance sheets and replace lost cash flows and many
businesses would not be interested in adding to debt burdens in any case. Equity injections were
not implementable for many firms of this size, and operationalizing a program based on them
would be extremely difficult to do in the time needed. But a revenue-replacement program for
small business would achieve the policy goal.




3. A Small Business Revenue-Replacement Program 3


1
  The official unemployment rate reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for April 2020 was 14.7 percent. The
household survey on which the unemployment rate is calculated showed a large increase in the number of
respondents who were classified as employed but absent from work. Most of these responses should have been
classified as unemployed on temporary layoff. Incorporating this change, the actual unemployment rate for April
was likely 19.5 percent.

  For research on the labor market effects of the pandemic, see Bartik, et al. (2020), Coibion, et al. (2020), Goolsbee
and Syverson (2020), and Kahn, et al. (2020).
3
  This section draws on Hubbard and Strain (2020) and Strain (2020).
        The goals of a small business revenue replacement program are twofold: to ensure small
business continuity and prevent a cascade of small business failures, and to preserve existing
employment relationships while shelter-in-place orders are in effect. We offer our analysis of
some key program design features to achieve these goals. We also address moral hazard
concerns, and briefly review programs enacted by other major economies.
3.1. The need to replace small business revenue
       The pandemic itself can be thought of as a large shock to aggregate supply: Businesses
could no longer produce goods and services because workers could not safely go to work. The
inability of workers to work caused downstream supply chain disruptions, as well.
       Shelter-in-place orders ameliorated the supply shock by reducing the spread of the
coronavirus. The catch is that these policies led to a precipitous drop in aggregate demand,
including labor demand (Kahn, et al., 2020) as businesses were temporarily closed and workers
lost jobs, faced hours reductions, and experienced nominal wage cuts (Cajner, et al., 2020). In
the private economy, workers faced a large reduction in earned income and businesses lost
revenue.
       The sharp and sudden nature of the Pandemic Recession left smaller services-sector firms
particularly at risk. Unlike larger businesses, these firms could not readily access capital markets
to shore up their balance sheets. Capital-market imperfections link equity contractions to
business fluctuations, and these firms were particularly vulnerable to a lack of collateralizable
net worth (e.g., Gertler and Hubbard, 1989). Small and mid-size businesses generally do not
have diversified revenue streams, as well. And they have limited cash holdings. Only half of
small businesses hold cash reserves sufficient to cover 15 days, and only four in 10 have a three-
week cash buffer (JP Morgan Chase Institute, 2019).
       And unlike manufacturing firms, services businesses would not return to partial
operations following the lockdowns with a backlog of orders. Nearly all of the revenue they lost
during the lockdowns was lost forever — for example, diners did not eat twice as many meals in
May and June because restaurants were shut in March and April.
       To summarize, the economy was at risk of a cascade of small business bankruptcies.
Small businesses play a critical role in the economy. Firms with fewer than 500 employees
account for 47 percent of private sector employees and 41 percent of private sector payroll.
There are 30.7 million such businesses, 19 percent of which have paid employees (Small
Business Administration, 2019). A wave of small business failures could have created an
aggregate demand doom loop, in which declining incomes and employment opportunities
reinforced each other.
        One way to address this concern would have been to lift lockdown orders. But the public
health effects of the virus and concern workers had about getting sick make this option
unattractive to many policymakers. For a short, temporary shutdown, replacing a large fraction
of the revenue businesses would have generated in normal times would go a long way toward
preventing a cascade of bankruptcies and a reinforcing cycle of declining incomes and job
opportunities.
3.2. Goals, cost, and key design features
        The specific goals of such a program are to ensure small business continuity and prevent
a wave of bankruptcies and, during the period of the shutdown, to preserve employment
relationships. The overarching objective is to preserve as much of the productive capacity of the
economy as possible while short-term shelter-in-place orders are in place, and to help the
economy transition quickly to a new, post-shutdown equilibrium by supporting labor demand
over the medium term.
        For firms, preventing wasteful liquidations allows the black box of productive
technologies and business relationships to remain intact. Professional networks are preserved,
relationships with suppliers and customers are maintained, and knowledge of local conditions
and preferences can continue to be put to productive use. For workers, the value of firm-specific
human capital is maintained, and maintaining employment relationships means they continue to
be paid by their employer, and they are in a position to return to work immediately once shelter-
in-place orders are lifted. No separation takes place, even a temporary furlough of workers. For
both workers and firms, productivity enhancing worker-firm matches are maintained. And the
economy is in a position to snap back quickly because labor demand has been supported. 4



4
  Papers that discuss the role of worker-firm matches include Mortensen and Pissarides (1999) and Davis and von
Wachter (2011). Jackson (2013) measures match quality directly in the context of schools, estimating teacher,
school, and match productivity on student outcomes. He finds that teacher-school (worker-firm) match effects are
important, estimating that a one standard deviation increase in match quality increases math scores by an amount
roughly equal to two-thirds of the effect of a one standard deviation increase in teacher quality. Using linked
worker-firm data, Farooq, Kugler, and Muratori (2020) document an important role for match quality, and find that
more generous unemployment insurance benefits leads to higher quality matches. In our context, match quality
likely matters the most for larger PPP-eligible firms.
       This observation is especially true in a lockdown because the risk of mass closures is so
real. Without a program to support small business continuity, a wave of closures would be
followed by a period in which new businesses started. Eventually, the economy would reach a
new equilibrium. But during the transition, labor demand would be depressed because there
would be fewer businesses looking for workers, which would lead to lengthy spells of
unemployment for millions of workers and a slower and more sluggish recovery.
       If the (aggregate, present discounted value of) social benefits of these businesses exceeds
their (aggregate, present discounted value of) costs, then a subsidy is justified under standard
economic logic. The possibility of an aggregate demand doom loop and the lengthy period of
high-unemployment it would cause would increase the size of the optimal subsidy.
       Once lockdown orders are lifted, partial revenue replacement may still be needed to
achieve the policy goals of the program. But it is no longer necessary to compel firms to
maintain pre-lockdown employment relationships or employment levels. After the economy has
partially reopened, this requirement would introduce frictions into the process of reallocating
labor (and capital) to its post-lockdown most productive use, and would slow the process of
firms reorganizing their post-lockdown production functions, working against the key overall
goal of a revenue-replacement program: ensuring small business continuity.
       There is an inherent tension between a revenue-replacement program’s goal of
maintaining employment relationships and keeping firms in business and the goal of efficiently
reallocating factor inputs and swiftly transitioning to a new, post-lockdown equilibrium. But for
the reason we discussed earlier, there is less to this tension than meets the eye in this case. A
revenue-replacement program allows that transition to happen faster by preserving many
otherwise-viable firms during the shutdown. Once the economy has partially reopened, severing
the link between program participation and maintain pre-virus employment levels is critical to
minimizing this tension. A revenue-replacement program may also keep some business afloat
that would have shut down in the absence of the pandemic. Presumably most businesses that
were not viable prior to the pandemic will remain unviable once the revenue-replacement
program has ended.
       These considerations suggest that a focus on revenue, not simply on payroll costs, would
be most effective in achieving the policy goals of the program. A separate reason to focus on
revenue rather than narrowly focusing on payroll costs is that non-payroll expenses, like rent in
many cities, are significant. A program replacing payroll costs, but not overall revenue, may not
be sufficient to keep many businesses in high-rent cities from closing.
        Replacing small business revenue is an expensive proposition. Hubbard and Strain (2020)
estimate that replacing 80 percent of revenue for 12 weeks for service-sector businesses — that
is, for businesses in industries other than manufacturing, finance and insurance, health care, and
educational services — with fewer than 500 employees would cost $1.2 trillion.
        Expensive as such an intervention is, the counterfactual would be even costlier, with
cascading business failures, wasteful liquidations, plunging incomes, soaring unemployment, and
little prospect for a rapid recovery because of the devastating effects on the small business
ecosystem. Another budgetary consideration is the offsetting effects of less use of social
insurance programs, like Unemployment Insurance, and safety net programs, like food stamps.
        So far, our discussion of a small business revenue-replacement program has been general,
and could be applied to any situation in which small, services-sector businesses needed to shut
down for a period of several weeks. A key feature of the Pandemic Recession is that such a
program did not exist, and Congress wanted to stand one up quickly. Given this context,
Congress chose to rely on the existing relationships many small businesses have (via checking
accounts or loans) with commercial banks rather than to have had the government attempt to
stand up an entirely new direct transfer program.
        The way to get money into business accounts as quickly as possible was for the
government to have treated the banks essentially as conduits. Of course, such an approach
requires convincing banks that they will be held harmless in the event of borrower
misrepresentation, both by the current administration and by future administrations. Strong
assurances are necessary. 5
        By structuring the revenue-replacement grants as loans that are forgivable if certain
conditions are met, the program would align with an equity infusion. By backing the loans and
allowing banks to charge fees, the government would encourage banks to participate.


5
  Prior to the 2008 financial crisis, large U.S. banks routinely made Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans
designed to help first-time home buyers and buyers with relatively poor credit purchase houses. To reach these
borrowers, the government encouraged lax lending standards. This policy shift contributed to the housing bubble,
and FHA’s solvency was in question following the crash. The government imposed fines on banks, arguing they did
not adhere to FHA underwriting standards. The revenues from the fines helped to shore up FHA. This episode has
left many large banks skittish about using anything but strict underwriting standards as part of government lending
programs.
         The pandemic shutdown’s adverse consequences for firms’ collateralizable net worth and
cash flows require equity contributions to keep them afloat. A lending program would result in
more layoffs by firms that would be averse to taking on more debt. This would be particularly
common in the services sector because revenue losses would often be permanent. Even if debt
service could be deferred for a period of one or two years, many would be reluctant to take out a
loan. 6 These businesses often have low profit margins, and a loan program would likely have had
an insufficient take-up rate to meet policymakers’ objectives. 7
         It would be difficult for this program to be targeted based on need. In the fog-of-war
atmosphere of the pandemic, policymakers have limited knowledge of the virus’s spread, and
crafting an effective triggering mechanism based on public-health metrics is difficult.
         At the beginning of a sudden and unexpected lockdown, demonstrations of hardship or
need would significantly slow down the process of getting funds to businesses, putting the
effectiveness of the program in jeopardy. Once the economy partially reopens, it can be argued
that revenue tests target assistance on firms that need it most, as measured by revenue loss
relative to normal circumstances. On the other hand, forward-looking revenue tests serve as a
disincentive to earn revenue by imposing implicit marginal tax rates on revenue. Backward-
looking revenue tests avoid this disincentive, but are less generous to otherwise identical firms
that are doing better adjusting to the post-lockdown economic circumstances.
         The main appeal of revenue tests and hardship demonstrations are lower program costs
and targeting aid based on “need.” The problem is that need is an amorphous concept in a
partially reopened economy, and revenue tests bring their own problems. A targeting strategy
that is broad-based, focusing on a large class of firms defined by size and industry type, avoids
these issues.
3.3. Addressing moral hazard concerns
         A program that replaces revenue for small businesses for a period of time is an
extraordinary government intervention in the private economy. It is reasonable to be concerned



6
  For a proposal that argues in favor of lending programs, see Ozimek and Lettieri (2020). Hanson, et al. (2020a)
argue for equity-like arrangements and grants to support small business. Hanson, et al. (2020b) argues for payment
assistance to impacted businesses to meet recurring fixed obligations (e.g., interest, rent, and utilities) during the
health emergency.
7
  At the time of this writing, the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Facility has very few loans, suggesting that
even among mid-size business taking out debt under non-borrower-friendly terms is not an attractive prospect.
that such a program would lead to excessive risk taking or other imprudent behavior on the part
of firms by potentially creating the perception of a government “business revenue safety net.”
        In normal public programs under normal circumstances, this concern is certainly real. But
in this instance, we are much less concerned about moral hazard. The need to shut down large
segments of the economy will occur infrequently, and without advance notice. Businesses cannot
purchase shutdown insurance from private firms in the way they can insure against risks from
fires and floods. If the government communicates the extraordinary nature of the assistance is
driven by the extraordinary nature of the threat, then that would mitigate moral hazard concerns.
3.4. Policy response in other OECD nations
        Before turning to the Paycheck Protection Program, we briefly discuss programs enacted
by member countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
during the Pandemic Recession. See Table A1 for specific program descriptions and parameters
for OECD countries.
        Many European nations relied on a version of a wage subsidy scheme in which workers
saw their hours and pay reduced and their government picked up a large part of the cost of
employing them. 8 This type of program was used by Germany (Kuzarbeit, or short-term work)
during the Great Recession, and is widely credited with keeping the German unemployment rate
down during that period. The way it often worked was that firms paid the benefit to their
workers, which was typically somewhat lower than wages, and the government reimbursed the
firm (Blanchard, et al., 2020). Austria implemented a similar program during the pandemic,
replacing up to 90 percent of covered wages.
        A few examples: In the United Kingdom, the government reimbursed firms for 80
percent of the wages of furloughed workers. Germany covered 60 percent of wages for childless
workers on furlough and 67 percent for furloughed workers with children. Depending on the
month, the government of France covered 84 percent, or 71 percent (as of June) of wages for
workers on temporary layoff. Notably, these countries did not condition eligibility based on firm
size, in contrast to the U.S. emphasis on small and mid-size firms. Some European economies
conditioned subsidies on a demonstration of a significant decline in revenue (e.g., the


8
  Hamilton and Veuger (2020) argue that large expenditures to address the pandemic will heighten concern about the
public finances of some European Union member states, implying that a broader, European approach to fiscal policy
is necessary. They suggest that the eurozone issue Eurobonds to placate markets and to avoid issues associated with
sovereign debt overhang.
Netherlands, Estonia, and the Slovak Republic). Slovenia emphasized state-funded bonuses for
‘hazard pay’ in certain sectors.
         These programs are similar to what we describe above. They maintain the worker-firm
relationship during the shutdown period, making it easier for workers, firms, and the economy to
recovery quickly once economic activity partially resumes. Keeping workers paid by the firms
also allows government assistance to reach workers quickly. They are similar to standard
unemployment insurance in that the government is helping support the incomes of workers who
are underemployed, but unlike standard unemployment insurance, they allow for part-time work.
         At the same time, European programs have been more focused on supporting workers in
their current employment matches, rather than smoothing a transition toward different
employment matches. Programs generally permitted workers receiving nonwork or part-time
work benefits to remain attached to the firm. As with the U.S. Paycheck Protection Program, the
state effectively assumed a portion of payroll costs for covered workers, albeit through payments
made to firms. 9 The U.S. program formally worked as a combination of loans and outright grants
to firms and wage subsidies. As we describe later, a number of administrative challenges were
‘unforced errors’ in its implementation.
         While some European pandemic unemployment or wage subsidy schemes have faced
fewer administrative challenges than in the United States, they still raise concerns (to which we
return later). Importantly, they were and are designed to maintain employment relationships in a
temporary cyclical downturn (e.g., a moderate and short recession or a short pandemic
shutdown). In a ‘reopening’ of the economy, policy shifts would be needed to focus on rehiring
workers and worker transitions by gradually reducing wage subsidies and the generosity of
unemployment benefits.
         Employment policy responses in OECD countries outside Europe during the pandemic
have been varied. Canada, for example, focused on rehiring workers previous laid off due to the
COVID-19 experience, with subsidies of up to 75 percent of all covered wages. Israel relied on
relaxing requirements for unemployment benefits, direct and government-guaranteed loans to
business of all size, special support for high-risk businesses, grants for small businesses, and a


9
  Norway relied on layoffs, making it easier for firms to use temporary layoffs and increasing the generosity of
unemployment benefits for workers. Norway also instituted a new compensation scheme for businesses that
subsidized fixed costs. Alstadsæter, et al. (2020) find that this program reduced firms’ economic distress by a
similar magnitude to PPP by reducing the negative effects of the crisis on profitability, liquidity, debt, and solvency.
variety of measures to reduce the short-term burden of business taxes. Australia, like large
European economies, implemented a wage subsidy for firms’ retention of employees. Japan
financed wage subsidies for retained workers, but only for small and mid-sized firms. South
Korea increased worker retention subsidies to up to 90 percent of covered wages for three
months for all employers. A less generous subsidy to wages was provided in South Africa for
firms whose operations were at least partially curtailed as a consequence of the COVID-19
pandemic. In Latin America, Chile provided partial support for wage declines, and Colombia
assisted workers in firms with significant revenue declines with support of 40 percent of the
minimum wage.


4. The Paycheck Protection Program
         The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security Act (CARES Act), the $1.8-trillion “Phase 3” economic recovery package
passed by Congress and signed into law on March 27, 2020. In this section, we outline the
statutory design of PPP, the program’s implementation by the Department of the Treasury and
Small Business Administration, and differences between PPP and the features of a small business
revenue-replacement program we discussed in the previous section.
4.1. PPP’s design
         PPP is a forgivable loan program. Businesses or nonprofits with 500 or fewer employees;
sole proprietors, independent contractors, or self-employed individuals; and small businesses,
501(c)(19) veterans organizations, or Tribal business concerns that otherwise meet SBA’s size
standards are eligible. Businesses in the accommodation and food services sector (NAICS code
72) may apply the 500-employee rule to each physical location, not to the corporation as a
whole. Congress appropriated $349 billion for PPP in the CARES Act.
         Under the program, businesses can borrow up to 2.5 times their average monthly payroll
costs, capped at $10 million. Loans are issued by banks and are guaranteed by the government. 10
The amount of the loan spent on payroll costs (including benefits), rent, utilities, and mortgage
interest during the 24-week period (originally eight-week period) after the loan is originated is

10
  FinTech played an important role, as well. Erel and Liebersohn (2020) study the response of FinTech to demand
for financial services created by PPP. They find that FinTech was disproportionately used in ZIP codes with fewer
bank branches, lower incomes, larger minority share of the population, in industries with less ex ante small business
lending, and in counties where the economic effect of the pandemic were more severe.
forgiven — i.e., it is converted to a grant — provided that 60 percent (originally 75 percent) of
the amount forgiven is spent on payroll (a Treasury/SBA regulation not found in the CARES
Act) and the business does not reduce headcount relative to pre-crisis levels and does not reduce
any employee’s compensation by more than 25 percent of his or her pre-crisis level. If headcount
or compensation are reduced beyond those parameters, the amount of the loan forgiven may be
reduced proportionately under some (but not all) circumstances. PPP encouraged businesses that
had already laid off workers due to the pandemic to rehire them quickly without penalty. 11
         Borrowers do not need to demonstrate hardship in order to qualify for a forgivable loan,
which streamlines the process and allows banks to get money to businesses quickly. Instead, they
need to offer a series of good-faith certifications, including: “Current economic uncertainty
makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the Applicant.” 12
Borrowers must also certify that the business intends to use the funds received for payroll and
other operating expenses and that they are not applying for a duplicative loan. For a loan to be
forgiven, in some cases, businesses may need to present documentation to lenders demonstrating
that they complied with the terms of the loan. In other cases, businesses simply need to attest to
this.
         To get funds to businesses quickly, PPP delegates authority to lenders to determine
borrower eligibility. By the PPP’s structure, lenders do not need to assess the ability of the
borrower to repay the loan. No collateral or personal guarantees from borrowers are required,


11
   Rules for loan forgiveness and for loan forgiveness reduction have been evolving. We describe guidance at the
time of this writing in more detail here. Loans can be fully forgiven if loan proceeds are spent and qualifying costs
are incurred during the covered period of the loan, which begins when the loan is disbursed (or during an alternative
covered period, depending on how the borrower manages payroll); at least 60 percent of the loan amount (originally
75 percent) was used on payroll costs; and staffing and compensation levels are maintained in the covered period
relative to the reference period. The covered period is 24 weeks for loans made after June 5, 2020. For loans made
before June 5, 2020, borrowers can choose between a 24-week or eight-week covered period. Borrowers can choose
one of two reference periods: February 15, 2019 to June 30, 2019, or January 1, 2020 to February 29, 2020.
(Seasonal employers have different rules.) PPP also includes a safe harbor provision that allows borrowers to avoid
loan forgiveness reductions due to decreases in headcount or compensation that occurred between February 15, 2020
and April 26, 2020, provided that headcount and compensation are restored by December 31, 2020 (originally June
30, 2020). Loan forgiveness will also not be reduced if borrowers issue written offers to rehire workers who were
employed on February 15, 2020, and those offers are not accepted, or if borrowers document an inability to rehire
similarly qualified workers for vacancies as of December 31, 2020. Loan forgiveness will not be reduced if
borrowers cannot maintain employment levels due to an inability to return to the same level of business as of
February 15, 2020 because they are complying with coronavirus-related guidance for social distancing, sanitation, or
worker or customer safety requirements from various federal agencies and departments between March 1, 2020 and
December 31, 2020. On October 8, Treasury/SBA issued additional guidance that exempted borrowers with loans
under $50,001 from any loan-forgiveness reductions based on failing to maintain headcount or wages.

and no credit-elsewhere tests are applied. Lenders simply need to establish that a business was
operational on February 15, 2020 and verify its payroll.
       To entice banks to participate, the program allowed them to charge generous fees — five
percent of principal on loans up to $350,000, three percent on loans between $350,000 and $2
million, and one percent on loans above $2 million up to $10 million. Lenders can charge an
interest rate of one percent on the portion of the loan that is not eligible for forgiveness, and
loans have zero weight in banks’ capital requirements. In the statute, lenders are “held harmless”
in the event of borrower misrepresentation, but Treasury/SBA did not waive requirements under
the Bank Secrecy Act and required anti-money-laundering compliance programs.
       The Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act was signed into law
on April 24, 2020, and increased PPP funding by $320 billion. The Paycheck Protection Program
Flexibility Act (PPPFA) was signed into law on June 5, 2020. The covered period of the
forgivable loan was extended from eight weeks to 24 weeks (or until December 31, 2020).
PPPFA also allowed businesses to spend 40 percent of forgivable funds on non-payroll expenses,
rather than the 25 percent previously established by Treasury/SBA regulation. The maturity of
the loans was increased from two years to five years for loans issued after June 5.
4.2. Design concerns
       On the whole, PPP’s design corresponds to the objectives for financing during a short-
term shutdown we described earlier. It was able to get an astonishing amount of money to
millions of small businesses very quickly. It relied on (what are essentially) grants and not loans.
It took measures to encourage banks to participate. It avoided revenue tests and it did not target
select industries. Its goals were ensuring small business continuity and preserving employment
relationships.
       But four design elements deviated from what we described previously. First, PPP was
heavily focused on payroll expenses. Second, the program was designed with a short lockdown
period in mind. This approach was driven by the widely held expectations about the course of the
pandemic in early March, and to some extent was addressed by PPPFA modifications to the
program. Even still, the program was relatively inflexible post-lockdown with respect to
allowing labor to be reallocated across firms and industries, a problem given a longer period of
partial shutdown. PPP contains incentives that work against this needed reallocation.
        Third, PPP’s original CARES Act appropriation of $349 billion quickly proved
inadequate to the program’s demand, and Treasury’s inability to adequately convince banks that
they would be held harmless in the event of borrower misrepresentation hampered its execution.
These led to the reality and public perception that PPP funds were flowing to relatively better-
resourced and less-vulnerable small and mid-size businesses.
        Finally, Hubbard and Strain (2020) estimated that the PPP’s original goals would require
around $1 trillion. With only $349 billion originally appropriated for PPP — and the intense
demand for PPP loans in the early days of the program — a perception developed that only
businesses with preexisting relationships with participating lenders would be able to access the
program. Lenders, in a rush to process applications and out of concern that they would not be
held harmless in all circumstances, focused lending on existing bank customers.




5. Evaluating PPP: Program Statistics, Implementation Challenges, and
Existing Evidence
        In this section, we present basic statistics about PPP loans, and discuss implementation
challenges. We also review current empirical evidence on the effectiveness of PPP.
5.1. PPP program statistics
        Table 1 presents PPP program statistics. As of August 8, PPP had approved 5,212,128
loans representing a total of $525 billion provided by 5,460 lenders. The average loan size is
$101,000. The solid majority of program dollars were included in loans of less than $2 million,
and the overwhelming majority of loans were for less than that amount. Loans of over $2 million
represent 0.6 percent of all loans and 20 percent of all dollars loaned. In contrast, around 87
percent of all PPP loans were made for less than $150,000, and 28 percent of all funds loaned
were part of loans of less than that amount. Figure 1 shows loan counts and loan amounts over
time.
        Figures 1A and 1B show loan totals and loan amounts by state, respectively. Granja, et
al. (2020) study the targeting of these loans across geography, and do not find evidence that the
first round of PPP funds went to parts of the country that saw the largest declines in hours
worked or business shutdowns. Further research is needed to study the targeting of the full
program. We also note that the entire country was affected by shutdowns, and the degree to
which different states were affected by the pandemic varied at different times, particularly as the
nation entered the summer months. Figure 2A shows PPP loans by industry and employment
losses by industry.
5.2. Implementation challenges
         Table 2 presents a timeline of select PPP events, and includes some implementation
challenges. Before the program officially launched on April 3, banks and other industry
associations were warning of a chaotic beginning to the program, arguing that borrower
verification would be onerous and would hamper the government’s objective of getting money
into the economy quickly, and due to confusion about basic program requirements like how
lenders should calculate payroll costs. Due to confusion about the program, on the day it
launched only eight of the 25 largest SBA 7(a) lenders were taking applications.
         The early stage of PPP was also characterized by intense demand. By the end of its
second week, all $349 billion of CARES Act PPP appropriations had been exhausted. Thousands
of submitted applications remained unapproved. There were accusations that large banks violated
the first-come, first-served structure of the program to favor large borrowers.
         Articles in the press reported that some publicly traded companies or their subsidiaries
had received PPP loans. On April 23, SBA released guidance that publicly traded companies
would likely find it difficult to certify in good faith that they needed PPP loans. 13 Treasury/SBA
gave businesses until May 7 (later extended to May 14 14 and then May 18 15) to return PPP funds
without facing a penalty. On April 28, Treasury Secretary Mnuchin announced that a review of
PPP loans in excess of $2 million would take place. The Secretary warned of potential criminal
penalties for borrowers found to have misrepresented themselves or not to have complied with
the terms of the loan. 16 On May 13, SBA attempted to reassure borrowers and indicated that


13
   See question 31 in “Paycheck Protection Program Loans: Frequently Asked Questions,” last revised June 25,
2020: “[I]t is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able
to make the required certification [of economic need] in good faith, and such a company should be prepared to
demonstrate to SBA, upon request, the basis for its certification.”

   See question 47 in “Paycheck Protection Program Loans: Frequently Asked Questions,” last revised June 25,
2020.
16
   For example, Secretary Mnuchin made this statement on April 28 on CNBC: “I really fault the borrowers who
made these certifications. Now, there were some banks early on who put things up on their website and prioritized
their customers. We immediately told them that was wrong. They took it down. So, you know, I want to be very
clear: it’s the borrowers who have criminal liability if they made this certification and it’s not true. And as I said,
we’re going to do a full audit of every loan over $2 million. This was a program designed for small businesses, it
loans of less than $2 million would be assumed to have made certifications of need in good
faith. 17
            Confusion over eligibility for PPP loans, which borrowers would be audited, and under
what terms those audits would take place had a profound effect on the program.
            Figure 1 shows PPP loan counts and dollars loaned over time. During the period of
uncertainty discussed above, shown in the light- and dark-grey bars in Figure 1, the slope of both
lines flattened. Dollars loaned have increased more slowly since this period of Treasury-sown
confusion ended on May 18. New PPP loans continued to be made in the second half of May and
into June and July, but at a much slower rate than in April.
            Of course, implementation shortcomings were inevitable to some degree in standing up a
program as ambitious as PPP in a short period of time in the midst of a pandemic. But Treasury’s
muddled management of PPP’s implementation is noteworthy because of its failure to take
seriously the advice it was given by a range of private-sector participants and policy experts,
leading it to make mistakes that were both forecastable and forecasted.
5.3. Brief review of existing economic research on the PPP
            Study of the PPP by academic researchers is still in the working-paper stage, but some
notable findings exist that shed light on the early effects of the program. We briefly survey that
research below.
            Bartik, et al. (2020) study the original $349 billion of PPP funds. Using a survey of small
businesses, they find that PPP approval increased self-reported firm survival probability by 14 to
30 percentage points. They also find that banks allocated PPP funds to firms with higher PPP
treatment effects. But these firms were also more likely to have stronger connections to banks,
while firms with less cash-on-hand were less likely to have their applications approved. They
find that PPP had a positive but statistically insignificant impact on employment.




was not a program that was designed for public companies that had liquidity. Again, the certification was very clear
in saying that if people had other sources of liquidity, they could not take this loan.”
17
   See question 46 in “Paycheck Protection Program Loans: Frequently Asked Questions,” last revised June 25,
2020: “Any borrower that, together with its affiliates, received PPP loans with an original principal amount of less
than $2 million will be deemed to have made the required certification concerning the necessity of the loan request
in good faith.”
         Quite modest employment effects are also found by Chetty, et al. (2020), which analyzed
data from Earnin, a financial management application. 18 Granja, et al. (2020) also do not find
evidence that the first round of PPP had a substantial effect on employment, or on other local
economic outcomes. Bartik, et al. (2020) find that states that received more PPP loans and those
with more generous unemployment benefits had labor markets whose declines were relatively
less deep and whose recoveries were relatively more rapid. Chodorow-Reich, et al. (2020) find
that PPP relaxed liquidity constraints facing firms, allowing some firms to pay down existing
credit line balances.
         Autor, et al. (2020) use weekly data from Automatic Data Processing (ADP) payroll
records to study PPP’s effect on employment. Using a difference-in-differences event study
framework, they compare employment at firms above and below the 500-employee PPP
eligibility threshold. Through the first week of June, they find that PPP increased employment by
between two percent and 4.5 percent. After scaling by the take-up rate, they estimate PPP
increased aggregate payroll employment by 2.3 million workers, again through the first week of
June.
         Autor, et al. divide total program expenditures by their estimate of PPP’s effect on
aggregate employment and report a cost-per-job-supported estimate of around $224,000. The
paper notes that “while this is a substantial cost per job supported, it would be premature to offer
a cost-benefit analysis of the PPP at this time,” and points to the need to take a longer-term view
of PPP’s effects. We agree, and would add that a short-term cost-benefit analysis should include
other factors. For example, many workers who were kept on employer payrolls this spring would
likely have been receiving unemployment insurance benefits in the absence of PPP. A short-term
cost-benefit analysis should include cost savings from reducing the demand for social insurance
and safety net benefits.
         More fundamentally, we disagree with Autor, et al. in that we do not find cost per job
supported to be a sufficient statistic to assess PPP’s success. PPP is not exclusively a jobs
program, and any evaluation of its effectiveness per dollar of program expense — even a short-
run estimate — must include the benefit of preserving small businesses and employment



18
  Autor, et al. (2020) discuss limitations in the Chetty, et al. (2020) study, including that Earnin data are focused on
very low-wage workers, with median wages equal to roughly the 10th percentile of wages in their industry, and that
the absence of reported standard errors makes the Chetty results hard to interpret.
relationships holistically, including social benefits in excess of private benefits and the benefits
from hastening the economic recovery by supporting labor demand over the medium term.


6. Evaluating PPP: Empirical Analysis
       We evaluate the effects of PPP on the employment, financial health, and continuity of
small businesses. To do this, we use data from the Dun & Bradstreet Corporation, a company
that provides commercial data and analytics to businesses. We are able to identify businesses in
the D&B data that applied for PPP loans of $150,000 or more. We do not observe if those
companies received a loan, or the exact amount (above $150,000 or more) of any loan received.
We are not able to observe if a business applied for a PPP loan of less than $150,000.
Information on loan applications comes from SBA and is merged into the D&B data.
       We estimate standard difference-in-difference models of the effect of PPP application
and of PPP eligibility based on size. We use several treatment-control groups in our analysis. We
also estimate the dynamic effect of PPP application and eligibility using event studies. We find
evidence that PPP increased employment, financial health, and continuity. We also find that the
effect of PPP is unfolding, with effects on employment and financial health growing over time
and reaching their peak in August, the last month for which we have data. In this section, we
discuss the data, our methods, and these results in further detail.
6.1. Dun & Bradstreet
       D&B is a global data and analytics company whose clients are businesses. The company
was founded in 1841 as The Mercantile Agency, and became Dun & Bradstreet in 1933. It has
extensive coverage, with over 355 million business records and data curated from tens of
thousands of sources, including public registries, newspapers and websites, its own
investigations and telephone interviews, courts and legal filings, financial statements, insolvency
records, and its own network, making use of proprietary and publicly available information. It is
the world’s largest commercial database, and counts 90 percent of the Fortune 500 companies as
clients, along with every cabinet agency in the U.S. government.
       D&B is able to track whether businesses pay their bills on time through its relationships
with landlords, mortgage companies, credit card companies, office suppliers, and the like. Their
clients make use of D&B’s ability to predict whether a particular establishment might be
delinquent in order to help clients manage financial risk. D&B has significant reach. For
example, the U.S. government has historically required companies that want to receive federal
contracts to register with D&B, as does Apple for companies that want to distribute applications
through its App Store. The Food and Drug Administration uses a company’s D&B registration
number as a way to verify that importers of pharmaceutical products are legitimate businesses,
and to confirm that applicant contact information is accurate and complete.
6.2. Sample, variables, and descriptive statistics
       Our sample includes all establishments in the D&B database active as of October 2019
with one to 1,000 employees. We do not include sole proprietorships, establishments with zero
reported employees, establishments with missing state and industry codes, and establishments
with modeled employee counts. We assign each establishment to a business-size category (e.g.,
one to 500 employees, 501 to 1,000 employees) based on employment in February 2020. We
also stratify establishments based on whether they applied for a PPP loan worth $150,000 or
more. (We are only able to observe whether businesses applied for PPP loans of at least
$150,000.)
       Table 3 presents summary means and standard deviations for key variables and the
distribution of establishments over industry. Businesses that applied for a PPP loan of $150,000
or more are nearly three times as large as those that did not. This difference is likely due to the
relatively large size of the loan we are able to observe. Each group of businesses have
comparable Paydex scores (discussed below), and over the entire sample period establishments
with 501 to 1,000 employees are more likely to go out of business. The group least likely to go
out of business during the sample period are establishments that we observe have applied for
large PPP loans, and by a wide margin.
       Key variables for our analysis include PPP application (for loans of at least $150,000),
establishment employment, state, and industry. We use Dun & Bradstreet’s Paydex variable as
our measure of a business’s financial health. Paydex is an indicator based on whether and how a
business is paying its bills. Paydex ranges from zero to 100. A Paydex score of 80 denotes that
payments made to D&B have generally been made within the terms of the covered agreement. A
Paydex score over 80 indicates that payments reported to D&B have been made earlier than their
terms required. Paydex scores of 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, and below 20 indicate that businesses are
15, 22, 30, 60, 90, 120, and over 120 days late, respectively, in paying their financial obligations.
Paydex scores evolve slowly, and for each business a given month’s Paydex score reflects
transactions that have taken place over the previous several months.
       Examples of recent papers that have used D&B data to examine changes in the financial
health of small businesses include Barrot and Nanda (forthcoming), which studies the impact of
the 2011 federal Quickpay reform using establishment-level employment data and Paydex scores
from D&B. Chava, Oettl, and Singh (2019) examine the effects of state minimum wage increases
on the financial health of small businesses. The authors use the D&B Paydex score as their
primary measure of financial health for 15.2 million establishments from 1989-2013.
       D&B’s out-of-business indicator is our measure of business continuity. It is a zero-one
variable. D&B determines a business is out of business if it is no longer engaging in transactions,
through direct investigations, and in other ways. Two separate authorities — e.g., management or
owners of the company itself, if a business isn’t listed with a landlord at its address, if a business
is no longer licensed, etc. — must confirm a business has closed for it to be recorded as out of
business.
       Panels (A) and (B) of Figure 2 plot average establishment employment per month for
establishments with one to 500 employees in our analysis sample (Panel (A)), and establishments
with 501 to 1,000 employees (Panel (B)). These plots indicate that employment among the D&B
sample is very stable. Among businesses with 1-500 employees (Panel (A)), employment
decreased by 1.42 percent in August relative to November. Panel (B) shows employment
declines of 1.83 percent among establishments with 501 to 1,000 employees. In contrast,
employment reported in official statistics shows much larger loses. The summary statistics we
present suggest that employment evolves slowly among firms of all sizes, and our analysis does
not indicate any relationship between the pace of evolution and PPP application. The relative
stability of employment in the D&B data biases against finding a PPP employment effect, in both
our treatment-on-the-treated and intent-to-treat models. We interpret all our estimates of PPP’s
effects relative to trends in the D&B data.
       We present the average Paydex score per month in Panels (C) and (D) of Figure 2. These
figures indicate that business’ financial health in our sample is relatively stable, as well, falling
in both panels by less than one point. This apparent stability is most likely due to the relatively
lengthy look-back period for Paydex. As with the stability of employment, this biases against
finding an effect of PPP on financial health.
        The share of establishments that went out of business is shown in Panels (E) and (F) of
Figure 2. The share of businesses with less than 500 employees that went out of business
increased by a factor of 15 between November and August (Panel (E)). Businesses with 501 to
1,000 employees saw closure rates increase by a factor of 13 (Panel (F)).
6.2. Estimation strategy
        To identify the effect of PPP on business outcomes, we estimate the following equation:


                    𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽(𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ) + 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,   (1)


where 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an outcome experienced by business i in month m. Our analysis sample covers ten
months, November through August, with five months of pre-PPP period (the CARES Act was
signed on March 27) and five months of post period (PPP launched on April 3). 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is an
indicator as to whether business i applied for a PPP loan of at least $150,000. This variable is our
measure of PPP — we do not observe whether businesses actually received PPP loans, or if they
did receive loans, the size of the loan. 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 is a state-by-month effect, and 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 is an industry-by-
month effect. 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 equals 1 if business i applied for a PPP loan and the month is
April, May, June, July or August. Standard errors are clustered by state.
        The coefficient of interest is 𝛽𝛽, which captures the effect of applying for a PPP loan of
$150,000 or greater on the outcome variable. The industry-month effects capture time varying
shocks to businesses in a given industry, and the state-month effects capture time varying shocks
to businesses in a given state. The effects of the pandemic and the lockdowns varied substantially
across industries and states. Using within-state-by-month and within-industry-by-month
variation to estimate the effect of PPP application helps ensure that our results are not driven by
time varying public health or social-distancing policy differences between states and industries.
        To trace the dynamics of PPP over the months since the CARES Act, we estimate a
difference-in-difference event study of the following form:


                               5

              𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + � 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋 𝜑𝜑𝑡𝑡 ) + 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,          (2)
                             𝑡𝑡=−4
where 𝛽𝛽𝑡𝑡 is a vector of nine parameters estimating the dynamic effect of PPP, 𝜑𝜑𝑡𝑡 is a month
dummy, and everything else is the same as in equation (1). The dynamics of the effect are
interesting because of lags in receipt time, the time it may take employers to bring workers back
onto payroll, and treatment-control differences driven by the economic outcomes of control
businesses worsening over time because they do not have access to PPP funds. The trend in the
pre-period coefficient vector is a partial check against differential employment trends among
businesses that applied for a PPP loan and those that did not.
        We observe whether a business applied for a PPP loan of $150,000 or more. If some
businesses that applied were turned down, then our estimates of PPP’s effect are biased
downward, because the treatment group would be contaminated by control observations. Another
important source of downward bias in our estimates of PPP’s effect is that many businesses in
our control group applied for and received PPP loans of less than $150,000. As presented in
Table 1, around 87 percent of all PPP loans were made for $150,000 or less, and these loans
accounted for 28 percent of all funds disbursed. These are treatment-on-the-treated estimates,
and do not control for selection into applying for PPP. Firms that did not apply could be very
different from those that did, perhaps thinking that they did not need the funds to continue
operating, or, alternatively, perhaps thinking that the situation was hopeless. They might have
also been less financially savvy, which could be correlated with other outcomes and
characteristics.
        Knowing how PPP affected firms that selected into participating is interesting and
important, but it confounds demand for PPP with PPP itself. To address this distinction, we
estimate intent-to-treat models. In these models, we do not use information on whether a
business actually applied for a PPP loan. Instead, we compare outcomes for establishments that
were eligible for PPP based on their size to establishments that were ineligible in a difference-in-
differences framework. Specifically, we estimate the following equation:


                   𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑋𝑋 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑚𝑚 ) + 𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝛾𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 + 𝛿𝛿𝑗𝑗𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .   (3)


        All variables in equation (3) are the same as in equation (1) except 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 , which equals 1
if a business is eligible for PPP based on its size, and equals 0 otherwise. We also estimate
intent-to-treat event studies analogous to equation (2).
6.3. Results
        Results for employment. Table 4 presents estimates of equations (1) and (3) for (the log
of) employment. The specification in the first column compares establishments with one to 500
employees that applied for a PPP loan of $150,000 or more to establishments in the same size
class but did not apply. PPP application is associated with a 0.90 percent increase in
employment. Columns (2) and (3) present the same specification, but on smaller samples of
establishments. Column (2) looks at establishments between one and 250 employees, and
similarly finds a 0.94 percent increase in employment from PPP. Column (3) analyzes a sample
of establishments of between 251 and 500 employees. Here, the effect on employment is
negative, -3.2 percent. This result might be driven by greater demand for larger PPP loans within
that size class among the treatment group, confounded by many control firms taking out PPP
loans that we do not observe. But in evaluating the program as a whole, it is worth noting that
there are approximately 82 million establishment-months with one to 500 employees in our
sample, and around 360,000 of those are establishment-months with 251 to 500 employees.
        These estimates are valuable in part because they implicitly control for establishment-size
category. But they are likely biased downward because the treatment effect is defined as a
business applying for a PPP loan of $150,000 or greater, while most PPP loans were for less than
this amount, so PPP-treated establishments are in the control group. The specification in Column
(4) attempts to address this by defining the treatment group as establishments will less than 500
employees who applied for a PPP loan of at least $150,000 and the control group as
establishments with between 501 and 1,000 employees. Here, we estimate a PPP employment
effect of 1.78 percent, substantially larger in magnitude than the coefficients discussed
previously.
        The estimates reported in Columns (1) through (4) are treatment-on-the-treated estimates.
In the context of evaluating PPP, this is interesting because estimating program outcomes
conditional on selection is important and relevant (program participation is voluntary) and survey
evidence finds that over 70 percent of small businesses participated in PPP. 19 But the estimates
do confound the effect of demand for PPP with the effect of PPP, in addition to the limitation
that we only observe PPP loans of at least $150,000.


19
   The Small Business Pulse Survey of the U.S. Census Bureau finds that 72.7 percent of small businesses received
financial assistance from PPP since March 13, 2020 as of August 22, 2020.
       To address these limitations, Column (6) reports intent-to-treat estimates in which we
define the treatment group purely based on size eligibility — i.e., we do not use information on
whether a business applied for a PPP loan — and the control group is establishments with 501 to
1,000 employees. We estimate that PPP size eligibility increased employment by 1.38 percent.
This result might suggest an important role for smaller PPP loans in supporting employment.
       Column (5) also reports intent-to-treat effects but for firms close to the 500-employee
cutoff (eliminating firms near the cutoff). The advantage of this specification is that it directly
controls for firm size. Comparing firms in the 400-600 employee window, we do not find a PPP
employment effect. This result, along with the estimates reported in Column (6), might suggest
that PPP was most effective in supporting employment among smaller firms, at least through
August.
       The specification that estimates the effect of PPP within the 400-600 employee window
arguably offer the strongest basis for causal inference assuming that the effect of PPP loans on
employment is similar for firms of different sizes. But this assumption is very strong, and it is
quite likely that PPP loans have effects that vary by firm size. The estimates reported in Table 4
suggest this is the case, and the $10 million maximum for PPP loans also suggests that PPP
would offer relatively more assistance to smaller firms. In the D&B data, 2019 annual sales for
firms with 1-500 employees were $2.4 million, while those for firms with 400-475 employees
were $46.4 million. These consideration suggests that a holistic evaluation of PPP should include
estimating its effects on firms of all eligible sizes. Therefore, our preferred specifications are
presented in Columns (4) and (6).
       Our results contrast with Autor, et al., who find employment effects for larger firms using
ADP data. It is interesting to note that Autor, et al.’s estimates become less precise as the
window around the 500-employee eligibility cutoff shrinks. This finding may be due to sample
size, or it could indicate that PPP is relatively less effective at supporting employment for larger
firms in the ADP data.
       We present event study graphs using our two preferred treatment and control groups.
Figure 3 presents results from equation (2). Panel (A) shows the dynamic effect of PPP on
employment when the treatment group is establishments with between one and 500 employees
who applied for a PPP loan of at least $150,000 and the control group is establishments with 501
to 1,000 employees. There is no trend in the pre-period coefficients, although the confidence
interval on the negative coefficient in February does not include zero. The absence of a pre-
period trend supports a causal interpretation of the estimates. In the post-period coefficients, the
effect of PPP increases over time, rising to 3.13 percent in August.
       Panel (B) shows a similar effect of PPP on employment. Here, the dynamic effect
captures intent to treat, comparing establishments with 500 or fewer employees to those with
between 501 and 1,000, regardless of whether the firms applied for a PPP loan. Like Panel (A),
there is no noticeable trend in the pre-period, and the strength of the effect increases in the post
period with each month. In August PPP eligibility is found to increase employment by 3.83
percent.
       To interpret the magnitude of these effects, consider that average establishment
employment fell by 1.6 percent in the D&B data for establishments with one to 1,000 employees
over the sample period, between November and August. In light of this change, the 1.78 percent
increase in employment reported in Column (4) of Table 4 and the 1.38 percent increase reported
in Column (6) of Table 4 are both substantial increases. The effects for the month of August —
3.13 and 3.83 percent, respectively — specifically are even more substantial.
       Results for financial health. Table 5 reports results for which the outcome variable is
financial health, as captured by Dun & Bradstreet’s Paydex score. Table 5 is the same as Table 4,
except for the outcome variable. The first three columns of Table 5 report results from
specifications where the treatment and control groups are the same firm employee-size class.
Taken together, they suggest that financial health worsened for firms with between 1 and 250
employees that applied for PPP loans of at least $150,000. We think this puzzling finding is most
likely the result of PPP-treated observations (i.e., establishments with less than 250 employees
that applied for loans of less than $150,000) contaminating the control group.
       For reasons discussed previously, our preferred specifications are reported in Columns
(4) and (6). The specification in Column (4) compares firms with 500 or fewer employees that
applied for PPP loans of at least $150,000 with firms with 501 to 1,000 employees that were not
eligible for PPP. PPP predicts a Paydex increase of about 0.31 points. Column (6) presents
results from an intent-to-treat specification. Here, PPP eligibility boosts Paydex by about 0.35
points. Similar to our results for employment, PPP seems to have had a larger impact on firms
with fewer than 400 employees, as suggested by comparing the results in Column (5) with
Column (4).
       Figure 3, Panels (C) and (D) present event study graphs that trace out the dynamic effect
of PPP for our two preferred specifications As with employment, the effect of PPP on financial
health (as measured by Paydex) grows over time. Both figures show a flat trend centered on zero
for the pre-period coefficients estimating the effect of PPP in November through February
relative to March. As with employment, this supports a causal interpretation of our estimates.
The effect of PPP application on financial health was estimated imprecisely in April, and
precisely every month after. The magnitude of the effect increased considerably over time, more
than doubling between June and August.
       The dynamic intent-to-treat estimate are shown in Panel (D). As with the results in Panel
(C), PPP’s effect on financial health is estimated imprecisely in April but precisely for the
following four months. The magnitude of the effect in August is more than double the effect in
May. PPP eligibility is estimated to have increased Paydex in August by 0.52 points.
       The magnitude of the effect is substantial. For all firms with one to 1,000 employees,
average monthly Paydex fell by 0.28 points from November to August. A PPP Paydex effect of
0.31 (Column (4)) and 0.35 (Column (5)) represents a significant increase relative to the change
in financial health of all firms during our sample period. As with employment, the effect of PPP
on Paydex in June is substantially larger than the post-period average, suggesting that the effects
of PPP on financial health may be increasing over time.
       Results for business continuity. Table 6 reports results for D&B’s out-of-business
variable. Everything in Table 6 is the same as in Tables 4 and 5, except the outcome variable.
PPP eligibility or application is estimated to have reduced business closure in every specification
at conventional levels of statistical significance, except for Column (5). Column (4) presents
results from the specification that compares firms that applied for a PPP loan of at least $150,000
to firms with between 501 and 1,000 employees, which were ineligible for PPP. PPP application
is estimated to have reduced the odds of business closure by 0.47 percentage points. Column (6)
presents results from our intent-to-treat model. Here, PPP eligibility is estimated to reduce
business closure odds by 0.22 percentage points. Column (5) reports intent-to-treat results for a
smaller window around the 500-employee cutoff. As with employment and financial health, we
do not find a significant effect of PPP on business closure among firms with 400—475
employees.
       Panels (E) and (F) of Figure 3 present event studies for those two models. The pre-period
coefficients show a trend, and these results should be interpreted cautiously. The confidence
interval on pre-period coefficients includes zero in several cases. In the post-period, the
magnitude of the effect is larger in June than in April or May. This pattern is similar to our
employment and Paydex results. The magnitude of these effects is large.
       To place the difference-in-difference estimates and June event study coefficient estimates
in context, the average establishment out of business indicator in August was 0.42 percentage
points higher than in November for firms with one to 1,000 employees.
6.4. Discussion and conclusions
       Our results point to PPP playing a significant role in the health and viability of small
businesses. Applying for a PPP loan of $150,000 or more and PPP eligibility as determined by
firm size both increase employment, financial health, and business continuity. In addition, we
find that it may have taken a month or two for PPP to kick in. An alternative interpretation is that
PPP was more effective in a partially reopened economy (i.e., June—August) than during the
lockdowns.
       Several caveats are in order. We avoid making strong statements about the success or
failure of PPP because the program is so young, and we are only analyzing the first five months
of the program. PPP did have important short-run goals, which included maintaining
employment relationships during the lockdowns and supporting consumer spending by allowing
workers to continue to be paid. But PPP has important medium-run goals as well, and it is too
early to say anything definitive about its success or failure. Those goals include mitigating
business closures after the economy had partially reopened (which we observe for about one
month), supporting employment and reducing unemployment, and increasing productivity by
preserving firm-specific human capital, worker-firm matches, and networks. Crucially, by
preserving the productivity capacity of the small business sector, PPP stands to quicken the
recovery by supporting labor demand over the medium run. In addition, the firms in the D&B
data are not nationally representative, and they exhibit employment and financial health
indicators that are likely more stable than typical firms. We also want to stress the tentative
nature of our conclusions. As shown in the dynamics of the effect (in Figure (3)), the effect of
PPP on employment, financial health, and business continuity is evolving, and is much stronger
in July and August than in April and May. The effects of PPP are unfolding, and it will be
particularly important to see what happens to businesses that received PPP and the workers they
employ once they have exhausted their forgivable loan.


7. Retrospective and Lessons for the Future
       Many of the common criticisms of the PPP as failed by design and effect were too strong.
Banks were skittish about participating, particularly in the early days of the program. But
program demand by lenders was sufficient to allow the government to transfer funds in an
amount roughly equal to 10 percent of an typical quarter’s GDP to small businesses. With the
vast majority of loans and the sizeable majority of program dollars going to loans of less than $2
million, media coverage suggesting that PPP was in the main offering grants to large and well-
connected firms was overblown. Many of the anecdotes in the media implying fraudulent
participation in the program actually pointed to firms that were eligible for PPP loans under the
statute. The criticism that the original CARES Act appropriation of $349 billion was too small
was quickly proven valid by events, but Congress rectified that swiftly.
       Could policymakers have designed a more effective and cost-effective intervention than a
small business revenue replacement program? In theory, one could argue that relying on the
Unemployment Insurance (UI) system to replace workers’ income and using a PPP-like program
to help small businesses with non-payroll cost has appeal to some economists and analysts. But
that plan would require worker-firm separations, albeit temporary, to take place. It would change
the default for small businesses from keeping workers employed (as under a revenue
replacement program) to recalling workers following a separation. The UI system in many states
was simply unable to handle the demands placed on it during the shutdown — increasing those
demands would not likely lead to the most successful outcomes. Finally, having both UI and a
small business revenue replacement allows for redundancy, with multiple programs operating to
replace workers’ incomes.
       For the reasons we discussed previously, we do not view a loan program as an adequate
substitute for a small business revenue replacement program. Many businesses would not want to
add to their debt burdens, even under very favorable lending conditions. Many would resort to
layoffs, which would disrupt other businesses, deepen the recession, and hurt workers’
employment and earnings opportunities.
        Even though a small business revenue replacement program may have been the best
available option, the PPP would have been more effective at achieving the goals established for it
by Congress in ways we previously discussed: If it focused less on payroll expenses; if banks had
been given stronger assurances that they would be held harmless; and if its initial appropriation
were larger. Much of the confusion about the program was driven by chaotic Treasury/SBA
management which weakened the program’s effectiveness, limited its reach, and ultimately led
to a falloff in demand for PPP funds.
        PPP was designed for a short shutdown that would be followed by a strong and rapid
recovery. But the shutdown was longer than anticipated and the recovery decelerated after a
burst of improvement in May and June. In addition, partial shutdowns may remain in some
regions for an extended period of time. Subsequent changes to PPP addressed these concerns, but
changes could have gone further. The economy overall, including workers, will benefit from a
fast transition from the pre- to post-lockdown equilibrium. PPP could facilitate this transition by
eliminating any link between PPP loan forgiveness and pre-crisis employment levels.
        A lending program could exist alongside a revenue replacement program, particularly for
a partially reopened economy. One way to structure such a lending program could be in two
stages, following a venture capital model preceded by a broadly available loan. In the first stage,
the Treasury Department could issue a small loan to firms using limited underwriting standards,
knowing that the loan will have a high default rate. In the second stage, surviving firms could
have access to additional funding. This financing would help to give many firms a lifeline for
survival, while still well-stewarding taxpayer funds. 20
        An alternative approach would be a federal business interruption insurance program for
small and mid-size firms (analogous to the federal terrorism risk insurance program) layered on
top of private business interruption insurance. Linking a trigger to a pandemic shutdown could
require a shutdown order by a public official (e.g., the governor of the state).
        Looking forward, there are broader lessons as well. For a situation in which the
government is shutting down large sections of the economy, if Congress and the White House
are willing to tolerate stories of “undeserving” beneficiaries of economic recovery programs,



20
  The Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Facility offers another lending vehicle for small and mid-size firms.
While the facility’s design remains in flux, its structure could also mimic better patient equity financing. Terms
could include much longer maturity and very low interest rates, for example.
then the government can get money to borrowers much faster. PPP stands a chance at succeeding
in the goals Congress set for it because its relief was broad based. The Treasury Department was
much more conservative with putting taxpayer dollars at risk when approving the terms of the
PPP, limiting early take-up. The Treasury’s conservative approach has extended to the Federal
Reserve’s Main Street Lending Facility, which received capital funds (along with other Fed
facilities under the CARES Act). As a consequence of Treasury’s aversion to putting that capital
at risk, potentially driven in part by concern about stories of “undeserving borrowers,” the
facility is not supporting the economic recovery yet because it, essentially, is not making loans.
       Another broader lesson is that state and federal IT systems are not up to the task of
pursuing policy goals as ambitious as PPP’s. Banks were needed as intermediaries in part
because the government’s IT constraint would not have allowed for it to lend directly to banks in
a timely fashion. Finally, the government’s attempt to support small and mid-size businesses in
the Pandemic Recession calls into question the nature of the division between the Fed and the
Treasury. Following the Dodd Frank Act, Treasury is required to approve the terms of 13(3)
lending programs, including the Main Street programs. But these are labeled as Fed programs,
creating confusion about which agency is ultimately responsible for their success or failure.
Furthermore, Congress appropriated $454 billion in the CARES Act to Treasury to support Fed
lending programs. At the time of this writing, little of those funds have been put to use to support
the recovery, despite congressional intent. If Treasury is unwilling to risk capital losses as part of
Fed lending programs, then Congress might consider whether an alternative structure to support
small and mid-size businesses is advisable.

selection criteria. For all regressions, the pre-treatment period is November-March and the post-treatment period is April-August. Each column uses a
different treatment and control group, where “X-Y” indicates the size of the establishment by employment in February, “loan” indicates that we observe
that the establishment applied for a PPP loan of at least $150,000, “no loan” indicates the opposite, and “all estabs” indicates that we include all
establishments in the analysis sample regardless of whether they applied for a loan. All regressions include state, month, and 2-digit SIC industry code
fixed effects as well as state-by-month and industry-by-month fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Coefficients and standard
errors are multiplied by 100 for ease of interpretation. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1

PPP loan applications are from Dun & Bradstreet. The sample consists of establishments operational as of October 2019 that meet our sample selection
criteria. For all regressions, the pre-treatment period is November-March and the post-treatment period is April-August. Each column uses a different
treatment and control group, where “X-Y” indicates the size of the establishment by employment in February 2020, “loan” indicates that we observe that the
establishment applied for a PPP loan of at least $150,000, “no loan” indicates the opposite, and “all estabs” indicates that we include all establishments in the
analysis sample regardless of whether they applied for a loan. All regressions include state, month, and 2-digit SIC industry code fixed effects as well as state-
by-month and industry-by-month fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Coefficients and standard errors are multiplied by 100 for ease
of interpretation. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1
Figure 1: Cumulative number of PPP loans and dollars approved, April 3-August 8. This figure displays
cumulative loans and dollars lent during the operation of the PPP program calculated from the microdata provided
by the SBA and Treasury Department as of August 20, 2020. Cumulative dollars lent are overstated in the microdata
due to using the midpoints of loan ranges provided for loans greater than $150,000. The shaded areas represent a
period of uncertainty over audits and the safe harbor deadline. The lightly shaded area covers the total period of
uncertainty over audits from April 28 (audits announced) to May 18 (final deadline to return funds under safe harbor
provision). The darker area covers the period of uncertainty over the safe harbor deadline from May 7 (the original
deadline) to May 18 (the final deadline).
Figure 2: Authors’ calculations of average establishment employment, Paydex scores, and out of business
rates by month. This graph shows average employment, Paydex score, and out of business rates from November
2019 to August 2020 for establishments with 1-500 employees and 501-1,000 employees. Establishments are
assigned to an employment-size group using February 2020 employment. Panels A, C, and E include establishments
with 1-500 employees. Panel B includes all establishments with 501-1,000 employees.
Figure 3: Graphs from Event Study Regressions. This graph shows the results from event study regressions in
equation (2) examining the impact of the Paycheck Protection Program on establishment employment, financial
health, and survival. Panels A, C, and E examine PPP’s effect on employment, credit scores, and survival rates for
establishments with 1-500 employees that applied for a PPP loan of $150,000 or more compared to establishments
with 501-1,000 employees. Panels B, D, and F examine the effect of PPP eligibility on the same outcomes,
comparing all establishments with 1-500 employees to all establishments with 501-1,000 employees (i.e., dynamic
intent-to-treat effects). Establishments are assigned to an employment-size group using February employment.
Coefficients and standard errors for Panels A, B, E, and F are multiplied by 100 to ease interpretation. Error bars
represent 95 percent confidence intervals.
