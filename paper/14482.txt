                                             ABSTRACT

Previous research has shown a strong connection between birth weight and future child outcomes.
But this research has not asked how insults to child health after birth affect long-term outcomes, whether
health at birth matters primarily because it predicts future health or through some other mechanism,
or whether health insults matter more at some key ages than at others? We address these questions
using a unique data set based on public health insurance records for 50,000 children born between
1979 and 1987 in the Canadian province of Manitoba. These children are followed until 2006, and
their records are linked to provincial registries with outcomes data. We compare children with health
conditions to their own siblings born an average of 3 years apart, and control for health at birth. We
find that health problems, and especially mental health problems in early childhood are significant
determinants of outcomes linked to adult socioeconomic status.

Introduction

   A large literature has established that low birth weight babies (those under 2500 grams) are

more likely to suffer various deficits, including lower average educational attainment. But

previous research has not asked how poor child health after birth affects long-term outcomes,

whether health at birth matters primarily because it predicts future health or through some other

mechanism, and whether health problems matter more at some key ages than at other times?

       This study provides a first look at these questions using a unique administrative data set

based on public health insurance records from the Canadian province of Manitoba. The data

combines information from birth records, hospitalizations, and ambulatory physician visits with

information from other provincial registers about educational outcomes and use of social

assistance. These outcomes include: achievement on a standardized test of grade 12 language

arts, whether children took college-preparatory math courses in high school, whether they were

in grade 12 by age 17, and welfare participation in the months immediately after becoming

eligible at age 18. This health and outcome information is much more complete, and in many

ways more accurate, than what is typically available in survey data. And because Canada has

universal public health insurance, this study sheds light on the consequences of disparities in

child health in a setting that abstracts from differences in access to insurance coverage.

       We follow 50,000 children born in the Canadian province of Manitoba between 1979 and

1987, until 2006, when they are young adults. We are able to compare siblings with different

health problems, to control for health at birth (including the presence of congenital anomalies

and perinatal problems), and to compare the effects of health problems at different ages.

       A growing body of research suggests that adverse conditions in early childhood may have

particularly negative long term effects. Cunha and Heckman (2007) hypothesize that this is



                                                                                                    3
because health human capital is complementary to skills and “skill begets skill,” so that children

who suffer early disadvantages may fall behind and never catch up. On the other hand, to the

extent that children are resilient and recover, one might expect more recent health conditions to

have greater effects on current outcomes. If both mechanisms are at work, then one might expect

to find that both health insults in early childhood and recent health problems have particularly

negative effects on young adult outcomes.

       We show that early health problems have significant effects on future adult outcomes.

For schooling outcomes, this is largely due to effects on future health outcomes. However, early

health conditions have lingering effects on social assistance use net of effects of future health

conditions. Mental health conditions are an exception: we find that diagnoses of Attention

Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder or Conduct disorder at school entry are significant predictors of

future outcomes whether or not future diagnoses are controlled. We also find that controlling for

early health problems reduces, but does not eliminate the effect of low birth weight, confirming

the importance of fetal conditions for future outcomes. We conclude that differences in health

in childhood may be a significant source of socioeconomic disparities in adulthood.



2. Background

   There is a large literature linking low birth weight to lower average scores on a variety of

tests of intellectual and social development (see for example, Breslau et al. 1994, Brooks-Gunn,

Klebanov, and Duncan, 1996). Currie and Hyson (1999) show that low birth weight children

from the 1958 British birth cohort study (all of the children born in Great Britain in one week in

1958) have lower test scores, educational attainments, wages, and probabilities of being

employed as of age 33, even conditional on many measures of family background and



                                                                                                     4
circumstances. Case, Fertig, and Paxson (2005) extend this research by showing that the same is

true at age 42, and for adults who suffered chronic conditions as children.

   Several studies have used sibling designs and/or large-scale administrative data sets to

examine the relationship between low birth weight and future outcomes in models that control

more fully for family background characteristics by comparing siblings or twins. In these

studies the “control” for the low birth weight child is the child’s non-low birth weight sibling.

Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Conley and Bennett (2000) find that low

birth weight reduces the probability of high school graduation, while Johnson and Schoeni

(2007) find that low birth weight is strongly related to poorer adult health and lowers adult

annual earnings by 17.5%.

       Lawlor et al. (2006) examine the birth weights of Scottish siblings born between 1950

and 1956 and find that lower birth weight siblings had lower scores on a test of intelligence at

age 7. Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2005) examine a large sample of Norwegian twins and

find, using twin fixed effects, that a 10% increase in birth weight leads to a one percentage point

increase in the probability of graduating from high school and a one percent increase in earnings.

Moreover, these effects are surprisingly linear between about 1,500 grams and 3,500 grams,

suggesting that an exclusive focus on the 2,500 gram cutoff for low birth weight is unwarranted.

       Royer (2005) and Currie and Moretti (2007) use linked mother-child birth certificate data

for California. Royer examines mothers who were twins, and finds that each 1,000 gram

increase in birth weight is associated with a gain of 0.16 years of education at the time the

mother gives birth to her own child. Currie and Moretti (2007) compare mothers who are sisters

by conditioning on grandmother fixed effects, and find that a sister who was low birth weight is

3% more likely to live in a poor area at the time she delivers her own child, and 3% less likely to



                                                                                                      5
be married when she gives birth. The low birth weight sister also has about a tenth of a year less

education on average.

   Oreopoulos, Stabile, Roos, and Walld (2007) examine the Manitoba data used in this study

and find results consistent with those discussed above: children with birth weight between 1,500

to 2,500 grams were 8.2 % less likely to reach grade 12 by age 17 than siblings who weighed

over 3,500 grams and these children also spent longer on welfare than their siblings who

weighed over 3,500 grams.

   In one of the very few studies to look at other child health measures, Luo and Waite (2005)

use data from the Health and Retirement Survey, a national survey of older adults, and find that

the effect of a retrospective self-reported measure of childhood SES on future health, education,

and income is attenuated by the inclusion of child health measures, suggesting that child health

may explain some of the impact of low childhood SES on future outcomes. But there are issues

with self-reported health data, and it is possible that these correlations are due to other

characteristics of households that are associated both with poor child health and poorer

outcomes.

   Smith (2007) examines the long-term effects of child health using a similar retrospective

health measure using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. In 1999, the 25 to 47 year

old adult children of PSID respondents were asked a retrospective question about the state of

their health when they were less than or equal to 16 years old: Whether it was excellent, very

good, good, fair or poor? In models with sibling fixed effects, Smith finds significant negative

effects of poor overall health status in childhood on earnings.

   Case and Paxson (2006) treat adult height as an indicator of childhood health, and show that

much of the wage premium associated with adult height can be explained by children’s cognitive



                                                                                                    6
test scores. They interpret their results as evidence that early child health affects cognition,

which in turn affects earnings.

   As Currie (forthcoming) documents, there has been little research examining the long-term

effects of other specific health conditions besides low birth weight, with the result that we know

little about how other conditions affect children’s prospects. Salm and Schunk (2008) use data

from an administrative data set in a German city to show that 6 year old children with health

problems also have lower test scores, but they are not able to track the children over time.

   Moreover, we do not know whether low birth weight and other childhood health conditions

matter primarily because they are linked to future health conditions or through other channels.

Elo and Preston (1992) show that cohorts who suffered high death rates in childhood also tend to

show high death rates in adulthood, presumably at least in part because of the direct effects of

childhood health conditions on future morbidity. For example, Linnet et al., 2006 show in a

large cohort of Danish children that low birth weight is linked to Attention Deficit Hyper

Activity Disorder. Hence, it is possible that the effects of low birth weight on future outcomes

could be eliminated by including controls for future health status.



3. Data

Our main source of data is records that are routinely collected through the administration of

Manitoba’s public health insurance system. These records include enrollment files, physician

claims, and hospital claims for every person in Manitoba. These data are matched to

administrative records on educational attainment and social-assistance (welfare) take-up and use.

       The registry contains information on 96% of all children born in Manitoba over the

sample period and tracks 99% of the original sample conditional on remaining in the province



                                                                                                     7
until June of their 18th year.1 We restrict our sample to families with more than one child born

between 1979 and 1987 (excluding 1983 as we are unable to match this cohort to educational

information). We track outcomes for these children through to 2006. We restrict our sample to

children with siblings also born in the period of interest as our identification strategy (discussed

in more detail below) relies on sibling comparisons. Previous work using these data (Oreopoulos

et al, 2008) has shown that the sibling cohort and entire cohort of Manitoba births over this

period are quite similar. We also exclude children who ever have a diagnosis of mental

retardation. Further details on the construction of the data set are available in the data appendix.

        Because the data set includes all hospitalizations and ambulatory visits, there are a very

large number of potential health measures. Birth weight, congenital anomalies and perinatal

problems are obtained from hospital records.          These measures are important conceptually as

summary measures of health at birth: We wish to investigate the effects of health problems after

birth, so it is necessary to control for the continuing effects of health at birth.2 It is also of

interest to ask whether the documented effects of health at birth matter primarily because they

affect future health, or through some other mechanism.

        In order to collapse the available health measures in an objective and arms-length way,

we use Adjusted Clinical Group (ACG) software developed by researchers at Johns Hopkins

University (The Johns Hopkins University, 2003). The ACG is designed to measure morbidity

by creating constellations of diagnoses. Medical providers indicate diagnoses using what are

1
  The registry data do suffer from attrition when families move out of the province and can no longer be
tracked. Approximately 20% of the sample leaves the province between the birth of the child and their
18th year. Previous studies (Oreopoulos, Stabile, Roos and Walld) find that there does not appear to be a
correlation between children being in poor health and the families leaving the province. There is also a
small amount of attrition from children who die, but children who died before age eight were much less
healthy at birth and most of these deaths (~3/4) occur within the first year of life.
2
  Congenital problems may continue to generate diagnoses, or may even be discovered as the child ages.
For example, we code a 10 year old’s visit related to a congenital heart defect as a congenital problem,
and control for it.

                                                                                                            8
called International Classification of Disease codes (ICD9 or ICD10 codes depending on the

year). The ACG software groups 14,000 ICD codes into 32 groups (called Aggregated

Diagnostic Groups or ADGs) on the basis of 5 criterion: 1) Duration of the Condition (acute,

recurrent, or chronic), 2) severity of the condition (e.g. minor and stable versus major and

unstable), 3) diagnostic certainty (symptoms focusing on diagnostic evaluation versus

documented disease focusing on treatment), 4) etiology of the condition (infectious, injury, or

other), and 5) specialty care involved (medical, surgical, obstetric, etc.) Individuals are assigned

an ADG code if they have been diagnosed with any of the ICD codes in the group in either an

outpatient or hospital visit over the past year.

        The ADG system has been extensively validated in the U.S. (Weiner, Starfield,

Steinwachs et al., 1991; Weiner, Starfield, and Lieberman, 1992; Powe, Weiner, Starfield et al.,

1998; Wiener, Dobson, Maxwell et al., 1996). The Manitoba Center for Health Policy has also

evaluated the application of the ACG software to the Manitoba administrative data (Reid et al.,

1999). See the data appendix for further details.

        We use the ADG codes to construct several health measures. First, the Johns Hopkins

software classifies some ADGs as major and some as minor for each age group, and we start by

looking at their definition of major diagnoses for children. However, this definition excludes

several diagnoses that are highly prevalent among children, and which are thought to have

important effects: While the Johns Hopkins definition includes acute, unstable mental health

conditions such as psychosis, it excludes “stable” mental health conditions such as Attention

Deficit Hyper Activity Disorder (ADHD) and Conduct disorders, two of the most common

mental health conditions among children. Also excluded are asthma and major injuries.3


3
 “Major injuries” are not included as a major ADG for 0 to 17 year olds, but they are included for 18
year olds. In order to construct a more consistent measure, we use the same definition of a major

                                                                                                        9
        These are potentially significant exclusions. Using retrospective questions about onset,

Kessler et al. (1995) find that those with early onset psychiatric problems were less likely to have

graduated from high school. Using large-scale national surveys of children from both the U.S.

and Canada, Currie and Stabile (2006, 2007) show that mental health conditions in childhood are

associated with lower future test scores and schooling attainments in both countries.

Externalizing disorders such as ADHD and conduct disorders were found to have the largest

effects on future outcomes. Duncan et al. (2006) report similar findings.

        Injuries are the leading cause of death among children over one year of age in developed

countries, notwithstanding a dramatic reduction in deaths due to injuries in the past 30 years

(Glied, 2001). Yet we have little information about the burden of morbidity caused by injuries

among surviving children (Bonnie et al, 1999).

        Asthma is the leading cause of school absence and pediatric hospitalizations in children,

and one of the most common chronic conditions of childhood (U.S. Environmental Protection

Agency, 2006). The available evidence suggests however, that when properly managed asthma

may have little impact on children’s functioning or academic achievements so it is not clear that

asthma in childhood should be expected to have consistent effects on young adult outcomes

(Annett et al. 2000; Gutstadt et al., 1989).

        In view of these literatures, we examine the effects of asthma, major injuries, two specific

stable mental health problems (ADHD and conduct disorders), as well as the number of major

health conditions as classified by the ADG software. In each case the measure is constructed to

cover a specific age range starting from the date of birth of the child. So, for example, we define

a child as having a major injury between ages 0 and 3 if the child has a diagnosis of a major

injury at any point between birth and their 4th birthday. We construct similar measures for the

conditions for 18 year olds as we do for younger children. Further details are in the data appendix.

                                                                                                       10
age ranges 4 to 8, 9 to 13, and 14 to 18. We chose these age ranges to correspond to important

stages of childhood: The preschool years, early elementary school, early adolescence, and the

late teen years.

        The data appendix shows the mapping between our measures and the most common

ICD9 codes in each category (the rankings are much the same for ICD10 codes). For example,

Appendix Table 3 shows that open wounds of the head are one of the most important major

injuries at all ages.

        Of course, given that we are using administrative data, what we observe is whether a

child had any interaction with the health care system for a specific ADG over a four year

interval. However, it is reasonable to expect that over a four year period a fully insured child

who is experiencing a severe health condition, or being treated for that condition, would need to

interact with the health care system at least once. For example, a child who was on medication

for asthma would need to see a physician periodically to have his or her prescription renewed,

even in the absence of acute asthma attacks. Moreover, our measure is not affected by the

number of visits for a particular condition, only by whether there is at least one visit. Hence, we

believe that our measure, while imperfect, offers a reasonable proxy for whether or not a child

had a particular condition in a given age range, and for the number of major conditions a child

had.

        Table 1 shows the means of our measures for each age range. Because the first age

range is one year smaller than the others, the estimates are pro-rated so that they all apply to a 5

year interval. The fraction of children with a medical contact for asthma ranges from 8% among

0 to 3 year olds, to 14.4% among 9 to 13 year olds. These numbers compare very closely with

the best available evidence of asthma prevalence for the U.S., which suggest that 13.1% of 0 to



                                                                                                   11
17 year old children have ever been told by a doctor that they have asthma (Bloom and Cohen,

2007).

         Major injuries are clearly the most common reason for seeking medical attention, with

around 40% of children having at least one visit for major injury over each age interval. U.S.

data suggest that in 2000, 11.9% of children less than 10 and 17.9% of children 10 to 19 received

medical attention for an injury, which suggests that over a 4 or 5 year period, a rate of 40% is not

unreasonable.

         In comparison, contacts for externalizing mental health problems are not nearly as

prevalent: 3 to 4% of children receive a medical contact for ADHD or conduct disorders over

each period. U.S. rates of ADHD prevalence are higher than this. For example, Froehlich et al.

(2007) report that 8.7% of 8 to 15 year old children in the National Health Interview Survey have

been told by a doctor that they have ADHD. But there is evidence that Canadian rates of mental

health diagnosis are lower than in the U.S. Currie and Stabile (forthcoming) found that 9.3% of

children in the U.S. National Longitudinal Survey of Youth were being treated for mental health

conditions compared to 4.5% in a similar Canadian survey. This disparity in the rates suggests

that Canadian children who are diagnosed may display more severe behavior problems than

treated children in the U.S., a comparison which should be born in mind when interpreting the

results below.4

         Congenital and perinatal (pertaining to the period from 22 weeks gestation to one week

after birth) problems are common among 0 to 3 year olds. We retain only those problems that

are considered “major” health conditions by the ADG system. Appendix Table 3 lists these

conditions and shows that they include problems such as birth asphyxia and neonatal jaundice


4
 We have repeated our analyses with a broader measure of mental health conditions as discussed further
below.

                                                                                                     12
accompanying preterm delivery. A small number of older children have contacts for congenital

problems such as heart defects. Though these contacts occur later, they result from health

conditions present at birth, so we control for them in our examination of the effects of health

after birth.

        About 15% of children 0 to 13 have major conditions. Appendix Table 2 provides a

breakdown of the ICD9 codes represented by this variable. This table demonstrates that

although it is relatively common to have a medical contact for a major health problem, most

individual types of problems have low prevalence. For example, the 629 children who had a

medical contact related to hearing lost when they were 0 to 3 represent only 1.2% of the sample.

This is the main reason that we group these major health conditions together. The average

number of major health conditions is a little over .2 for children 0 to 13 (vs. .335 for 14 to 18

year olds) which suggests that most children with a major health condition have only one such

condition. There are however a small number of children who have multiple conditions, with the

maximum being 10 to 12 for 0 to 13 year olds (14 for 14 to 18 year olds). Finally, the table

shows the effects of limiting our attention to major conditions. While the average number of

major conditions identified is far less than 1, the average child has an average of 5 different

major and minor conditions diagnosed over a five year period.

        Table 2 explores the temporal pattern of health problems for the children in our sample.

For example, a child is assigned the pattern 0000 if he or she did not have a diagnosis for a

particular health condition in any age range. The fractions ever diagnosed with asthma,

ADHD/conduct disorder or major injuries are 28.31, 10.18, and 82.06 respectively, while

47.36% ever have anmajor condition. Relatively small numbers of children have a diagnosis




                                                                                                    13
related to the same condition in each period. However, 5.58% of sample children have a major

injury in every period.

       There is clearly state dependence in diagnoses. For asthma, a child who is diagnosed

with asthma has about a 50% chance of being diagnosed with asthma in the next period, whereas

a child with no diagnosis has about a 10 to 20% probability of having a diagnosis in the next

period. For ADHD/conduct disorder, children diagnosed in the first period have a 20% chance

of having a medical contact for this diagnosis in the second period; and children with a previous

diagnosis become more likely to be diagnosed in the current period as they age. Even for major

injuries, a child who has a major injury in the current period has about a 50% chance of having a

diagnosis for major injury in the next period, while a child without a diagnosis this period, has

only a 30 to 40% probability of such a diagnosis in the next period.

       Still, the variation in our data over time periods suggests that in each period, some

children without initial health conditions develop them, and other children with health conditions

recover from them. Such variation is the key if we are to be able to use the data to examine the

impact of health conditions at different ages.

       The outcome variables we examine are created by linking the health care registry

information to administrative data on education, and social assistance.5 We link education

enrollment records with the provincial registry to determine whether a student has attained Grade

12 by age 17. This measure is available for all birth cohorts. Overall, about 70% of children are

in grade 12 by age 17. Not attaining grade 12 by this age could indicate that a student entered

school late, has been held back in a grade at least once, or has dropped out. Hence, we also


       5
         These data are available only for Manitoba residents. The analysis of the effects of
health on these longer-term outcomes, therefore, is conditional on both survival and on
remaining a resident in the province. This issue is discussed further in the data appendix.


                                                                                                    14
looked at whether the child was in school at age 17, but did not find significant effects of early

health on this measure. Therefore, it seems that “grade 12 by age 17” mostly captures the effect

of starting school late or of being delayed.

         We also have information from provincial language arts standards tests taken in grade 12.

These tests contribute 30% to the students’ final course grade. Individuals pass the language arts

test by scoring 50% or more on a comprehensive exam.6 The score on the test is normalized to

have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one for the entire population of students in

Manitoba. Within each birth cohort, some test scores are missing and we have imputed scores

for these children based on the reasons for the failure to write the test, as discussed further in the

data appendix.

         Students in the province can select into one of several math tracks. While the courses

offered differ by year and school, they always include courses that would prepare the student for

college level mathematics. In each year we classify high school courses into college versus non-

college preparatory mathematics based on the difficulty of the course and the course material.

The number of college preparatory math courses available increased over our sample period, and

as a result the number of students in college preparatory courses also increased. In our empirical

analysis, year fixed-effects will help to account for this trend.7 We calculate that 22% of the

sample took college-preparatory math courses.

         Finally, the sample of Manitoba residents is matched to monthly social assistance records

(the provincial welfare program). Residents become age-eligible to participate in welfare in

  The test focuses on reading comprehension, exploring and expanding on ideas from texts, the management of ideas
and information, and writing and editing skills.

  To further ensure that our results are not overly sensitive to the fact that the number of courses increases, we
estimated alternative models using information on the grade obtained in the course and assign students with a grade
of 80% or better to college-level math. Results using this specification are quite similar to the results using just the
course assignment and we present our results using only the course assignment here.

                                                                                                                     15
their own right (rather than as a dependent child) on their 18th birthday. Our youngest birth

cohort can only be followed for 1.25 years after the age of 18. While the older cohorts can be

tracked for longer, we define our social assistance exposure window to be a consistent 1.25 years

for each cohort (or 70 weeks). Using this exposure window, 6% of our sample went on social

assistance in the 70 weeks after they became eligible on their 18th birthday.

        Note that our last age group, 14 to 18, encompasses the ages when some of our outcomes

are measured. This, combined with the fact that some people might delay seeking treatment for

conditions first noted at say age 16, leads us to consider the health measures for 14 to 18 as

roughly contemporaneous with the outcomes we are examining. Hence, we have measures of

early health, health in middle childhood, and measures that are roughly contemporaneous with

the outcomes examined.

        Appendix Table 1 shows the means of the other variables that we control for in our

models. The administrative and registry records provide information on the characteristics of the

mother at the birth of the child, and on the number of children in the family. We use 2004 as the

fixed point to determine family size and the birth order of the child. This year, many years after

the final birth cohort used in the analysis (1987), was chosen in order to try to ensure that

families were past the childbearing phase.



4. Conceptual Framework

        The simplest model that captures key elements of our approach is:
             "    $
(1) Yt = aHt Ct

(2) ct = b0 + b1ct-1 + b2ht-1

(3) ht = (ht-1 + ut


                                                                                                 16
where Yt is a young adult outcome, Ht is contemporaneous health, Ct is contemporaneous

cognitive ability, and ht and ct are log health and log cognitive ability, respectively. We assume

that outcomes are produced using inputs of health and cognitive ability, and that cognitive ability

depends on ability last period and also on health last period. Finally, health depends on health

last period, and is subject to random problems, ut. Solving the model recursively yields an

equation of the form:

(4) log(Yt)= * + *1ct-4 + *2ht-4 + *3ut + *4ut-1+ *5ut-2 + *6ut-3

where, in our context, (*1ct-4 + *2ht-4) represent endowments at birth, ut is a contemporaneous

health problem, and ut-3 is a health problem in the first 3 years of life. The coefficients *3 to *6

are given by:

*3 = "

*4 = "( + $ b2

*5= (*4 + $ b2 b1

*6= (*5 + $ b2 b12.

         We can consider several interesting special cases:

         Case 1. b2 = 0 so that cognition does not depend on health. If it is also true that (=1 then

all health problems have the same effect. If  (< 1 then health depreciates, and the effects of

health problems die out over time. In this case, more recent health problems always have a

larger effect. In order for early health problems to have a large effect in this model, it must be

the case that b2 >0.

         Case 2: b2 > 0 and (=1. Now early health problems matter more than later health

problems. The reason is that early health problems affect the development of cognitive ability

through multiple periods.


                                                                                                     17
       Case 3. if b2 >0 and (< 1 then it is possible to generate many interesting patterns in the

data, even with this simple model. For example, if "=$=.5; b1=1.5; b2=.2; (=.7, then *3= .5, *4 =

.45, *5= .47, *6= .56 then health problems in the first year of life and contemporaneous health

problems matter most. In other words, the pattern of coefficients is U-shaped rather than

monotonically increasing or decreasing.

       The intuition is that there are two different mechanisms at work. On the one hand, early

health problems affect early cognitive ability, which affects future cognitive ability. Hence, the

effects of these early problems cumulate. Second, people tend to recover from health problems

over time, so that the main effect of the health problem per se diminishes with time.

       The empirical analogue of (4) is given by:

(5) OUTCOME = a + b1X + b2HEALTH0 + b3HEALTH0-3 + b4HEALTH4-8 + b5HEALTH9-13 +

b6HEALTH14-18 + e,

where OUTCOME is one of the young adult outcomes described above, X is a vector of controls

including marital status, sex of the child, and mother’s age at birth, dummy variables for birth

order of the child, and year of birth indicators, HEALTH0 are measures of health at birth and

{HEALTH0-3, HEALTH4-8, HEALTH9-13, HEALTH14-18} is a vector of age specific health

problems. We use a number of different measures of health, as described above.

       These models show the correlations between young adult outcomes and an individual’s

health history, but they may be biased by omitted characteristics of families, including

characteristics that affect young adult outcomes, the health of children in the family and the

propensity of the family to seek medical care.

       Hence, our main focus is on models of the following form:




                                                                                                     18
(6) OUTCOMEya = a + b1X + b2HEALTH0 + b3HEALTH0-3 + b4HEALTH4-8 + b5HEALTH9-13 +

b6HEALTH14-18 + MOTHER + e,

where MOTHER is an indicator for each mother in the data. The inclusion of mother fixed

effects will help us to control for many unobserved family background characteristics that may

be correlated with the propensity to use medical care, true health status, and with young adult

outcomes. The fact that we observe families over a relatively short period of time is also helpful,

as siblings will be less likely to be exposed to different environments over a short time than over

a long time. The mean difference in age between two siblings is only 3 years, and most children

and 74% of children are born less than 4 years apart.

       Several other issues arise when using family fixed effects models.      First, there may be

characteristics of the individual child that are correlated with health conditions and also with

future outcomes.    While we cannot control for all such factors, it is important to note that we

have very thorough controls for health at birth, and that the degree of serial correlation in many

of our outcomes (such as injuries) is modest. Second, health conditions of one sibling may have

an impact on the other sibling. To the extent that the household is disrupted by a child’s illness,

we might expect both children to be negatively affected in which case our sibling comparisons

will tend to underestimate the effects of health conditions.

       Third, sibling fixed effects models may exacerbate the effects of measurement error.

This last point highlights a strength of our analysis in that our measures of health are much more

accurate than those used in previous studies, and less likely to be subject to bias due to

self/parental reports, forgetting, etc. Moreover, a comparison of OLS and fixed effects estimates

can shed some light on the importance of measurement error.




                                                                                                19
       We estimate all of our models using linear probability models for dichotomous outcomes

both for ease of interpretation, and for ease of including fixed effects.



5. Estimation Results

       In order for models that include family fixed effects to be informative there must be

variation within families in both the health problems children experience and the outcomes

observed later in life. To explore the extent of this variation we report the average difference in

each outcome for families with children who have different health measures in each age group.

The results are reported in Table 3, and the mean differences for each health measure are plotted

in Figures 1 to 4.

       The first column of Table 3 reports the number of siblings with different health measures

at each age. So, for example, there were 3177 pairs of siblings with differences in whether they

were ever treated for asthma between age 0 to 3. The remaining columns report the average

difference in outcomes for these pairs. In each case the difference is reported as the outcome for

the child with the worse health measure minus the outcome for the child with the better health

outcome.

       Many of the mean differences reported in Table 3 are significantly different than zero.

They are all of the anticipated sign except for the case of asthma at age 0 to 3. Although siblings

with an asthma diagnosis are more likely that those without to lag behind in school and they

score lower on literacy tests, they are less likely to be on welfare in young adulthood. As shown

in Figure 1, sibling differences for asthma show inconsistent patterns across outcomes. Asthma

in early childhood seems to have a large effect on the literacy score, with the effect on literacy

declining with age.



                                                                                                20
        Figure 2 shows that sibling differences in major injuries have surprisingly little effect on

welfare use, but quite consistent negative effects on school outcomes which grow larger with

child age.   Consistent with what we will show below, Figure 3 indicates that sibling differences

in externalizing mental health conditions have large effects of the anticipated sign on all our

outcomes, and that these effects grow larger as children age.

        Children with major conditions have consistently worse outcomes than their siblings, as

shown in Figure 4. Table 3 shows that most of the mean differences are statistically significant.

These effects show a variety of age patterns – the effects of major conditions on welfare use

increase with age, while the effect on school progression is constant from age 4 on. The effects

on college preparatory math are greatest for older children, while the mean differences for

literacy follow an inverse U.

        Finally, Table 3 indicates that children with congenital or perinatal problems do worse

than their siblings in terms of both welfare use and the schooling measures. The estimates are

generally much larger for children with medical contacts at older ages, which probably reflects

selection: Only the most serious congenital or perinatal problems require follow up at older

ages.

        We next turn to estimation of models of the effects of birth weight which show that we

can replicate the results of earlier studies that focused exclusively on this measure. We will then

use these estimates as a baseline to see how the inclusion of health measured at later ages

changes inferences about the about the effect of birth weight.

        The first panel of Table 4 presents Ordinary Least Squares estimates of the effects of

birth weight. These models include all of the controls listed in Appendix Table 1.              The

estimates suggest that lower birth weight has negative effects on all of our outcomes. Moreover,



                                                                                                 21
the effects are monotonic: The lower the birth weight of the surviving infant, the more likely the

young adult is to be on social assistance, the less likely they are to have been in grade 12 by age

17, the lower the probability that they take college preparatory math, and the lower their literacy

score.

         The second panel shows that including mother fixed effects (so that lower birth weight

siblings are compared to their own siblings of higher birth weight) reduces, but does not entirely

eliminate these effects. It becomes difficult to identify the effects of birth weight less than 1000

grams, probably because there are relatively few surviving children in this birth weight category,

though birth weight in this category is estimated to have large negative effects on the probability

of being in grade 12 by age 17 and on the literacy score.

         For welfare use and grade 12 by age 17, there are however significant effects of birth

weight between 1000 and 1500 grams which are larger in absolute value that the effects of birth

weight between 1500 and 2500 grams. These estimates suggest that children of lower birth

weight are indeed more likely to end up on welfare, and are less likely to have reached grade 12

by age 17. The estimated effects on literacy scores are monotonic, and suggest increasing scores

with birth weight. The contrast between the two panels of Table 4 shows the importance of

adequately controlling for family background when examining the effects of ill health.

         Table 5 shows estimates of a model similar to (6) except that we include only measures

of health at 0 to 3. There has been a good deal of popular discussion of the idea that the earliest

ages are a uniquely vulnerable period, so it is of interest to see if health conditions at these ages

have long term effects. On the other hand, it must be kept in mind that some conditions such as

ADHD, may be very difficult to diagnose at this age.




                                                                                                  22
        When we control for all of these health conditions (in contrast to Table 3) we find no

significant effects for asthma in either OLS or fixed effects models.        Major injuries are highly

significant in OLS, but controlling for sibling fixed effects eliminates most of these effects

though there is still a significant negative effect on grade 12 by age 17.

        OLS estimates of ADHD/conduct disorder show large point estimates, but also large

standard errors with the result that they are not always statistically significant. The sibling fixed

effects models indicate much stronger effects which are significant for every outcome except

college preparatory math.       The fact that the estimates rise when fixed effects are included

suggests that these estimates are not driven by measurement error. The estimates indicate that

children with an early diagnosis of one of these conditions are 1.6 percentage points more likely

to end up on welfare immediately after becoming eligible (on a baseline of 5.5%). They are also

4.4% less likely to be in grade 12 by age 17, and obtain scores that are .06 of a standard

deviation less on the literacy test.

        Finally, the number of major conditions has a strong effect, which is significant across

the board in both OLS and the sibling fixed effects models. In fact, the estimates are quite

similar in the two specifications.     In the fixed effects models, an additional major condition

increases the probability of being on welfare by 18%. The probability of being in grade 12 by

age 17 is reduced by about 1%, the probability of taking college preparatory math is reduced by

3%, and the literacy score is reduced by .15 of a standard deviation. Finally, congenital and

perinatal problems are important determinants of future outcomes, with significant effects on 3

out of the 4 outcomes.

        The addition of these controls reduces but does not eliminate the effect of low birth

weight. Indeed, the pattern of significant effects is much the same as it was in Table 4. Hence,



                                                                                                   23
on the one hand, low birth weight continues to exhibit negative effects on future outcomes net of

the effects of health at early ages. On the other hand, a reduction in the magnitude of the

estimated effects suggests that some of the long term effect of low birth weight comes about

because low birth weight is predictive of future conditions such as ADHD or conduct disorder,

and/or major health conditions.

       But this observation raises the question of how much of the effect of early health

conditions is due to the fact that they are predictive of later health conditions? Table 6 takes up

this question by adding all but the contemporaneous health measures to the model. For the sake

of brevity, we show only the sibling fixed effects models from here on.

       There are some small negative effects of asthma in this table: A diagnosis at age 4 to 8 is

estimated to increase the probability of welfare use, and a diagnosis at age 9 to 13 is estimated to

reduce the probability of taking college preparatory math.      Major injuries at 0 to 3 no longer

have any significant effect, while a major injury at age 9 to 13 has a significant negative effect

on all of the schooling variables: A major injury at this age is estimated to reduce the probability

of being in grade 12 by age 17 or of taking college preparatory math by 2%, and to reduce the

literacy test score by .035 of a standard deviation.

       The estimated effects of ADHD/conduct disorder at 0 to 3 are reduced and remain

significant only for the probability of being in grade 12 by 17. However, a diagnosis of this type

at school entry (ages 4 to 8) has large negative effects, and a diagnosis at age 9 to 13 has effects

which are even larger. The estimates suggest that a child who was seen for one of these

disorders at both ages would be 6.8 percentage points more likely to be on welfare after age 18,

35% less likely to be in grade 12 by age 17, and 50% less likely to take college preparatory math,




                                                                                                 24
and that these children also have scores on the literacy test that are half a standard deviation

lower than others on average.

       The addition of controls for health at later ages also reduces the estimated effects of the

number of major conditions from 0 to 3, though a significant effect on welfare use, and the

probability of taking college preparatory math remains. The probability of welfare use appears

to be impacted similarly by the number of major conditions at each age, while the number of

conditions has an increasingly negative effect on the probability that a child is in grade 12 by age

17. Only major conditions at 9 to 13 are estimated to significantly impact the literacy score.

       Table 7 shows estimates from a model of the form (6) which includes both childhood

health conditions, and conditions for those 14 to 18.    When asthma in the oldest age group is

controlled, the estimated effect of asthma at 4 to 8 on welfare use, and the estimated effect of

asthma from 9 to 13 on college preparatory math become slightly smaller and are significant

only at the 90% level of confidence.

       A major injury at age 9 to 13 remains a significant determinant of schooling outcomes,

and the coefficients are little changed by the addition of a measure of major injuries at 14 to 18.

Moreover, injuries at the two ages have fairly similar effects on these outcomes.

ADHD/conduct disorders at school entry and at age 9 to 13 also continue to have large effects on

all outcomes, even when additional diagnoses at age 14 to 18 are controlled for.

       Turning to major conditions, the number of major conditions at age 0 to 3 and at age 4 to

8 continues to be a significant predictor of eventual welfare use in young adulthood. But the

number of health conditions during childhood has no effect on the schooling outcomes when the

number of conditions at age 14 to 18 is controlled.




                                                                                                 25
        The models shown in Tables 6 and 7 also included controls for birth weight categories,

but the estimated coefficients were almost identical to those shown in Table 5. That is, adding

additional controls for health at older ages did not alter the size or significance of the birth

weight coefficients.

        These estimates suggest that while childhood health conditions do affect outcomes

through their effects on future health, some conditions have additional effects on outcomes

independent of future health.     In particular, early diagnoses of mental health conditions have

strong effects independent of future diagnoses of these and other conditions, and other early

major health conditions impact the probability of being on social assistance after age 18.

        Finally, Table 2 suggests one additional way to look at the data, which is in terms of

health trajectories.   The largest single category in Table 2 is children who never have a given

condition. The next largest categories are generally those children who had a condition only

once. We might then compare children who have a given condition at age 0 to 3 and then

recover, to those who have the same condition at a different age. Table 8 carries out this

comparison. We include a dummy for having a condition only at 0-3, having it only at 4-8,

having it only at 9-13, and having it only at 14-18. A fifth dummy is added for children who

have a condition over multiple periods. The left out group for each condition is children who

never had the condition.

        The table suggests that for most physical health conditions, children who have the

condition and then recover (so that there are no future contacts related to the same condition) do

not suffer lingering effects.   Children with major health conditions at 14 to 18 suffer severe

consequences, as do children who have conditions and do not recover quickly (i.e. the condition

persists across multiple periods).    It is interesting that we find no effects for asthma in this



                                                                                               26
formulation, and the effects of injuries mirror those discussed above, that is, injuries at 9-13 and

14-18 appear to be important determinants of schooling outcomes. Repeated injuries are also

important.

       Once again, mental health proves an exception. We see that children with ADHD or

conduct disorders at 4-8 suffer lingering effects even if they subsequently appear to recover.

And as in Table 7, the effects only grow larger with age. They are also larger when contacts for

the condition cover multiple age ranges.



6. Extensions

       While the ADG system is a well established way to construct health measures from

underlying ICD9/ICD10 codes, some arbitrariness in grouping diagnoses and in classifying

diagnoses as major or minor is inevitable. The fact that the software was written by a third

party with no vested interest in our study is a significant advantage. Still, it is tempting to try to

look at a greater number of individual diagnoses.

       It is especially tempting to try to break down the injury category, since it is so large. We

have tried to estimate the effect of serious head injuries (skull fractures and intracranial injuries

including concussion) since there is a literature positing long term effects of such injuries

(Hawley et al, 2008). However, although 4 to 7% of children have such injuries in each age

group, we did not find any statistically significant effects. It is possible that to do so may

require larger samples.

       Our findings with regard to ADHD/conduct disorders are provocative and beg the

question of how other mental illnesses affect child outcomes. We have repeated our analyses

with a somewhat broader measure of mental health conditions defined using all of the conditions



                                                                                                     27
included in ADG 24 “Recurrent or Persistent, Stable Psychosocial conditions” the ADG category

that includes both ADHD and conduct disorder. This exercise produced similar though

somewhat larger estimates of the effects of mental health conditions.

       Reliance on administrative data entails some limitations on our analysis. For example,

we have no information about measures of socioeconomic status (SES) such as parent’s income

or education. SES-related gaps in maternal reports of child health status tend to grow with child

age in both the United States and Canada (Case, Lubotsky and Paxson, 2002; Currie and Stabile,

2003). And poor children receive more insults to their health than richer children, including

more injuries, chronic conditions and acute conditions (see for example, Newacheck, 1994;

Newacheck and Halfon, 1998; Currie and Lin, 2007; Case, Lubotsky and Paxson, 2002).

Hence, it would be of great interest to break down our results by SES.

       We constructed a measure of socioeconomic status (SES) using income measured at the

enumeration area level (an area similar to a U.S. Census tract with 400 to 700 people) from

the1986 Canadian Census. We used the area in which the child’s family resided as of Dec. 31,

1987 (see the data appendix for further discussion) and ranked enumeration areas by their

median incomes. We then used residence in the bottom two quintiles of enumeration areas as an

indicator of “lower SES” (the results were similar if we focus on residence in the lowest quintile

as our measure). Other work using these data suggests that the correlation between individual-

level income and median income in the enumeration area is about .44 (Roos et al, 2005).

       Our outcome measures show a clear gradient by this measure which suggests that it is

capturing real differences between groups. For the entire sample of siblings, 5.5% of the full

sample are on social assistance compared to 9.5% of the low SES sample. The comparable




                                                                                                 28
figures for reaching grade 12 by age 17 are 69% vs. 53%, while for college preparatory math

and the normalized literacy score they are 21.4% vs. 14.8% and 0 vs. -.34.

       When we attempt to estimate separate models for the lower SES group, some of the point

estimates are higher for the low SES than for the full sample. However, the standard errors are

also higher so that it is difficult to draw any firm conclusions about whether the long term effects

of health conditions in childhood are greater for those of low SES from these data.

       The outcomes that can be tracked are also limited by the availability of administrative

data sets that can be merged to the health records. It would be very interesting to be able to

measure adult earnings or employment status, but this information is currently unavailable.



6. Discussion and Conclusions

       The strengths of our study include: a large sample; virtually complete coverage of the

population from birth to follow-up; a long follow up period; and the use of objective health

measures rather than self-reports or retrospective measures. The fact that we observe multiple

children from the same family is an additional strength because sibling comparisons enable us to

control statistically for many unobserved characteristics of families that could be related to

health and propensity to seek care.

   Large numbers of children suffer from health problems in childhood. Previous research

across a number of countries has shown that there is a strong link between socioeconomic status

and poor health (see Adler and Ostrove (1999), Marmot and Wilkinson (1999), and Cutler and

Lleras-Muney (2006) for reviews) and that low socioeconomic status in childhood is related to

poorer future adult health. But it has not been clear whether health problems in early childhood




                                                                                                  29
had any effect on determinants of SES over and above their effects on future health.           The

paucity of data on health in early childhood has severely limited research in this area.

       Our research offers several striking conclusions. First, low birth weight continues to be

predictive of long term negative effects even after measures of subsequent health conditions are

included in the models. Moreover, the estimates are remarkably similar to those obtained in

models without such measures. The main exception is that the effects of birth weight between

1500 and 2500 grams (higher birth weight low birth weight babies) are no longer significant

when future health measures are controlled. Birth weight less than 1500 grams has pronounced

effects on future outcomes apart from its effects on future health.

       Turning to health conditions at age 0 to 3, the measures that are most predictive of

negative future outcomes are the number of “other” major conditions and whether the child has a

diagnosis related to ADHD/conduct disorders. A child with two major diagnosis over this

interval is predicted to be 3% more likely to end up on social assistance after age 18, 1.6% less

likely to be in grade 12 by age 17, 2% less likely to take college preparatory mathematics courses

in high school, and has a literacy score that is .03 of a standard deviation lower than their own

sibling. A diagnosis related to ADHD or conduct disorders has a similar effect on the probability

of social assistance use, but a much larger negative effect on being in grade 12 by age 17 (a 6%

reduction relative to baseline) and on the literacy score (a reduction of .06 of a standard

deviation).

       Conditional on health at later ages the number of major conditions at 0 to 3 continues to

be an important predictor of social assistance use. But its effects on schooling attainment

disappear when future health measures are added to the model suggesting that many early child

health conditions affect schooling attainments mainly through their effects on later health.



                                                                                                30
          In contrast, the estimated effects of diagnoses related to ADHD or conduct disorders at

school entry (age 4 to 8) are large and largely unaffected by controlling for later diagnoses of

these or other health conditions. Children with a stable diagnosis of ADHD or conduct disorder

from 4 to 18 are more than 10 percentage points more likely to end up on social assistance, more

than 30 percentage points less likely to be in grade 12 by age 17, over 15 percentage points less

likely to take college preparatory mathematics courses, and also have literacy scores more than a

half a standard deviation lower than unaffected siblings. Major injuries sustained at ages 9 to 13

have significant effects on our measures of academic achievement, which are robust to the

inclusion of health measures at age 14 to 18.

          In sum, our results suggest considerable heterogeneity in the long term effects of specific

early child health conditions. Birth weight less than 1500 grams has long term effects regardless

of future health. Many other early health conditions affect future schooling outcomes mainly

through their effects on future health, though they remain predictive of future use of social

assistance programs.       This may in some sense be good news in that it suggests that better

treatment of medical conditions as late as high school can help some children to succeed in

school.

          However, mental health problems at early ages have large and robustly estimated effects

on future schooling and social assistance outcomes, regardless of whether they go on to lead to

mental health diagnoses at later ages.    This result suggests that better screening and treatment of

young children with mental health problems, and/or education geared to these children might

have a significant effect on eventual schooling attainments.




                                                                                                  31
       Our overall conclusion is that health problems in early childhood may be significant

determinants of adult socioeconomic status, even in a country like Canada where all children

have access to health insurance.
