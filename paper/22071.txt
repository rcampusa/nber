Selection and Incentive Effects of Elections: Evidence from State Supreme Courts

                                         ABSTRACT

Using data on state supreme court judges for the years 1947 through 1994, we find that judges
selected by nonpartisan elections and judges selected by technocratic merit commissions produce
higher-quality work than judges selected by partisan elections. Election-year pressure reduces
work output, but only partisan elections reduce work quality. Moving from nonpartisan elections
to uncontested elections increases work quality for incumbent judges, while there is no effect on
incumbent judge performance when moving from partisan to nonpartisan elections, or when
moving from partisan to uncontested elections, consistent with the hypothesis that non-partisan
judges have a greater intrinsic value for quality.

1       Introduction
The decisions of public officials have a large impact upon our daily lives, yet they typically
face weak incentives for good performance. In the case of judges, weak incentives are a
design feature justified by the need to have them issue unbiased decisions in the public
interest.1 This is particularly important for appellate courts in common-law systems, such
as the United States, where judicial decisions have the power of law.2
    In the absence of explicit pecuniary rewards, what motivates good performance for public
officials? One possibility is the intrinsic reward from doing a good job, which may arise
when organizations have a clear “mission” that can motivate their members (Wilson, 1989).
Dewatripont et al. (1999) study the design of rewards in the presence of mission, and in
particular highlight the role of “professionalism” in encouraging task-specific skills, which in
turn increase the professional’s intrinsic incentive for work (see White (1959) and Wilensky
(1964)).3
    These ideas highlight the importance of selecting the right type of public official who
values work quality, and providing incentives that do not interfere with these values. Alesina
and Tabellini (2007, 2008) analyze decision quality under elections or bureaucracy. Tenured
“bureaucrats” are preferred for technical tasks, where organizations can evolve a mission, and
for protecting the rights of minorities. In contrast, elected “politicians” are more sensitive to
outcomes, and to the preferences of the median voter. The choice of one or the other system
is a practical question that depends upon the empirical magnitude of these factors.4

     See for example Epstein et al. (2013). The optimality of this policy follows directly from the Holmström
and Milgrom (1991) multi-tasking model when there are no good measures of decision quality.

     The state court websites provide up-to-date information on how appellate courts work in each state. See
https://www.ohiobar.org/forpublic/resources/lawyoucanuse/pages/lawyoucanuse-448.aspx for a
concise explanation. See Landes and Posner (1980) on the role of judges in common law systems. The
work of Djankov et al (2008) has been influential in documenting how variation in legal systems, including
the effectiveness of judicial decision making, can affect economic performance. Klerman and Mahoney (2005)
provide additional historical evidence linking increases in judicial independence with increased economic per-
formance.

    The purpose of this paper is to estimate the effect upon performance of changing the
appointment procedure for state appellate courts. We do this by exploiting the changes in
the way state supreme court judges are selected in the United States over the period 1947-
1994. These courts serve as the state judiciary’s analogue to the U.S. Supreme Court and
have the authority to review laws produced by state legislatures and decisions produced by
lower state courts. Thus state supreme court judges are some of the most powerful officials in
state government. These judges are the last appeal on some of the most important features
of common law, including most rules on contract, property, tort, and crimes.
    The identification of the effect of appointment procedure relies on two ingredients. First,
over this period of time U.S. states experimented with different methods of appointing judges.
Second, the job of a supreme court judge does not change much over the course of the career,
and it does not vary across states. The main component of the job is to write an opinion
explaining the court’s decision. This involves working (mainly with clerks, and not with other
judges) to research the relevant case law, reason through the implications for present and
future litigants, and introducing a precedent that future judges in the state must follow.5
Judges do not write all the text of their opinions, however they are responsible for each
decision they sign. The quality of judges depends not only upon their native skills as a
writer of legal arguments, but also as an individual who hires and manages law clerks that
assist in this activity. Thus, if we find that some judges perform better than others, then we
are providing some direct evidence on the importance of management for performance.6
    We construct two classes of performance measures. The first of these is “output”. This
includes number of cases heard, total words written, and citations to other cases. These
roughly measure time on the job. The second class of performance measures correspond to
“quality”. Given that the job of an appellate judge is to clarify and in some cases create new
law, legal scholars measure quality by the frequency with which the decisions of a judge are
cited in future cases, both within-state and out-of-state.7
    While the task of a judge is similar from state to state, the rules for selecting and retaining
appellate judges vary across states and over time. These rules are listed in Table 1, with rule
changes indicated by cell borders. A graphical representation of these changes is included in
choice of institution (removable “politician” or unaccountable “judge”); election pressure can cause officials
to modify their decisions to reflect the interests of the electorate.

Appendix Figure 3.
    In this study we are concerned with three types of appointment systems: partisan elec-
tions, non-partisan elections and appointment by the state governor. The first system, parti-
san elections, is used for both selection of new judges and retention of incumbent judges. For
these elections, judges represent a political party, Republican or Democrat, that is clearly
identified on the ballot. They must win a primary election for their party before running in
a general election. Incumbent judges rarely face a credible challenge in the primary, but in
the general election they usually face a challenger from the opposing political party.
    The second system, nonpartisan elections, are also used for both selection and retention.
In this system there are competitive elections, but there are no primaries and party affiliations
are not on the ballot. There are generally two candidates, an incumbent and a challenger,
but the incumbent is not identified as such.
    The third major system is merit selection with uncontested retention elections, also known
as the Missouri Plan. In this system, judges are nominated by a commission of experts –
senior attorneys and retired judges – and confirmed by the governor. Incumbent judges
face an up-or-down retention vote with no challenger. This system is designed to be more
meritocratic, and to impose weaker political incentives, than electoral selection.8
    There is an extensive discussion in the political science literature of the reasons for these
different systems, and the effect they have upon judicial decisions, that we discuss briefly
in the next section. This work is concerned with the politics of decision-making, and when
judges make decisions that pander to one political party or the other. Our concern here
is with the labor economics of this particular market for experts. By an expert we mean
any person who is engaged to carry out tasks for which the employer is not qualified to do.
Doctors, lawyers or financial advisors are all experts whose demand for services depends
upon consumers buying (or in our case voting) with their choices. The question is whether
or not the non-expert decision maker is able to distinguish the quality of the expert.
    In our context, the question we are interested in is whether the appointment system
positively selects judges for their ability. In our earlier work, Ash and MacLeod (2015), we
   8
     There is a fourth hybrid system, where judges are initially selected through partisan elections but there-
after face uncontested retention elections. California has governor appointment but uncontested retention
elections. The other states either have some combination of governor or legislative appointment, both for
initial selection and for period retention. In Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Rhode Island,
judges have lifelong tenure. In Ohio and Michigan, judicial elections are difficult to classify within the parti-
san/nonpartisan dichotomy because they have partisan primaries and nomination processes, but the political
party is not on the ballot in general elections. Following Nelson et al. (2013), we classify these states as
partisan selection and nonpartisan retention. Alternative codings, or leaving them out of the analysis, does
not change our results.

found that on average appellate court judges do have a taste for quality. We were able to
show this by exploiting changes in their workload, that in turn led them to write longer and
more influential opinions. In the case of elections, we cannot expect voters on average to be
well informed regarding the quality of a judge. Moreover, since we do not have data on the
output of all potential candidates, we cannot measure the quality difference between winners
and losers. Rather, our approach is to ask the practical question of whether a state’s choice
to change from, say, a partisan election system to a non-partisan election system leads to a
change in the quality of the court.
    Choi et al. (2010) look at this question using data on the opinions written by all state
appellate court judges over a period of three years (1998-2000). They find that in the
cross section states with appointed judges have higher quality decisions, but produce fewer
decisions. These results are consistent with our results in Ash and MacLeod (2015) suggesting
that judges face a trade-off between quality and output. Given that these results are from
a cross-section they do not answer the question of what will happen when a given state
changes their appointment system.
    We have constructed a data set of all state supreme court decisions from 1947 until 1994
that is matched to a number of judge characteristics and state rules on judicial appointment.
The data on decisions was provided by Bloomberg Law, which includes the number of (pos-
itive) citations to each decision. With this data we can construct a number of measures of
performance and output. We find that states that move from partisan elections to either
nonpartisan elections and or technocratic merit commissions choose judges who produce
higher-quality work. We also find evidence that judges do care about re-election and put
effort into gaining re-election. This follows from the observation that in an election-year a
judge’s work output falls. Interestingly, if a judge is up for re-election under a partisan sys-
tem we also observe a fall in work quality. Moving from nonpartisan elections to uncontested
re-elections increases work quality for incumbent judges, while there is no effect on incum-
bent judge performance when moving from a partisan to a nonpartisan re-election system,
or when moving from partisan to uncontested re-election. These results are consistent with
the hypothesis that partisanship affects judge performance through the selection of judges
that have a lower intrinsic value for quality.
    The agenda of the paper is as follows. In the next section we briefly review the relevant
literature. Section 3 discusses the role of information in the judicial selection process. The
data and performance measures are discussed in Section 4, followed by a discussion of our
identification strategy and empirical analysis. Section 6 concludes the paper. The Appendix


                                               6
contains results from a number of robustness checks.


2    Literature
The literature can be roughly divided into two distinct questions. In economics there is
a literature that is concerned with understanding the quality of civil servants, and how
different appointment systems affect this quality. In our case these are judges, but similar
issues apply to any individual who is chosen to make complex decisions on our behalf. For
the most part voters do not have the skill set to carry out the choices that the appointed
individual is carrying out, yet they must decide who they should support for appointment.
    There is a literature in economics showing that electoral pressures do affect decision mak-
ing. Besley and Case (1995) use the variation in term limits to show that state governors do
respond to electoral pressure and reduce state spending where there is a binding term limit.
Besley and Coate (2003) show that electricity prices are lower in states with elected (ver-
sus appointed) utility regulators, consistent with elected regulators being more responsive
to consumers. List and Sturm (2006) show that electoral incentives drive decision-making
by governors on environmental issues. Ferraz and Finan (2008) find that voters respond to
information on corruption, and therefore serve to select out the worst politicians. Ferraz and
Finan (2011) find that mayors who are term-limited (and therefore face no re-election in-
centives) are more corruption, consistent with an incentive effect against corruption. Pande
(2011) reviews the literature in development economics on political accountability and finds
that voters respond to information about the political process and that politician perfor-
mance improves electoral accountability. In particular, the quality of information regarding
candidates plays a central role in explaining the quality of elected politicians.
    Like Choi et al. (2010) discussed above, Lim and Snyder (2015a) use the cross-section
variation in election systems to study the relationship with various measures of trial judge
quality in a sample of 39 states from 1990 - 2010. They find that voters are strongly
influenced by party cues in partisan elections, but add the caveat that trial court judges are
less important than appellate court judges in making law, which might result in less voter
scrutiny.
    There is also an important and voluminous literature documenting the significant impacts
of political motivations on decision-making. Hall and Bonneau (2006) have an interesting
paper that looks at the effect of a challenger upon the success of an incumbent judge using
data from 21 states from 1990 to 2000. They find that voters do respond to challenger


                                              7
quality. There are also a number of papers that focus upon the politics of decision making.
Specifically, does the appointment system affect the values that use to evaluate cases. A
key finding is that stronger electoral pressures are associated with harsher criminal sentences
(Huber and Gordon, 2004; Gordon and Huber, 2007; Lim, 2013; Berdejo and Yuchtman, 2013;
Iaryczower et al., 2013; Canes-Wrone et al., 2014; Park, 2014; Lim et al., 2015). Looking
at federal judges, Epstein et al. (2013) review the evidence that decisions tend to reflect
the ideological leanings of the president that appointed them. Besley and Payne (2013) find
that elected judges are more likely to support anti-discrimination law. Shepherd (2009) and
Canes-Wrone et al. (2010) find that retention elections cause state appellate judges to vary
their decisions in subsets of politically sensitive cases. Fouirnaies and Hall (2018) show that
U.S. state legislators who are term-limited decrease effort, in terms of sponsoring bills, acting
on committees, and being present for floor votes.
    Finally, there is a literature that looks at the information processing by voters. Early
work by Rahn (1993) shows that voters use partisan identifiers as a decision making short
cut. Using a combination of survey and experimental data, Bonneau and Cann (2015)
and Lim and Snyder (2015a) also find that partisan identification plays an important role
in voter decision making. Recently, A. Kirkland and Coppock (2017) provide some direct
experimental evidence that if voters cannot observe partisan labels then they put more weight
upon observable judge characteristics that reflect quality. In the next section we discuss how
such a mechanism may lead to the quality of judges varying with the type of system used to
appoint them.

In our data we observe the change in appointment system and link these changes to measures
of judge performance. The literature shows that when moving from a partisan to non-
partisan system voters are likely to use more information regarding judge ability. In this
section we show how formally this may lead to variation in the quality of selected judges. The
theoretical literature on voting in political science is well-developed and sophisticated (see
Ashworth and de Mesquita (2008) and Ashworth et al. (2017) for comprehensive reviews
of this literature). However, empirically we only look at the most basic features of the
environment - the division of appointment systems into three crude categories, and the
effects that these have upon basic performance measures.
    The relevant question is: How do these appointment systems change the performance of


                                               8
judges? To answer this question, suppose voters are faced with the choice between judge A
and B. We follow Condorcet (1785) and view voting as an information revelation problem.
The voter’s choose based upon some signal sj of a latent factor, qj . It is also the case that
voters care about the political views of judges, and hence they may be biased for one judge
over another. Let bj denote the bias term. Hence we suppose:

                                sj = bj + qj + γj , j ∈ {A, B} .

It is possible that the election system can affect the pool, both in terms of the levels and
variance. One can model this by setting:

                                          qA = m + δ/2,
                                          qB = m − δ/2,

where m is the mean ability in the electoral pool, and δ is a measure of the variance. Note that
without loss of generality judge A is assumed to have higher ability. Given that the elections
are relative races, then like other parameters, bias can be viewed as a single parameter in
favor of Judge A:

                                           bA = b/2,
                                           bB = −b/2.

This allows for nice closed-form solutions for the expected ability. Moreover, it is possible
that the parameters vary with the appointment system and future behavior of the judge. At
the time of appointment, the parameters are assumed to take on their expected values.
    Under the hypothesis that there is a common latent factor, and that voters prefer higher
q to lower q, then we may suppose that there is a representative voter who chooses the judge
with the highest value (see Rothstein (1991); Saporiti and Tohmé (2006)). Thus, the judge
selected in period τ is given by:

                                jτ∗ = argmaxj∈{A,B} {sA , sB } .                           (3.1)

The expected quality of the judge chosen in period τ is given by:

                                                        δ+b   1
                                                             !     !

3.1    Judicial Effort
Judges have the potential to affect these signals through two avenues. One is to provide
more information regarding themselves so that the voters can more accurately assess their
quality. Second, they can pander to the voters regarding their political views, and thus affect
                                                                        n      o
the bias in their favor. Let the effort of judge j be given by ~ej = eIj , ePj , and total effort
be given by ~e = {~eA , ~eB }, where I indicates providing information (not disinformation!) and
P refers to pandering.
   Suppose that bias is given by:

assumed that C 0 (0) = 0, C 00 (e) > 0 and there is an ē such that lime→ē C (e) = ∞. Suppose
that the utility that judgesget from obtaining office is Uj∗ > 0. Then the payoffs of the judges

    Notice that Judge A has an incentive to invest in providing information if and only if
δ + b > 0, while Judge B will invest if and only if δ + b < 0. Thus, only one of the two judges
has an incentive to invest in providing information, depending upon whether or not the bias
is sufficiently strong to overcome the quality differences.


                                                    10
    In contrast, both judges have an incentive to invest in manipulating the bias. Consider the
case where the bias is such that Judge A chooses to provide information to voters (eI∗ A > 0).
In that case the first order conditions for an effort equilibrium are given by

Notice that the Normal probability density function, f (), is symmetric and hence the term
in front of costs C 0 is the same in both expressions. Suppose that the gain from winning is
the same for both judges (UA∗ = UB∗ ), and Judge A chooses eIA > 0, then it must be the
case that the level of pandering by Judge B is more than by Judge A (ePB∗ > ePA∗ ). In other
words, the less-skilled judge does not invest in providing information on his performance,
but panders more to voters than the more highly skilled Judge A. This effect is reversed if
the bias is sufficient to make Judge B more likely to win.


3.2    Judicial Selection
Let us now consider how election success is affected by the parameters that are exogenous
from the perspective of voters. Suppose that they have rational expectations regarding the
parameters of the system. In general we cannot expect voters to have a great deal of high-
quality information regarding candidates, though as we discussed above there is evidence
that votes do have some information regarding judges. Given that both judges have an
incentive to engage in pandering, to a first order we can assume that it cancels out, and thus
we can take the baseline level of bias, b̄, as given.
   Given this and the equilibrium variance of signal quality derived from the previous section,
we have that the average quality of an elected judge in period τ is given by:

                                                                   δ + b̄   1
                                                                       !           !
                                             q̂τ = m + δ F                −   ,                             (3.3)
                                                                     σ      2

where σ 2 = σA2 + σB2 is the variance of the difference in errors. From expression (3.3) we




                                                              11
immediately get:

                                            ∂ q̂τ
                                                  > 0,                                         (3.4)
                                            ∂m
                                            ∂ q̂τ
                                                  > 0,                                         (3.5)
                                            ∂ b̄
namely, an increase in mean quality of the pool increases expected quality, all else held fixed.
Given that Judge A is assumed to be better, then bias in favor of Judge A increases the
probability that he/she wins, and hence increases average quality. Hence, the effect (3.5) is
of practical use if and only if we can tell ex ante who is the better judge.
    Next, notice that the effect of the two variance measures (δ and σ 2 ) also depends upon
the bias term. The positive bias case occurs when δ +b > 0. This ensures that the probability
of the better judge (Judge A) winning is greater than 1/2, in which case we have:

                                            ∂ q̂τ
                                                  > 0,                                         (3.6)
                                             ∂δ
                                            ∂ q̂τ
                                                  > 0.                                         (3.7)
                                            ∂σj2

Ex ante, the higher quality judge is not known by the voters, and hence it is more useful to
think about bias in terms of its strength. When the size of the bias is less than the variance
of the pool, |b| < |δ|, we call this the weak bias case, which also implies (3.6 - 3.7).
    In the strong bias case, the result depends upon the sign. If the bias is in favor of the
better candidate, then we get the above comparative statics. However, if δ + b < 0, then we
get:


                                            ∂ q̂τ
                                                  < 0.                                         (3.8)
                                            ∂σj2

The effect of δ is ambiguous in this case and depends upon the relative magnitudes of the
bias and the variance.


3.3    Application to Empirical Context
Choi et al. (2010) begin their article on judicial quality with a quote from Justice O’Connor,
concurring in Republican Party of Minn. v. White, 536 U.S. 765, 792 (2002):

         “If the state has a problem with judicial impartiality, it is largely one the state

                                               12
     brought upon itself by continuing the practice of popularly electing judges.”

Our goal is to explore the validity of this claim by exploring the natural experiment that
arises when states change the system they use from appointing judges. Consider first a
non-partisan system. In such a system judges are not identified with any political party,
and hence a priori the voters may not know where they stand on certain issues that are
associated with parties. In the context of our model, this is captured by setting the bias
term b̄ = 0. This also implies that in an election year a non-partisan judge may have a
greater incentive to pander to voters than under a partisan system, to let them know where
he stands on sensitive issues. Hence, compared to a partisan system, we might expect non-
partisan judges to spend more time in election year politics, which in turn may be reflected
in less effort on the bench. In our data we can observe election year performance, and we
can see how it affects both total output and the quality of decision making. In the case of
appointed judges, their reappointment is not determined by voters and hence we would not
expect to see any performance fall during years they are reappointed.
    Thus, the null hypothesis is that in an election year judges work at the same level as in a
non-election year. We expect this null to be rejected in the case of partisan and non-partisan
elections, with possibly a larger effect in a non-partisan election.
    In terms of the average quality of judges the case is far from clear. As we discussed
above, there is evidence to support the hypothesis that voters are influenced by the political
party. However, this does not necessarily imply less competition. For example, if party A
is more favored in a state, then individuals who want to be judges would know that they
should compete in A’s primaries (there are cases of judges changing political affiliation for
this purpose). See Hirano and Snyder Jr (2014) for some evidence on this point. In the
case of a merit panel we can suppose that they have better quality information Thus, again
the null hypothesis is that the appointment system has no effect upon the quality of judges
appointed. The theory suggests two alternatives to the null hypothesis:

  1. Suppose that both candidates are drawn from the same distribution. In partisan
     elections voters have less incentive to gather information relative to the non-partisan
     system, and hence we expect judge quality to be highest under a merit system, followed
     by a non-partisan election system, and finally the partisan system would have the lowest
     quality judges.

  2. Suppose that political parties use superior information to choose candidates, and the
     distribution of judges under a merit system is the same as the distribution of a randomly

                                              13
      chosen judge under the non-partisan system, then the quality of judges is highest under
      the partisan system, followed by the non-partisan system, then then the merit system
      would have the lowest quality.

The second result follows from (3.1). Namely, if appointment systems are not competitive in
the sense that the distribution of judges they select is the same as a single judge presenting
themselves for office, then election systems introduce an element of competition that improves
quality. Whether or not a partisan system is superior to a non-partisan system depends upon
the quality of the primary system.
    From the results in Ash and MacLeod (2015) we know that judges face a trade-off between
output and quality. Those results follow from exogenous shocks to workload generated
by the addition of intermediate appellate courts, and hence identified separately from the
appointment system. Left to their own devices we found that judges, like many academics,
prefer quality over quantity. By this, we mean they seem to prefer to write longer opinions
that are cited by their colleagues in the future. By measuring how the appointment system
affects output and quality separately we should also be able to uncover some information
regarding voter preferences over these different performance measures.


4     Data and Performance Measurement
4.1    Data Overview
The data-set used for the empirical analysis is an update and extension of that used in
Ash and MacLeod (2015). It merges information on judge biographies, state-level court
institutions, and published judicial opinions. For this paper, the dataset was checked and
rebuilt, with more information relevant to elections added or updated. These data allow
panel estimates on the effects of court institutions on judge performance.
    There are 1,628 state supreme court judges in our data. Table 2 reports summary statis-
tics on the characteristics of judges working in one of the three selection systems discussed
in the introduction. For many of the variables, the systems are comparable. Relative to the
partisan judges, the nonpartisan and merit judges are more likely to be female. Merit judges
are the most likely to have judicial experience, while partisan judges are the most likely to
have political experience. Nonpartisan and merit judges have longer career lengths. Merit
judges are the least likely to lose re-election.
    Our performance measures were constructed from published state supreme court opinions

     Notes. Biographical information by judge election system. Observation is a judge. Start Age is judge age upon joining the court. Female is a
     dummy for being female. Top School means the judge attended law school at Yale, Harvard, Columbia, Stanford, or Chicago. The Previous
     Experience items equal one if the judge has previous experience in the respective area. Republican is a dummy for being Republican, Democrat
     for being Democrat. Career Length is number of years working on the court, conditional on having left the court before 2014. The How Ended
     items equal one if the judge's state supreme court judgeship ended for this reason.
for the years 1947 through 1994, obtained (along with some annotated meta-data) from
bloomberglaw.com. The full sample includes 1,024,261 cases. We drop opinions that do
not have a named author (per curium decisions), resulting in a sample of 404,928 majority
opinions. This is an average 47.2 cases per judge per biennium.


4.2    Measuring Judge Performance
An important step in this research is to provide an effective measure of judge performance.
We focus on two simple metrics for judge performance, work output and work quality. The
measures build off of work by previous researchers, in particular Choi et al. (2010) and
Epstein et al. (2013).
    The baseline measure of work output is the total number of words written by a judge in
opinions during a year on the job. This is a measure of the total volume of opinion-writing
work that a judge is responsible for in that year. As alternatives to assess robustness, we
look at number of sentences written and number of characters written.
    Work quality is measured by the number of citations to a judge’s opinions. Judges in
a common-law system cite previous cases that are useful to their decision, and therefore
citations can be seen as an expert evaluation of peer decision quality (Posner, 2008). More
citations means that a case (and the authoring judge) have a stronger influence on the path
of the law.
    The citations measure is per case (divided by number of cases), so it is workload-adjusted.
Citations are annotated as positive, negative, or distinguishing by the data provider, so for
the baseline we look only at positive citations. As alternative measures, we use all cites
(including negative and distinguishing), discussion cites (where the case was discussed at
length by the citing court), and out-of-state cites (only citations in other jurisdictions).
Because state supreme court precedents have no bindingness in other states, out-of-state
citations serve as an especially strong signal of legal usefulness or influence (Choi et al.,
2010).
    To check for the importance of caseload changes, we report the number of opinions
written as an outcome. To help assess the relative importance of output and quality, we
also report a measure of work impact – the total number of positive citations to a judge in a
year (unadjusted for number of opinions). The appendix includes a range of other outcomes,
including measures of caselaw research and number of discretionary opinions written.
    This approach faces the challenge that the difficulty and importance of a ruling varies
from case to case, for reasons outside a judge’s control. This problem is exacerbated when

                                              16
trying to compare judges across different states (as done in Choi et al. 2010), since not only
lower-court characteristics but also a range of court and state factors might affect number
of opinions written, and citations to those opinions.
    The goal of the analysis is to make two key comparisons: first, to compare a judge’s
performance to other judges in the same court-year; and second, to compare a judge’s per-
formance to his/her performance in other years. A challenging feature of the data is that
the distributions of the outcomes are extremely variable across courts, judges, and years.
This means that, when making within-court-year comparisons, for example, court-years with
higher variance are upweighted in regressions using the raw data. In addition, coefficients
on treatments that affect different subsets of states will not be comparable, as the different
subsets will have different outcome variance.
    We address this issue by normalizing outcome variables within subsets of observations.
For the purposes of within-court-year comparisons (selection system and election cycle), we
divide the outcomes for each judge-year by the court-year standard deviation, meaning that
each court-year subsample will have variance once. In turn, for within-judge comparisons
(retention system), outcomes are divided by the judge’s standard deviation, meaning that
each judge’s sample of observations, together, will have variance one.9 We do not de-mean
the outcomes within the groups; de-meaning does not change the coefficients or standard
errors, but it does reduce adj. R2 substantially. In the replication notebook we show that
the state-year fixed effects and judge fixed effects each explain, by themselves, about 60% of
the variance in both outcomes (output and quality). Together, they explain about 80% of
the variance in output and 70% of the variance in quality.
    Citations are a joint measure of work quality and case importance. Some types of cases
are more important than others. For example, cases that review the constitutionality of
statutes are probably relatively important. In addition, judges have some discretion over
the types of cases they are chosen to author opinions for. If we want to compare the quality
of judges working on the same court at the same time, we need to try to account for these
non-judge factors.
    Empirically, we use the full range of dummy variables for the area of law of a case, as
well as the related industries of a case. These are coded for each case by Bloomberg staff
   9
    The main implication for our results is that we can compare the election-year effect sizes for partisan
elections and nonpartisan elections. Without this normalization, the non-partisan effect appears larger than
the partisan effect, but that turns out to be solely due to different variances in work output for these states.
The only finding that is different with variance normalization is the effect of partisan elections on quality;
without the normalization, this coefficient is still negative but not statistically significant. The full set of
results without variance normalization are reported in the appendix.

attorneys, and there may be up to three legal areas and three related industrial sectors for
any particular case. Summary tabulations for the most frequent legal areas and industrial
sectors are reported in table 3. The case characteristics vector includes a dummy variable
for each area and sector, equaling one if the case has been assigned to that area or sector.
Because there are so many of these characteristics, including separate covariates for every
category would almost saturate the dataset. Instead, we include the first five principal
components of this matrix of controls, which explains 65% of the variance of the matrix of
case controls.10
    An important issue is that a “judge” is not really a single individual, but a team of
individuals that includes clerks and secretarial staff. Judges select the clerks that are working
for them, and hence our measures can be seen as composites that depend upon both the
judge’s legal skill when researching, reasoning, and writing, as well as managerial skill when
selecting and directing clerks. As we know from Bloom et al. (2012), management quality
varies across firms, and there are systematic relationships between management quality and
firm performance.
    In our data we cannot directly disentangle managerial skill from legal skill. However, we
can ask if there is variation across judges in the same court, and/or across time within-judge.

    Using more or fewer components does not change anything. See the appendix for details. In the appendix,
we report results with log transformations of the outcomes. Taking logs does not change any of the main
results. It tends to strengthen significance in most cases.

izing out state-year fixed effects and case characteristics. This is the outcome variation left
over for use in the estimation of treatment effects. As can be seen in the figure, there is sig-
nificant variation in output and quality across judges, even after controlling for institutional
and case-level characteristics. Next, Figure 2 shows that our performance measures are pos-
itively correlated, both within judge over time, and within court-year between judges. In
the appendix we report plots of our judge quality measures over time for individual judges,
to illustrate that the measures can reliably distinguish individuals over time.
    To validate our outcome variables as judge-specific measures of performance, we explore
the extent to which they are correlated with another performance measure previously used
in the literature, the quality ratings issued by state bar associations. We were able to merge
our data for a small number of judges with the data on evaluations provided by Lim and
Snyder (2015b). We then regressed our performance measures on the bar evaluations with
state-year fixed effects, to see whether our quality and output measures are predictive of the
bar association evaluations of a “good judge,” as coded by the authors. Table 4 Column 3
shows that quality, but not output, is a strong predictor of the bar association qualifications
evaluation.11
  11
     An important caveat is that this difference is only identified off of three states where there were both
“good” and “not-good” supreme court judges during the time overlap (1987 through 1994). A second caveat
is the evidence in ? that attorney evaluations of judges seem to reflect partisan political affiliations and
ideological differences, rather than judicial performance.

5      Econometric Approach and Results
The empirical analysis follows the theoretical analysis. In turn, we look at election-year
pressures, then changes to the retention system, and then finally to the selection system.


5.1      Effect of Election-Cycle Pressure on Incumbent Judges
How do judges change their behavior over time in response to the election cycle? Ash and
MacLeod (2015) show that contested elections reduce judicial performance. We add to that
analysis by distinguishing between partisan and nonpartisan elections. In theory, if judges
wish to be re-elected then they should put effort into election-year politics. This in turn
would lead to a reduction in time spent on judging.
    The empirical strategy for examining the effects of electoral demands on judicial behavior
is to exploit the staggered election cycle for identification of stronger electoral incentives.
The election schedule is arbitrarily assigned by history, so it is reasonable to assume that the
schedule is uncorrelated with other institutional or socioeconomic factors that might affect
individual judge performance. For this analysis we used data provided by Kritzer (2011),
supplemented by new data collection and checking by a team of research assistants.
    The electoral cycle is represented in our regressions as a vector of dummy variables Ejst ,
which equals one if judge j in state s is up for election at year t. The vector includes sepa-
rate indicators for partisan, nonpartisan, and uncontested retention elections. The dummy

                                                            21
variable is coded as a one regardless of whether the judge actually ran for election – this
is intended to avoid endogeneity problems from the judge’s choice whether to actually run.
Similar results were obtained using an intensity treatment variable giving the number of
years until the next election.
    One possible source of bias in this analysis comes from time-invariant characteristics of
individual judges. Some judges may have higher or lower performance than others on average
due to unobservable characteristics, and they may be up for election more often or less often
for any number of reasons. To deal with this possibility, we include a full set of judge-specific
fixed effects. Therefore any estimated election coefficients are relative to a judge’s personal
average.
    A second major source of bias comes from the time-varying changes in the court work
environment which may be correlated with the electoral schedule. For example, there may be
campaigning demands during election years on all judges – not just those up for election – if
they are asked to assist fellow members of their political party. To deal with this possibility,
we include a full set of court-year fixed effects. Therefore any estimated election coefficients
are also relative to the court average in each year. This means they effectively compare
judges sitting on the same court, working at the same time, but who are in different stages
of the electoral cycle.
    Our preferred specification is

                      yjst = JUDGEj + STATEs × YEARt + Ejst
                                                        0
                                                            ρ + jst                          (5.1)

where JUDGEj is a judge fixed effect, STATEs × TIMEt is a court-year fixed effect for
each state s and year t, and Ejst includes the election-year treatments. Standard errors are
clustered by state. Note that this gives the average output deviation for the year before an
election.
    The coefficient estimates from Equation (5.1) are reported in Table 5. In Columns 1
through 3, we see that both partisan elections and nonpartisan elections have a negative
election-year effect on work output. This effect does not change much when adding judge
fixed effects, case topic controls, or judge experience controls. In all cases, there is no negative
effect of uncontested retention elections on work output; if anything there is a positive effect.
    We don’t see much of an effect of election-year pressure on work quality (Columns 4
through 6). In nonpartisan and uncontested elections, the effects are clearly zero. In partisan
elections, there is a negative coefficient but it is not significant.
    The effects on work output observed under partisan and nonpartisan elections are driven

at least in part by a decrease in workload. Column 7 shows that they are ruling on signifi-
cantly fewer cases than their colleagues when up for election. Due to the decrease in cases
published, the election-cycle judges have significantly lower impact in terms of total citations
per year (Column 8).
    Table 6 extends the analysis to the alternative specifications for performance. These
results are in line with what we saw in the previous table. First, from Columns 1 and 2 we
learn that the electoral effect on output is not sensitive to how output is defined. Second,
we see negative coefficients for the effect of partisan elections on quality, although only “all”
citations is significant.

cations are reported in the appendix. We got similar results after dropping short opinions
(less than 3 paragraphs). We also got similar results when looking at different types of
cases (criminal, civil, administrative, or constitutional), when using logs of the outcomes,
including more case factor controls, or dropping the first and last year for each judge career.
Without normalizing the variance by state-year, or when normalizing by judge, the effects
of partisan elections on quality goes to zero. When weighting by number of opinions, the
effect of non-partisan elections is larger, and the effect of partisan elections is smaller and
not significant.
    The election-cycle results suggest that contested elections reduce output, while uncon-
tested elections have no effect. Since uncontested elections are non-competitive by design,
the null effect here is unsurprising.12 In addition, partisan elections tend to reduce work
quality, but not nonpartisan elections. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that
partisan judges have a less preference for producing high quality decisions. The fact that in
election years there is a fall in performance is consistent with the hypothesis that voters do
care, and that judges do need to spend time to get re-elected.


5.2     Effect of Retention Process on Incumbent Judges
This subsection reports the results on how changing the system for judge retention affects the
performance of sitting judges. The theory predicts that judges will work to get re-elected,
though their choice between pandering and providing information regarding their work qual-
ity depends upon which factor is more important for their re-election chances. We identify
the effect of the re-election system using discrete changes in the rules for retaining state
supreme court judges. Four states moved from partisan retention elections to nonpartisan
retention elections: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, and Utah. Eight states moved from parti-
san retention to uncontested retention elections: Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas,
Nebraska, New Mexico, and Oklahoma. Six states moved from nonpartisan retention to
uncontested retention: Arizona, Florida, Maryland, South Dakota, Utah, and Wyoming.13
    The regression framework is a standard differences-in-differences approach based on
Bertrand et al. (2004). To control for time-invariant judge characteristics that may be
correlated with the retention system in various states, we include judge fixed effects. To
control for national trends in performance, we include year fixed effects. To control for pre-

      Note that since the mid-1990s, third-party funding for negative advertising in Missouri Plan elections
has increased significantly. Our results may not extend to more recent years (our panel ends in 1994). This
is an important area for future research.

existing state trends in performance that may be confounded with the reforms, we include
state-specific linear trends. In the strictest specification, we include controls for a number
of other rules affecting the judiciary, notably state expenditures on courts.
    We measure effects in a ten-year window before and after the reforms. The regressions
include an indicator equaling one for the baseline time window of ten years before and ten
years after a change to the retention system. The treatment variable is a dummy for the
ten years after the change. Thus, with the inclusion of the judge fixed effects, the estimates
can be interpreted as the average difference in within-judge performance for the ten years
after the policy change relative to the ten years before the policy change. In a handful of
states, we shrank the time window if the reform occurred close to the beginning or end of the
sample.14 A graphical representation of the windows is included in Appendix Figure 3. In
the appendix we include a table using other time windows; our main result on nonpartisan
judges and quality is a somewhat lagged effect that is statistically significant with an effect
window of at least eight years.
    Formally, we estimate

             yjst = YEARt + JUDGEj + STATEs × t + R̄st
                                                    0

                                                                     0

where YEARt is a fixed effect for the two-year period t, JUDGEj is a judge fixed effect, and
STATEs ×t is a state-level linear time trend for state s. The term R̄st is a vector of indicators
equaling one for the baseline time windows of ten years before and ten years after each of
the retention reforms. Rst is a vector of treatment indicators for the ten years after each rule
change (with ρ measuring the corresponding causal effects of interest). Xjst includes other
state and judge controls, namely variables for case topic and other court-related policies.
Standard errors are clustered by state and year.
    Table 7 reports the estimates for ρ from Equation 5.2. First, in Columns 1 through 3
we look at effects of the rule changes on average judge output. There is an inconsistently
significant negative effect of moving from partisan to nonpartisan elections. Effects for
partisan-to-uncontested and nonpartisan-to-uncontested, change a lot across specifications.
    Next, Columns 4 through 6 show no effect of moving from partisan to nonpartisan elec-
tions, or moving from partisan to uncontested, on work quality. However, there is a positive

     These reforms are mostly enacted by voters through ballot referendums administered in November and
officially going into effect the subsequent January. In these cases the dummy variable would turn on in the
year following the vote. In cases where the policy is effective in the first half of the year, it is coded as
turning on in that year. Note that Florida changes from partisan to nonpartisan and then to uncontested
elections. Our results do not change substantially if Florida is left out of the analysis.

and statistically significant effect when moving from a nonpartisan system to uncontested
elections. This result is insensitive to the addition of state time trends, judge experience
controls, and a range of state-level policy controls.
    In terms of caseload (Column 7) and total citations (Column 8), there are no effects
for partisan to nonpartisan, nor for nonpartisan to uncontested. We see positive effects for
partisan to uncontested, but these are sensitive to the inclusion of trends and controls.
    Finally, Table 8 adds to the results with the alternative outcomes. In terms of output,
we see more consistent negative effects for moving from partisan to nonpartisan elections. In
terms of quality, there is a significant positive effect on “all” citations for the nonpartisan-
to-uncontested reform (Column 3). For discussion cites (Column 4) and out-of-state cites
(Column 5), the coefficients are positive but not significant at the standard thresholds.

                                                            28
    In the appendix and replication materials we provide other robustness checks and al-
ternative specifications. We got similar results after dropping short opinions (less than
3 paragraphs). The quality results were similar in magnitude, but more significant, when
weighting by number of opinions written, using log transformations of the outcome, or adding
more case factor controls. Dropping the first and last year for each judge reduced signif-
icance of the main quality regression. The retention effect is statistically significant with
an effect window of at least 8 years.15 There was no effect on probability of being over-
ruled by the U.S. Supreme Court. Finally, we dropped each treated state one by one; the
nonpartisan-to-uncontested effects on quality were significant in all regressions.
    These results provide additional evidence that electoral incentives have an important
impact on the performance of appellate court judges. In particular, the partisanship of
elections matters. When moving from partisan to nonpartisan elections, there is a reduction
in output, consistent with the hypothesis that nonpartisan elections are more competitive.
When taking nonpartisan judges and giving them tenure, meanwhile, there is an increase
in work quality. This is consistent with the idea from Ash and MacLeod (2015) that these
judges have an intrinsic motivation to produce high-quality work, and that with weaker
electoral incentives they will orient their time and decision choices away from campaigning
and pleasing voters, and toward writing good decisions that please their peers.
    On the other hand, when taking partisan judges and giving them tenure, there is no effect
on output or quality. This suggests, consistent with Judge O’Connor’s view, that partisan
elections are less competitive than nonpartisan elections. Because there was little electoral
pressure in the first place, eliminating those elections does not have a big impact on the way
partisan judges spend their time or decide their cases.
    Second, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that partisan-selected judges have
a lower intrinsic valuing of quality than non-partisan judges. When giving them tenure, they
do not value quality enough to invest in it with the newly available time. Because we found
above that partisan election cycles reduce output (and therefore seem to involve election
pressure), the evidence is more in line with this selection mechanism.
  15
    This delayed effect is likely due to the relatively long term lengths for supreme court judges. The
minimum term length for these treated states is six years, the maximum is ten years, and the average is 7.8
years. Therefore one would expect a delay in the incentive effect until the next election, which could be as
long as ten years.

5.3     Effect of Selection Process on Selected Judges
The evidence on election year effort shows that election pressure does count, and that poten-
tial judges do attempt to influence the vote. The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis
that judges selected under a non-partisan systems place more value upon quality than quan-
tity relative to a judge selected under a non-partisan system. This weighting does not
necessarily imply that they are worse judges. The effect of the selection system upon overall
quality of a judge can be measured in our data by measuring the effect of a change in a state
appointment system upon judges selected under different systems but working on the same
court.
    In Table 1 we see that four states changed from partisan selection to nonpartisan selection:
Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, and Utah.16 Seven states moved from partisan selection to merit
selection: Colorado, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Nebraska, and Oklahoma.17 Six states moved
from nonpartisan selection to merit selection: Arizona, Florida, Maryland, South Dakota,
Utah, and Wyoming.18 The goal is to compare the performance of judges selected before
these reforms to the performance of judges selected after these reforms.
    We control for time-varying state-specific factors by including a full set of court-year
(interacted) fixed effects. This specification effectively compares the performance of judges
sitting on the same court at the same time, but selected under different regimes. We include
case characteristics to address the issue of endogenous selection of case types to judge types.
In the strictest specification, we include a set of covariates for judge personal characteristics.
These include controls for judge starting age, gender, political party, and whether they come
from a top law school.

     Florida moved from nonpartisan to merit five years after the partisan to nonpartisan reform, and only
four judges were selected under the nonpartisan system. Therefore Florida is excluded from the baseline
selection regressions, but including it does not change the results.
  17
     Tennessee moved to merit selection in 1972, but moved back to partisan selection in 1978. Only one
judge was selected by the merit process so it is not included in the analysis.

the average difference in performance between judges selected under the new system and
judges selected under the old system, controlling for other time-varying state-level factors.
Standard errors are clustered by state and year, where generally we got smaller standard
errors with clustering by state, clustering by state-year, or not clustering.
    Table 9 reports the estimates from Equation (5.3) for our baseline set of outcomes. First,
in Columns 1 through 3, we do not see any robust selection effect on output. Judges selected
by partisan elections, non-partisan elections, and merit commissions write about the same
number of words per year.
    In Columns 4 through 6, however, wee see significant effects on work quality. Relative to
their partisan-elected colleagues, nonpartisan-elected judges write higher-quality decisions.
In turn, merit-selected judges also write higher-quality decisions than partisan-elected col-
leagues. This effect is not driven by differences in the types of cases they are assigned
(Column 5). It is also not explained by judge demographic characteristics (Column 6).
    As seen in Column 7, there is no significant difference between judges in terms of the
number of opinions they are assigned. As a result, the effect on total citations to a judge in
a year (Column 8) is positive for both nonpartisan relative to partisan, and merit relative
to partisan. Meanwhile, there is a marginally significant negative difference between merit-
selected judges and nonpartisan-elected colleagues.
    Table 10 reports the selection-system effects for some additional measures of output and
quality. In Columns 1 and 2, we see again that there is no difference between the types of
judges in terms of output. Columns 3 through 5 show that in the case of quality, there are
robust differences between the systems. When looking at all citations (including negative and
distinguishing, not just positive) or discussion citations (where the previous cases is actively
discussed), there are significant positive differences between nonpartisan and partisan, and
between merit and partisan. In the case of out-of-state citations, the effect of nonpartisan
(from partisan) is no longer significant, but strongly significant for merit selection (relative
to partisan).
    We ran a number of robustness checks and alternative specifications, which are reported
in the replication materials. In general, the results on partisan-to-merit are more robust
than the results on partisan-to-nonpartisan. The results were not sensitive to subsetting by
type of case (criminal, civil, etc.), using log transformations, dropping first and last year
of each judge career, or adding more case characteristics components. Without normalizing
fill a vacant seat, rather than being initially selected through a competitive electoral process. We still code
the appointed judges as being selected under the electoral system – since the predecessor’s choice whether
to step down is endogenous to the system.

the variance within court year, some of the results on work quality are only significant at
the 10%, rather than 1% or 5%, level. The results were of similar magnitude, but more
statistically significant, when weighting by number of opinions written. The results on
partisan-to-nonpartisan were somewhat sensitive to the “window” before and after the form
for including judges: if you only look at judges selected 5 years either side of the reform,
the effect is not significant, but the effect is seen when including judges selected at least 10
years either side of the reform. Adding state-specific trends in judge starting year shrinks the
coefficients; the effects are significant only with clustering by state-year (rather than two-
way clustering by state and year). When requiring that there be at least 2 judges selected
from each system, the effect of partisan-to-nonpartisan shrinks and is no longer significant.
Finally, we dropped each treated state one by one; the partisan-to-nonpartisan results were
unaffected, while the partisan-to-merit effects shrank and became marginally insignificant
when either Indiana or Oklahoma were dropped.
    Overall, these results point to the importance of selection systems for the quality of
judge decision-making. Partisanship of election processes reduces decision quality, but not
total output. From A. Kirkland and Coppock (2017) we know that partisan labels leads
to less scrutiny of the candidates. Hence this finding is consistent with the hypothesis that
the primary system does not select better candidates than an at large election. In these
regressions there seems to be little difference in quality between a non-partisan systems and
merit systems.


6    Conclusion
The goal of this paper has been to contribute some evidence regarding the hypothesis that
the choice between a “politician” and “bureaucrat” entails a trade-off between a sensitivity
to the desires of the electorate and the execution of the mission to make high quality legal
decisions (Maskin and Tirole, 2004; Alesina and Tabellini, 2007, 2008). A substantial body of
work documents that public officials respond to the preferences of the electorate (Ashworth,
2012). We complement this literature with evidence on the other side of the balance sheet:
how electoral pressures interact with a judge’s mission to provide high work quality. Sitting
judges spend more time on their work in response to a weakening of re-election pressure, and
they make decisions that are evaluated as higher-quality by other judges. Moreover, judges
selected by a technocratic merit commission are of higher quality. The results are detailed
in Table 11.

    For incumbent judges, we find that contested systems reduce output in election years,
but not uncontested elections. This is consistent with a simple model in which campaign
effort takes time away from judging. Moving from nonpartisan to uncontested elections
increases case quality, consistent with the notion that nonpartisan contested elections are
more demanding of a judge’s time than uncontested elections. There is no within-judge effect
of moving from partisan to uncontested elections, reflecting that nonpartisan elections are
most competitive – due to less bias than partisan elections. Finally, the merit-based selection
process selects better judges than the election systems. These results are consistent with a
selection model where better-informed experts can choose higher-quality officials than voters
on average.
    Our evidence is broadly in line with the early rational-choice approaches of Downs (1957)
and Ferejohn (1986), in which voters use their information to make the best decisions they
can, conditional upon their policy preferences. But more information is not always better;
more information on candidate quality can improve performance (see Pande, 2011), but more
information on political affiliation can reduce performance.
    Should all states immediately move to a merit system with uncontested retention elec-
tions? Our evidence would certainly strengthen arguments to do so. But there are other
criteria besides judicial citations for ranking courts, and ballot referenda for the merit plan
have failed many times. There may be many other social impacts of these courts, but at
present there aren’t data-driven ways to measure them. There is an ongoing debate on which
is the superior system (e.g. Pozen, 2010); the fact that states continue to experiment with
different systems suggests that it is not clear which system is optimal. If a single system were
clearly optimal, then we would have expected the market to have moved in that direction
quickly, consistent with Posner’s (1987) view that legal institutions move in the direction of
efficient exchange.
    The fact that we do find a pattern of effects predicted by our simple model helps explain
why there is experimentation. While the results are consistent with merit commissions
selecting better judges, judging is not a purely technical activity. The political views of
judges color the ideological content of their decisions (see Epstein et al., 2013), which may
explain why many jurisdictions prefer to give voters a clear signal of the political views of
judges. Optimizing states would change systems only if it led to an improvement; hence at
any point in time there should be only small variation across states (as Choi et al. (2010)
find).20

      The issue here is similar to the well-known Roy model in economics. One cannot use cross-sectional data

    Finally, our results highlight the fact that the American legal system is neither simple nor
static. It is a complex, dynamic system consisting of a number of interlocking ingredients.
Our study focuses upon one of the most important and influential ingredients of this system:
the U.S. state supreme court judges who rule on all aspects of private law, including contract,
tort, and property law. Our evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that these judges are
professionals who are interested in enhancing the quality of the law. Hence, we have observed
many states moving away from partisan political processes for selection toward nonpartisan
and merit-based processes. These more “bureaucratic” systems have selected better judges
and imposed incentives more aligned with the mission of increasing the quality of American
law.




to measure the impact of a location on wages due to the self-selection by workers; similarly, one cannot use
cross-sectional data to measure the impact of selection systems on judge performance due to self-selection
of judges across states. See Heckman and Honore (1990) for details.

A     Appendix
This appendix includes some further notes on the data and the institutional reforms, as well
as further regression specifications.


A.1     Notes on Institutional Reforms
This section provides some notes on the institutional reforms. The key point is that there
were often coterminous reforms, such as the introduction of an intermediate appellate court.
To deal with this we ran all the regressions while leaving one state out. None of the re-
sults were substantially changed in these checks. Note that these coterminous reforms only
threaten identification in the analysis of retention-process reforms. When we look at the
electoral cycle and when we look at selection effects, we are holding court-specific incentives
constant.
    Colorado instituted an intermediate appellate court in 1971, four years after the election
reform. Changing Colorado to a four year window does not change the results. Florida
moved from partisan to nonpartisan elections in 1972, then moved from nonpartisan to merit-
uncontested in 1977. In the retention-process regressions we treat these as separate reforms
with five-year effect windows. Removing Florida from the regressions does not change the
results.
    At the same time that Illinois changed from partisan retention to uncontested retention
(November 1962), the state also increased judge term lengths from nine years to ten years.
However, the term-lengths change went into effect in January 1963, two years before the
election reform went into effect.
    At the same time it moved from partisan to merit-uncontested, Indiana increased term
lengths from six years to ten years.
    Kentucky instituted an intermediate appellate court at the same time that it moved from
partisan to nonpartisan elections.
    The Maryland governor began selecting new appointees by merit commission beginning
in 1971. When it moved from nonpartisan retention to uncontested retention, the term
length was reduced from 15 years to 10 years.
    Oklahoma instituted an intermediate appellate court at the same time it moved from
partisan to merit-uncontested.
    In 1973, South Dakota increased its term length from six years to eight years, eight years
before the nonpartisan to merit-uncontested reform.

    Tennessee moved from partisan to merit-uncontested in 1972, then moved back to partisan
elections in 1975. It is not included in the analysis.
    Utah instituted an intermediate appellate court in 1988, two years after the reform from
nonpartisan to merit-uncontested.


A.2                            Appendix Tables
This section provides additional tables and empirical results.
    Figure 4 shows the distributions of the variances of the outcomes by court-year and by
judges. This substantial variation justifies the normalization of variances within these groups
of observations.
    Next we look at additional outcome variables for the set of judges analyzed. Figures 7, 8,

                                                                                           45
and 9 provide judge-specific plots for three potential outcome variables to measure output.
Respectively, they report the number of opinions written annually, the number of words
written annually, and “work output” the number of words written per two-year period after
residualizing on case characteristics. As discussed in the text, work output provides the most
consistent distinctions between judges of these measures.
    A host of other results (described briefly in the text) are shown in the replication mate-
rials.
