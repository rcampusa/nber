Gains and Losses from Potential Bilateral US-China Trade Retaliation
Yan Dong and John Whalley
NBER Working Paper No. 17366
August 2011
JEL No. F00,F1

                                             ABSTRACT

Two closely related numerical general equilibrium models of world trade are used to analyze the potential
consequences of US-China bilateral retaliation on trade flows and welfare. One is a conventional Armington
trade model with five regions, the US, China, EU, Japan and Rest of the World, and calibrated to a
global 2009 micro consistent data set. The other is a modified version of this model with monetary
non neutrals and including China’s trade surplus as an endogenous variable.

Who may gain or loss from global trade conflicts spawned by adjustment pressures in the post crisis
world is much debated. In a US-China trade conflict, Europe and Japan would seem gainers from preferential
access to US and Chinese markets. The loss of markets would hurt the US, but moving closer to an
optimal tariff could be the source of terms of trade gains. And the ease of substitution across trading
partners practices would determine costs for China.

Results from the conventional model suggest that retaliation between the two countries can be welfare
improving for US as it substitutes expenditures into own goods and improve its terms of trade with
non retaliatory regions, while China and non retaliatory regions maybe adversely affected. Results
in the endogenous trade surplus model from the central case model specification ,however, suggest
that both the US and the EU (the deficit regions) have welfare losses in most cases, while the surplus
region, China, and the ROW have welfare gains. In both models, when the bilateral tariff rates are
very high, gains accrue to the EU and Japan from trade diversion if the substitutions elasticities of
imports are high. Costs will are borne by the US and China in lost exports, lowered terms of trade
and adjustment costs at home.

1. Introduction

     Concerns permeate the global trade policy community today over the possibilities of
major trade confrontations occurring over the next few years centered on, but not exclusively
including, the US and China. These reflect a number of deep structural features in today’s
global economy.
     One is the continued high growth rate of and level of China’s exports and the seemingly
remorselessly growing adjustment resisting pressures in major export markets in North
America and Europe. With Chinese export growth currently running at around 30% per year,
exports are roughly doubling every two years and China now accounts for over 10% of
world trade. The adjustment consequence for labor markets in the US and EU seem major
and even growing larger, and with them will come more political pressure for protection.
     A second is the size of both the Chinese trade surplus and the US trade deficit and the
perceived linkage to the onset of the 2008 financial crisis. As a result, the G20 process which
the crisis has spawned has centered on the claimed need for rebalancing and with this
pressures build for reduced trade growth by China. A third is memories of the 1930’s and the
major trade compression which accompanied the breakdown of international economic
cooperation at the time. Kindleberger(1970) documents a near 80% reduction in US trade
that accompanied the 1929 depression and this past event reinforce the perceived need to
contain retaliation today.
       Previous simulation literature has only explored the potential consequences of
retaliatory trade sequences in simple two country stylized settlings. (see Johnson(1953),
Kuga(1973), Hamilton and Whalley(1983), Krugman(1991)). Here we go beyond this by
considering bilateral retaliation in a 5 country model where non participants in the retaliation
potentially benefit from preferential access to bilaterally protected markets. We also
explicitly explore the impacts of retaliation in models both of classical form with exogenous
trade imbalances (as in Whalley & Wang (2011)) and with monetary non-neutralities, fixed
exchange rates and endogenous trade imbalances. These two forms of model both use the
Armington assumption of product heterogeneity by country.
       We calibrate these models to 2009 data for US, China, EU, Japan and the Rest of the
World. We use nested CES functions in preferences and draw on literature estimates for key
elasticity parameters, and exploring conventional CES production functions. Factors are
assumed immobile across countries.
      Our results suggest a number of key themes relevant to the global policy debate on the
consequences of potential retaliatory episodes. One is that relative to existing 2 country
simulation literature, generally the impacts of bilateral trade retaliation on trade and welfare


                                               3
seem much smaller once other non retaliatory countries enter the analysis. Also, the impacts
on the two countries directly engaged in bilateral retaliation can (depending on parameter
specification) be welfare improving for both as they substitute expenditures into own goods
and improve their terms of trade with both retaliatory and non retaliatory regions. Non
retaliatory region can thus be adversely affected even though they have preferential access to
markets of retaliating countries, since while they seemingly benefit from preferred access to
retaliatory regions they suffer the adverse terms of trade consequences of the bilateral
retaliation. Finally, the impacts of bilateral retaliation emerge as highly dependent on the
chosen model structure. In models with endogeneity of the trade surplus (accommodated via
a fixed exchange rate regime, non accommodative monetary policy and reserve accumulation)
retaliation abroad which reduces exports and large reserve accumulation can reverse the
sign of welfare impacts relative to conventional models.
       We do not claim to produce definitive analysis of the potential impacts of a possible
US-China retaliatory trade episode. But relative to available literature we are able to show
the potential numerical consequences through the various sources of channels of impact
involved.

2. The Impacts of Bilateral Trade Retaliation between US and China
   using a Traditional Approach
    We first describe a traditional five region Armington competitive numerical trade model
which we have calibrated to 2009 data. We thus use a calibration generated parametric
model specification to compare counterfactual equilibria and different tariff retaliation
scenarios to assess the effects of potential bilateral trade retaliation between US and China
on the welfare of major world major economies. We do not explicitly compare post
retaliation Nash equilibria, since in a multi country (more than 2) model, these are complex
to compute. Existing numerical calculation literature for Nash equilibria does not extend
beyond 2 countries.
Armington Trade Model Structure
     More formally, the model incorporates 5 regions (US, China, EU, Japan and ROW)
indexed by j or m ( j  1,2,3,4,5 , m  1,2,3,4,5 ) to denote region ,and 2 traded goods
(manufactures and non-manufactures indexed i ( i  1, 2 ) to denotes goods. Goods produced
across the five regions are treated as heterogeneous (the Armington assumption).
      For each good i produced in region j ,we define the seller’s price (net of tariff) as
Pi j , and allow each region m to impose tariffs at rate timj ( region m’s tariff on good i
imported from region j ) on each imported good. These change as we consider alternative
retaliatory scenarios. Tariffs are set to zero for exports. Internal (gross of tariff ) prices for
good i produced in region j are thus

                        pimj  [1  t imj ]Pi j                                                                      (1)

     On the production side, we use a two sector (manufactures and non-manufactures), two
factor (capital and labor) structure. We assume production is CES, and the production
function for each good in each region is given by

                          
             Yi j   i j  i j ( K i j )   i  (1   i j )( Lij )   i

                                                                                  
                                                                                  1

     where Yi j is the output of good i produced in region j and i j is the substitution term
among components of value added (capital and labor) in sector i in region j, K i j and Lij
refer to the factors capital and labor used in production of good i in region j.  i j is
productivity parameter of sector i in region                                            j, and  i j are share parameters in CES
functions.

     On the demand side a single set of final demand functions applies for each region
resulting from maximizing a nested CES utility function subject to a regional budget
constraint. Within this functional form, a hierarchy of substitution possibilities applies, and
between the two kinds of goods (manufactures and non-manufactures), then between
composites of imports across sources and comparable domestic products, and finally
between similar products imported from the various trading areas. This is set out in Figure 1.

Model Calibration and Counterfactual Experiments
       We have constructed a model admissible data set for 2009 for this structure which we
use to determine model parameters through calibration . We use calibrated model parameters
to experiments for changes in country tariffs for the US and China as part of an assumed
retaliatory bilateral trade policy sequence . Alternative equilibria associated with different
bilateral tariff levels can then easily be computed. Our base case data captures 2009 trade,
production, and consumption by region.
      In Table 1, we report the 2009 base year date used to calibrate the model. GDP data is
from the World Bank’s WDI database. The EU-27’s GDP data is calculated by adding GDP
of member countries. Trade data is taken from the UNCOMTRADE database. F.o.b. exports
values as reported by exporting regions are used. Tariff data is from WTO Statistic Database.
Labor input data is from China’s NBS data .The U.S. Bureau of Labor of Statistics, Eurostat
stastistics and International Labor Statistics.

      For the central case model analyses there is limited literature yielding elasticity
parameters and so these are set as follows. The production elasticities are all set equal to 0.5.
The top level consumption substitution elasticity between manufactures and non-
manufactures goods is set equal to 0.5 in all regions. The second level trade elasticities
between domestic and imported commodities follow a “rule of two” as discussed in Hertel al.
(2009), that is the substitution elasticity between domestic and imported goods is set equal to
2. This rule was first proposed by Jomini et al.(1991) and later tested by Liu, Arndt,and
Hertel(2002) in a back-casting exercise with a simplified version of the GTAP model. The
third level elasticities, ie substitution elasticities between the four imported goods in each
country are also set at 0.5. We then change the third level substitution elasticities in
sensitivity analysis to change the strength of terms of trade effect.
       We have used our calibrated model to analyze the effects of bilateral trade retaliation
between US and China on welfare, terms of trade, production and trade flows. The scenario
we analyze is one of assumed progressive trade retaliation. In step 1, the US first imposes a
tariff at rate 25% on import of China’s goods, and in step 2 China’s reaction is a 25% tariff
rate on import of US’s goods. In step 3, the US increases its tariff rates to 50% on imports of
China’s goods and so on. This continues until in step 8 for which US and China each use a
100% bilateral tariff rate.
     All the results of impact of retaliation are calculated as relative to the base year
dataset.The welfare impacts of this trade retaliation sequence are measured as equivalent
income variations (EVs) by region, with the arithmetic sum of EVs reported as the
worldwide welfare gain or loss.
      Underlying the welfare effects given by the model are the effects of trade retaliation
between US and China on terms of trade. An improvement of the terms of trade raises the
price of a region’s exports relative to its imports; while a deterioration has the opposite effect.
If protection is below the level implied by a set of optimal tariffs, the terms of trade will
typically improve, but if the opposite holds they can deteriorate relative to the base case data.
The combined welfare effects can attributed to only changes in the terms of trade and the
domestic welfare impact of tariff distortion and these combine to produce the total effect.
      This simple decomposition provides a convenient point of reference for interpreting
model results. The measure used here is the net barter terms of trade, which measures using
fixed quantity weights the relative price in index-number form of a composite of imports in
terms of a composite of exports for each region. Here benchmark domestic production
quantities are used as weights, and the terms of trade are calculated as a producer price
index.

Model Results
      Results for bilateral retaliation between the US and China using the central case
specification of the Armington model are reported in Tables 2 and 3. These results show that
increasing protection in US and China yields substantial gains to the US and losses to China,
Japan and ROW. The EU experiences either small gains or losses under different levels of
bilateral retaliation between US and China.

     For step 1,when US initially increases its tariffs on China to 25%, the US has a welfare
gain of $67.215 billion, but while China has a welfare loss of $39.021 billion. For step 2,
when China retaliates and increases its tariff on US to 25%, US suffers a small welfare loss
compared to step1 and the US welfare gain relative to the base year falls to $59.753 billion,
China in contrast, has a welfare gain compared to step 1, China’s welfare loss relative to the
base year falls to 18.744 billion dollars.
      With increasing bilateral retaliation, US welfare gains increases, and China’s welfare
losses also increase, as shown in step 4 and 8, US has a welfare gain of 106.55 billion
dollars when the bilateral tariff rate is 50% in both US and China, and 177.007 billion
dollars when the bilateral tariff rate is 100%, China has a welfare loss of 34.908 billion
dollars when the bilateral tariff rate is 50% in both US and China, and 61.989 billion dollars
when the bilateral tariff rate is 100%. Japan and ROW have increasing welfare losses with
increasing bilateral trade retaliation between the US and China. Japan and ROW have
welfare losses of 18.028 billion dollars and 104.276 billion dollars respectively when the
bilateral tariff rate is 100% in both US and China. The welfare change in the EU is small, a
3.089 billion dollar gains in for step 1 and a -3.404 billion dollar loss for step 8.
      These welfare changes are collinear with terms of trade effects generated by the model.
Table 2 also reports the terms of trade effects for the bilateral trade retaliation cases. The US
always receives a terms of trade gain, because bilateral tariff retaliation diverts US
expenditures to US goods. Other regions suffer a deterioration in there terms of trade, but
the result is sensitive to the specifications of demand elasticities.
       Changes in trade flows by region from the bilateral trade retaliation between US and
China are reported in Table 3. Bilateral trade between U.S. and China decrease significantly.
In step 4, when the bilateral tariff rate is 50% in both US and China, China’s exports to U.S
fall 21.85% percent, and U.S.’s exports to China fall 25.72%. In step 8, when the bilateral
tariff rate is 100% in both US and China, China’s exports to the U.S fall 34.75% percent,
U.S.’s exports to China fall 40.05%. U.S.’s exports to other regions also fall with increasing
retaliation. World trade also shrinks with increasing bilateral retaliation.

3. Analyzing Bilateral Retaliation in a Model with Trade Surplus
   Adjustments
An Endogenous Trade Surplus Model
      The traditional Armington model set out above can be extended on to incorporate non
neutral monetary and exchange rate policy as in Whalley & Wang(2011). This endogenous
trade surplus model reflects a managed Chinese exchange rate and a monetary regime with a
peg and RMB inconvertibility. Monetary policy is non accommodative to the chosen fixed
exchange rate, and the excess supply of foreign exchange is accommodated by the Central
Bank as additions to reserves .
      This model characterizes reserve accumulation as driven by government or central
bank policy which sets non accommodative monetary policy given the exchange rate and
simply absorbs any excess supply of foreign currency it is offered at the set exchange rate
maintaining inconvertibility of domestic currency. This model embodies a simple monetized
extension of a conventional trade model but with the added structure that the trade surplus is
endogenously determined. The model we use specifies a monetary regime using monetary
non-neutralities reflecting the actual Chinese exchange rate and monetary regime. Given a
large trade surplus in China, if this is endogenously determined in the model the effects of
bilateral trade retaliation can appear as quite different.
     On the demand side of the model, utility functions are same as in the Armington model
with a 3 level nested CES form. To extend the traditional Armington trade model to
incorporate a endogenously determined trade surpluses (and deficits for others) we use a
simple monetized extension to a pure barter trade model with a transactions demand for
money and unitary velocity of circulation. In the 5 region model with the U.S, China, EU,
Japan and rest of the world, we assume that there are two kinds of currencies: the Renminbi
and the US dollar. The US, EU ,Japan and ROW are assumed to use the US dollar as their
currencies, and the money supply of the US meets the money demand of US, EU, Japan and
ROW.
      This two currency treatment is adopted for convenience, and to help us focuses on the
role of an endogenously determined Chinese trade surplus can play in assessing the impacts
of bilateral retaliation. China is thus assumed to fix its exchange rate and has non-
accommodative monetary policy, US is assumed to fix its money stock.

       From the 2009 data used for calibration the model, the surplus countries are region
1(China), region 4(Japan) and region 5 (ROW), while the deficit countries are region 2(U.S)
and region 3(EU). The sum of trade surpluses across all regions is zero:

     We assume the money supplies of region1 (China) and region 2 (US) are fixed at M 1
and M 2 . For simplicity, each of these two regions is assumed to have a constant unit
velocity in their transactions demand for money. In equilibrium, this implies:

Calibration and Conterfactual Analysis

    We use the same data set and elasticities in calibration with this extended model as in the
traditional Armington model for our central case analyses .To convert Chinese data into
units consistent with other regions data in $, we construct an artificial Chinese currency unit,
RMB* , which implies that 1 unit of RMB* equals 1 US dollar. To do this, ,we set as
RMB*  6.83RMB , the exchange rate of the US dollar to Renminbi in 2009. This
convention is adopted so that in calibration all equilibrium prices will be unity for both
Chinese and other regions goods and factors. We then examine a similar sequence of
bilateral retaliatory steps.

Results
      Table 5 reports the welfare impacts of bilateral trade retaliation in the endogenous trade
surplus model. Results are strikingly different with the exogenous trade surplus model. The
deficit regions, US and EU have welfare losses in most cases, while the surplus region,
China and ROW have welfare gains. Japan has small gains or losses under different levels of
bilateral retaliation between US and China. Bilateral trade retaliation reduces global
imbalances, as both the US and EU trade deficits falls and these two countries suffer welfare
losses. China and ROW have large trade surplus in base case, and bilateral trade retaliation
reduces their surplus, and they receive welfare gains unlike in the traditional model. Japan
has a relatively small surplus in the base case, and the sign of the effects of bilateral
retaliation on Japan’s welfare varies. China receives terms of trade gains with increasing
bilateral retaliation, US receives terms of trade gains, while the EU, Japan and ROW
experience terms of trade losses in most cases.

The results reflect the feature that in the trade imbalance endogenous model, countries
running surplus receive paper in return for put of their export of goods and the paper does
not directly yield welfare. Trade policy which reduces trade surplus thus yields welfare
gains to surplus countries and welfare losses to deficit country.
    The changes in trade flows by region that results from the bilateral trade retaliation
between US and China are shown in Table 6. Bilateral trade between U.S. and China
decreases significantly. For step 4, when the bilateral tariff rate is 50% in both the US and
China, China’s exports to U.S fall by 21.15%, U.S. exports to China fall by 19.68%. For
step 8, when the bilateral tariff rate is 100% in both US and China, China’s exports to U.S
fall by 33.26% percent, and U.S. exports to China fall by 31.36%. U.S. exports to other
regions also fall with increasing retaliation. World trade shrinks with increasing bilateral
retaliation, similar to the Armington model.

4. Sensitivity Analysis
     Results from both exogenous trade surplus model and endogenous trade surplus model
change as the parameter values used for the functions adopted vary. The key parameters are
the substitution elasticities between domestic and foreign goods (  d2 ), and the elasticity of
substitution between imported goods (  d3 ). Tables 7 and 8 give sensitivity results for
welfare and terms-of –trade impacts for 3 alternative elasticity specifications of both models.
      In the exogenous trade surplus model, in the central case, we use the settings
  2.0 ,  d3  0.5 . In the first sensitivity variation we set  d2  2.0 ,  d3  2.0 , Increasing
  2
  d

the substitution elasticity between imported goods, the welfare gain to U.S. falls, and EU,
Japan and ROW receive welfare gains. The welfare loss to China increases a little. For the
second sensitivity variation are set  d2  1.0 ,  d3  2.0 . Here, the welfare gain to the U.S.
falls further, and with increasing tariff retaliation, the U.S. receives a welfare loss, while the
EU, Japan and ROW receive gains. China suffers further welfare losses. These welfare
changes are collinear with terms of trade effects. Decreasing substitution elasticities between
domestic and foreign goods, the diversion of US’s import demand to domestic consumption
is less, and with a higher elasticity of substitution between imports, US demand is more
heavily diverted to EU, Japan, and ROW goods.
      In endogenous trade surplus model, sensitivity results are similar to those from the
exogenous trade surplus model. Decreasing elasticities between domestic and imported
goods and increasing of substitution of imported goods , the U.S suffers welfare losses and a
deterioration in their terms of trade, while the surplus regions of Japan and ROW gain.
China suffers a further welfare losses and deterioration in their terms of trade. The EU also
suffers a welfare losses.
      When elasticities between domestic and imported goods are low and substitution
elasticities among imported goods are high, (eg.  d2  1.0 ,  d3  2.0 ,) , increasing bilateral
US-China retaliations suggests that U.S. may lose in both exogenous and endogenous trade
surplus model. In Table 7 and 8, when both U.S and China have bilateral tariff rates as high
as 100% (in case 8), the U.S. suffers a welfare losses and a deterioration of terms of trade in
both models. Because a tariff by the US against China is effectively a tax on US exports to
China, the gains to the US alone from trade diversion will be smaller if the substitutions
elasticities between imports are high. The major loser may thus be the U.S.

5. Concluding Remarks
     This paper assesses the potential consequences of a US-China trade retaliation
scenarios on trade flows and welfare using two related numerical general equilibrium trade
models involving five major world trading areas. The first model is a conventional trade
Armington model with an exogenous trade surplus. The second model incorporates non
neutral monetary and endogenous trade imbalances structure. We calibrate these models to
2009 data, and using the calibrated parameters ,we analyze the impacts of progressively
increasing bilateral trade retaliation between US and China.
    Results from the first model using a central case elasticity specification suggest that US
as the large country would receive both a welfare and terms of trade gain under bilateral U.S
and China retaliation. Bilateral tariff retaliation diverts US expenditures to US’s goods.
Other regions suffer a deterioration in both welfare and the terms of trade despite a
preferential trade diversion effect .Bilateral trade between U.S. and China decreases
significantly. World trade also shrinks with increasing bilateral retaliation.
      Results from the endogenous trade imbalances model using the central case model
specification suggest that in contrast US and EU (the deficit regions) will experience
welfare losses while the surplus regions, China and ROW, have welfare gains, Japan
experiences small gains or losses under different levels of bilateral retaliation between US
and China. China receives terms of trade gains with increasing bilateral retaliation. The US
receives terms of trade gains, while the EU, Japan and ROW experience terms of trade
losses in most cases.
     Elasticity values in both models affect the results. The U.S lose in both the traditional
Armington and endogenous trade surplus models when the bilateral tariff rates as high as
100% ,since a tariff by the US against China is effectively a tax on US exports to China. The
EU and Japan can gain from trade diversion if the substitution elasticities among imports are
high. The largest cost will be borne by the US and China in lost exports, lowered terms of
trade and adjustment costs at home. With sequential tariff retaliation, Japan, EU and ROW
progressively gain preferential access to US and Chinese markets.
