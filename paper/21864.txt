                                             ABSTRACT

We study the effect of mean-preserving labor reallocation on business cycle outcomes. We develop
an empirical methodology using a local area's exposure to industry reallocation based on the area's
initial industry composition and employment trends in the rest of the country over a full employment
cycle. Using confidential employment data by local area and industry over the period 1980-2014, we
find sharp evidence of reallocation contributing to worse employment outcomes during national recessions
but not during national expansions. We repeat our empirical exercise in a multi-area, multi-sector search
and matching model of the labor market. The model reproduces the empirical results subject to inclusion
of two key, empirically plausible frictions: imperfect mobility across industries, and downward nominal
wage rigidity. Combining the empirical and model results, we conclude that reallocation can generate
substantial amplification and persistence of business cycles at both the local and the aggregate level.

1. Introduction
    Industries can experience idiosyncratic shocks, generating changes in the distribution of
employment. Whether such industry labor reallocation matters quantitatively in causing, am-
plifying, or propagating the business cycle has important implications for our understanding of
business cycles, labor markets, and the scope for policy in affecting business cycle outcomes.
Yet, the issue remains one of great debate.
    In this paper we study the employment effects of secular labor reallocation, which we define
as the change in an economy’s allocation of labor in response to mean-preserving idiosyncratic
industry shocks. We make two main contributions. First, we propose a novel method to
estimate the effect of secular labor reallocation on business cycles and implement it using a
confidential employment data set from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We find large negative
effects of reallocation on aggregate employment when the reallocation coincides with a national
recession, but roughly neutral effects when it occurs coincident with a national expansion.
Second, we build a multi-area, multi-sector search-and-matching model to interpret and extend
the empirical results. Together, the model and data indicate that reallocation can be an
important contributor to the amplification and persistence of business cycles at both the local
and the aggregate level.
    A number of empirical challenges have hampered analysis of the effect of secular labor
reallocation on aggregate outcomes. First, the small number of national business cycles in
periods with high frequency, high quality industry level data limit inference based only on
national variation. Second, reallocation within a business cycle may reflect cyclical sensitivities
that vary across industries (Abraham and Katz, 1986), and business cycles can cause permanent
reallocation of inputs (Schumpeter, 1942). Finally, we generally do not observe pure reallocation
shocks, i.e. mean-preserving demand or productivity shocks across industries.
    We design and implement a methodology that addresses these challenges. To circumvent
the small number of national business cycles, we use variation in reallocation and business
cycle outcomes across broadly defined local labor markets in the United States. To address the
problem of cyclical sensitivity, we divide the national business cycle into a recession-recovery
and an expansion period, where by definition the national economy experiences the same level of
cyclical “tightness” at the beginning and end of each subcomponent. Our metric of reallocation
consists of summing the absolute value of industry employment share changes between the
start and end of the recession-recovery or expansion cycle. We address the endogeneity of
reallocation to local conditions by developing a measure of reallocation exposure based on a
local area’s initial industry composition and the pattern of industry reallocation in the rest
of the country. Finally, we transform this measure of exposure to total reallocation into the
part based on mean-preserving shocks by orthogonalizing it with respect to the growth rate

                                           1
predicted by an area’s industry composition.
   We implement our exercise using confidential employment data by local area and industry
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Longitudinal Database, merged with the public use coun-
terpart of these data, the QCEW. We use the public use version to extend the analysis back to
1979. The resulting data set tracks industry reallocation and aggregate employment in more
than 200 urban local labor markets.
    An example illustrates the identification. The share of workers employed in the wholesale
trade sector has declined over the past thirty years, due in part to better inventory management
technology, while the share in health care has expanded in response to an aging population’s
rising demand for health services. By contrast, the share of employment at establishments
engaged in management of companies has changed relatively little. As a result, a local labor
market with employment concentrated in wholesale trade and health services would have ex-
perienced greater secular reallocation than an area with low employment in these sectors but a
high concentration of corporate headquarters. At the same time, the average industry demand
shock across these areas would be very similar. Our exercise amounts to comparing aggregate
employment outcomes in these two areas during national recession-recoveries and expansions.
    We have two main findings. First, reallocation has economically important effects on an
area’s aggregate employment growth during a recession-recovery cycle. On average, an area with
reallocation one standard deviation above the mean has employment roughly 2% lower at the
end of a national recession-recovery cycle. Second, reallocation does not have a meaningful effect
on aggregate employment if it occurs during an expansion. These results are statistically strong
and robust to inclusion of a variety of local area time-varying control variables, inclusion of local
area fixed effects, changing the metric used to partition time into recessions, recoveries, and
expansions, and excluding the areas with the largest shares of employment in manufacturing,
construction, or health care.
    The paper’s second contribution is to build a multi-sector, multi-area model of reallocation
unemployment and to discipline the model’s features using our empirical results. Each area in
the model consists of a number of industries, each of which contains firms and workers who
interact according to a search and matching framework. The shares of workers and firms in
each industry depends on industry-specific productivity and consumer preferences. In line with
the data, the model features two-way gross flows of workers across industries each period. The
model counterpart to secular industry reallocation is an increase in the cross-sectional variance
of industry-level productivities.
   We conduct the same empirical exercise in the model as in the data. Specifically, we define
predicted reallocation in the model based on an area’s initial industry distribution and industry
employment trends in the rest of the model economy, and compare outcomes across areas with
industry distributions which give rise to different amounts of reallocation but experience the

                                                       2
same mean shock. We repeat this comparison during an “expansion” in which the increase
in the cross-sectional variance of industry productivity constitutes the only set of shocks, and
when we combine the industry reallocation shocks with an increase in an interest rate wedge
to simulate a demand-induced recession.
   With only within-industry search and matching frictions, the mean-preserving spread in
industry productivities generates a small decline in employment regardless of whether it occurs
coincident with a demand-induced recession or not. Incorporation of reallocation frictions
and empirically plausible downward wage rigidity breaks this symmetry and produces a model
response of similar magnitude to that observed in the data. Intuitively, during expansions higher
wages draw job seekers into the expanding sectors, while wage compression during recessions
pushes the adjustment into a larger difference in job finding rates. The dispersion in job finding
rates produces reallocation unemployment, similar to the mismatch unemployment in Sahin,
Song, Topa, and Violante (2014). We provide evidence of such asymmetric wage compression
using hourly wage data from the CPS.
    Having disciplined the model to match the cross-sectional facts from the data, we next use
it to clarify the relevance of other proposed empirical signatures of reallocation. A popular
account suggests that a reallocation shock must engender high wages in the growing sector and
falling wages in the declining sector (see e.g. DeLong, 2010; Krugman, 2014). While strictly
true in our model, the magnitude of this wage differential can be quite small. Moreover, it is
precisely when this wage differential is small that the unemployment response to the reallocation
shock is magnified. The model also shows that reallocation shocks can produce a decline in
vacancies as unemployment increases, contra Abraham and Katz (1986). The increase in wages
in expanding sectors limits vacancy creation there, while at the same time wage rigidity reduces
the employer’s share of match surplus in contracting sectors, sharply reducing vacancies in those
sectors. The net result is that total vacancies fall following a reallocation shock.
    We also use the model to highlight the interaction of industry reallocation shocks and labor
market fluidity. Davis and Haltiwanger (2014) define worker fluidity as the sum of worker sepa-
ration and hiring rates, and find in a U.S. state-year panel data set that an exogenous increase
in fluidity raises aggregate employment. The same result obtains in our model. Indeed, the
positive correlation holds in our benchmark calibration even conditional on an industry reallo-
cation shock, as both fluidity and aggregate employment decline in response. More important,
higher exogenous fluidity mitigates the adverse employment consequences of a reallocation
shock by making industry transitions easier, suggesting more fluid labor markets may reduce
the volatility of unemployment in addition to affecting the mean level.
   Finally, we use the model to link our local area empirical results to national effects. We vary
the size of the mean-preserving productivity shock to generate variation in reallocation at the
national level. Reallocation has substantial effects on both the amplification and persistence of

                                          3
national recessions in the model. Thus, our results suggest that secular labor reallocation can
be an important contributor to the nature of local and aggregate business cycles.
    The paper relates to literatures on the causes and consequences of input reallocation and
business cycles. In an early and influential contribution, Lilien (1982) argued that sectoral shifts
were responsible for much of the fluctuation in unemployment in the 1970s, a point subsequently
disputed by Abraham and Katz (1986) and Murply and Topel (1987). The critiques of Lilien
inform our methodological approach. Debate over the importance of sectoral reallocation has
renewed in the context of the slow recoveries from the most recent two national recessions.1
   Methodologically, our paper follows Autor, Dorn, and Hanson (2013) and Charles, Hurst,
and Notowidigdo (2014) in using industry shocks to local labor markets. Autor et al. study
the effects of China’s export growth on U.S. commuting zones which had previously produced
goods exported by China, while Charles et al. examine outcomes in MSAs experiencing large
manufacturing declines. Our paper differs in its focus on business cycles outcomes. As such, we
construct a measure that does not rely on a specific source of variation in sectoral reallocation,
and also construct a model to interpret our findings. Our findings complement recent work
on the consequences of reallocation at the worker level (Jaimovich and Siu, 2014; Fujita and
Moscarini, 2013; Davis and Haltiwanger, 2014).
    Our general equilibrium search-and-matching model with nominal frictions builds on Chris-
tiano, Eichenbaum, and Trabandt (2015), and earlier work by Walsh (2005). We incorporate an
industry structure and labor reallocation frictions following Kline (2008), Pilossoph (2014), and
Dvorkin (2014). Downward nominal wage rigidity has recently been emphasized by Schmitt-
Grohé and Uribe (2013), Baqaee (2014) and Daly and Hobijn (2014), and following Hall (2005),
our implementation does not violate bilateral bargaining efficiency conditions (Barro, 1977).
    Section 2 explains our methodology and empirical identification strategy. Section 3 describes
the employment data and our concept of local labor markets. Section 4 presents summary
statistics of reallocation and local business cycles, as well as a series of specification checks of
our framework. Section 5 contains the paper’s core results on the effects of reallocation on
business cycle outcomes. In section 6 we describe the labor market model and demonstrate its
ability to match the patterns found in section 5. Section 7 concludes.


2. Measurement and Identification
    Our first contribution is to design and implement a methodology to measure the effects
of secular industry reallocation. Our strategy rests on three innovations. First, we measure

(2013); Mehrotra and Sergeyev (2012) for papers which highlight the importance of input reallocation, and
Aaronson, Rissman, and Sullivan (2004); Pilossoph (2014); Dvorkin (2014); Hall and Schulhofer-Wohl (2015)
for an opposing view. Sahin et al. (2014) stake a middle ground using an empirical decomposition.

reallocation over a full national employment recession-recovery or expansion cycle, rather than
period by period. Second, we define a local area’s exposure to reallocation based on its initial
industry composition and national trends. Third, we orthogonalize local reallocation exposure
with respect to other labor demand shocks associated with an area’s industry distribution.

2.1. Measure of Reallocation

     We start by defining an index of reallocation based on the change in industry employment
shares. The economy consists of A distinct areas, each with I industries. Let ea,i,t be employ-
ment in area a and industry i at time t, ea,t = Ii=1 ea,i,t the total employment in the area, and
                                                  P

sa,i,t = ea,i,t /ea,t industry i’s employment share. Define reallocation Ra,t,t+j in area a between
months t and t + j as the scaled sum of absolute sectoral employment share changes:
                                                             I
                                                      !                           !
                                                 12       1X
                                Ra,t,t+j =                      |sa,i,t+j − sa,i,t | .                 (1)
                                                  j       2 i=1

    The measure Ra,t,t+j is easily interpreted. The term in the second parentheses of Ra,t,t+j ,
1   PI
2   i=1 |sa,i,t+j − sa,i,t |, equals zero if employment grows at an identical rate in every industry
between t and t + j. The term is equal to one if all industries with positive employment in
t disappear by t + j. In general, this term is between zero and one, with higher realizations
indicating more reallocation. The first term, 12/j, translates the reallocation between t and
t + j into a monthly flow expressed at an annual rate, such that Ra,t,t+j ⊆ [0, 12/j]. For
the same area and time period, Ra,t,t+j is additive in the level of industry aggregation. For
example, Ra,t,t+j constructed over NAICS 4 digit industries equals the reallocation across 3
digit industries plus the reallocation that occurs across 4 but within 3 digit industries. As
an immediately corollary, Ra,t,t+j is weakly increasing in the level of industry disaggregation.
Finally, the measure has a natural economic interpretation when total employment does not
change between the two periods, ea,t = ea,t+j , a case of particular interest in what follows. In
that case,
                                              I                            I
                                        12 1 X   ea,i,t+j − ea,i,t   12 1 X   |ea,i,t+j − ea,i,t |
             Ra,t,t+j |ea,t =ea,t+j   =                            =                               .   (2)
                                         j 2 i=1        ea,t          j 2 i=1         ea,t

Equation (2) rewrites Ra,t,t+j as the minimum fraction of total period t employment that changes
industries between t and t + j, expressed as a monthly flow at an annual rate.
    The reallocation measure defined in equation (1) also has a close relationship to two measures
of period-by-period reallocation used in previous studies. First, Ra,t,t+1 is equivalent to the
sectoral dispersion measure defined in Lilien (1982) up to a first order approximation and
substitution of our L1 for his L2 norm. We prefer the absolute value to the squared metric
because it has less sensitivity to outliers. Second, Ra,t,t+1 is equal to the job reallocation rate

                                                      5
defined in Davis and Haltiwanger (1992) if total employment remains unchanged between the
two periods. Appendix A contains details of these comparisons.

2.2. Empirical Challenges

    We use a parsimonious model of production and demand across areas and industries to
illustrate the identification issues which arise with using Ra,t,t+j to understand how reallocation
affects business cycle outcomes. The model has a similar structure to that of the model in
section 6, but does not incorporate any of the labor market frictions which give rise to a causal
role for reallocation on area employment. It thus provides a valid benchmark under the null of
no causal effect and allows us to make precise the empirical challenges.

to τ̃a,t , industry-specific shocks to ηi,t , and area-industry shocks to τa,i,t . Up to a redefinition
of variables, this division is almost without loss of generality; for example, all of what follows
would go through with area-industry specific productivities ηa,i,t . Likewise, we need not specify
for now how labor markets or goods market clear.
   Industry and wholesaler prices freely adjust and labor can move frictionlessly across areas
and industries.2 These two assumptions ensure a common marginal revenue product p̄t ,

                        ln ea,t+j − ln ea,t =        ln      + εt,t+j + εaa,t,t+j ,                  (7)
                                                ζ −1    Φa,t

where εt,t+j ≡ −ξ (ln p̄t+j − ln p̄t )+ln Qt+j −ln Qt is an aggregate shock which may be absorbed
by a time fixed effect and εaa,t,t+j ≡ ln τ̃a,t+j − ln τ̃a,t is a local area shock.
    We interpret {ηi,t } as physical productivities, and {τa,i,t } as consumer taste preferences.
From equation (5), changes in the joint distribution of these variables will generate within-area
reallocation across industries. This setup does not, however, give a direct role to reallocation
in determining local employment outcomes ea,t , a subject we turn to in section 6. We proceed
for now by using equation (7) to illustrate the issues that may arise in a regression of local area
employment on reallocation.

2.2.2. Three Identification Challenges The first identification challenge arises because not
all reallocation results from a mean-preserving change in the underlying fundamentals. In
our simple model, a change in the distribution of {ηi,t , τa,i,t } which changes the index Φa,t
will have a direct effect on local area employment through the ln ΦΦa,t+j
                                                                        a,t
                                                                            term in equation (7).
Intuitively, some areas have more growth industries and others more declining industries, and
such differences affect local employment directly even absent effects from the need to reallocate
inputs. In our example, the special case of a mean-preserving change occurs if and only if
Φa,t+j = Φa,t ; more generally, the change in Φa,t constitutes a potential omitted variable.3
    The second problem mirrors the critique of Lilien’s period-by-period reallocation measure
by Abraham and Katz (1986). Abraham and Katz point out that industries differ in their
cyclical sensitivities. For example, demand for durable goods falls by more than demand for
education during a recession. As a result, the employment share in durable goods production
falls during recessions and the share in education increases, generating reallocation at the
recession frequency. In this case, however, the business cycle causes a temporary reallocation
across industries, rather than industry reallocation affecting the business cycle. Specializing
our example to two industries, a decline in local demand, εaa,t,t+1 < 0, might differentially
affect the consumer preferences τa,1,t+1 = τa,1,t + βεaa,t,t+1 and τa,2,t+1 = τa,2,t − βεaa,t,t+1 . Given
initial conditions τa,1,t = τa,2,t and η1,t = η1,t+1 = η2,t = η2,t+1 = 1, we would measure positive
reallocation, Ra,t,t+1 = 12( 12 )β|εaa,t,t+1 |, generating a negative correlation between reallocation
and local employment, but with causality running from εaa,t,t+j to reallocation Ra,t,t+j .
   The third challenge also concerns the direction of causality between reallocation and aggre-
gate outcomes. A literature stretching from Schumpeter (1942) to Berger (2014) has explored

  3
    Other authors have focused exactly on idiosyncratic industry or even firm shocks which do not net out
in the aggregate (Long and Plosser, 1983; Gabaix, 2011). One can view such shocks as combinations of the
mean-preserving shocks studied here and non-zero mean shocks.

                                                7
how the state of the business cycle might affect incentives for firms to restructure and hence the
reallocation of inputs. For example, a low opportunity cost of restructuring during periods of
weak demand might induce reallocation to concentrate during cyclical downturns, generating
a correlation between local reallocation and local employment without a causal effect of the
former on the latter.

2.3. Mean-preserving Changes and Predicted Growth

   A measure of predicted employment growth based on an area’s industry mix addresses
the concern of mean-altering changes in industry productivities and tastes. Let e−a,i,t denote
employment in industry i at time t summing over all areas other than area a, s−a,i,t = ee−a,i,t
                                                                                         −a,t
                                                                                                the
                                                     e−a,i,t+j
employment share excluding area a, and g−a,i,t,t+j = e−a,i,t − 1 the employment growth rate.
We refer to these objects as the elsewhere employment share and the elsewhere employment
growth rate. Following a literature beginning with Bartik (1991), we define an area’s predicted
                                                      b
monthly growth rate (expressed at an annual rate), ga,t,t+j   , where the superscript b refers to
“Bartik”, as

                 b
   Intuitively, ga,t,t+j predicts an area’s employment growth rate between t and t+j based on the
area’s industry employment shares at t and the common component of industry employment
growth across areas. To show formally why this variable may solve the first identification

challenge, it helps to write out ga,t,t+j  in the case of our simple example:

Bartik employment growth variable would then control exactly for the effect on local area
employment of a mean-altering change in industry productivities and tastes.

2.4. Reverse Causality and Predicted Reallocation

    We address the reverse causality concerns with a multipronged approach. The first and
most important involves defining the reallocation analog of Bartik predicted growth as the
reallocation which would obtain in the local area if employment growth in each local industry
exactly followed its elsewhere counterpart. To derive such an expression, we start from an

                                                                              8

employment share rescaled by the ratio of local area predicted growth to elsewhere total em-
ployment growth. The rescaling forces the term to sum to one across all industries. Intuitively,
an area with only one industry and where that industry is predicted to decline should have
zero predicted reallocation.4 Thus, the full term inside the absolute value is the appropriately
scaled contribution to reallocation for each industry predicted by elsewhere employment. When
                                                                    b
e−a,t = e−a,t+j , a derivation similar to equation (2) shows that Ra,t,t+j  has the interpretation of
the predicted net quantity of industry employment reshuffling between t and t + j as a share
of total employment at t, expressed at an annual rate.

2.5. Timing

    Our second innovation in response to the possibility of endogenous reallocation within a
business cycle is to measure reallocation separately over full national recession-recovery cycles
and expansion cycles. A full recession-recovery cycle starts at an employment peak and lasts
for T periods until the economy regains the previous peak’s employment level, which we call
the last-peak. Figure 1 illustrates the timing for total private sector employment in the U.S.
economy between 2006 and 2014. For comparison, the shaded area shows the NBER recession.
Using our timing convention, the peak occurs in January 2008 at 116 million employees. The
private sector regains its last-peak level of employment in February 2014, T = 73 months. The
period from June 2005 (the last-peak from the previous recession cycle) to January 2008, and
the period beginning in February 2014, are expansions.


Assumption 1 The cyclical sensitivity of national industry employment is the same at a peak
and a last-peak.

   4
     The scaling factor matters only when an area’s initial industry mix predicts employment growth very
different from the actual national growth rate. Such instances are rare, and all of our quantitative results
remain essentially unchanged if we omit the scaling factor. We thank Ivan Werning for suggesting it.

Notes: The figure shows our business cycle timing procedure as applied to national private sector employment
over 2006-2015. The shaded area indicates the NBER defined recession for comparison.



    Under this assumption, our timing convention addresses the Abraham and Katz (1986)
critique. Implicitly, a recession-recovery cycle consists of a temporary decline below trend, and
an expansion cycle a movement along the trend, similar to the “gaps” view of business cycles
advocated by DeLong and Summers (1988).5 We present evidence supporting this timing
assumption in section 4, and report sensitivity analysis to our dating procedure in section 5.

   Measuring reallocation based on the snapshots of industry employment composition at the
peak and last-peak effectively filters out any cyclical reallocation which occurs during a recession
but reverses during the recovery. The approach thus isolates secular reallocation trends without
requiring parametric time series models for either the cyclical component or the trend compo-
nent of employment shares (see Brainard and Cutler, 1993; Aaronson et al., 2004; Mehrotra and
Sergeyev, 2012, for articles that take the parametric time series approach). Together, national
                                                                      b
timing of peaks and last-peaks and predicted reallocation make Ra,t,t+T     pre-determined with re-
spect to local outcomes following the start of the national cycle, addressing the Schumpetarian
reverse causality concern.




   5
     The underlying employment trend excludes population growth for three reasons. First, the predicted
                         b
reallocation measure Ra,t,t+j   has the natural interpretation of the predicted minimum fraction of total peak
employment that changes industries between the peak and last-peak when et = et+j , as it does (up to discrete
                   b
time error) for Ra,t,t+T  . Second, there exist much better high frequency measures of employment than of
population at the local level. Third, we do not see an obvious alternative for how to adjust for demographic
trends. For example, not only has the national employment-population ratio not recovered its pre-recession
level as of the end of 2015, the peak of the series predates the 2000 recession as well. Similarly, the employment-
population ratio for prime age males did not regain its previous peak following any downturn since 1975.

                                                                                                     10
2.6. Empirical Specification and Comments
    Our strategy consists of exploiting cross-sectional variation in the part of predicted reallo-
         b                                        b
cation Ra,t,t+T orthogonal to predicted growth ga,t,t+T , and where t corresponds to a peak (or
last-peak) and T the elapsed time until the subsequent last-peak (or peak). We formally state
two further assumptions needed for this approach to identify the causal effect of reallocation.

Assumption 2 Growth rates of the same industry in different local areas have a common
component, and the loading of the local area-industry on the common component does not depend
on the local industry share.

The first part of Assumption 2 is a relevance condition for the Bartik predicted variables. It
will hold if the local area industry response to national shocks is positively correlated with
the national industry response. In our example, the relevance conditions holds trivially if the
{ηi,t } are not constant. The second part of the assumption states that when industries grow
they do not systematically grow more or less in areas where they already have large or small
                                                              b
shares. Through the lens of equation (9), Bartik growth ga,t,t+j    will prove an inadequate control
if changes to ηi systematically prompt differential changes to τa,i depending on the initial level
                                        b
of τa,i,t . The same issue arises with Ra,t,t+j and would affect the interpretation of the effect of a
unit increase in predicted reallocation. Fortunately, both parts of Assumption 2 have testable
implications: Bartik growth should predict actual growth and Bartik reallocation should predict
actual reallocation (part 1), and the pass through coefficient for predicted reallocation should
equal 1 (part 2). We verify these implications in the data and find strong evidence in support.

Assumption 3 Conditional on Bartik predicted growth, area-specific shocks are uncorrelated
with Bartik predicted reallocation.

In our example, shocks to the local demand determinant εaa,t,t+j must be uncorrelated with
residualized Bartik predicted reallocation.
                                                       b                                b
    Less formally, the two variables Bartik growth ga,t,t+j  and Bartik reallocation Ra,t,t+j depend
only on the industry distribution in a base period t and industry employment growth in other
areas between t and t + j. Fixing j, both variables are thus pre-determined as of time t
                                                                b
with respect to local outcomes. Under mild conditions, ga,t,t+j       has the interpretation of the
average labor demand shock implied by an area’s industry distribution. Therefore, the part of
  b                     b
Ra,t,t+j orthogonal to ga,t,t+j is the reallocation predicted by the area’s initial industry mix but
orthogonal to the direct labor demand consequences of that initial mix.
   The Bartik research design has the advantage of not requiring the researcher to take a stand
on the deep shocks determining reallocation in any given period, such as changes in technology,
consumer tastes, exchange rates, or trade policy. We do not often directly observe {ηi,t } and

 Notes: The bar graph displays two hypothetical industry distributions at the onset of the 2008-14 cycle.
The high reallocation area has predicted reallocation during the 2008-14 cycle of .89% per year, and predicted
employment growth of .001% per year. The low reallocation area has predicted reallocation during the 2008-14
cycle of .62% per year, and predicted employment growth of .001% per year.


{τa,i,t }. Rather, the evolution of employment shares nationally summarizes the consequences of
the combination of these deep shocks for reallocation, similar to the sufficient statistic approach
described by Chetty (2009) for welfare economics. The Bartik approach simply requires that
the deep shocks produce a common component of industry employment growth across areas,
and that, after residualizing with respect to the consequences for average labor demand, these
shocks affect local areas only through their effect on reallocation.
    Figure 2 provides a heuristic example of the identification strategy. The figure shows two
hypothetical industry distributions at the start of the 2008-14 cycle. The dark bars correspond
to an industry distribution which generates Rab of 0.89% per year during the cycle, while the
light bars give rise to Rab of 0.62%. That is, over the full cycle, an area with the distribution
given by the dark bars would be predicted to have an additional 1.6% of employment changing
industry between the national peak and last-peak. However, both the dark bars and the light
bars correspond to predicted employment growth during the cycle of essentially zero. Our
methodology amounts to comparing business cycle outcomes in these two areas.


3. Data
                 We implement our exercise in broadly defined local labor markets in the United States.
   Data on employment by county and industry come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
Longitudinal Database (LDB) and Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW).
The LDB reports employment by establishment and month and covers the period 1990-2014.
The source data come from quarterly reports filed by employers with state employment security
agencies as part of the unemployment insurance system; as a result, the LDB contains essentially

                                                                                                                                      12
universal coverage of private sector employment. Each establishment in the LDB has a 6 digit
NAICS code associated with its primary activity. Our LDB sample contains 42 states which
allow access to their data through the BLS visiting researcher confidential data access program.
    The QCEW is the public use version of the LDB. It reports employment at the industry-
county level for all 50 states from 1975-2014, subject to disclosure limitations to prevent the
release of identifying information regarding single establishments. Even at the NAICS 2 digit
level and with counties already aggregated into metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), roughly
one-fifth of potential cells get suppressed for disclosure reasons; the suppressed share rises to
35% for MSA-industry cells at the NAICS 3 digit level.Thus, analysis of reallocation requires
the use of the confidential data.
    Two details of the data collection procedure merit mention as they affect the periods in-
cluded in our analysis. First, the Federal Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976
expanded the number of industries and establishments covered by unemployment insurance
laws, with the result that the QCEW expanded its coverage of employment between 1976 and
1980.6 We exclude data prior to 1978 because the staggered implementation of the coverage
expansion across states produces substantial measurement difficulties during that period. In ef-
fect, we exclude the 1976-1980 expansion from the analysis. Second, in 1990 and 1991 the BLS
lowered the threshold requirements for multi-establishment employers to report employment
by single establishment (Farmer and Searson, 1995). As a result, an unusually high number of
establishments change industry code during those years. While predicted reallocation between
the 1990 peak and 1993 last-peak should remain mostly unaffected by the reclassifications as
long as the changes roughly net out at the national level, actual reallocation at the local level
has sufficient measurement error to render it unusable.7
   We combine our LDB sample with NAICS 2 and 3 digit employment from the QCEW for
counties in states not in the LDB, and with 2 digit SIC data for 1975-2000.8 We seasonally
adjust all series at the industry-county level using the multi-step moving average approach
contained in the Census Bureau’s X-11 algorithm. We also define a new SIC classification,
“SIC 1.5,” which groups 2 digit SIC industries into 2 digit NAICS industries using the modal
employment for 2 digit SIC industries which split into multiple 2 digit NAICS industries.9

   7
     We are grateful to Jessica Helfand and David Hiles of the BLS for helping to clarify the issues related to
the 1990 and 1991 reporting change.
   8
     The QCEW reports employment by county and SIC 2 digit industry beginning in 1975, and by 3 and 4 digit
industry for 1984-2000. We date the 1980s expansion as beginning in October 1983, making the introduction
in 1984 of the SIC 3 and 4 digit industry detail redundant for our analysis. The 1987 revision of the SIC made
large changes to a handful of industry definitions which if uncorrected would result in spurious reallocation. We
adjust for the classification changes by combining each of SIC 36 and 38, SIC 60 and 61, and SIC 73, 87, and
89 into a single composite industry.
   9
     See appendix C for details of the construction of the SIC 1.5 classification.

Bureau’s County Business Patterns or Longitudinal Business Database (LBD), the BLS data
have the important advantage of providing monthly rather than annual frequency, a requirement
for the timing procedure described in section 2. In what follows, we make SIC 2/NAICS 3 our
baseline level of industry detail.
   We aggregate county-level data into Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs). The Office
of Management and Budget (OMB) defines CBSAs as areas “containing a large population
nucleus and adjacent communities that have a high degree of integration with that nucleus,”
and distinguishes between Metropolitan (MSA) and Micropolitan (MiSA) areas depending on
whether the urban core contains at least 50,000 inhabitants. We further aggregate CBSAs into
Combined Statistical Areas (CSAs).10 CSAs consist of adjacent CBSAs that have “substantial
employment interchange,” and thus better capture the local labor market. Not all CBSAs
belong to a CSA. For example, the San Diego MSA is not part of a CSA, but the Boston-
Cambridge-Newton MSA is one of five MSAs in the Boston-Worcester-Providence CSA.
    Our final sample includes all MSAs and CSAs containing at least one MSA, with employment
of at least 50,000 in one month, an agricultural share of employment of less than 20%, and where
we observe at least 95% of employment at the industry level.11 The final sample contains 1,314
of the 3,144 counties in the United States and covers 86% of 2013 employment.


4. Summary Statistics
4.1. Trends in National Reallocation
    We begin with an overview of reallocation at the national level. Table 1 reports national
full cycle reallocation for each recession-recovery and expansion, and at six levels of industry
aggregation. The shaded rows indicate the recession-recovery episodes. Here and elsewhere, we
group together the 1980 recession-recovery, 1981 expansion, and 1981-1983 recession-recovery
cycles into a single episode.12 We measure reallocation using SIC definitions for the episodes
between 1975 and 2000, and using NAICS definitions for the episodes beginning after 1990. It
helps to group SIC “1.5” with NAICS 2, SIC 2 with NAICS 3, and SIC 4 with NAICS 6, based
on similarity in the number of industries. Indeed, reallocation measures for the overlapping
episodes of the March 1990-April 1993 recession-recovery cycle and the April 1993-December
  10
     We use the 2013 OMB county classifications of CBSAs and CSAs for our entire sample to avoid disconti-
nuities from counties switching CBSAs.
  11
     We exclude areas with a large agricultural share because of the particular difficulty of seasonally adjusting
agricultural employment. The 95% coverage restriction binds because of disclosure limits in CSAs/MSAs located
at least partly in states not in our LDB sample.
  12
     We do so for a number of reasons. Measured separately, each of these episodes is much shorter than the
recession-recovery and expansion cycles that follow. Grouping them together generates a cycle 6 months longer
than the 1990-1993 recession-recovery cycle, and 11 months shorter than the 2000-2005 recession-recovery cycle.
At the local level, many areas do not have a last-peak between the two recessions. Results are qualitatively
robust to this choice.

 Notes: The table reports values of Rus,t,t+j for all complete national recession-recovery and expansion cycles
between 1975 and 2014, and at varying levels of industry detail. The table omits the entry for SIC 4 between
1983 and 1990 because of the SIC classification revision in 1987.


2000 expansion cycle appear roughly comparable across these definitions, validating the group-
ings and facilitating comparison across time and classification.
    A number of interesting patterns emerge. First, the rate of reallocation during episodes
containing recessions has trended down. We find 4.6% (1.29*43/12) of employment changed
SIC 2 digit industry between the March 1980 private sector employment peak and the October
1983 last-peak. The same fraction changed NAICS 3 digit industry between the January 2008
peak and the February 2014 last-peak, despite the latter episode lasting 30 months longer. As
a result, monthly reallocation fell from 1.29% (at an annual rate) during the 1980-83 episode
to 0.74% during the 2008-14 episode. The decline in between is monotonic. Despite the
widespread attention to industry reallocation during the 2008-2014 episode, our measure of
secular reallocation suggests a decline in reallocation intensity during the Great Recession (see
also Foster, Grim, and Haltiwanger, 2014).
    The second interesting pattern comes from contrasting reallocation during the recession-
recovery and expansion cycles. Beginning with Schumpeter (1942), a long tradition has viewed
recessions as periods with low opportunity cost of reallocation, with the implication that re-
allocation will concentrate during downturns. More recently, Jaimovich and Siu (2014) find
that the disappearance of employment in occupations in the middle of the skill distribution
has occurred almost entirely during recessions. In contrast, Caballero and Hammour (2005)
argue that recessions reduce cumulative reallocation across establishments within manufactur-
ing. What does our approach say? At the national level, substantial industry reallocation has
occurred during both expansion and recession-recovery cycles. However, slightly more secular

                                               15
reallocation concentrates during episodes containing recessions.
    Third, comparing reallocation measures using the same industry classification and for the
same recession reveals the monotonicity property in aggregation level discussed in section 2.1.
For example, of the 6.5% (1.06% per year multiplied by 6.08 years) of employment changing 6
digit NAICS industry between the January 2008 peak and the February 2014 last-peak, 4.1 p.p.
constituted movement across 2 digit industries, 0.4 p.p. movement within 2 digit but across
3 digit industries, 1.0 p.p. movement within 4 digit but across 3 digit industries, and 0.9 p.p.
movement within 4 digit but across 6 digit industries.
    Fourth, while individual industries exhibit persistence in their contribution to national re-
allocation, the explanatory power of this relationship lies well below one. We establish this fact
by reporting in the penultimate line of the table the R2 from the regression:
                                         1
                                           |∆si,t,t+j | = αi + εi,t .                                (11)
                                         j

For example, at the NAICS 3 level, the R2 of this regression equals 0.59. Thus, individual
industry trends leave unexplained 40% of the variation in the contribution of industries to
national reallocation. This time variation in industry employment trends will in turn contribute
to substantial variation over time in the predicted reallocation in individual areas.
    We next evaluate our timing convention using national share changes. As explained above,
the division of calendar time into peak-to-last-peak, which we call recession-recovery, and last-
peak-to-peak, which we call expansion, addresses the Abraham and Katz (1986) critique if
industries exhibit the same cyclical sensitivity at a peak and last-peak. Otherwise, industries
will systematically gain or lose share during a recession-recovery depending on their cyclicality.
Table 2 presents formal diagnostic statistics based on the following specification test:
            1
              ∆si,c(t),x(t),t,t+j = αi,c(t) + βi I{x = recession-recovery} + εi,tc(t),x(t),t,t+j .   (12)
            j

The dependent variable in equation (12) is the average monthly change in industry i’s employ-
ment share during either the recession-recovery or the expansion part of the national last-peak-
to-last-peak cycle c. We allow non-parametrically for changes in trend share growth over time
by saturating the regression with a full set of industry-by-last-peak-to-last-peak cycle fixed ef-
fects {αi,c(t) }. The variable I{x = recession-recovery} is an indicator for whether the period t
to t + j corresponds to a recession-recovery or an expansion. The coefficients {βi } estimate the
average recession-recovery share change premium for each industry. These coefficients should
all equal zero if the peak and last-peak occur at the same cyclical point for each industry.
   Column (1) of table 2 reports summary results for NAICS 3 digit industries, grouping the
1993-2000 expansion with the 2000-2005 recession-recovery, and the 2005-2008 expansion with
the 2008-2014 recession-recovery. The p-value for the joint F-test of βi = 0 ∀i does not reject at

 Notes: In columns (1)-(3), the dependent variable is the monthly share change during a recession-recovery or
expansion episode. The sample includes the 1976-80 expansion grouped with the 1980-83 recession-recovery, the
1983-90 expansion grouped with the 1990-93 recession-recovery, the 1993-2000 expansion grouped with the 2000-
05 recession-recovery, and the 2005-08 expansion grouped with the 2008-14 recession-recovery. Equation (12)
provides the estimating equation. In columns (4)-(6), the dependent variable is the monthly share change during
a recession or recovery episode. The sample includes the 1980-82 recession grouped with the 1982-83 recovery,
the 1990-92 recession grouped with the 1992-93 recovery, the 2000-03 recession grouped with the 2003-05
recovery, and the 2008-10 recession grouped with the 2010-14 recovery. Equation (13) provides the estimating
equation. The p-value reports the p-value from a joint hypothesis test that the coefficients interacting the
industry categorical variables with the recession-recovery (columns 1-3) or recession (columns 4-6) indicator all
equal zero. Construction is SIC 0C17 and NAICS 238. Health is SIC 0I80 and NAICS 62.



the 10% level. Column (2) reports results for SIC 2 digit industries. Here the p-value rejects at
the 5% level. However, only two sectors account for the rejection: specialty trade contractors
(NAICS 238), and health care (NAICS 621, 622, and 623). The test fails to reject for all other
sectors, with a p-value of 0.44. Column (3) combines NAICS 2 digit industries with our SIC
1.5 industries. The sample period for column 3 spans 1976 to 2014 and includes 4 full last-
peak-to-last-peak episodes. Despite the concomitant increase in power, excluding construction
and health the data do not reject equality with zero, with a p-value of 0.95.
    What about the construction and health sectors? In appendix D, we plot the time series of
employment shares in these two sectors. Whether the result of having a finite sample or partic-
ular structural loadings, these sectors exhibit marked differences between recession-recoveries
and expansions irrespective of exactly where one defines the last-peak. We assess the sensitivity
of our results to the behavior of these two sectors in robustness exercises.
   Columns (4)-(6) of table 2 repeat the exercise in equation (12), but after removing all
expansion periods from the sample and defining αi,c(t) as an industry-by-recession-recovery

The {βi } now assess whether cyclical differences exist between recessions and recoveries, as
suggested by Abraham and Katz (1986). We find that they do. The data reject βi = 0 ∀i
at all conventional confidence levels, even excluding the construction and health sectors. This
suggests that the failure to reject in columns (1)-(3) does not reflect low power, but instead
provides support for the timing convention we adopt as our baseline.

4.2. Local Business Cycles

    We now turn to a comparison of the timing of local and national business cycles. This
comparison matters to the interpretation of our empirical results contrasting national recession-
recovery and expansion episodes insofar as the national cycle may not coincide with the local
cycles. The pattern of local cycles and their relation to national cycles also has independent
interest for a number of questions in regional economics.
   We identify 915 local employment peaks in CSA/MSAs between 1979 and 2014.13 The left
panel of figure 3 displays their calendar frequency. Local peaks cluster around national business
cycle peaks; more than three-quarters of the local peaks occur in the six quarters preceding or
during an NBER recession.

 Notes: In the left panel, the shaded areas indicate NBER recessions. The panel shows the number of local
recessions beginning in each quarter. In the right panel, the dark shaded area indicates a national recession, and

     To avoid misattributing statistical noise or temporary disruptions such as strikes to cyclical causes, for local
cycles we require that the period of the recession last at least 6 months and that employment at the trough has
fallen by at least 1% and 2000 employees from employment at the peak.

                                                                                                         18
    The right panel of figure 3 reports time series of the fraction of local areas in a local
recession, recovery, or expansion. The dark shaded areas indicate national recessions, and the
light shaded areas indicate national recoveries. For this plot only, we show separately the 1980-
81 and 1981-83 recession-recovery cycles. Perhaps not surprisingly, the fraction of local areas
in recession spikes during national recessions, and conversely for expansions. The fraction in
recession remains around 0.5 even during the brief 1981 expansion, providing support for our
decision to group the episodes together. The relatively high share of areas in recession during
the 2005-08 expansion reflects areas such as the Detroit-Warren-Ann Arbor CSA which never
recovered from the sharp manufacturing losses imposed by the 2000 recession. Strikingly, fewer
than 10% of areas escaped recession during the 2008 downturn.
    Taken together, the evidence in figure 3 points to a strong correlation between national and
local cycles, echoing earlier findings of comovement at the state level (Blanchard and Katz,
1992; Hamilton and Owyang, 2012).

4.3. Variation in Predicted Reallocation
    Figure 4 shows a map of the variation in predicted reallocation during the 2008-2014
recession-recovery cycle.14 We split the MSA/CSA observations into quintiles based on their
Bartik reallocation, and mark higher reallocation levels with darker shades of red. Note that
all CBSAs belonging to an observation have the same color. The map shows that predicted
reallocation is not easily explained by geographic factors. Indeed, many of the areas with high
predicted reallocation border areas with low predicted reallocation.
    Table 3 reports the pairwise correlations in predicted local reallocation across each national
recession-recovery and expansion. A consistent pattern does not emerge. Bartik predicted
reallocation has a positive correlation across some national recession-recoveries and a negative
correlation across others. The absence of strong serial correlation again helps in expanding the
available variation. Nonetheless, in what follows we cluster all standard errors by CSA/MSA
to account for arbitrary correlation within a CSA/MSA over time.

4.4. Predicted and Actual Reallocation
    For predicted reallocation to matter to local outcomes, it must actually predict realized
reallocation, as formalized in assumption 2. Here we assess this first stage relationship.
    Table 4 reports regressions of actual on predicted reallocation, separately for recession-
recovery and expansion cycles. For this table only, the recession-recovery cycles exclude the
1990-93 period. As discussed in section 3, the substantial industry reclassification of establish-
ments during that period generates sufficient measurement error to render it unusable. Columns
(1) and (4) contain our minimum set of control variables: national cycle fixed effects, predicted

    For data confidentiality reasons, the map uses only the public-use QCEW data. Greater disclosure limita-
tions prior to 2008 make it impossible to report maps at the same level of industry detail for earlier cycles.

employment growth over the cycle, and a lag of population growth. Columns (2) and (5) add
a number of time-varying area-specific controls.15 Columns (3) and (6) replace the additional
control variables with location fixed effects.
    Across specifications, predicted reallocation has strong explanatory power. Treating these as
first stage regressions, in most specifications the instrument would clear conventional thresholds
for absence of a weak first stage.
   The point estimates relating predicted to actual reallocation also cluster around one, with
implications for the validity of using local variation to infer effects at a national level. If the

    These include: lagged house price growth; lagged employment growth; area size, measured by the log of
sample mean employment; the Herfindahl of industry concentration at the cycle start; and for the recession-
recovery cycles, the predicted employment decline at the national recession trough, based on peak employment
shares. This last variable gives a measure of the cyclicality of an area’s industry mix. Appendix E provides
further description of the variables and reports partial correlations with predicted reallocation.

mean employment; the Herfindahl of industry concentration at the cycle start; and for the recession-recovery

expansion or shrinkage of an industry occurs disproportionately in areas that have a high initial
employment share, then predicted reallocation would translate into much higher local reallo-
cation. Conversely, if industry trends disproportionately concentrate in areas with low initial
employment share in those industries, then predicted reallocation would overestimate local real-
location. The first stage coefficient of one indicates that on average national reallocation maps
one-for-one into local reallocation, irrespective of the local employment share. Thus, local areas
provide appropriate microcosms of the national economy in line with assumption 2.
    In what follows, we report reduced form rather than second stage results for two reasons.
First, otherwise we would have to exclude the 1990-93 cycle from the analysis. Second, a
first stage coefficient of one with a large partial F statistic suggests that the reduced form
and second stage coefficients would have a similar magnitude in any case. Indeed, we find very
similar coefficients in unreported second stage results excluding the 1990-93 cycle. We therefore
proceed with reduced form regressions of business cycle outcomes on predicted reallocation.



5. Empirical Results

                                                 21
5.1. Baseline Recession-Recovery Results

   We begin by establishing a negative effect of predicted reallocation on aggregate employment
during a national recession-recovery cycle. Table 5 reports OLS regressions of the form:

                                           b
                       ya,t,t+j = αt + β1 Ra,t,t+T       b
                                                   + β2 ga,t,t+T + γ 0 Xa,t + εa,t,t+j ,                 (14)

where ya,t,t+j is an outcome in area a at between the time t and t + j. The right hand side
                       b
variable of interest, Ra,t,t+T , measures the predicted monthly flow of secular reallocation over the
course of the national recession-recovery, based on the area’s initial industry distribution and
the evolution of industry employment in the rest of the country. All specifications control for
at a minimum the Bartik predicted growth in the area over the course of the national recession-
recovery, the area’s population trend ∆ ln lt−60,t−12 , and national recession-recovery cycle fixed
effects. The table reports two outcomes: an area’s annualized employment growth from the
beginning to the end of the national cycle; and an area’s employment growth in the four years
following a national peak in employment. While the average national recession-recovery cycle
lasts approximately four years, these measures will differ because of the heterogeneity across
national cycles in the cycle length. In the regressions where the dependent variable is actual
growth in the four years following a national peak, we always also control for predicted growth
                                 b
over the four year horizon, ga,t,t+48 . We report standard errors clustered by CSA/MSA.
    Table 5 shows a negative effect of reallocation on employment growth during a recession-
recovery cycle. Each column in each panel restricts in a different way the type of variation
in reallocation exposure exploited. Columns (1) and (5) present the most parsimonious spec-
ifications, including only the control variables just described. These variables in fact absorb
substantial variation; in particular, the predicted growth rate in column (1) has a coefficient
of 1.19 and a standard error of 0.21, such that the data do not reject a coefficient of one for
predicted growth but strongly reject a coefficient of zero. Columns (2) and (6) add the control
variables described in appendix E: lagged house price growth, lagged employment growth, area
size, the industry Herfindahl at the employment peak, and the predicted employment decline at
the national recession trough. Here the point estimate falls but only slightly, while the R2 rises
by 16 p.p. reflecting the explanatory power of the control variables for the outcome variable.16
   Columns (3) and (7) present regressions which control non-parametrically for the Bartik
predicted growth rate by including episode-specific indicator variables for belonging to each of
twenty quantiles of predicted growth. Similar to the identification illustrated by figure 2, these
columns compare employment growth across areas with different predicted reallocation but in
the same vigintile of predicted growth. The absolute value of the point estimate for reallocation

    Columns (4) and (8) substitute area fixed effects for the area-specific control variables.17
Inclusion of both area and time fixed effects restricts the variation in predicted reallocation to
coming from within a CSA/MSA and relative to the national mean. The point estimates for
the effect of reallocation again remain similar. In all specifications, the data reject no effect of
reallocation on outcomes at the 1% level.
   The point estimates translate easily into economic magnitudes. In the first panel, a marginal
1 p.p. increase in predicted reallocation per year results in employment growth 3 p.p. slower
per year during the course of the recession-recovery cycle. Predicted reallocation has a sample

       We substitute rather than augment because the control variables include a lag of the dependent variable.

culminating in an employment level about 2% lower at the end of the national cycle.

These coefficients trace out an impulse response function. Areas undergoing reallocation during
a national recession-recovery cycle experience a sharp relative fall in employment immediately
following the national peak. The decline appears persistent, with the trough after five years.The
coefficients for one and two years before the national peak indicate little evidence of areas with
large predicted reallocation during the recession-recovery experiencing differential employment
trends immediately prior to the national peak. For comparison, we also plot in the solid line
with O hashmarks the impulse response for a robustness sample excluding areas in the top
quartile of manufacturing share and described further below. The impulse response function
generated by the robustness sample lies within the 95% confidence interval bands of the baseline
impulse response function but has a more U-shaped pattern and a trough after 24 months.
   To what extent does the fall in employment coincide with out-migration of the working-
age population? Table 6 repeats the regressions reported in table 5, but replacing the log of

employment with the log of the working-age population in the dependent variable. Depending
on the specification, roughly one-third to one-half of the decline in employment constitutes
workers leaving the geographic area. This magnitude lies below but reasonably close to the
estimate in Blanchard and Katz (1992) for arbitrary labor demand shocks.18 The persistence
of population movements may partly explain the persistence of the impulse response function.

5.2. Baseline Expansion Results and Comparison

   Table 7 reports a parallel set of results for reallocation occurring during national expansions.
Reallocation has a quantitatively smaller effect on employment outcomes during an expansion
than during a recession-recovery. In almost all cases, the data do not reject zero effect.
    Table 7 also reports the p-values from equality tests of the effect of reallocation during a
recession-recovery and an expansion. We construct the p-values by estimating pooled regres-
sions and interacting each covariate and predicted reallocation with an indicator for recession-
recovery or expansion cycle.As apparent from comparing the predicted reallocation coefficients
in tables 5 and 7, the interacted coefficient Reallocation X Recession-recovery has a negative
  18
     Two differences in sample may explain the differences in magnitudes. First, Blanchard and Katz (1992)
use states as their unit of analysis, whereas we use combined and metropolitan statistical areas. While states
are larger, from the perspective of migration they have arbitrary borders. Second, migration has trended down
in the United States over the past 30 years (Molloy, Smith, and Wozniak, 2011; Kapan and Schulhofer-Wohl,
Forthcoming; Ganong and Shoag, 2015), implying much less unconditional migration during our sample period
than during the period analyzed in Blanchard and Katz.

 Notes: Each panel of each row of the table reports the coefficient and standard error of predicted reallocation
from a separate regression, with the dependent variable monthly employment growth during the cycle. Each
regression also includes predicted growth, a lag of population growth, and cycle fixed effects. The first row,
labeled “Baseline”, reproduces column (1) of table 5 (left panel) and the corresponding result for expansions
(right panel). Rows 6-8 exclude observations in the cycle’s top quartile of employment share in the industry
indicated. Row 9 excludes observations where the area contains at least one industry with employment of 5%
or more of the national total in that industry at the cycle start. Row 10 extends the national recession-recovery
cycle by 3 months on each side. In row 11, a recovery ends when the cyclical component of an HP filter of
national employment (smoothing parameter 129,600) equals zero. In row 12, a recovery ends when the national
unemployment rate first equals the CBO’s estimate of the NAIRU. Row 13 constructs predicted reallocation on
a peak-to-peak basis.


5.3. Robustness

    The negative effect of labor reallocation on aggregate employment during recession-recovery
cycles is a robust result. Table 8 groups together a number of sensitivity exercises. Each panel
of each row of the table reports the coefficient and standard error from a separate regression,
with the dependent variable monthly employment growth during the cycle. For brevity, we
report results only for the parsimonious specification controlling for predicted growth, a lag of
population growth, and cycle fixed effects. Thus, the first row, labeled “Baseline”, reproduces
column (1) of table 5 (left panel) and the corresponding result for expansions (right panel).
    Rows 2-5 provide subsample analysis by dropping one recession-recovery at a time. No
single episode dominates the results.19
  19
     The small increase in magnitude moving from row 2 to row 5 suggests slightly larger effects of reallocation
earlier in the sample. The decline in the marginal effect of reallocation mirrors the decline in total reallocation
reported in table 1. The model described in section 6 predicts this form of convexity; in the model economy, a
given difference in reallocation between two areas results in a larger difference in employment outcomes if the
average reallocation rate is higher.

                                                 27
    Rows 6-8 explore the importance of particular industries. In section 4, we identified two
sectors, specialty trade contractors and health care, which in sample have systematically dif-
ferent share changes during recession-recovery cycles and expansions. Already, the columns of
table 5 with area fixed effects suggest that permanent exposure to these industries cannot fully
explain the negative relationship during recession-recovery cycles. Row 6 provides an alter-
native sensitivity test by removing from the sample observations above the 75th percentile in
beginning-of-cycle employment share in specialty trade contractors. Row 7 does the same, but
for the share of employment in health care. Neither sample restriction generates a meaningful
difference in the estimated effect of reallocation. Row 8 assesses sensitivity to removing obser-
vations with the highest exposure to the manufacturing sector, a sector which has contracted
in employment share almost continuously through our sample and as a result has received sub-
stantial attention elsewhere (Autor et al., 2013; Charles et al., 2014). We cannot reject equality
of the recession-recovery coefficients in rows 6-8 with the baseline, and all remain statistically
significant at the 1% level. Likewise, the expansion coefficients remain much smaller in absolute
magnitude and statistically indistinguishable from zero.
    Row 9 addresses one possible concern with the Bartik predicted reallocation and employ-
ment variables. If employment in an industry concentrates in a few areas (for example, auto
manufacturing employment in Detroit and Birmingham), and if the firms in different areas en-
gage in strategic interaction (for example, negative shocks to plants in Detroit induce expansion
at plants in Birmingham), then local industry employment in an area may correlate with else-
where employment in that industry because of a strategic response to shocks specific to another
local area’s industry, rather than because of the common response to a common set of shocks.
The coefficient of roughly one in the regressions in table 4 of actual on predicted reallocation
and the positive coefficient on predicted growth in table 5 suggest absence of such concerns in
our sample. Nonetheless, a more direct robustness exercise is to remove from the sample areas
which contain an industry with employment relative to national employment in that industry
above some threshold. Row 9 shows the result for a threshold of 5%. This restriction removes
17 CSA/MSAs from the sample (primarily the largest ones), but has almost no effect on the
estimated coefficients.
    Rows 10 to 12 explore robustness to the precise timing definition. Row 10 expands the
recession-recovery symmetrically by 3 months on either side. For example, row 10 treats the
peak of the Great Recession as occurring in October 2007 instead of January 2008, and the
last-peak as May 2014 instead of February 2014.20 The point estimate falls but only slightly.
In row 11, we define the peak as in the baseline sample, but define the last peak as the first
  20
    Because the 3 month shift changes the peak of the 1990-93 cycle to December 1989, the sample in row 10
includes only SIC-based reallocation for the 1990-93 cycle. The change from NAICS-based reallocation for most
observations in this period, for which we use the LDB data without disclosure limitations, explains the fall in
the sample size of roughly 60 observations in the left panel.

                                                            28
month following a peak in which the cyclical component of an HP filter (smoothing parameter
129,600) of national private sector employment turns positive. This change has almost no effect
on the results for either the recession-recovery or expansion results. In row 12, we define the
last peak as the first month in which the national unemployment rate falls to or below the
Congressional Budget Office estimate of the NAIRU.21 Again, the results change little.
    Finally, row 13 completely redefines the reallocation timing to measure reallocation between
two national employment peaks.22 On the one hand, this peak-to-peak measure obviates the
problem of identifying the end of a recession-recovery cycle for purposes of the Abraham and
Katz (1986) critique. It also addresses the possibility of some industries leading and others
lagging the aggregate cycle, such that our timing would count as secular reallocation the cyclical
changes in shares between the leaders and laggards.23 Third, it provides another means for
addressing the in-sample patterns of construction and health care. On the other hand, peak-
to-peak reallocation may provide a noisy measure of the actual reallocation occurring during
the recession-recovery and expansion parts of the cycle. We would not want to conclude that
reallocation affects aggregate outcomes only during the recession-recovery part of the cycle
because our measure of reallocation correlates well with actual reallocation during that part of
the cycle and poorly during the expansion part. In the event, using peak-to-peak reallocation
results in coefficients nearly identical to those in the baseline specification.


6. Model
    We summarize the results of the previous section in four stylized facts: (1) dispersion in
industry labor demand causes a decline in local aggregate employment during recession-recovery
cycles; (2) the decline is persistent; (3) out-migration of the working age population accounts
for part of the decline; and (4) dispersion in industry labor demand has little to no effect on
local aggregate employment during expansions. We now build a model of the labor market
which generates this pattern and use it to draw inferences for the national economy.
    The model economy consists of multiple geographic areas and industries linked by a demand
structure similar to that described in section 2.2.1. We add three essential features which give
rise to a quantitatively meaningful role for reallocation. First, each industry in an area contains
a frictional labor market with both employed workers and unemployed searching for work
in that industry. Second, each period only some agents may change industry or geographic
  21
     For the 2008-14 cycle, we define the last peak as December 2014, the last month in our sample.
  22
     For the 2008-14 cycle, we measure reallocation between the peak in January 2008 and December 2014. The
dependent variables in row 13 are the same as in the baseline, i.e. they measure the employment change between
the peak and last-peak (recession-recovery) or last-peak and peak (expansion).
  23
     The specifications with area fixed effects already suggested this sort of variation does not drive the results, at
least insofar as some industries always lead and lag the cycle and some areas have permanently higher exposure
to those industries.

                                                   29
area or both. The reallocation decision depends on the returns to searching in a particular
area and industry as well as on personal idiosyncratic preferences. These two features alone
produce the qualitative pattern of aggregate area employment falling in response to an industry
dispersion shock and workers moving away from areas undergoing more reallocation. The third
feature delivers the quantitative difference between the effects of reallocation occurring during
a downturn and an expansion. We embed the industry structure in a general equilibrium
framework with sticky prices and downward nominal wage rigidity. The wage rigidity allows
the model to overcome the unemployment volatility puzzle highlighted by Shimer (2005). More
subtlety, the downward wage rigidity serves to compress the distribution of industry wages
during recessions. The compression of wages forces more of the adjustment into differences
in labor market tightness across industries, resulting in a larger unemployment response in
recessions than in expansions. We provide auxiliary evidence in support of this mechanism in
the form of regressions of changes in wage premia on employment share changes.

6.1. Setup

   We develop a model in discrete time. The economy consists of A islands, each of which has
up to I industries. Our calibration will feature A = 2, with one small island representative of
an individual CSA/MSA and one large island representative of the rest of the economy, but it
proves simpler to describe the model’s equations without specializing to this case.
6.1.1. Labor market The labor market in each area-industry operates according to search and
matching principles. At the beginning of period t, industry i in area a contains (1 − δt−1 )ea,i,t−1
workers employed in the previous period and still attached to their firm, xa,i,t workers searching
for a job, and va,i,t job vacancies. Hiring occurs at the beginning of the period, with na,i,t
new matches formed. The ea,i,t = (1 − δt−1 )ea,i,t−1 + na,i,t workers employed in t engage in
production. At the end of the period, δt ea,i,t of the employed workers exogenously separate
from their employer. We let ua,i,t = xa,i,t − na,i,t denote the number of unemployed workers in
period t after the matching process has taken place. Following Christiano et al. (2015), this
concept of unemployment allows for job-to-job transitions by workers who separate at the end of
t−1 but get newly hired at the beginning of t. We let la,i,t = ea,i,t +ua,i,t = (1−δt−1 )ea,i,t−1 +xa,i,t
denote the total labor force in industry i in area a at time t. We fix the economy-wide labor
force at A
        P      PI
           a=1  i=1 la,i,t = 1.
    The firm vacancy posting condition and matching process are standard. Firms post va,i,t
vacancies in industry i at cost κ per vacancy. A free entry condition drives the expected value
                                                                                                 1−α α
of a vacancy to zero. The matching function takes the Cobb-Douglas form na,i,t = M va,i,t           xa,i,t .
                 va,i,t
Letting θa,i,t = xa,i,t denote the vacancy-searcher ratio, or industry labor market tightness,
                                                1−α                                                  −α
searching workers find jobs at rate fa,i,t = M θa,i,t , and firms fill vacancies at rate qa,i,t = M θa,i,t .
   Unemployed workers search in one industry and one area at a time. Their choice of where to

                                                          30
search plays an important role. In line with recent literature, we assume semi-directed search
(Kline, 2008; Artuç, Chaudhuri, and McLaren, 2010; Kennan and Walker, 2011; Pilossoph,
2014; Dvorkin, 2014). Specifically, at the end of period t, employed workers transition into
unemployment in their same industry at rate δt − λt . Both unemployed and employed workers
receive an industry reallocation shock at exogenous rate λIa,t and an area reallocation shock
at rate λA                 I      A
          a,t , with λt = λa,t + λa,t . An industry reallocation shock consists of an immediate
job separation if previously employed, and a draw of I idiosyncratic taste shocks {εj }Ij=1 from
a distribution F I (ε). These taste shocks enter additively into the worker’s value function for
searching in each sector j = 1, . . . , I in the worker’s initial area a. An area reallocation shock
has two parts. First, the worker draws A idiosyncratic shocks {εb }A                            A
                                                                       b=1 from a distribution F (ε),
which enter additively into the worker’s value function for searching in area b = 1, ..., A. After
choosing a location, she then draws idiosyncratic industry taste shocks {εj }Ij=1 to determine
her new industry. We parameterize F I (ε) and F A (ε) as Type I Extreme Value.
    Reallocation shock frequencies λA                                     A
                                    a,t may be area-specific. We let λ̄t denote the average area
reallocation shock across islands. In our calibration, λA  a,t will vary inversely with initial area
size to ensure balanced migration flows in steady state. As a corollary, workers in small areas
disproportionately receive taste shocks εb , which raises their utility. Offsetting this, residents
of area a enjoy an amenity (λ̄A     A
                               t − λa,t ) (E maxb εb ), where E denotes the expectation operator
and the absence of a time subscript denotes the steady state value, so that the option value
of moving does not vary with island size. The assumption that workers receive amenities from
living in areas with greater population density has some empirical support (Diamond, 2015).
    We comment briefly on the industry and geographic mobility assumptions. The parameter
 I
λ determines the share of unemployed re-optimizing their industry search market. Holding
this share below unity provides one important friction allowing reallocation shocks to affect
employment. Having both employed and unemployed workers receive reallocation shocks at
the same rate λI removes any option value of remaining unemployed in order to potentially
switch sectors. One may also interpret λI as a stochastic death or retirement shock, with a new
generation of workers of mass λI born each period and choosing afresh their industry of search.
The εj shocks have the interpretation of taste shocks which make some individuals prefer to
work in certain sectors, or of noise shocks which give individuals private (mis)information about
the returns to searching in each sector. Inclusion of these shocks generates two-way gross labor
flows across industries. Existence of gross flows in excess of the net reallocation flows induced by
non steady-state dynamics captures an important feature of reality and facilitates computation
by ensuring an interior solution in cross-industry flows at each moment in time. The level of λI
and the volatility of the process generating εj together govern the directness of search across
industries. Analogously, the magnitude of area reallocation shocks λA    a and the volatility of area
taste shocks determine the directness of search across locations.

factor ma,t,t+1 . Let pa,i,t denote the real marginal product of a match, wa,i,t the real wage
payment to the worker, z the worker’s flow opportunity cost of employment, Ja,i,t the value
of a filled job to a firm, Wa,i,t the value of a filled job to a worker, and Ua,i,t the value of

   Wages follow a Nash bargain between the firm and worker, subject to exogenously imposed
downward nominal wage rigidity. This rigidity takes the form

                                         ∗
                           wa,i,t = max{wa,i,t , (1 − χw ) wa,i,t−1 /Πa,t },                                (20)

         ∗
where wa,i,t is the Nash bargained real wage, Πa,t is gross producer price inflation, and χw is
a parameter specifying the maximum permitted decline in the nominal wage. The assumption
of downward nominal rigidity has some support in the empirical literature (Kahn, 1997), and
following Hall (2005) and Chodorow-Reich and Karabarbounis (2015) allows the model to
generate realistic unemployment fluctuations without violating bilateral efficiency conditions
or requiring counterfactual assumptions on the sources of wage rigidity.
6.1.2. General equilibrium We embed the industry structure in a demand framework similar
to that in section 2.2.1. Output of industry i in area a is

                                          Qa,i,t = ηi,t ea,i,t ,                                            (21)

where ηi,t is (strictly exogenous) labor productivity in industry i which by free flow of infor-
mation does not vary across islands. Industry output is sold under perfect competition at real
       Q
price Pa,i,t to a wholesaler. The wholesaler combines local industry output into an area-specific
good Qa,t using the technology

where ζ ≥ 1 and Pa,t       =     i τa,i,t (Pa,i,t ) . In our calibration, we vary the parameters
{τa,i,t } across islands to generate variation in steady state employment shares.
   The real marginal revenue product pa,i,t arising in equation (16) is the product of industry
productivity and the real price of industry i’s good:

                                                         Q
                                          pa,i,t = ηi,t Pa,i,t .                                            (23)

With downward sloping demand, the decline in output engendered by a decline in ηi,t induces
                          Q
a rise in the real price Pa,i,t , such that following a negative productivity shock the marginal
revenue product pa,i,t changes little but output and employment in sector i fall.
   Closing the model requires specifying the determination of the set of real industry prices
 Q
Pa,i,t ,
      overall inflation, and the discount factor ma,t,t+1 . We do so by incorporating standard
elements from a New Keynesian currency union model. In short, a continuum of retailers com-
bine the Q good with capital to produce differentiated final goods which they sell to households

                                             33
across all islands, subject to Rotemberg pricing adjustment costs and home bias in the goods
market. An Euler equation for each household determines how much of the final goods to
consume and how much to invest. While agents enjoy perfect consumption insurance within an
area, asset markets across areas allow only for trade of a nominal bond. A central bank follows
a standard interest rate rule that satisfies the Taylor principle. Finally, we allow for a wedge µt
between the policy interest rate and the interest rate faced by households, and use an increase
in the wedge to generate a demand-induced recession. We provide a detailed discussion and
formal statement of the equations of the remainder of the model in appendix F.

6.2. Model Intuition
    To understand why this model generates additional unemployment during a recession in
areas undergoing secular reallocation, it helps to consider an economy with a single area and
with two industries indexed as 1 and 2. Suppose the industries begin in an initial, symmetric,
steady state, with η1,t−1 = η2,t−1 = 1, τ1,t−1 = τ2,t−1 = s1,t−1 = s2,t−1 , and where as above si,t
denotes the employment share. Two shocks occur simultaneously at time t. First, the steady
state productivities undergo a permanent, mean-preserving spread, with η1,t+∞ > 1 > η2,t+∞ .
Second, a temporary increase in the interest rate spread µt generates a recession.
    Due to reallocation frictions, the marginal revenue products p1,t+∞ and p2,t+∞ initially
diverge and then compress again as employment moves out of sector 2 and into sector 1. Along
the transition, labor market tightness diverges, as firms concentrate their vacancy postings
in the growing industry, while the search and reallocation frictions keep a mass of workers
searching in the declining industry. The recession causes the downward wage rigidity to bind
especially tightly on the declining industry. The downward rigidity reduces the firm’s share
of match surplus in the declining industry, further disincentivizing vacancy creation, while the
compression of wage differentials keeps additional workers searching in the declining industry.
This further divergence in vacancy posting and unemployment implies a much larger difference
in labor market tightness between the two industries than would occur without the recession.
    With a constant returns to scale matching function, differential labor market tightness
generates unemployment.24 Fixing δt = δ, fluctuations in unemployment depend on fluctuations
in job finding rates. In the two sector version, the economy-wide average job finding rate ft
                                  
equals M xx1,tt θ1,t
                 1−α
                     + xx2,tt θ2,t
                               1−α
                                     . Holding the distribution of vacancies fixed and maximizing
ft over the allocation of job seekers requires setting θ1,t = θ2,t . The sharp divergence in θ1
and θ2 caused by reallocation thus generates unemployment. This reallocation unemployment
closely resembles the mismatch unemployment in Sahin et al. (2014) and Barnichon and Figura
(Forthcoming).25 The addition of nominal rigidities, capital, and labor mobility across areas
  24
     Pissarides (2000) surveys the properties of matching functions and finds broad empirical support for and
almost universal adoption of the assumption of constant returns to scale.
  25
     Our focus on wage rigidity does not mean that we reject other possible mechanisms. Recent work has

                                                           34
amplify this mechanism and as we show next allow the model to quantitatively match our
empirical estimates.

6.3. Quantitative Results

    We calibrate a version of the model with two areas and twenty-three industries, A = 2
and I = 23, at monthly frequency. The two areas allow for one small area which we treat
as representative of a single local CSA/MSA, and one large area representative of the rest of
the economy. Three industries is the minimum number necessary to have different amounts
of reallocation result from the same mean-preserving spread in industry productivities, but a
larger number of industries more closely approximates the empirical specification.26 Appendix F
provides details of our calibration and procedure for finding the model steady state. Appendix
table F.1 provides a summary of the calibrated parameters and moments matched. We solve
the perfect foresight transition paths by reversing the shocks after 700 periods and working
backward from the initial steady state equilibrium.27
    Reallocation is induced by an unexpected, gradual mean-preserving spread in industry pro-
ductivities. These are constructed as follows: We take average observed sector share changes in
the NAICS-3 data, sort them into 23 quantiles, and take the mean in each quantile. The pro-
ductivity changes are fixed multiples of the sector share changes chosen to match the standard
deviation of industry share changes in the data. Thus, the log productivity changes have mean
zero. The productivity changes occur gradually, beginning in period 0 and reaching full spread
after 48 months. We order the industries in decreasing order of productivity change, such that
industry 1 experiences the largest productivity increase, industry 2 the second largest increase,
etc. down to industry 23 which experiences the largest productivity decline. The left panel of
figure 6 plots these perfect-foresight paths.
    We solve the model separately for a small area with low reallocation (LR) and with high real-
location (HR). In the LR area, we start from input weights τa,j = 2−0.425|j−12| / 23        −0.425|j−12|
                                                                                   P
                                                                                     j=1 2               ,
                                                             0.425|j−12|  P23   0.425|j−12|
while in the HR area we start from input weights τa,j = 2                / j=1 2            . We then
scale the weights on the declining sectors such that the input-weighted log productivity change

highlighted two: the possibility of search inefficiency or job retraining associated with industry switchers (e.g.
Jaimovich and Siu, 2014), and changes in the pool of job seekers during recessions (e.g. Hall and Schulhofer-
Wohl, 2015; Ahn and Hamilton, 2014). Pilossoph (2014) and Dvorkin (2014) criticize the inefficient search
explanation on the grounds that gross flows of workers across industries vastly exceed net flows and appear
mostly unresponsive to changes in net flows, a fact consistent with our model. We also note that on at least
some observable dimensions such as educational attainment, the composition of workers switching industries
appears roughly acyclical. We provide direct evidence of the wage compression channel in table 9.
  26
     Twenty-three industries corresponds to the number at the NAICS2 level. While the model allows for an
arbitrary, finite number of sectors, we found it computationally infeasible to scale our model to the I ≈ 80
industries at the SIC2/NAICS3 level. Increasing the number of industries from three to twenty-three slightly
amplifies the marginal effect of reallocation on employment, suggesting that we do not bias toward larger
responses by restricting to small I.
  27
     Allowing for a longer time before reversal has little effect on our results.

               in each area is mean-zero. The right panel of figure 6 plots these input shares. The low re-
               allocation area has predicted reallocation of 0.7%, approximately a one-and-a-half standard
               deviation below median reallocation in our sample. The input shares of the high reallocation
               area are more concentrated among the expanding and contracting sectors and give predicted
               reallocation of 1.3%, corresponding to a one-and-a-half standard deviation increase in reallo-
               cation relative to the median area in the data. In both versions, the large area has uniform
               input shares τb,j = 1/23. Since this area is large, it will behave identically regardless of the
               reallocation in the small area. Thus, this set-up allows us to compare outcomes under high and
               low reallocation for members of the same currency union.
                   We consider two scenarios. A pure reallocation shock consists of only the mean-preserving
               spreads in productivities and corresponds to the expansion results in section 5. The second
               experiment combines the reallocation shock with a temporary increase in the wedge between
               the central bank’s policy interest rate and the interest rate available to households. This wedge
               increase simulates a demand-driven recession. We set the increase in the wedge to 0.8 p.p. with
               subsequent decay of 4.5% per month to generate an employment contraction of approximately
               4% in the large area. The recession cum reallocation shock corresponds to the recession-recovery
               results in section 5.28
                   The left panel of figure 6 plots the employment rates in the small area in the high and low
               reallocation version and for each scenario. In the expansion scenario, the low reallocation area

                 28
                   A pure recession shock has nearly identical effects in both areas. Thus, any differential exposure to a
               recession comes from the combination of the recession shock with the reallocation shock.

                                   approximately 1% after 40 months. A recession induces a much larger decline in employment.
                                   In the low reallocation area the decline reaches around 3% after 6 months, while in the high
                                   reallocation area the trough is 6% after 10 months.

                                       We have also estimated regressions of local area employment growth on Bartik growth and Bartik real-
                                   location in simulated data. Specifically, we ran 100 simulations of a 5-sector partial equilibrium version of
                                   the model corresponding to the set-up in section 6.1.1 but with exogenous marginal revenue product paths,
                                   a constant discount factor, and a constant zero inflation rate. Relative to the full quantitative model, which
                                   takes approximately five hours to solve, this model is solved significantly faster. For each simulation, we drew
                                   a different initial local productivity distribution over the five sectors, giving rise to a different initial indus-
                                   try employment distribution. We then regressed area employment growth on Bartik reallocation and Bartik
                                   growth. The coefficient on reallocation aligns very closely with the result from simulating two local areas that
                                   have the same predicted Bartik growth but different levels of reallocation and calculating the marginal effect as
                                   in equation (24).

                                                                                            37
reallocation variable depends on the large area’s recession-recovery cycle, which is just over 5
years long, T = 69. We use the same duration for the expansion cycle. In the model, the
marginal effect of reallocation on unemployment is significantly larger and more persistent in
recession-recoveries than in expansions. The maximum marginal effect during the recession-
recovery is about -7, only slightly below the range of the estimates reported in table 5 from the
data. The effect is persistent and traces a path similar to the manufacturing-trimmed impulse
response function in figure 5. In contrast, the maximum marginal effect during the expansion
is about -2.5, which is within the range of point estimates reported in table 7 and substantially
below the effect during recession-recoveries. The share of the employment response accounted
for by population migration also appears roughly consistent with the data.

6.4. Discussion
    The model replicates the finding that reallocation generates a quantitatively large decline in
aggregate employment if it occurs during a recession but not if it occurs during an expansion.
Compression of the wage distribution during recessions forms a key mechanism underlying this
difference. In expansions the wage constraint does not bind, so real wages rise in the expanding
sector and fall in the declining sector commensurate with the rate of the productivity change.
This is shown by the squared-hash lines in the left panel of figure 8, where, for ease of exposition,
we only show the most productive, least productive and median sector. Due to imperfect labor
mobility, tightness diverges as shown in the right panel of figure 8, causing a decrease in
aggregate matching efficiency and reducing employment. However, the divergence in tightness
is small as higher wages draw workers into the expanding sectors, increasing the number of job
seekers in the expanding sectors and reducing the number in the contracting sectors.
    In a recession the downward nominal wage constraint becomes binding. However, the extent
to which it binds differs across sectors, with the sharpest effect on sectors contracting due to
both a temporary recession and permanent productivity decline, as illustrated by the triangle-
hash lines in the left panel of figure 8. The increase in the workers’ share of match surplus
in the contracting sectors leads to greater divergence in allocation of both vacancies and job
seekers, magnifying the divergence in labor market tightness.
    To illustrate quantitatively the model’s key mechanisms, figure 9 plots the baseline marginal
coefficient impulse response function (the solid blue line) along with counterfactual marginal
coefficients obtained by selectively changing features of the model. The dash-dot light blue line
shows the marginal effects in recession-recoveries with wages determined by Nash bargaining
in each period. Without downward wage rigidity, the effects are much smaller and of similar
magnitude independent of the state of the business cycle.30

    A potential concern with the downward nominal wage rigidity mechanism is whether it applies in the
1980s when trend inflation was higher. However, this period also featured higher average reallocation and
higher inter-regional mobility. When we re-calibrate our model to match these three features of the data

                                    the baseline model with a parameterization that sets the area and industry reallocation noise parameters to 20
                                    percent of their baseline values, which weakens reallocation frictions and makes labor search more directed. In
                                    this case the productivity paths are re-parameterized to yield the same amount of average reallocation as in the

                                                     The asymmetry of wage compression during recessions and expansions has a counterpart

                                    around 6, close to our baseline effect. Moreover, in unreported results we find industry wage-compression in the

moment in the data. Table 9 tests for this asymmetry using national hourly wages by industry
from the CPS and QCEW employment share changes during recession-recoveries and expan-
sions. The table reports regressions where each observation is a national NAICS 2, SIC 2,
or NAICS 3 digit industry during a national recession or expansion episode. The dependent
variable is the change in the industry wage premium during a recession or expansion.31 The
regressors include the growth rate of the employment share change in the industry during the
expansion or recession-recovery containing the recession, and the share change interacted with
the state of the business cycle.
    In the data, industries with rising employment shares have rising wage differentials during
expansions. In contrast, there is no economically or statistically significant relationship between
the change in the wage premium during a recession and industry share growth. The data reject
equality of coefficients during expansions and recessions at the 5% level. Because realized
reallocation and wage differentials may be jointly determined, we do not read causality into
these results. Nonetheless, they provide evidence of wage compression between expanding
and contracting industries during recessions but not during expansions, consistent with the
  31
     See appendix G for details of the construction of the dependent variable. By construction, the dependent
variable has essentially zero mean across industries in a given time period, and the changes in industry shares
also have essentially zero mean within a time period. We therefore omit time fixed effects from the regressions
for parsimony. We weight the SIC 2/NAICS 3 digit regressions by employment share because smaller industries
have greater measurement error in the industry wage premia. The CPS provides too small a sample to repeat
the exercise at the CSA/MSA level.

mechanism in the model.32
    Panel B of figure 9 illustrates the importance of reallocation frictions. The teal and pink
dashed lines report the impulse response functions of the marginal coefficients from a calibration
with the variance of the reallocation taste shocks εj , εb reduced to 20% of their baseline values.
This change makes the industry and location choice much more directed, and so in these
experiments we feed in much less dispersion in productivity in order to generate the same
amount of labor reallocation as in the baseline calibration. While the directedness of search per
se has only a minor effect on the employment response to a given set of productivity processes,
the lower productivity dispersion required to match the actual amount of reallocation in the
data results in marginal coefficients of nearly zero in both expansions and recessions.

6.5. Aggregate Importance

    Armed with our calibrated benchmark model, we can ask what it implies for the importance
of reallocation in propagating and amplifying business cycles at the national level. To do so, we
report employment responses in the large area to different amounts of reallocation generated by
scaling up and down the mean-preserving productivity shocks shown in the left panel of figure
6. This experiment differs from the cross-sectional empirical and model-based results, which are
based on differential exposure in small areas to the same mean-preserving productivity shocks,
but perhaps better captures the source of time series variation in national reallocation. Likewise,
the large area employment response excludes channels such as population mobility which affect
local areas but not the national economy. Figure 10 shows how reallocation amplifies and
propagates national recessions in the model. The effects can be substantial.
    The model’s implications for the relationship of secular industry labor reallocation to the
behavior of vacancies and worker flows also merit comment. In their article, Abraham and
Katz (1986) suggest looking to vacancies to ascertain the importance of reallocation shocks in
driving the business cycle. Their intuition rests on a downward sloping Beveridge curve absent
sectoral shifts, that is, a negative relationship between unemployment and vacancies, while
reallocation shocks shift the Beveridge curve out and therefore induce positive comovement of
vacancies and unemployment. Since vacancies fall in recessions, they argue that reallocation is
not a major driver of business cycles. However, in our model reallocation reduces vacancies;
comparing across the episodes shown in figure 10, a larger reallocation shock generates a larger
decline in vacancies. The key is again the downward-rigid wage constraint. Vacancy creation in
the declining sector plummets because of rigid wages, while the rising wages in the expanding
sector limit vacancy creation there. Thus, our finding that reallocation can be important for
  32
    The magnitude of the coefficient on share change growth during expansions is smaller than the corresponding
magnitude in our calibrated model. This difference may partly reflect unmodeled labor market institutions such
as minimum wage increases which might generate non-random changes in wage premia without corresponding
changes in employment share.

Notes: Each line scales the dispersion in productivities in panel A of figure 6 and thus the amount of labor
reallocation at the national level. The top line corresponds to 80 percent of the baseline dispersion. Each further
line adds increments of 20 percent, so the bottom line corresponds to 120 percent of the baseline dispersion. All
reallocation shocks occur concurrently with an AR(1) interest rate wedge of 0.8p.p. with persistence 0.955.


aggregate fluctuations is consistent with a downward sloping Beveridge curve.
    In interpreting our results it is important to distinguish between industry labor demand
shocks and worker fluidity shocks as sources of worker mobility. Worker fluidity is the sum of
the separation and hiring rates. Using a state-year panel, Davis and Haltiwanger (2014) find
that an exogenous increase in fluidity raises aggregate employment. We simulate an increase in
fluidity in the model by simultaneously increasing matching efficiency and the separation rate δ
such that both δ and the job finding rate f rise by the same amount in percent terms. This shock
raises both worker fluidity and aggregate employment, but leaves our measure of cross industry
reallocation unchanged. The increase in aggregate employment follows immediately from the
                                    δ(1−f )
steady state approximation u = δ(1−f    )+f
                                            . Moreover, following an industry reallocation shock,
the separation rate remains unchanged but the aggregate hiring rate falls commensurately
with the decline in aggregate matching efficiency. Thus, an increase in industry reallocation
generates a decline in worker fluidity along with a decline in employment, again reproducing
the positive correlation found by Davis and Haltiwanger (2014). Perhaps more importantly,
higher exogenous fluidity in the model mitigates the adverse employment consequences of a
reallocation shock by making industry transitions easier.


7. Conclusion
   Reallocation of workers across industries matters to aggregate labor market outcomes during
recessions. To establish this fact, we develop a methodology to isolate the mean-preserving

                                                                  42
spread component of secular industry-specific shocks. The methodology identifies reallocation
in a local area predicted by the local area’s industry composition and national trends, and
orthogonalizes this predicted reallocation with respect to the direct growth rate consequences
of the local industry composition. We apply the methodology to local labor markets over a 35
year period. We find a robust effect of reallocation on aggregate labor market outcomes during
periods when national employment is depressed, but not during national expansions.
    We interpret the empirical results through the lens of a model of the labor market featuring
decisions by job-seekers of which industry to search for work. The model delivers the follow-
ing insights. First, absent labor market frictions or mechanisms which generate sticky wages,
reallocation does not affect aggregate outcomes. Intuitively, when workers can seamlessly tran-
sition across industries, dispersion shocks result in immediate transitions to a new steady state.
Second, plausible frictions result in marginal reallocation effects of similar magnitude to those
found in our empirical results. Third, compression of wage differentials during recessions can
explain the asymmetric response of aggregate employment to reallocation during recession-
recoveries and expansions. Fourth, secular labor reallocation can have substantial effects on
the persistence and amplification of national as well as local business cycles.
    Our analysis has implications for policy not explored in this paper. The idiosyncratic indus-
try shocks which underly secular industry reallocation include real shocks such as dispersion
in productivity levels or consumer taste trends. Nonetheless, the ease with which reallocation
occurs appears to depend sharply on the state of the business cycle. This interaction suggests
a possible role for monetary policy in accommodating such shocks to “grease the wheels” of re-
allocation with higher inflation. Likewise, the interaction between worker fluidity and industry
reallocation in our model suggests a possible role for policy in increasing the fluidity of labor
markets to mitigate against the consequences of industry reallocation shocks. We leave further
development of these conjectures and other implications to future work.
