       This paper examines the output contributions of capital and labor deployed in

information systems (IS) at the firm level during the period 1988-91 throughout the business

sector, using two different sources of data on these inputs. Our production function estimates

suggest that there are substantial excess returns to both IS capital and IS labor, although the

size and significance of the excesa returns to IS capital is larger. Computer capital and labor

jointly contribute, or account for, about 21 percent of output, although only about 10% of

both capital and labor income accrue to IS factors. Although IS employees accounted for a

very small share of total employment by 1986, IS employment growth is estimated to have

made a larger contribution to 1976-86 output growth than non-IS employment, due to the very

rapid growth (16% per annum) of IS employment. The estimated marginal rate of

substitution (MRS) between IS and non-IS employees, evaluated at the sample mean, is 6:

one IS employee cart be substituted for six non-lS employees without affecting output

 1. Introduction
          In the last few years there have been several studies of the
contribution of computers to output. Lau and Tokutsu (1992)
investigated this issue at the aggregate level using U.S. annual
time-series data for the period 1960-90. Berndt, Morrison, and
Rosenblum (1992), Morrison and Berndt (1991), and Siegel and
Griliches (1992) studied it at the industry level. We are familiar
with only one major firm-level study, by Brynjolfsson and Hitt
(1993).
       Two of the industry-level studies concluded that
computers have had a negative influence on productivity.
Berndt, Morrison, and Rosenblum (1992) constructed an estimate
of the ratio of an industry's "high-tech" capital stock (consisting
of computers, communication equipment, scientific instruments,
and photocopy equipment) to its total capital stock for 2-digit
manufacturing industries for the period 1968-86. They found
that changes in this ratio were negatively correlated with labor
productivity growth.        Using similar data but a different
methodology, Morrison and Berndt (1991) concluded that "in
1986, estimated marginal benefits of investments in ["high-tech"
office and information technology equipment] are less than
marginal costs, implying over investment in" this capital in 1986.
       The other studies have reached the opposite conclusion.
Lan and Tokutsu (1992) found that "computer technology has
                                                                  3

made a very significant contribution to the growth of aggregate
real output in the U.S. economy during the past three decades.
In fact, approximately 50 percent of the growth of aggregate real
output during this period can be attributed to the growth in
computer capital" (p. 25). Siegel and Griliches (1992, p. 456)
found a strong "positive correlation between productivity growth
(but not acceleration in productivity) and investment in
computers." Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1993) also conclude that
computers "have made a substantial and significantly significant
contribution to output."1
        All of these studies have been useful, and have increased
our understanding of the role of computers in production, but
they are subject to various limitations. For example, 1982 was
the last year of the period analyzed by Siegel and Griliches;
according to Baily and Gordon (1988, p. 390) this preceded the

    1
        Because  economists believe that an employee's wage is
positively correlated with his or her productivity, estimates of the
relationship between computer use and wage rates may provide
indirect evidence about the productivity impact of computers.
These estimates also suggest that the productivity impact has been
positive. Using data from the Current Population Survey and the
High School and Beyond Survey, Krueger found (1993, p. 33)
that
"workers who use computers on their job earn 10 to 15 percent
higher wages." Berman, Bound, and Griliches (1993) also found
strong positive correlations between skill upgrading and increased
investment in computers within industries.
                                                                  4
 era of great diffusion of computers.2 The industry-level studies
 were based on the manufacturing sector; as Baily and Gordon
 (1988, p. 389) point out, "the manufacturing sector is not a big
 owner of the electronic equipment it produces." The studies that
 have found that computer investment yields positive returns have
 not provided valid tests of the (stronger) hypothesis that computer
 investment (like R&D investment) yields excess returns--returns
 greater than those earned by other factors. In addition, although
 labor costs account for over 40% of information systems (IS)
 budgets, only one previous study has examined the role of IS
labor as well as 115 capital.
         In this paper we examine the output contributions of both
IS capital and IS labor at the firm level during the period 1988-
91 throughout the business sector, using two different sources of
data on these inputs: Informationweek magazine and
Computerworid magazine. The use of two independent data
sources allows us to explore the reliability of the data on IS
budgets, capital and labor.
         In Section 2 we postulate a production function that


    2
        IBaily and Gordon show that computers and communication
equipment as a percent of total non-residential capital employed
in nonmanufacturing increased from 4.4% in 1960-69 to 6.7% in
1970-79 to 16.2% in 1987. Similarly, Krueger (1993, p. 36)
reports that the percent of workers who directly use a computer
at work increased from 24.6% in 1984 to 37.4% in 1989.
                                                                    5

incorporates IS capital (and labor) in addition to non-IS inputs,
and discuss the restrictions imposed on the parameters of this
function by several hypotheses. In Section 3 we review in
greater detail the empirical results obtained by Lau and Tokutsu
and by Brynjolfsson and Flitt. We describe our research design
for estimating the production function in Section 4, and the data
sources in Section 5. Summary statistics, including some basic
facts about the allocation of information technology resources,
are presented in Table 6. Estimates of the production function
and their interpretation are discussed in Section 7. Section 8
contains a summary and concluding remarks.


2. Incorporating computer capital (and labor) in the production
function
          The major objective of this and previous studies in this
area is to estimate (and test hypotheses about) the marginal
product of computer capital, or a related parameter, the output
elasticity of computer capital. Let us postulate the following
production function :
           lnY=cx1lnK1+cr0InKo+fllnL                          (1)
 where Y = output, K1 computer capital stock, IC K - K1
 = non-computer capital stock, K = total capital stock, and L =
 labor.
 a1 =     d In Y I d   ln K1 = (d Y / d K1) (K1 / Y) = MP1 (K1 / Y),
                                                                     6
 where MP1       (d Y / d K1) = the marginal product of computer
 capital.
        There are at least two different ("null") hypotheses that
 one might want to test concerning &1. The first is H0: a
                                                           S0
 against the alternative that a1 > 0. In other words, one could
 test whether or not the output elasticity (and marginalproduct) of
 computer capital is positive. The second null hypothesis is that
 MP1 / MI'0 S R1 I R0: the ratio of the marginal products of
computer and non-computer capital is less than the ratio of their
rental prices (R   the rental price of asset i). This hypothesis
can be expressed in the form
        H0: a1-(R, K1/R0K0)cy0cO                            (2)
Since the second term on the left-hand-side of eq. (2) is positive,
rejection of this hypothesis is "stronger" than rejection of the first
hypothesis. Rejection of it implies not just that there are positive
returns to computer investment, but that there are xcess returns
to computer investment.
       Much previous research has shown that capital (and labor)
employed in research and development (R&D) activities has a
higher marginal product than other capital employed by the firm:
there appear to be "excess" private returns to R&D investment.
Rejection of the hypothesis represented by eq. (2) would imply
that like R&D expenditure, IS expenditure yields excess returns.
       As Lau and Tokutsu (1992) observe, in equilibrium the
                                                                      7

rental price of asset i (i = 0, 1) is
       R1=P1(R+&-E(pa),
where P1 the purchase price of asset i (the "asset price"), R = the
nominal interest rate, = the depreciation rate of asset i, and
E(pa = the expected rate of capital gains on asset i (p1 (P1Ã·1 -
 P / a.      Hence the ratio r of the rental price to the asset price
is
        r1     R/P1 (R+81-E(pa)                                (3)
Hence the hypothesis (2) may be rewritten as
        H0: a1 -   (r1   fr0) (P1 K1 / P0 K0) a0 > 0           (4)
According to Lan and Tokutsu, reasonable estimates of the mean
values during 1960-90 of the variables on the right-hand-side of
equation (3) are as follows: R = .07, Ã´1 = .20,        b=   .05, E(p1)
 = -.15, IE(p0) = .05. Computers depreciate more rapidly than
other capital, and the purchase price of computers has declined
rapidly, whereas the purchase price of other capital has
increased. Hence r1 = .42, r0 = .07, (r1 / r0) = 6, and eq. (4)
becomes
        H0:a1-6(P1K1/P0K0)a0>0                                  (5)
Lau and Tokutsu (1992) and Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1993) both
 obtained estimates of the parameters a and a0, but they did not
 perform tests of the hypothesis (5). Lau and Tokutsu did not
 perform tests on any linear combinations of the two parameters.
 Brynjolfsson and Hilt did attempt to compare a1 to a0 to
                                                                     8
determine whether the "return on investment" in both types of
capital was the same, but their test was based on the difference
a1 - (P1 K1 / P0 K0) a0 rather than aj - 6 (P1 K1 / P0      a3: it
failed to adjust for the much higher (by a factor of six) ratio of
rental- to purchase-price for computers.              It therefore
overestimated the "excess returns" to computer investment.
        Our data indicate that labor costs account for over 40
percent of information systems (IS) budgets, and provide
estimates at the firm level of the number of IS employees. It is
therefore natural to generalize the production function (1) as
follows:
        In Y =   a1   ln K1 + a0ln K0 +      In L1 + j30 ln L0 (6)
where L1 = the number of computer (IS) employees, and L,
L-    = the number of other employees.
       There axe two hypotheses that one might want to test
about 13. The first is that the ratio of the marginal product to the
wage rate is higher for IS employees than it is for other
employees; this may be expressed as
                                                             (7)
where W, (i = 0, 1) = the wage rate of type i employees. The
second hypothesis is that the ratio of computer labor to computer
capital output elasticities is equal to the ratio of their shares in
the IS budget:
       H0:f31-(W1/R1)(L1/K1)cx1 =0                           (8)
                                                                  9
3. Previous research


       Lau and Tokutsu (1992) estimated a translog unit cost
function with three inputs (computer capital, non-computer
capital, and labor) from aggregate U.S. time-series data. (They
did not distinguish between computer and non-computer labor.)
They were unable to reject the hypothesis of a stationary (no
technical progress) Cobb-Douglas unit cost function. They
estimated a cost function rather than a production function
because at the aggregate level "it is difficult to separate computer
capital and non-computer capital." The aggregate production
function implied by their cost function estimates is as follows:
     in Y = .072 In K1 + .329 in 1(0 + .599 in L
where Y = output, K1 = computer capital stock, iÃ§ =            non-
computer capital stock, arid L = labor. The average annual
growth rates during 1961-90 of Y, K,, K0, and L were 3.1%,
21.5%, 1.4%, and 1.8%, respectively. (According to NSF, L1--
"computer specialists employed in industry"--increased at an
average annual rate of 16.2% between 1976 and 1986.) Hence
approximately one-half of the growth in aggregate output is
attributable to the growth in computer capital.
       Brynjolfsson and Hitt (1993) examined the role of IS labor
as well as IS capital in production using longitudinal data on
several hundred large American companies for the period 1987-
                                                                 10

91. They estimated production functions using the following
specification and variable definitions:
        ln Y =    a1   in K1 + a0 in K0 + b1 in (W1 L1)
                                 + b0ln(COGS-W1L)          (9)
where COGS = cost of goods sold (total labor, materials, and
other nonrinterest expenses).. Their measure of computer labor
was W1 L (IS budget labor expense) rather than the number of
IS employees L1, perhaps because L1 was available only in a
single year (1990). Our data suggest that there is substantial
variation in this sample in the implicit annual wage rate of IS
employees (W,): it ranges from about $9000 to $135,000.
Although some of this variation may reflect differences in labor
quality, skill, and hours of work, it may also reflect substantial
measurement error. We will use IS employment rather than the
IS wage bill as our measure of computer labor. Because the last
regressor in eq. (9) includes--in a rather unconventional way--
expenditures on materials as well as on non-JS labor--this
specification does not permit comparison of the marginal
productivity of IS employees to that of other workers.
        Brynjolfsson and Hitt report estimates of a large number
of variants of eq. (9); a typical set of estimates, based on a
sample of both manufacturing and service firms, is as follows (N
=   1055, t-statistics in parentheses):
        ln Y =   .0061  in K1 + .0462 in K0 + .0274 in (W1 L1)
                 (2.12)    (10.7)      (6.32)
                                                                  11

                                 + .905 in (COGS - W1 L1) (10)
                                    (144)

The coefficients on IS capital and IS labor are both positive and
significant. The computer capital elasticity, .0061, is 13% as
large as the non-computer capital elasticity. This is larger than
the imputed ratio of K1 rental payments to 0 rental payments (=
6 * (P1 K1 / P0 1(0)   = 6 * .014     8.5%)--implying excess returns
to computer capital--but the difference between the elasticity ratio
arid the rental payment ratio may not be significant. Moreover,
the finding that the coefficient on IS labor is over four times as
large as the coefficient on IS capital is anomalous, since firms
apparently spend more on IS capital.


4. Research design


        Our objective is to estimate production functions of the
form
       in Y =    a1    ln K1 + a ln K0 + j3 in L1 + j3 In L0 (11)
using longitudinal, firm-level data. Although at the firm level,
purchases of intermediate materials account for a substantial
fraction of total costs (about 50% in manufacturing), due to lack
of data materials are not included as an input in eq. (11). Y
should therefore be interpreted as real value added. We do not
actually observe real value added, however; instead we observe
                                                                 12

nominal gross output, or revenue (R). R is related to Y by


where P = (gross) output price, Z real gross output, and ir e
Z/Y     the ratio of real gross output to real value added. We
observe a sample of firms (indexed by i) in a variety of industries
(indexed by j) over a period of years (indexed by t). R1ft denotes
nominal revenue of firm i in industry j in year t, for example.
Suppose that P and r vary across industries and years, but are
invariant within industries and years; in particular, suppose that
ln (Pu,       = e + &.         Then the relationship between revenue

and capital and labor inputs may be expressed as follows:
          in R,, =   a1   in K1,1, + a0 in
                            + $ hi L11, + fl0 in L + O + b (12)
Under these assumptions, the coefficients from the real-value-
added production function (11) may be identified from a gross-
revenue regression that includes industry and year dummies.
          An obvious advantage of this cross-sectional, within-
industry research design is that it enables us to finesse the
extremely difficult--particularly in the service sector--problem of
price (and real output) measurement.4 Our procedure does not


      Inclusion of a complete set of industry/year interaction
effects would consume too many degrees of freedom.

          See Lichtenberg and Griliches (1989), and (3riliches
(1992).
                                                             13

require us to have accurate output or input deflators, provided
only that these deflators are invariant across firms within
industries and years, an assumption which does not appear to
trouble most economists.


5. Data sources


       We utilize two different sources of data on computer
capital and labor, K1 and L1. The first is the same source used
by Brynfolfsson and Bitt, the annual survey of chief information
systems executives conducted by International Data Group, a
subset of which is published in Computerworid magazine. This
 survey provides data on the following variables:
        IS Budget (   R1   K1 + W1 L1): Corporatewide capital and
        operating budget for information systems and services.
        Expenditures for staff, hardware, software, and data
        communications are excluded,          Not included are
        telecommunications costs or spending on information
        technology by departments other than IS.


        % of IS Budget for staff


         % of IS Budget for training
                                                                14
        Market value of processors (         P1   K1): the current
        market value of all major processors, including
        supercomputers, mainframes, and minicomputers. They
       reflect the dollar value of the systems if they were sold on
       the market today, regardless of whether the company
       owis or leases the systems.


       Total IS Staff (L1) (1990 and 1992 only)


Informationweek magazine was the second source of data. Like
Computerworid, Informationweek has conducted an annual
survey since 1989 of companies' IS budgets and staff. (The IS
Staff data are now avaiable for each of the five years 1989-93.)
Informationweek also reports rankings of companies by the total
estimated value in the used equipment market of their installed
computer base, including storage and communications devices.
This estimate is developed by Computer Intelligence Corp., a
market research company that surveys about 30 thousand "sites"
(e.g., individual departments of companies) per month to
construct these estimates. The Computerworid estimate of the
market value of processors may not be based on such detailed
research, and may therefore be less reliable.
       Unfortunately, in the Informationweek data companies are
simply ranked and grouped into broad ranges of computer asset
                                                                   15

value (e.g. over $200 m., $100-$200 m., $50-$100 m., etc.);
actual asset values are not reported. However we obtained
estimates (which we believe are fairly precise) of this value by
interpolating the published data. In 1992, for example, there
were 47 firms (ranked 12 to 58) whose computer asset value was
between $100 m. and $200 m. We assumed that the highest-
and lowest-ranked firms were at the top and bottom of this range,
respectively, and that the other firms were equally spaced within
this range, i.e. we assigned an asset value (V) based on rank
(RANK) using the formula V = 200 - [(RANK -           12)   / 46] 100.
(This procedure could not be applied to 10 to 15 firms per year
in the top, open-ended asset value category.)
        As noted earlier, the noncomputer capital stock is defined
as the total capital stock minus the computer capital stock: '0
K - K1. We defined K as the book value of total net property,
plant, and equipment: the (historic) cost of tangible fixed
property used in the production of res'enue, less accumulated
depreciation (annual data item #8 in the Compustat Industrial
File). This is an imperfect measure of capital for two reasons:
it is based on historic rather than replacement cost (i.e. it fails to
account for changes in asset prices), and on accounting rather
than economic depreciation. To the extent that the ratio of
historic to replacement cost and the ratio of accounting to
economic depreciation are constant across firms within industries
 and years, however, inclusion of the industry and year dummies
 will eliminate biases arising from this definition of K (hence K3).
        Non computer labor input (L0) was defined as total
 employment (L) minus the number of IS employees.
        Computerworld survey data were available for the years
 1988-92, and Informationweek survey data were available for the
 years 1988-93. Unfortunately, Compustat data on total assets
 (WE) were not available for most firms after 1991, so our
production function estimates are based only on data up to that
year. Moreover, data on L1 for a substantial number of firms
became available only beginning in 1990, so production functions
in which total employment is disaggregated into L1 and L0 are (at
most) primarily based on data for 1990 and 1991.             Also,
Informationweek (the only source that attempts to collect L1 data
annually) is sometimes unable to obtain current information on
L1, so it simply assigns the previous year's number.
       The shortness of the time series for each firm, and the
occasional imputation of lagged values for missing data, lead one
to expect that ("within") estimation of production functions with
fixed "firm effects" would not yield reasonable or reliable
estimates. We found this to be the case, and do not report such
estimates in this paper. In the near future, however, we plan to
extend the sample in the time dimension to enable full
exploitation of the longitudinal character of the data.

6. Summary statistics


       Summary statistics based on the Informationweek data are
reported in Table 1. In 1993, the average IS budget was $177
million. The weighted (by sales) average ratio of ISBUD to sales
was 2.7%. The nominal IS budget fell about 10 percent between
1990 and 1993, but sales fell by about the same magnitude
(reflecting the recession and slow recovery), so the ratio of IS
spending to sales remained roughly constant.5
       The mean number of IS employees was 1121 in 1993,
also down about 10 percent from the 1990 figure. However total
employment declined less than IS employment, so that weighted-
average (L1 / L) declined from 3.3% to 2.9%, The fact that the
weighted average value of (L1 / L) is always lower than the
unweighted average indicates that (L1 / L) tends to be inversely
related to total employment. This might be a reflection of
economies of scale.


       In 1992 Informationweek for the first time published IS
spending and capital value data for the top 50 (ranked by value
of IS capital) European companies. IS spending and capital value
of these firms appears to be much greater than those of the top
50 American firms. The unweighted mean ratio of IS
expenditure to sales was 3.7% for Europe and 2.2 % for the
U.S.; the t-statistic on this difference was 2.1 (p-value  .04).
Moreover, the value of the IS capital employed by each of the 50
European firms was over $400 m., whereas only 11 of the U.S.
companies had JS capital whose value was at least $250 million.
        On avenge during the sample period, then, the number
of IS employees was about 3.2% as large as the number of other
employees. To perform the appropriate hypothesis tests, we need
to multiply this ratio by the ratio of IS to non-IS employee wage
rates (W1 / W0), to obtain an estimate of relative (IS to non-IS)
labor costs. In 1990, the average annual earnings of all private-
sector workers (a weighted average of W1 and W0) was
$17,994.6 The Computerworld data indicate that in 1990, iS
labor cost per employee was $56,091. This is likely to be an
overestimate of WI, since it includes fringe benefits. (According
to the National Science Foundation, the average annual salary in
1986--the most recent year for which data are available--of
"computer specialists employed in industry" was $37,900.)
Adopting this estimate implies that W0 = $16,735, W1 / W0 =
3.35, and L W1 I L0 W0 = 10.7%. The ratio of IS to non-IS
labor costs is no more than 10.7%, and probably less. To
perform hypothesis tests, we assume that the ratio is 10%, which
is probably too high, so that our tests are likely to be
conservative (we are less likely to reject the null hypothesis that
relative marginal productivity equals relative wages).
       Summary statistics based on the Computerworld data are
reported in Table 2. Between 1989 and 1990, the sample size


        Source: Table B-44, 1991 Economic Report of the
President.
                                                                    19

more than doubled and its composition changed, rendering
comparisons before and after the change hazardous. These data
reveal a slightly larger (14%) drop in mean nominal IS budgets
than the Informationweek data, from $133 million in 1990 to
$114 million in 1992, The mean value in the used equipment
market of sample firms' computer capital remained roughly
constant during 1990-92, at about $47 million. The weighted (by
net PPE value) mean ratio of the value of computer capital to net
PPE value was 1.5% in both 1990 and 1991. The unweighted
mean is about three times as large, indicating that (K1 / K) is
inversely related to K.
       During the period 1988-91, computer capital accounted
for about 1.8% of the value of the total capital stock, which
implies that P1 K1 / P0 lC = .018. As discussed earlier, to
obtain the rental value ratio (R1 K1 7 R0 }Q) we need to multiply
this asset value ratio by r1 / r0, where r1 (i = 0, 1) is the ratio of
asset i's rental price to its asset price. Lau and Tokutsu's
analysis suggested that r1 / r0 = 6, which implies that R1 K1 / R0
1( 10.8%.             An estimate of the average ratio of
investment in computers to total investment may perhaps serve as
a check on the validity of this constructed rental value ratio.
Imagine that an economy is in a steady state (zero net
investment) and that the prices of output and assets are
unchanging. Then Iâ€¢ =       Ã´1   K1, (I / I) = (b / &)    (K1   / K0).
    Moreover, given these assumptions and reasonable parameter
    values, (r1 / r0)   (b / Ã´), so that (I I I)    (r1 / r0) (K1 / K0).7
    One would expect the relative rates of investment to be roughly
    equal to (slightly larger than) the relative rental values. The last
    column of Table 2 shows weighted (by total investment) avenge
â€¢
    estimates of the ratio of computer equipment purchases to total
    capital expenditures (I). Computer equipment purchases are
    calculated as I = [(1 - STAFF - TRAIN) * ISBUD], where
    STAFF = the fraction of the IS budget devoted to personnel, and
    TRAIN is the fraction devoted to training.8 This figure probably
    overstates actual computer equipment purchases since it may
    include purchases of software and lease payments. The avenge
    value of (I / I) during 1988-9 1 was about 13% (implying a mean
    value of I / I of 15%), which suggests that our estimate of
    10.8% of the rental value ratio is not unreasonable.
            The Informationweek and Computerworid data are
    examined simultaneously, for a set of "matched observations"
    (observations for which data were available from both sources)



          With zero expected asset price changes, (r1 / r0) = (R +
    b) I (R + 4%). With zero inflation, the nominal interest rate R
    is equal to the real interest rate, whose long-mn average value is
    perhaps .02. When Ã´, = .20 and 4% = .05, (r / r0) = .22 / .07
     = 3.14, which is not that far from (S1 / 4%) = 4.

        s The mean values of these fractions are about 40% and 3%,
    respectively.
                                                               21

in Tables 3 and 4.      The first table reports weighted and
unweighted means and standard deviations. The Informationweek
estimates of the IS budget and IS employment tend to be higher
(by about 10%) than the corresponding Computerworid figures.
in contrast, the Informationweek estimates of IS capital tend to
be lower in every year except 1992 (when there is a suspicious
jump in the mean).9         The standard deviations of the
Informationweek K1 and (K1 / K) estimates are uniformly lower,
often by a substantial amount, consistent with the view that these
estimates (based on extremely detailed Computer Intelligence
survey data) are more reliable than the Computerworld estimates
of the value of computer capital.
       Correlation coefficients between Inlormationweek and
Computerworid estimates of IS budget, labor, and capital--both
levels and shares (of sales, total employment, and total assets,
respectively)--are reported in Table 4. The correlation between
the two IS budget estimates tends to be quite high: it ranges
between .85 and .94. The correlation between the two estimated
ratios of IS budget to sales is lower, ranging from .59 to .74. In
the case of IS employment, the pattern is similar, although the
correlations are higher: the correlation between L1 values is .91 -


       There is also a suspicious jump in the mean value of the
Computerworid K1 value in 1991. Since our production function
model includes year dummies, large changes in the annual means
per se will not affect our estimates.
                                                                22

.96, and between (L1 / L) ratios is .84. Not surprisingly,
perhaps, the correlation between alternative K1 values is much
lower than the correlation between alternative ISI3UD and L1
values: the mean and median K1 correlations are both about .55.
This suggests that estimates of the value of computer capital are
less reliable than estimates of the IS budget and of IS
employment.


7. Empirical results


       Estimates of variants of the production function (12) are
presented in Table 5. The first line of the table reports a
"baseline" regression in which neither capital nor labor is
disaggregated into IS- and non-IS components. The coefficients
on both total capital and total labor are reasonably well behaved,
although their sum (.93) is significantly less than one (suggesting
decreasing returns to scale) and the ratio of the capital to the
labor coefficient is somewhat larger than one might expect on the
basis of relative factor shares. In the next three regressions
capital, but not labor, is disaggregated into IS and non-IS
components, using the Computerworid estimates, the
Informationweek estimates, and an avenge of the two estimates
(when both were available), respectively. In the regression based
on Computerworld data on line (2), the coefficient on computer
                                                                 23

capital is positive, large (.100) and highly significant (t = 10.8).
This indicates that we can easily reject the hypothesis that the
marginal product of computer capital (or the rate of return on
investment in computers) is zero. To test the hypothesis that the
rate of return on computer investment is equal to the rate of
return on other investment, we use the statistic (a1 - .08 a0),
shown on the right of the table. This is a measure of the
difference between the estimated output elasticity of computer
capital (cr1) and the expected elasticity under the hypothesis of
equal returns ((R1 K1 / R0 K0) a0 = .08 a0). This statistic is also
positive, large, and highly significant. This suggests that there
are substantial "excess returns" to investment in computer capital:
a1 is 2.6 times as large as we would expect to observe if there
were zero excess returns ([.100 / (.100 - .072)] = 2.6). The
estimates in line (3) based on the Informationweek data are quite
similar, although the point estimates of both a1 and cr0 are about
20 percent larger than those in line (2); as a result, the sum of
the three elasticities is almost exactly one. In this equation, a1
is 3.7 times as large as we would expect to observe under the
null hypothesis. The estimates in line (4), based on an average
of the two alternative K1 values, are almost identical to those in
line (2).
        These estimates are quite similar to those obtained by Lau
and Tokutsu from estimation of a unit cost function from
                                                                24
  aggregate U.S. time-senes data'Â°; recall that the production
  function implied by their cost function was
         in y =   .072 In K1 + +329 in K0 + .599 in L
  Our estimates of the K1 elasticity are 39-69% larger than theirs,
  and of the L elasticity 14-18% smaller. A possible explanation
 for this is lower relative importance (cost share) of computers at
 the beginning of the sample period (1960-90) studied by them.
        Because IS capital consists entirely of machinery and
 equipment as opposed to structures (but non-IS capital does not),
 our finding of higher returns to IS capital is consistent with
 results reported by De Long and Summers (1991, 445), who.
 found that there "is a much stronger association [across
 countries].. .between growth and [equipment investment than
 between growth and] any of the other components of
 investment." They note (p. 447) that "economic historians have
seen the richest countries [and enterprises?] as those that were
first in inventing and applying capital-intensive technologies, in
which machines embody the most advanced technological
knowledge."
       In the next three regressions labor, but not capital, is
disaggregated into IS and non-IS components. Estimates based



       Although the assumptions of constant returns and cost
minimization were imposed in [au and Tokutsu, and they are not
here.
                                                                 25

on the Computerworid IS employment data (for the year 1990
only) are reported in line (5). The coefficient on L1 is positive,
large, and significant, but the null hypothesis of no excess returns
to IS labor cannot be rejected: the t-statistic on the linear
combination of parameters (j3 - .10 fl0) is 1.46. The sample size
for the regression based on the Informationweek data, shown in
line (6), is almost four times as large. The point estimate of the
coefficient on L1 is 35% smaller than it is in eq. (5), but it is
estimated much more precisely; the t-statistic is 5.4. The
hypothesis of zero excess returns to IS labor is clearly rejected;
j3 is more than twice as large as the value implied by that
hypothesis. The estimates based on an average of both sources
of data on IS employment, reported in line (7), are very similar
 to the estimates in the preceding line.
        In the last three regressions, both capital and labor are
 separated into IS and non-IS components. Comparison of eqs.
 (8) and (5) reveals that, in the rellatively small sample based on
 Computerworld data, distinguishing between IS and non-IS
 capital lowers the coefficient on IS labor by two-thirds and
 renders it insignificant. (In contrast, the coefficient on IS capital
 remains significant, and its magnitude is unaffected, from the
 disaggregation of labor.) In the regression (9) based on
 Informationweelc data, the coefficients on K1 and L1 are both
 positive and highly significant, and they are virtually equal in
                                                                 26
magnitude. Both are about three times as large as we would
expect to observe if use of these factors did not yield excess
returns. In the final equation (10), based on average values of K1
and L1 from the two sources, the       of the K1 and L1 elasticities
is the same--about .21--as in eq. (9), but this eq. assigns more
"weight" (and excess returns) to K1, and less to L1, than eq.
(9). hI This equation suggests that the computer capital elasticity
is over four times as large as one would expect in the absence of
excess returns; the computer labor elasticity is about twice as
large, but this difference is only marginally significant.
       The sum of the IS capital and labor elasticities perhaps
provides the most obvious evidence for excess returns to IS
expenditure. The last two equations both imply that computer
capital and labor jointly contribute, or account for, about 21
percent of output (a1 + f31 = .21). Our earlier calculations
indicated that only about 10% of both capital and labor income
accrue to IS factors.
       Loosely speaking, the finding that IS inputs earn excess
returns suggests that small changes in IS spending result in large
changes in output and productivity. A model developed in a
recent paper by Kremer (1993) suggests a mechanism that could
possibly underly this. Kremer defines a worker's skill, or


      In eq. (10), I (a1 + f3) = .41, which is very close to
the mean ratio of IS labor costs to total IS expenditure.
                                                                27

quality, level as the probability that he or she does not make a
mistake (such as producing defective 0-rings) that destroys
output (makes the space shuttle explode). Kremer argues that
"production consists of many tasks, all of which must be
successfully completed for the product to have full value,t' so that
expected output depends on the jthnt probability that no worker
makes a mistake. He therefore postulates a production function
in which the expected output of the firm depends on the puct
of the skill, or quality, levels of all of the workers in the firm.
  Kremer shows that the "0-ring production function provides a
mechanism through which small differences in worker skill create
large differences in productivity and wages." Suppose that
information systems have the effect of raising the firm's average
skill level--i.e., reducing the probability that workers make
mistakes.12     Kremer's model implies that the productivity
increase resulting from this could be large.
          According to the National Science Foundation, the number
of "computer specialists employed in industry" increased from




     12
       In the case of a major financial services company we are
 studying, information technology is used to perform "trade
 capture," which reduces errors at their source, and eliminates the
 need for rework at multiple points down the workflow chain.
                                                              28
 86,800 in 1976 to 345,300 in 1984 to 439,700 in 1986) The
 average annual growth rate of L1 during 1976-86 was 16.2%.
 During the same period, the growth rate of total employment
 (and L0) was about 2 %.       This   implies that, although IS
 employees accounted for a very small share of total employment
 even at the end of the period, IS employment growth made a
 larger contribution to 1976-86 output growth (j3 * d ln L1 =
 .088 * .162   = .014) than non-IS employment (flu * d InL0 =
 .458 * .02   =   .009).
       In eq. (10), the elasticity of output with respect to IS
employment is 19.2% as large as the elasticity with respect to
non-IS employment (3 / 10 = .088 I .458 = .192). Since the
weighted-average value of L1 I L0 is .032, this implies that the
marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between IS and non-IS
employees, evaluated at the sample mean, is 6 (= .192 / .032):
one IS employee can be substituted for six non-IS employees
without affecting output. Such an MRS is not inconsistent with
evidence from a specific case of computerization of production
that we are familiar with. One of the "Baby Bell" local
telephone operating companies decided to computerize and
automate customer service inquiries. According to internal


        There were 275,220 IS employees in the 220 firms that
reported the number of IS employees in the 1990
Informationweek survey; 281,371 15 employees in the 251 firms
reporting in 1993.
                                                               29
company documents, the introduction of this technology required
the hiring of nine "high-wage't ($75K) programmers/systems
personnel (as well as acquisition of new minicomputers), but
would    displace    75    "low-wage"     ($42-42.5K)     service
representatives. 8.3 non-IS jobs were lost per IS job created.
This probably overstates the MRS between IS and non-IS labor,
since IS capital is not held constant, but the degree of
overstatement may not be very large.


8. Summary and concluding remarks


        The magnitude, and even the sign, of the impact of
computers on output and productivity has been the subject of
considerable debate. Some business analysts have asserted that
the return on investment in information technology has generally
been low, and perhaps even negative. A few econometric studies
have provided support for this claim. But a number of others
have found that
the output contribution of computers is positive and statistically
significant, and may even be quite large. These studies have
supported the hypothesis that computer investment yields positive
returns, but they have not provided valid tests of the hypothesis
that computer investment (like R&D investment) yields excess
returns--returns greater than those earned by other factors. Some
                                                                   30
  of these studies examined the period preceding the large increase
  in the use of computers, and some were based on the
  manufacturing sector, which is a relatively small user of
 computers. Although labor costs account for over 40% of IS
 budgets, only one previous study has examined the role of IS
 labor as well as IS capital.
         This paper has examined the output contributions of IS
 capital and IS labor at the firm level during the period 1988-91
 throughout the business sector, using two different sources of
 data on these inputs. We began by establishing some basic. facts
 about the allocation of information technology resources.
 Expenditure on information systems tends to be about 2.7% of
 total revenue, and
 the share of IS employment in total employment is about 3.1 %.
Since the wage rate of IS employees is much higher (on the order

of 3 times as high) as that of other workers, the share of IS labor
cost in total labor cost is higher perhaps as high as 10%.
        The mean value in the used equipment market of sample
firms' computer capital as a percent of their net tangible assets
was 1.5%.       But because computers have a much higher

depreciation rate, and much lower (in fact, negative) rate of asset
price appreciation, than other capital, the rental- to asset-price
ratio is expected to be six times as high for computers as it is for
other assets. This implies that the share of computers in capital
                                                               31

(rental) income is similar to the share of computers in labor
income, about 10%. The sample mean ratio of non-labor IS
expenditures to total investment (about 13% during 1988-9 1) is
consistent with this.
       The data suggest that accurate measurement of the
replacement cost of computer assets seems to be much more
difficult than measurement of IS budgets and employment: the
correlation between IS capital values contained in the two surveys
is much lower than the correlation between the IS budget and
employment values. They also suggest that theInformationweek
IS capital data, which are based on an extremely detailed
underlying survey and which this study is the first to analyze, are
more reliable than the Computerworld estimates.
        We estimated production functions in which only capital
was disaggregated into IS and non-IS components, only labor was
disaggregated, and both inputs were disaggregated. Noise in the
computer capital data notwithstanding, the hypothesis of zero
returns to computer capital was always decisively rejected by the
data. In fact, the estimates indicated that there are substantial
"excess returns" to investment in computer capital: its elasticity
was 2.6 - 3.7 times as large as we would expect to observe if
there were zero excess returns (i.e., if the marginal rate of
substitution between IS and non-IS capital were equal to the ratio
of their rental rates).
                                                                  32
        Our estimates are quite similar to those obtained by Lau
 and Tokutsu from estimation of a unit cost function from
 aggregate U.S. time-series data, although our estimates of the IS
capital elasticity are 39-69% larger. The finding of excess
returns to computer investment is also consistent with De Long
and Summers' results concerning equipment investment and
growth.
        When labor, but not capital, is disaggregated into IS arid
non-IS components, the hypothesis of zero excess returns to IS
labor is clearly rejected; /1 is more than twice as large as the
value implied by that hypothesis. When both capital and labor
are separated into IS and non-IS components, it appears that there
are excess returns to both IS capital and IS labor, although the
size and significance of the excess returns to IS capital is larger.
     Several other implications of our estimates may be
summarized as follows: (1) computer capital and labor jointly
contribute, or account. for, about 21 percent of output, although
only about 10% of both capital and labor income accrue to IS
factors; (2) although IS employees accounted for a very small
share of total employment by 1986, IS employment growth made
a larger contribution to 1976-86 output growth than non-IS
employment, due to the very rapid growth (16% per annum) of
IS employment; and (3) the marginal rate of substitution (MRS)
between IS and non-IS employees, evaluated at the sample mean,
                                                           33

is 6: one IS employee can be substituted for six non-IS
employees without affecting output. Some anecdotal evidence is
consistent with this.
