                                           ABSTRACT

Retirees must draw down their accumulated assets in an orderly fashion, so as not to exhaust their

funds too soon. We compare alternative phased withdrawal strategies to a life annuity benchmark

using German data; one particular phased withdrawal rule seems attractive, as it offers relatively low

expected shortfall risk, good expected payouts for the retiree during his life, and some bequest

potential; results are similar for the US case. Delayed annuitization may also appeal, as it offers

higher expected benefits with lower expected shortfalls. Requiring unisex mortality tables in annuity

pric-ing raises women's risks under a phased withdrawal program.

              Betting on Death and Capital Markets in Retirement:
   A Shortfall Risk Analysis of Life Annuities versus Phased Withdrawal Plans

                     Ivica Dus, Raimond Maurer, and Olivia S. Mitchell


       Economists often advise retirees seeking to spread their assets over their retirement period to

purchase a life annuity, which is a financial contract between an insured person and an insurer “that

pays out a periodic amount for as long as the annuitant is alive, in exchange for an initial premium”

(Brown et al., 2001). Annuity payments may be fixed in nominal terms (fixed annuity); they can rise

at a pre-specified fixed nominal escalation rate (graded annuity); or they can be indexed to inflation

(real annuity). Alternatively, they may reflect the return of a specific asset portfolio which backs the

(variable) annuity, or they can depend on the insurance company’s experience with mortality, in-

vestment returns, and expenses (participating annuity). As Mitchell et al. (1999) note, the essential

attraction of a life annuity is that the individual is protected against the risk of outliving his own

assets, given uncertainty about his remaining lifetime, by pooling longevity risk across a group of

annuity purchasers. Yaari (1965) shows that risk-averse retirees without a bequest motive facing

annuity markets that charge actuarially fair premiums, should annuitize 100 percent of their wealth.

       Though life annuities provide invaluable longevity insurance, they also have some disadvan-

tages. Most obviously, the purchaser faces loss of liquidity and control over his assets, because the

lump sum premium cannot be recovered after purchase of the annuity, irrespective of special needs

(e.g. to cover unexpected and uninsured medical costs; c.f. Brugiavini 1993). Also, if the annuity

payments are contingent on the individual’s survival, there is no chance of leaving a bequest for

one’s heirs. Other explanations for why people may be reluctant to buy annuities are the high ad-

ministrative costs levied by insurance companies (Mitchell et al., 1999), the ability to pool longevity

risk within families (Brown and Poterba, 2000; Kotlikoff and Spivak, 1981), and the presence of
                                                                                                           2



other annuitized resources from Social Security or employer-sponsored defined benefits plans

(Munnell et al., 2002).

       As an alternative to buying a life annuity, one might “self-annuitize” following a phased

withdrawal approach. Here the retiree allocates his wealth endowment across various asset catego-

ries (e.g. equity, bonds, cash) typically included in a family of mutual funds where the assets will

earn uncertain rates of return. A certain amount of the invested funds can then be withdrawn peri-

odically for consumption purposes. An advantage of the phased withdrawal strategy, as compared to

a life annuity, is that it offers greater liquidity, the possibility of greater consumption while alive,

and the possibility of bequeathing some of the assets in the event of early death. On the other hand,

relying on a steady asset drawdown without any insurance provides no pooling of longevity risk, so

the retiree could outlive his assets before his uncertain date of death. Another withdrawal rule, for

example, consuming a specified fraction of the remaining fund wealth each period, avoids the risk

of outliving one’s total assets, as long as the benefit-to-wealth ratio is lower than one. Yet stochastic

investment returns will mean that pension assets change over time, and the periodically withdrawn

amount could be substantially lower or higher than the benefit payable under a life annuity.

       Such phased withdrawal approaches are becoming popular in many countries, prompted by a

round of pension reforms in Europe and America. For example, in Germany, recently-introduced

“Riester plans” offer a tax inducement for voluntary saving in individual pension accounts (IPA)

during the worklife, underscoring the government’s interest in boosting asset accumulation for the

aging population (Börsch-Supan et al., 2003). At retirement, thirty percent of the accumulated assets

in the IPA may be withdrawn as a lump-sum distribution; the remainder must be taken as a life an-

nuity (offered by a commercial insurance company) or paid out according to a phased withdrawal

plan (typically offered by mutual fund and/or bank providers) of which part reverts to an annuity as

of age 85. In the UK, personal pensions are now the norm, and here too, a portion of the accumu-
                                                                                                         3



lated asset must be annuitized by age 75. In Canada, the retiree at age 69 must either buy an annuity

with his tax-sheltered saving or create a discretionary managed withdrawal plan (Milevsky and Rob-

inson, 2000). In the US, no compulsory annuitization is required for 401(k) plans; rather, most re-

tirees roll over their pension assets into an Individual Retirement Account and manage the funds

themselves in old age. Together, these trends signal a growing interest in helping retirees manage

the asset decumulation process.

         To compare alternative retirement asset decumulation strategies quantitatively, we require a

formal risk/return framework for decision-making under uncertainty. One approach taken by finan-

cial economists is to maximize the expected discounted value of a (time separable) utility function

for uncertain future benefits and (if necessary) for a bequest. For example, Blake et al. (2003)

evaluate different withdrawals plans assuming that mandatory annuitization is required at age 75,

using a constant relative risk aversion utility framework. Milevsky and Young (2003) use a similar

objective function to determine the option value of deferring annuitization. A shortcoming of such

an approach, however, particularly in the world of financial retirement planning, is that decision-

makers often lack an explicit measure of retirees’ risk preferences (Pye 2000). For this reason, an

alternative approach using risk-value (or risk-return) models are appealing, in that they use explicit

measures of risk and value along with a function reflecting the tradeoff between these two. To the

extent that individuals prefer more return to less, and less risk to more, we can derive a partial or-

dering of opportunities within a risk-return dominance context, even if the exact utility weights for

risk and return are unknown. Depending on which risk metric is selected and how we formulate the

tradeoff between risk and return, a risk-value model can be consistent with the expected utility ap-

proach of choice (Sarin and Weber 1993).

       In what follows, we therefore take a risk-value approach. Here the “return” is the expected

level of benefits as well as the expected possibility of bequest, and the “risk” is the possibility of not
                                                                                                         4



reaching a benchmark or desired level of consumption. Previous studies taking this tack focus on

the probability of consumption shortfall as the operative risk measure (Ho et.al 1994, Bengen 1994,

1996 Milevsky et al. 1997, Milevsky and Robinson 2000, Milevsky 1998, 2001, Ameriks et al. 2001,

Pye 2001, Hughen et al. 2002, or Albrecht and Maurer 2002). Assuming that the retiree consumes a

fixed amount at specific points in time from a self-managed pension account, those studies calculate

the probability of running out of money before an uncertain date of death using alternative assump-

tion about the asset allocation, the initial consumption-to-wealth ratio, and the optimal waiting time

before switching the retirement wealth into an annuity. Our work extends this literature in several

directions. First, we examine the risk and return profiles of several variable self-annuitization

strategies that provide payments according to a predetermined benefit-to-wealth ratio. Second, we

address a major shortcoming of the shortfall-probability risk measure, namely that it ignores the size

of the possible loss that may be experienced. In practice, of course, both theoretical and empirical

arguments suggest that investors take both the probability and the amount of a possible shortfall into

consideration. Our contribution is to go beyond prior work by looking not only at the probability of

a consumption shortfall, but also consider the size of the shortfall when it occurs. Third, we exam-

ine how the results change if a mandatory annuitization rule were imposed akin to those in the re-

cent German and UK pension reforms. Fourth, we evaluate the impact of allowing the annuitization

date to be endogenous, along with the asset allocation decision. We illustrate how the risk of a con-

sumption shortfall and return profiles of fixed and variable phased withdrawal strategies compare to

the life annuity, and indicate what dominant strategies might be.

       In the remainder of this paper, we describe several withdrawal strategies and illustrate their

implications assuming capital and insurance market conditions relevant to the German marketplace.

We adopt these so as to be informative about alternative payout options that might be contemplated

under the German Riester plans when they reach maturity. Most results focus on an age-65 male

retiree, but we also provide findings for other ages and for women. Results are first given using a

fixed asset allocation pattern, and subsequently, assets are permitted to be allocated optimally. A

final section summarizes and concludes.


The Case of Phased Withdrawal

         We assume that the retiree is endowed with an initial level wealth V0 that he can use to buy a

single-premium immediate life annuity paying constant annual real benefits B at the beginning of

each year for life, with no bequest. We denote this as the benchmark annuity, and refer to Appendix

A regarding the pricing of such an insurance product using assumptions about mortality, loadings,

and interest rates. If the retiree does not annuitize his wealth, he must allocate his retirement money

across various financial assets such as equities and bonds (represented here as mutual funds); there-

after, he can withdraw a certain amount at the beginning of each year for consumption purposes.

Throughout, we assume that payouts are taxed as ordinary income; therefore taxes will not change

the desirability of voluntary annuitization or systematic withdrawal from a self-managed retirement

account.1

1 Withdrawal Plans with Fixed Benefits

         Under a fixed benefit rule, at the beginning of each year the retiree will sell as many fund

units as required to reach the same yearly benefits paid by the life annuity, either until he dies or the

retirement assets are exhausted. Formally, the benefits Bt at the beginning of each year are given by:

                                                Bt = min( B,Vt ) ,                                                     (1)

where Vt is the value of the retirement accounts assets wealth at the beginning of year t (t = 0, 1, …)

just before the withdrawal Bt for that year is made. The retiree faces an intertemporal budget con-

  This is accurate for the German context; for more on annuity tax treatment in the US see Brown et al. (2001). Hugen et
al (2002) studies the cash-flows of various withdrawal rates (as a percentage of initial portfolio value) within an ex post
context using historical returns data on common stocks and bonds before and after taxes.

straint such that wealth next period Vt+1 equals wealth today Vt, less what is subtracted for benefit

payments Bt, times the (inflation adjusted) portfolio return Rt+1 over the period, or zero if the fund is

exhausted:

                                                         ⎧(V − B)(1 + Rt +1 ) Vt > B
                     Vt +1 = (Vt − Bt ) ⋅ (1 + Rt +1 ) = ⎨ t                         .                  (2)
                                                         ⎩       0            Vt ≤ B.

Note that the benefit paid Bt depends on the value of the retirement assets used to finance withdraw-

als, Vt. If these assets are risky, benefit payouts are exposed to uncertain capital market returns. The

idea of the fixed benefit rule is to replicate the payout from a life annuity (self-annuitization) as long

as the funds permit, while at the same time offering liquidity and some bequest potential in the

event of an early death. Nevertheless, the risk of such a self annuitization strategy is that adverse

capital markets linked to longevity outcomes might produce a situation where Vt hits zero and there-

fore Bt = Bt+1 = … = 0, while the retiree is still alive.

2. Phased Withdrawal Rules with Variable Benefits

        Under a variable phased withdrawal plan, the retiree receives an ex ante fixed fraction of the

retirement assets remaining each period (as in Merton 1971). Due to the stochastic nature of capital

markets, the value of the retiree’s fund is exposed to positive as well as negative fluctuations. Con-

sequently, the level of benefit payments under a variable withdrawal plan also fluctuates in tandem

with the account value.

        The path of benefits payable under a variable phased withdrawal rule can be formalized as

follows. Let Vt be the value of the retirement assets at the beginning of period t (t = 0, 1, …) before

the withdrawal Bt for that year is made. At the beginning of period t, an ex ante specified fraction ωt

(0 < ωt ≤ 1) is withdrawn from current wealth; hence the retiree receives a payment according to:

                                               Bt = ωt ⋅ Vt                                             (3)
                                                                                                            7



Further let Rt+1 denote the return of the funds over the period. Then, the intertemporal budget con-

straint of the retirement account is given by:

                        Vt +1 = (Vt − Bt ) ⋅ (1 + Rt +1 ) = (1 − ω t ) ⋅ Vt ⋅ (1 + Rt +1 ) .            (4)

Note that if the assets of the pension account are invested in risky assets, both the pension benefits

Bt as well as the bequest potential Vt are random variables. In what follows, we focus attention on

three specific withdrawal rules that generate variable benefits: the fixed percentage rule, the 1/T

rule, and the 1/E(T) rule. Each is discussed in turn.

“Fixed Percentage” Withdrawal Rule: Here a constant fraction is withdrawn each period from the

remaining fund wealth,; that is, the benefit-wealth ratio is fixed over time:

                                                 Bt
                                                    = ω t = ω.                                          (5)
                                                 Vt

This withdrawal rule has the advantage of simplicity, requiring no information regarding the maxi-

mum possible duration of the payout phase or the retiree’s demographic characteristics.

"1/T Rule" Withdrawal Rule: The idea behind this rule is to set the withdrawal fraction according

to the maximum possible duration of the plan, denoted by T. One way is to set T equal to the oldest

age assumed in a mortality table; another is to fix it at the retiree’s life expectancy as of his retire-

ment date (Brown et al., 1999). In the first case, the maximum number of payments T is given by

the limiting age l of the mortality table minus the current age of the retiree x plus one (T – l – x +1).

       The retiree gets a fraction of 1/T of his initial pension account as the first payment, the sec-

ond payment is worth 1/(T –1) of the remaining assets, and so forth until the retiree either passes

away or reaches the plan’s limiting age l. Formally, the benefit-wealth ratio at the beginning of year

t (t = 0, 1, …T-1) of this retirement plan is given according to:

                                              Bt          1
                                                 = ωt =      .                                          (6)
                                              Vt        T −t
                                                                                                               8



In contrast to the fixed percentage rule discussed above, the withdrawal fraction is not constant, but

rather rises with age.

“1/E[T(x)]" Withdrawal Rule: This rule, which we will call the 1/E(T) rule for short, takes into

account the retiree’s remaining life expectancy in a dynamic way. Now, the withdrawal fraction is

no longer determined by the maximum length of the plan, but instead it is a function of the retiree’s

remaining life expectancy. Let t px represents the conditional probability that an x-year old man will

                                                                                    l−x
attain age x + t, the complete expectation of life is calculated as E[T ( x + t )] = ∑ t p x where l is the
                                                                                    t =0


maximum age according to a mortality table. Then, for an at retirement x-year old man, the benefit-

to-wealth ratio in period t after retirement, conditional on the fact that he is still alive, is given as:

                                       Bt             1
                                          = ωt =                .                                            (7)
                                       Vt        E[T ( x + t )]

The shorter his expected remaining lifetime, the higher the fraction he will withdrawal from his

pension account. The 1/E(T) withdrawal rule is used in the US during the decumulation phase of

401(k) plans, where the tax authority seeks to ensure that retirees consume their tax-qualified pen-

sion accounts instead of leaving them as bequests for their heirs (see Munnell et al., 2002).


Risk and Reward Analysis of Phased Withdrawal Plans Conditional on Survival

1 Research Design

        To compare the risk and value characteristics of the four phased withdrawal rules of interest,

it is useful to begin with an assessment of expected payouts conditional on retiree survival. For the

moment, therefore, we focus only on the risk resulting from capital markets and suppress mortality.

To do so, we assume a 65-year old male retiree who seeks to compare benefits under the four

phased withdrawal plans given an initial asset balance. His retirement assets are rebalanced annu-

ally to maintain an asset pool split evenly between stocks and bonds, consistent with recommenda-
                                                                                                                        9



tions by financial advisors.2 The analysis to follow uses assumptions drawn from the German capital

and annuity market environment; later, we offer some comparisons with US assumptions. The an-

nuitant mortality table is provided by the German Society of Actuaries and used to calculate sur-

vival probabilities and expected lifetime (in the 1/E(T) case). Since this table ends at age 110, we

set l = 110 for the 1/T rule. For the fixed percentage withdrawal rule, we select ω = 5.82%, since

this benefit-to-wealth ratio produces an initial payout equal to the life annuity in the first year of the

plan. In the case of the fixed benefit rule, we assume that the initial withdrawal continues until the

retiree dies or the account is exhausted.

        We compare the risk and return patterns that emerge under these alternative phased with-

drawal patterns to those from a fixed real annuity providing lifelong constant payouts. When focus-

ing on risks and benefits, the computations either assume that the retiree is alive, or conversely, we

evaluate the bequest potential if the retiree is assumed to pass away at a specific age. To do so, we

specify an exogenous structure on the ex-ante probability distribution governing the financial uncer-

tainty of future returns and estimate the parameters of such a model from independent (e.g. yearly)

historical observations of real returns. With such a model in place, it is possible to look into the fu-

ture and compute the expected benefit payments and different shortfall-risk measures of the four

withdrawal plans in which we are interested. Implementing it relies on the assumption that the sto-

chastic specification of the asset values in the retirement account follows a geometric random walk

with drift, a standard assumption in financial economics. This implies that the yearly log-returns

are serially independent and identically normally distributed with given mean and covariance. We



2
  Feldstein et al. (2001) and Ibbotson (2003) assume that retirees hold their non-annuitized assets in a 60% stock, 40%
bond portfolio. Here, for illustrative purposes, we use a more conservative 50-50 split, consistent with the position rec-
ommended by the President’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security (see Cogan and Mitchell (2003)). Some finan-
cial advisers propose that investors hold equities equal to 100 minus their age; see Canner et al. (1997) or Vora and
McGinnes (2000). The number 100 can be justified as it is the maximum age used in most population mortality tables,
but annuitant mortality tables often have a maximum age 10-15 years higher.

also use German historical time series over the period 1967-2004 for the German Equity Index

(DAX) and the German Bond Index (REXP) as proxies for stock and bond investments. The DAX

represents an index portfolio of German blue-chip stocks, and the REXP represents a portfolio of

German government bonds. Each of these indices is adjusted for capital gains as well as dividends

and coupon payments (on a pre-tax basis). To account for potential administrative costs, we subtract

the equivalent of 0.5% p.a. from the yearly portfolio return. Subsequently, asset returns are adjusted

for inflation by using the German Consumer Price Index.

        These yearly data produce estimates for the real log average rate of return for stocks of 6.18

percent and 3.96 percent for bonds, respectively. The corresponding volatilities are 25.00 percent

for stocks and 5.07 percent for bonds, and the correlation-coefficient is 0.22. Since we assume nor-

mally distributed log returns, i.e. It = ln(1 + Rt) ~ N(µ, σ ), these parameters imply a real log mean

rate of return on the fifty-fifty stock-bond portfolio of µ = 5.81 percent with a standard deviation of

σ = 13.28 percent. Note that this produces an expected gross rate of return of E(1 + Rt) = E[exp(It)]

= exp[0.0581+ 0.5*0.1328²] =1.0692. Assuming3 that the normality property also holds for the log

portfolio returns, it is straightforward to develop an analytical closed form solution for the probabil-

ity distribution of future benefits of the different variable phased withdrawal rules (see Appendix B

for details). However, because the value of the retirement accounts value might hit zero, the in-

tertemporal budget constraint in equation (2) for the fixed benefit rule is not (log)linear, and future

benefits are path-dependent. Hence, for the fixed benefits withdrawal plan, the probability distribu-

tion of future benefits is unknown. As a result, estimates for the different risk and return measure

use Monte-Carlo simulation to generate a large number (i.e. 100,000) of paths for the evolution of

the withdrawal plan.

  This assumption is widely used in the strategic asset allocation literature (e.g. Feldstein et al. 2001 or Campbell and
Viceira 2002) and it can be justified by a Taylor approximation of the nonlinear function relating log-individual-asset
returns to log portfolio returns. For details see Campbell and Viceira (2002), p. 28-29 and Campbell et al. (2001).

2      Analysis of Expected Benefits

       Figure 1 depicts the Expected Benefits profiles conditional on survival under all four phased

withdrawal rules; in each case payouts are compared to the annuity profile. Focusing on the fixed

benefit rule, we see that in the first year, mean benefits are (by construction) equal to the annuity

payout. Thereafter, however, expected payments from the plan are decreasing, reflecting the risk of

running out of money. The fixed fraction rule also starts with a benefit equal to the life annuity pay-

out, and after that, mean benefits slightly rise as the retiree ages. This is due to the fact that the pen-

sion account’s expected gross rate of return is 6.92% p.a., which exceeds the constant benefit-to-

wealth-ratio of 5.82% p.a. (i.e. 1.0692*(1-0.0582) = 1.007 > 1).

Figure 1 here

       By contrast, the 1/T rule pays a much lower expected benefit up to the age of 80, but thereaf-

ter, the expected benefit rises extremely quickly and to very high levels. This can be explained by

the low withdrawal fractions under this rule, during the first part of the retirement plan. Up to age

95, the benefit-to-wealth ratio is lower than the expected rate of return; consequently, the expected

value of the pension assets grows over time. “Reserves” built up in earlier ages can be used to in-

crease the expected benefits in later years. The 1/E(T) rule starts at a level of about 85% of the an-

nuity payment and increases to 100% when the retiree attains age 70. This payout approach reaches

its maximum expected payment of about 150% at age of 83. After that point, expected payments

monotonically decrease, reaching the life annuity benefit level at age 91. For ages older than 100,

the 1/E(T) rule would expose the retiree to very low benefits, asymptotically approaching zero.

Only for the first six years of the retirement plan will the benefit-to-wealth ratio be lower than the

expected return earned on pension assets. If the retiree survives until age 71, his expected lifetime is

about 15 years, resulting in a withdrawal fraction of 6.66% which is about the same as the expected

rate of return. Beyond that age, the withdrawal fraction grows ever larger than the expected asset
                                                                                                                    12



returns backing benefit payments. For some time (i.e. up to age 83), the increasing withdrawal frac-

tions produce increasing expected benefits. But because less and less wealth is left in the fund, at

some point (here age 83) the expected benefit amounts decrease although the withdrawal fraction

increases.

3. Shortfall Risk Analysis

        In general, shortfall risk is associated with the possibility of “something bad happening”, in

other words, falling below a required target return. Returns below the target (losses) are considered

to be undesirable or risky, while returns above the target (gains) are desirable or non-risky. In this

sense, shortfall-risk-measures are called “relative” or “pure” measures of risk.4 To analyze this risk

in the case of our phased withdrawal strategies, we employ several different shortfall risk measures.

Shortfall Probability: We begin with the shortfall probability, defined as:

                                            SP(Bt) = P(Bt < z).                                                   (8)

This measures the probability that the periodic withdrawal Bt is smaller than a chosen benchmark z,

which is here the payment provided by the life annuity.

        Figure 2 depicts the SP for the fixed benefit rule, the fixed fraction rule, the 1/T approach,

and the 1/E(T) rule, compared to the annuity benefit. In the first year, all the strategies except the

fixed benefit program face a high probability of shortfall; the only reason the fixed benefit approach

does not is that it is set, by construction, to pay the initial annuity value as long as the funds are not

exhausted. Accordingly, the fixed benefit program offers a shortfall probability close to zero at the

beginning of the retirement period, but this risk metric begins to rise over time, reaching about 20%

around age 85. By contrast, both the 1/T and 1/E(T) rules have high shortfall probabilities early in

4
  The concept of shortfall risk was introduced in the area of finance by Roy (1952) and Kataoka (1963), and it was ex-
panded and theoretically justified by Bawa (1978) and Fishburn (1977, 1982, 1984). It was widely applied to invest-
ment asset allocation by Leibowitz et al. (1996) and used by Leibowitz and Krasker (1988) and Maurer and Schlag
(2003) among others to judge the long term risk of stocks and bonds. In addition Libby and Fishburn (1977); Kahneman
and Tversky (1979); Laughhunn et al. (1980) and March and Shapira (1987) show that in empirical business decision-
making, many individuals judge the risk of an alternative relative to a reference point.
                                                                                                             13



the retirement period. This is because a retiree investing his assets in a mutual fund hoping to gen-

erate the same payment offered by the life annuity must withdraw about 6.50% of the fund annu-

ally. But the withdrawal fractions under the 1/T and the 1/E(T) rules are smaller early in retirement,

meaning that the wealth remaining grows quickly. Consequently the SP declines over time, though

the withdrawal fraction is growing. The retiree that withdraws a fixed fraction each year faces a risk

profile that is remarkably high for all ages. In early years, the probability of receiving a benefit be-

low the benchmark life annuity is about 50%, gradually increasing to about 54% at the end of the

period.

Figure 2 here

          Another interesting finding has to do with the gradient of the SP under the 1/E(T) rule. Early

in the retirement period there is a fast decline in this risk, but if the retiree is still alive at age 83, the

SP begins to rise quickly due to the special construction of this spending rule. In contrast to the 1/T

rule, expected payments at the beginning of the plan are already higher, meaning that few “re-

serves” are built up in the beginning of the plan. Also, the 65-year-old retiree has an expected re-

maining lifetime of 19 years, and his expected remaining lifetime decreases over time, especially

after the age of 80. The shorter is the remaining expected lifetime, the more wealth will be with-

drawn in the 1/E(T) case. As the withdrawal fractions increase, less and less wealth is left in the

fund; at some point, wealth remaining is insufficient to provide high enough payments, so the short-

fall probability again rises.

Shortfall Measures That Incorporate Severity: As Bodie (2001: 308) notes, a major shortcoming

of the popular SP risk metric is that it “completely ignores how large the potential shortfall might

be.” That is, the shortfall probability answers the question “how often” consumption falls short, but

not “how bad” the loss is if it occurs, under each of the different withdrawal rules. A shortfall risk
                                                                                                           14



metric that considers both the probability and the average size of the shortfall when it occurs is the

Shortfall Expectation (SE):

                          SE(Bt) = E[max(z - Bt,0)] = MEL(Bt)ּSP(Bt).                                     (9)

The SE is the sum of losses weighted by their probabilities, and hence it is a measure of the uncon-

ditional “average loss”. As equation (9) shows, the SE is the product of the shortfall probability and

the conditional expected shortfall given the occurrence of a shortfall. This measure is also known as

the Mean Excess Loss and it is defined as MEL(Bt) = E[ z – Bt | Bt < z ], i.e. the MEL answers the

question of “how badly on average” the strategy performs (see Artzner et al. 1999).

       In Figure 3 we plot the shortfall expectation results for the various withdrawal strategies of

interest, namely the fixed benefit rule, the fixed fraction rule, the 1/T approach, and the 1/E(T) rule.

The SEs can be compared for each tactic to the annuity benefit, all conditional on survival. Here we

see that the fixed benefit rule has a very low shortfall expectation through about age 83, whereas the

1/T rule is initially the riskiest with a 60% SE. It takes a very long time until the SE of the 1/T rule

declines to a negligible level, older than age 90 for the case under study. The fixed fraction and the

1/E(T) rules both have SEs below 20% through at least age 80, but the 1/E(T) rule again traces out

what is perhaps unexpected behavior – after falling to low levels through about age 84, the risk be-

gins to rise substantially 20 years after retirement, and it has the highest expected shortfall for the

long-lived individual.

Figure 3 here

4. Analysis of Expected Bequests

       The other aspect of these rules, of course, is that the retiree must in effect compare his own

consumption with the potential value of any bequest going to his heirs should he die. Figure 5 illus-

trates the expected bequest under the various formulations, conditional on death. The pattern exhib-

iting most stability is the fixed fraction rule, but the other three are highly divergent. For example,
                                                                                                         15



the 1/T expected bequest follows an interesting path, rising during the early retirement period when

withdrawals are small. About 35 years after retirement, however, the expected bequest begins to

decline very quickly – a fact that is directly attributable to the construction of this plan. The older a

retiree gets, the more he or she withdraws from his account: thus five years before the plan ends, the

retiree withdraws 1/5 (or 20%) of the remaining wealth. If the retiree should, by chance, live beyond

age 110, this approach offers no continued payment or bequest potential. The 1/E(T) rule also offers

only a very low bequest potential after reaching a limiting age. In contrast with the 1/T tactic, how-

ever, the 1/E(T) plan offers lower expected inheritance at every age. Particularly if the retiree does

not die until 20 years into retirement, the inheritance will decline dramatically.

Figure 4 here


Risk-Minimizing Phased Withdrawal Strategies

       Thus far, our analysis has assumed that the retiree holds his pension assets in a fixed-weight

portfolio comprised of 50% stocks and 50% bonds; accordingly the payouts in retirement take into

account only capital market uncertainty, without permitting investment optimization around

risk/reward tradeoffs. In this subsection, we extend the analysis by considering mortality risk and

two additional phased withdrawal rules that permit the retiree to optimize the design of the with-

drawal patterns. In the next subsection, we further vary the portfolio’s investment weights to attain a

risk-minimizing static asset allocation. The portfolio weights are therefore determined endoge-

nously (excluding short-selling), following Albrecht and Maurer (2002). Finally, the following sub-

section examines the impact of mandatory shifting to annuitization at a specific age. This is cur-

rently required in tax qualified German Riester plans at the age of 85 and for UK income drawdown

plans at the age 75.

1. Optimized Withdrawal Rules in a Risk-Return Context

       To evaluate how the relative ranking of the alternative withdrawal rules might change with
                                                                                                         16



an endogenous asset mix in the retiree’s investment fund and other plan design parameters, it is use-

ful to define the expected present value of the shortfall, called here “EPVShortfall”:

                                                   l−x
                                                               p x SE ( B t )
                                  EPVShortfa ll = ∑       t
                                                                                                      (10)
                                                   t =0       (1 + R f ) t

Here, SE(Bt) = E[max(z – Bt, 0)] denotes the expected shortfall with respect to the target z, which is

the benefit flow of the benchmark life annuity. Possible expected shortfalls are weighted by the

conditional probability tpx that a man aged x at the beginning of the retirement phase is still alive, if

a shortfall occurs. All possible expected shortfalls are discounted back to the beginning of the re-

tirement period using the risk-free interest rate Rf (i.e. assuming a flat term structure of real interest

rates) and summed over the maximum length of the mortality table used. This useful summary

measure of the risk associated with a phased withdrawal strategy may be interpreted as the lump

sum premium that would be required for the retiree to transfer this shortfall risk to an insurer, as-

suming actuarially fair pricing and no additional loading. Given this function, we minimize it with

regard to asset allocation and other plan design parameters, to derive the patterns most amenable to

alternative withdrawal rules.

       Previous studies, most notably Milevsky (1998), Milevsky and Robinson (2000) and Albrecht

and Maurer (2002), approach the issue of optimal fixed benefit withdrawal rules by adopting the

criterion of controlling the probability of a consumption shortfall in retirement. On the other hand,

as we have argued, this perspective does not account the timing and magnitude of the loss when it

happens, which our risk measure does. To extend the approach, we propose two additional reward

measures associated with each optimized phased withdrawal strategy, namely, the expected present

value of benefits received during life (EPVBenefits) and the expected present value of bequests at

death (EPVBequest). These are defined, respectively, as:
                                                                                                                         17


                                                        l−x
                                                                p x E (B t )
                                     EPVBenefit s = ∑          t
                                                                             , and                                    (11)
                                                        t =0   (1 + R f ) t

                                                        l−x
                                                                      p x q x +t E ( Vt )
                                     EPVBequest = ∑            t −1
                                                                                                                      (12)
                                                        t =1          (1 + R f ) t

Here, the EPVBenefits is similar to the money’s worth concept used by Mitchell et al. (1999); it

reflects the expected present value of benefit payments conditional on survival. Finally, EBVBe-

quest measures the expected present value of the inheritance that the retiree would pass on to heirs

in the event of his death.5

         Using these, we develop two optimized rules, namely the “Fixed Percent Optimized” rule,

and the “1/T Optimized” rule. The first minimizes the expected present value of the shortfall by

jointly selecting the optimal constant withdrawal fraction and an asset allocation. This relaxes the

constant withdrawal rule mentioned earlier by endogenizing the withdrawal fraction. Compared to

the non-optimized Fixed Percent rule, we expect that having two additional parameters, the fraction

consumed as well as the asset allocation, will be more successful in controlling both mortality and

capital market risk. The second rule, denoted as “1/T Optimized,” minimizes the EPVShortfall by

jointly selecting the maximum duration of the plan conditional on survival, and the asset allocation.

We expect that the 1/T Optimized rule will permit more consumption when the probability is high

that the retiree remains alive, as compared to the non-optimized 1/T rule, but it will also offer lower

expected bequests.

2. Comparative Results: Annuity versus Phased Withdrawal Plans


5
  These metrics are useful as compared to a specific utility function for several reasons. First, the risk measures are
consistent with expected utility analysis, since they are the primitives that enter into utility maximizers’ objective func-
tions. For example, one could imagine that a retiree trades off expected benefit payments versus the expected shortfall
vis a vis the benchmark annuity; this risk value model is consistent with a utility function suggested by Fishburn (1977).
Further any particular functional form must embody specific tradeoffs between risk and return components, whereas our
approach can remain agnostic about the specific weights attached to each (Sarin and Weber 1993). Also, risk minimiza-
tion is consistent with many prior studies (c.f. Albrecht and Maurer, 2002; Chen and Milevsky, 2003; Milevsky and
Robinson, 1994), and it is also consistent with conventional wisdom offered by financial planners when providing ad-
vice regarding retirement income payouts (c.f. Ameriks, 2004; Ameriks et al., 2001; Ibbotson Associates, 2003).
                                                                                                         18



       Table 1 report results for the various withdrawal rules of interest, allowing optimized asset

allocation. These may be compared to the benchmark case of a life annuity benefit given in Row 1;

here, we find that a 65-year old male who paid €100 for an immediate real annuity will receive an-

nual benefits of €5.82 for life. By construction, both the EPVShortfall and EPVBequest are zero for

the annuity purchase; the EPVBenefits measure is slightly below €100 due to the annuity load as-

sumed. Row 2 reports results for a phased withdrawal program where the Fixed Benefit is set equal

to the annuity at €5.82 as before; of course, the retiree may run short of funds. The optimized asset

allocation associated with minimizing the EPVShortfall for this Fixed Benefit withdrawal plan con-

sists of 25% stocks and 75% bonds, and associated with this plan is an expected shortfall worth

€3.24 per €100 of initial assets. As long as the retiree lives, he can expect benefits totaling €93.87

(in present value). The present value of the bequest that his heirs can expect is quite large, at €54.67

(or more than half the initial investment). Clearly, unless the retiree has an enormous taste for be-

quests, annuitization would be judged far superior to taking a fixed benefit at 5.82€ per annum until

the fund is likely exhausted.

Table 1 here

       Rows 3 and 4 of Table 1 display results for two Fixed Percentage strategies. The first is de-

termined by selecting a fixed percentage rule that pays out a first-year benefit equivalent to the

€5.82 real lifelong annuity payable to a 65-year old male paying €100. Given this constant benefit-

wealth-ratio (i.e. ω = 5.82%), we solve for the optimal asset mix minimizing the EPVShortfall. The

second strategy selects a fixed fraction that is now also optimized with regard to EPVShortfall.

What is different here is that both the asset allocation and the withdrawal fraction are simultane-

ously optimized at the beginning of the retirement phase. These two rows indicate that, in both

cases, the risk measured by the EPVShortfall is almost four times as large as under the Fixed Bene-

fit approach. Offsetting this could be the higher benefit stream conditional on survival and higher
                                                                                                         19



bequest value to the heirs. Both fixed percentage strategies have slightly higher equity exposures

(about 35%) than the fixed benefit approach (25%). This contrasts with the high equity exposures

recommended by Albrecht and Maurer (2002) and Vora and McGinnes (2000) who use a fixed

benefit withdrawal approach. Of course, an optimized strategy that permits a fixed percentage pay-

out of 7% of the account annually has a lower expected shortfall and higher expected benefits than

the non-optimized strategy.

       Next we turn to the two 1/T rules, where again the first simply sets T to the maximum plan

duration (the oldest age in the mortality table), and optimizes asset allocation so as to minimize the

EPVshortfall. The second rule endogenously evaluates both the asset allocation and the plan dura-

tion that minimizes EPVShortfall. It is interesting that the simple 1/T rule (Row 5) results in the

highest equity exposure, and it is also unlikely to be preferred by many: this is because the size of

the expected shortfall is the largest of those considered (€34 of the initial €100 asset), and the ex-

pected benefits are the lowest of those examined. The only clear gainers are likely to be the heirs.

We contrast this with the pattern that would result from optimizing the maximum plan duration,

which the retiree could do if he had Social Security or welfare to live on in the event that his asset

were extinguished but he were still alive. This would occur around age 87, according to the program

computed. Row 6 indicates using the 1/T rule optimized for asset allocation and the date of running

out of assets offers lower risk, higher expected than the annuity, a reasonable bequest, and the asset

allocation is not too risky (16% equity and 84% bonds).

       Finally we turn to Row 7 for the 1/E(T) rule, which is consistent with the phased withdrawal

scheme for 401(k) pension plans allowed by the US tax authority. This is an interesting strategy,

because it offers quite low expected shortfalls and 8% higher expected benefits than the life annuity,

while still affording a decent bequest potential. The asset allocation implied is rather conservative,

with 22% in equity and 78% in bonds. Overall, looking across the phased withdrawal plans, there is
                                                                                                         20



no clearly dominant strategy, since all involve tradeoffs between risk, benefit, and bequest meas-

ures, and individual preferences may vary. Nevertheless, the 1/E(T) rule seems relatively appealing

as compared to the others, as long as the retiree has only a moderate appetite for bequests.

       The second panel of Table 1 reports results for a female age-65 retiree considering the same

phased withdrawal patterns. To summarize results, we find that women generally confront lower

expected shortfall risks and anticipate higher EPVBenefits. This is because lower female mortality

translates into a lower initial annuity payment; i.e. her actuarially fair benefit is €5.02 per year for a

€100 purchase (versus the male payout of €5.82). Consequently, variable withdrawal plans have the

woman withdraw less early in life, leaving more assets in the fund to earn future capital market re-

turns. Since the woman also is expected to live longer, she will more likely be alive to reap the

fruits of the investment. We would therefore predict, and the results confirm, that the 1/E(T) rule is

more attractive to women than men, since it offers rather low expected shortfalls, and 20% higher

expected benefits as compared to the annuity, while still affording a decent bequest potential. It is

also interesting that the asset allocation strategies for women are similar to those for men.

       Thus far, the analysis has assumed the retiree begins the payout phase at age 65, but it may

be of interest to explore how phased withdrawal patterns might change for alternative retirement

ages. Table 2 displays the findings for a male retiring at age 60 or age 70, which can be directly

compared with the top panel of Table 1. The results show that the phased withdrawal patterns are

unambiguously more attractive for an age-60 retiree, as compared to the 65-year old. In other

words, all expected shortfall risk measures are lower, expected benefit payouts to the living retirees

are higher, and expected bequests are similar; furthermore, the portfolios are slightly lighter in equi-

ties. This is because the mortality drag for the life annuity purchased by a younger person, and

therefore the benchmark, is substantially lower. By contrast, higher mortality faced by a 70-year old

retiree produces a higher benchmark annuity which translates into greater EPVShortfalls, lower
                                                                                                        21



expected benefits, and also lower expected bequests. This is despite having 10-15% higher equity

exposure. This leads us to conclude that annuitization would be relatively more appealing to older

retirees, as compared to phased withdrawal patterns.

Table 2 here

       Thus far the annuity benchmark has been computed using the sex-specific mortality table

relevant to the individual making the purchase. But in some contexts, insurers are required to use a

“unisex” mortality table when pricing annuities: for example, this is true in the US if an annuity is

purchased with company-based pension accumulations (McGill et al., 2004). Likewise in the UK,

unisex tables are used to price annuities in the Personal Pension arrangements. A unisex mortality

table is generated by averaging mortality probabilities for men and women at each age. Naturally,

such a table boosts the annuity paid to a female retiree and reduces the male’s benefit, as compared

to using sex-specific tables. In our context, if German mortality tables were used to value unisex

payouts (as per Appendix A), a €100 annuity purchased by a female would have benefit payouts

that are 7% higher than otherwise, whereas payments to the male would be 7.7% lower.

       Yet the surprise is that women are not necessarily gainers, depending on the phased with-

drawal pattern selected. This is because adopting a unisex table for annuitization changes the annu-

ity payout benchmark, while the phased withdrawal plan still embodies the purchaser’s sex-specific

mortality table. Table 3 illustrates this case, where the annuity benefit is now (by construction)

equal for men and women, at €5.37 annually for a €100 purchase. For men, expected shortfalls un-

der all withdrawal patterns are lower, expected benefits are lower, and bequests are higher. The pat-

tern is the opposite for women: expected shortfalls are higher, expected benefits are higher, and

bequests lower. In other words, if a government mandated a unisex table for annuity pricing yet it

still permitted phased withdrawal patterns, the woman who elected the phased withdrawal will be
                                                                                                          22



exposed to greater risk. This is likely a result that would be surprising to those who advocate unisex

tables in retirement accounts.

Table 3 here

3 Phased Withdrawal Plans with Mandatory Deferred Annuities.

       The results above suggest that some retirees might prefer to engage in a mixed strategy –

that is, to undertake phased withdrawals during the early portion of the retirement period and then to

switch to an annuity thereafter. Furthermore, some researchers have suggested that such a mixed

strategy would be attractive: it enhances the payout early on, in exchange for relatively low risk,

and it also adds the insurance feature later in life (Blake et al., 2003; Milevsky, 1998). In addition, as

noted earlier, some governments have recently required that the elderly annuitize after a phased

income drawdown period.

       To examine the risks and rewards associated with phased withdrawal followed by mandatory

annuitization at some later age, we now revisit our calculations under each withdrawal rule but as-

sume that annuity purchase is required if the individual is still alive at either age 75 or 85. Two ap-

proaches are considered. In the first case, which we call the “switching strategy”, a retiree would

follow the relevant phased withdrawal rule until reaching the mandatory switching age. Again as the

benchmark, we use the real annuity that the retiree could have purchased at age 65, to compare our

new results with prior findings. If, at the switching point, the fund is inadequate to purchase this real

annuity, the gap represents a shortfall; conversely, if the account holds more than is needed to buy

the benchmark annuity, this excess can be allocated to increase the bequest or used for higher con-

sumption. In the following, we assume that an excess (if any) is used to increase the level of the

annuity starting at age 75 or 85, enhancing the EPVBenefits rather than EPVBequest measure. For

the second case, we examine an “immediate purchase deferral strategy”. In this case, the retiree

purchases an annuity on retirement, with deferred payouts beginning at age 75 (or 85). The deferred
                                                                                                            23



annuity benefit is set equal to the benchmark that the retiree could have received if he initiated an-

nuity payments at age 65. It is worth noting that it is unclear what one might expect from these

switching strategies, in terms of risks and rewards. Some analysts suggest that switching may be a

preferred strategy, relying on the fact that the mortality drag rises with age; annuities pay out more

for a given premium, the older one is when purchasing them (Milevsky, 2001). On the other hand,

that analysis focuses only on the probability of a shortfall but does not weight the size of the loss,

conditional on the shortfall occurring. By delaying annuitization, the retiree can benefit from capital

market returns if they are favorable, so benefit payments can be higher while he lives, or bequests

higher if he dies. Yet delaying annuitization also exposes him to shortfall risk.

        Table 4 reports findings for the male retiring at age 65, making the decision to switch from a

phased withdrawal to an annuity at either age 75 (or 85). Comparing results in Panel A of Tables 1

and 4, we see that if delayed annuitization is available, this generally increases the value of the EP-

VBenefits amount and shrinks the EPVShortfall, both of which are beneficial. The EPVBequest

falls, indicating that the deferred annuitization strategy is likely to be most attractive to those seek-

ing to secure consumption while alive, without completely stripping their heirs of some unexpended

funds. In other words, the risk/return profile of the phased withdrawal plan that includes a delayed

annuity is enhanced, as compared to no annuity, at the cost of a smaller bequest potential. Also in-

teresting is the fact that switching to an annuity later in life (i.e. at age 85; compare panels A and B

in Table 4) raises the equity share of the portfolio slightly, but greatly enhances the bond exposure.

Also, buying the annuity later obviously promise more bequest potential, at the cost of higher short-

fall.

Table 4 here

        Table 5 displays results for a 65-year old male purchasing a deferred annuity at the begin-

ning of the retirement period, with annuity payouts commencing at age 75 (or 85) assuming he is
                                                                                                          24



alive. In contrast to the mandatory annuitization strategy, we see that the risk and return profile de-

pends heavily on the chosen withdrawal rule. In the case of the 1/T rule combined with a deferred

annuity payable from age 75, the logical strategy is to consume all remaining wealth using the

phased withdrawal tactic by age 74, secure in the knowledge that one is protected against longevity

risk thereafter. This pattern provides a benefit stream worth slightly more than the real annuity, and

it offers low shortfall risk and low expected bequests. This is an important result since it indicates

the advantage of allowing flexibility until age 75, paired with protected consumption after that age.

Similar results hold if the deferred annuity were to begin at age 85, with slightly higher benefit and

bequest levels at the expense of somewhat higher shortfalls. By contrast, the 1/E(T) rule combined

with a deferred annuity at age 75 provides the retiree with relatively low payouts up to age 75, pro-

ducing a high EPVShortfall, but after that age, benefits flow from both the annuity and the phased

withdrawal plan which raises EPVBenefits (and higher potential bequests). Delaying the annuity

payout date to age 85 instead of 75 exposes the retiree to much higher shortfall risk, along with

higher possible wealth for the heirs.

Table 5 here

4. Comparative Results

       In additional analyses not reported here (but available on request), we have also explored the

sensitivity of our results to a range of alternative capital and annuity market scenarios. An interest-

ing experiment develops the environment that might be relevant to US retirees: here, life expectancy

is longer than in Germany, loadings are lower, and the capital market presents different risk/return

characteristics. In this simulation, we use the US Annuitant 2000 Basic Male mortality table along

with means and standard deviations for stocks, bonds, and cash using Ibbotson Associates data over

the period 1967-2004 (the same period over which we take the German capital market parameters).

While annuity payouts are quite similar across the two countries, capital markets display different
                                                                                                        25



characteristics: the mean returns on stocks and bonds is slightly lower in the US than Germany, but

volatility on stocks is much lower in the US (about 17% instead of 25% in Germany), and it is much

higher on bonds (about 11% versus 5% in Germany). Under these assumptions, we re-optimize the

withdrawal rules and find, for all withdrawal plans, that the US retiree would hold a much higher

level of equity exposure in the risk-minimizing portfolio. Nevertheless, the withdrawal fractions are

not much affected for the 1/T and the Fixed Percentage rules. This is accompanied by a higher

shortfall risk, higher expected benefits, and comparable expected bequests, driven by the fact that

bonds are riskier in the US than in Germany.


Summary and Concluding Remarks

       Standard economic models imply that retirees would tend to value highly the protection

against longevity risk that annuitization offers, but the evidence suggests that many retirees do not

purchase annuities with their disposable wealth, perhaps because they anticipate leaving a bequest.

As a result, there is a need for models that can guide retirees as they examine tradeoffs between

consumption versus the possibility of leaving a bequest during the asset drawdown phase. Of

course, these tradeoffs require a retired worker to exchange some risk for some return, offering a

natural role for phased withdrawal programs during the retirement period.

       Our approach uses the concept of shortfall-risk, whereby the benefit of a life annuity serves

as the benchmark. We extend previous research in two directions. First, we use a risk metric which

considers both the probability as well as the size of a consumption shortfall when it occurs. Second,

we focus not only on phased withdrawal plans with fixed benefits, but also on variable benefit pat-

terns in conjunction with a predetermined benefit-to-wealth ratio. We investigate several phased

withdrawal strategies, assessing the success of withdrawal rules while allowing for endogenous as-

set allocation patterns, and we also allow the worker to make decisions both about when to retire

and when to switch to an annuity. Of course, selecting any specific withdrawal pattern requires fur-
                                                                                                                        26



ther information on utility weights that balance own consumption against bequests, but many retir-

ees and their financial counselors may find it difficult to articulate their utility functions in advance.

For this reason, we believe it is useful to explore various explicit risk and return measures for alter-

native withdrawal plans, allowing for randomness in both the time of death and investment returns.6

       Our model offers several novel conclusions which may be useful for professional financial

planers helping clients make retirement investment choices:

     Discretionary management of accumulated assets with systematic phased withdrawals for con-
      sumption purposes offers the advantages of flexibility, bequests, and possibly higher rates of
      consumption than under a standard life annuity. However, phased withdrawal plans also re-
      quire the retiree to dedicate effort to formulating asset allocation and withdrawal rules.

     A phased withdrawal plan that minimizes the risk of consuming less than the real annuity
      benchmark will allocate retirement assets more to fixed income than to equities. Nonetheless,
      the specific mix elected will depend on plan design, age, and mortality risk, among other fac-
      tors.

     A phased withdrawal strategy paying the same benefit as an annuity exposes the retiree to the
      risk of outliving his assets while still alive. A phased withdrawal plan using a fixed benefit-to-
      wealth ratio avoids the risk of running out of money, since benefits fluctuate in tandem with
      the pension fund’s value. But the fixed benefit withdrawal rule affords lower risk than variable
      withdrawal rules, if one uses a mortality-weighted shortfall-risk measure (which includes both
      shortfall probability and magnitude of loss).

     Mandatory deferred annuitization with a fixed withdrawal rule can enhance expected payouts
      and cut expected shortfall risk but at the cost of reduced expected bequests, as compared to no
      annuity. For a variable withdrawal plan, a simple deferred annuitization may not reduce risk:
      rather, it requires optimization of the benefit to wealth ratio.

     The optimized 1/T rule and the fixed benefit rule both have appealing risk characteristics, par-
      ticularly when combined with a mandatory deferred annuity.

     As a standalone strategy, the 1/E(T) phased withdrawal rule is appealing since it offers a rela-
      tively low expected shortfall risk, good expected payouts for the retiree during his life, and
      some bequest potential for his heirs. But when mandatory annuities are combined with a
      phased withdrawal plan, the 1/E(T) rule becomes less attractive.

6
  Taking risk and value as primitives is appealing for several reasons, as expressed by Brachinger and Weber (1997).
From a descriptive perspective, a risk-value model such as ours is likely to be useful in explaining retiree preferences by
understanding how they trade off expected benefits, bequests, and the risk of consumption shortfalls. Policymakers and
regulators may benefit from evidence on the risk-return patterns of different withdrawal options in tax-favored individ-
ual retirement plans. Financial institutions offering retirement products such as banks, insurance companies, and mutual
funds, can use this information to design and market products that have typical benefit, bequest, and risk features.

   Some advocate unisex mortality tables, seeing them as “fairer” to women; however our model
    shows that if phased withdrawal plans are available as an alternative, unsex tables make
    women bear more risk compared to annuitization.

     These findings also have general relevance for national retirement policy in Europe and the

Americas. As one example, the 1/E(T) rule is used by the US tax authority for the “default” with-

drawal pattern in defined contribution accounts (including 401k plans). Our results show that this is

a relatively appealing standard in the US context, where retirement plan annuitization is not manda-

tory. Mandating annuitization after a phased withdrawal period can also be quite appealing in terms

of risk, so it is interesting that this approach has recently been implemented in both the UK and Ger-

many, and it has been recommended in the US by the recent Commission to Strengthen Social Se-

curity (Cogan and Mitchell, 2003). Our results also suggest that government mandates requiring

unisex tables for annuity pricing (as in the UK) expose women to greater risk if they elect a phased

withdrawal plan. Finally, our results imply that retiree portfolios will optimally include more fixed

income if the retiree plans on annuitizing later.

Appendix A: Determining Annuity Benefits
        Using the actuarial principle of equivalence, we estimate the gross single premium of the
annuity by calculating the present value of expected benefits paid to the annuitant including pro-
vider expense loadings (i.e. commissions and administration fees). Explicit assumptions must be
made about mortality risk, the annuitant’s age, the interest rate used by the insurance company to
discount expected benefit payments, and the cost structure of the insurance company.
        Following Albrecht and Maurer (2002), we take the basic annuitant mortality table DAV
1994 R provided by the German Society of Actuaries for the specification of the demographic pa-
rameters. The table offers sex-specific mortality rates qx (qy) for male and female. From these sex
specific mortality rates we construct the mortality rates of a unisex table as a weighted average of qx
and qy. The interest rate (adjusted for inflation) used to discount expected annuity payments is set to
an annual 1.5%, consistent with the current yield of Euro-based inflation-linked bonds. Regarding
the cost-structure of the insurance company, it is assumed that the total expense loading relative to
the pure actuarial premium is 2.785%. Given these assumptions, table A1 shows the yearly real
benefits a retiree with age 60, 65 and 70 would receive per 100 EUR of premium.

Appendix B: Determining Expected Benefits, Expected Bequest and the Risk of a Consump-
tion Shortfall for Phased Withdrawal Plans with given Benefit-to-Wealth Ratios
       Let ωt = Bt/Vt (t = 0, 1, ..,) be a predetermined sequence of benefit-to-wealth ratios 0 ≤ ωt ≤
                       t
1, and define cω t = ∏ (1 −ω i ) . The retirement accounts assets (adjusted for inflation) used to fund
                      i =0
the variable pension benefits Bt are assumed to follow a geometric random walk with drift. This
implies that the real log returns It over the year are serially independent and identically normal dis-
tributed with given mean µ and volatility σ. Given an initial endowment V0 at the beginning of the
retirement phase, the market value of the retiree’s account at the beginning of year t (t = 1, 2, …)
just before the withdrawal Bt for that year is made:
                                                                              ⎛ t ⎞
                             Vt = (1 − ω t −1 )Vt −1 exp(I t ) = cω t −1V0 exp⎜ ∑ I t ⎟ .                 (B1)
                                                                              ⎝ i =1 ⎠
Vt is distributed log-normally, i.e. ln(Vt) ~ N(mt, v²t) follows a normal-distribution with mean mt =
ln[cωt-1 V0] + tµ and variance vt2 = tσ ². Consequently, the benefit payments Bt at the beginning of
each period:
                                                                  ⎛ t ⎞
                                       Bt = ωtVt = ωt cωt −1V0 exp⎜ ∑ I t ⎟                               (B2)
                                                                  ⎝ i =1 ⎠
are also log-normally distributed, i.e. ln(Bt) ~ N(nt, v²t) with parameters nt = ln[ωt cωt-1 V0] + tµ.
With these formulas in hand, and additional assumptions about the expected return µ and volatility
σ of the retirement accounts assets, it is possible to compute for the variable phased withdrawal
rules - i.e. fixed fraction, 1/T and 1/E(T) - various risk and return measures of future benefits if the
retiree is alive as well as the possible bequest in the case he dies.
         The expected benefit payments E[Bt] in each period t = 0, 1, … are given by:
                                                                               1
                           E[ Bt ] = exp(nt + 12 vt2 ) = ω t cω t −1V0 exp(tµ + tσ 2 )                    (B3)
                                                                               2
and the expected bequest if the retiree dies in period t = 1, 2, … according to:
                                                                         1
                             E[Vt ] = exp(mt + 12 vt2 ) = cω tV0 exp(tµ + tσ 2 )                          (B4)
                                                                         2
        The shortfall probability that the benefits from a variable withdrawal plan is lower than a
target annuity z can be calculated as:
                                                 SP( Bt ) = Φ (qt )                                       (B5)
where Φ is the cumulative density function of the Standard Normal Distribution at the point
qt = ( z − mt ) / σ t . Using the results given in Winkler et al., (1972) the shortfall expectation is:

                                SE( Bt ) = z ⋅ Φ (qt ) − E[ Bt ] ⋅ Φ(qt − σ 2 ⋅ t ) .                     (B6)
