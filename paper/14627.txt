                                              ABSTRACT

This paper revisits the issue of people’s preferences for international trade protection examining survey
data from the American National Election Studies. I first show that both an individual’s skills and
the international trade characteristics of their employment industry affects their trade policy preferences,
in contrast to previous analysis using these data. Second, I document that many people do not feel
informed enough to state a preference on trade protection, which is inconsistent with assumptions
of standard political economy models. I examine the factors that correlate with being uninformed,
and show that inferences from actual trade policy outcomes can be incorrect if one does not account
for this uninformed group. Finally, I examine and find that individuals’ retirement decisions have
systematic effects on both their choice to be informed and their trade policy preferences. This highlights
that there are significant life-cycle implications to trade policy preferences.

1. Introduction

       Trade policy outcomes are fundamentally determined by individuals’ preferences for trade

policies which, in turn, are determined by how trade affects the income and welfare of

individuals. While the majority of empirical previous work on trade policy outcomes has

examined the position taken by political representatives or lobbies, more recent work has begun to

explore individuals’ survey responses or votes on trade policies directly. As Rodrik (1995) points

out, understanding the formation of individual trade policy preferences is a fundamental input into

the modeling of trade policy outcomes.

       The recent literature analyzing individual responses has examined whether standard trade

models’ predictions of who gains and loses from trade protection correspond with individuals’

stated preferences regarding trade policies. The almost exclusive focus has been on whether

individuals’ endowments (primarily their human capital skills) or their current industry of

employment are correlated with their trade policy preferences. If workers are (perfectly) mobile

across sectors, then their skill endowment matters for trade policy preferences, not their industry

of employment. This corresponds to a two-factor Heckscher-Ohlin framework with associated

Stolper-Samuelson effects, whereby workers with less (more) skill residing in a skill-abundant

(skill-deficient) country will experience real income declines from freer trade and, thus, favor

trade protection. In contrast, if workers cannot move between industries, then industry

characteristics, not the workers’ skill levels will determine how their income varies with trade and

their resulting trade preferences. This corresponds to a sector-specific model or what Scheve and

Slaughter (2001) call a Ricardo-Viner framework.

       Earlier studies of these competing hypotheses do not examine data at the individual level

and generally conclude in favor of industry characteristics, not human capital endowments, in




                                                 2
determining trade policies. These include Magee (1980) which examines the position taken by

political lobbying groups on a 1973 U.S. trade bill, and Irwin (1994, 1996) which analyze county

voting patterns of 1906 and 1923 British general elections and are argued to be essentially

referenda about trade policies. However, Kaempfer and Marks (1993), Baldwin and Magee

(1998), and Beaulieu (2002b) find some evidence for both human capital endowments and

industry composition of representative districts determining votes on trade bills by US and

Canadian political representatives.1

         A smaller recent literature has begun to examine these hypotheses using individuals’ votes

or stated preferences on surveys about free trade and trade protection. Balistreri (1997) and

Beaulieu (2002a) explore survey data on individual Canadians preferences regarding the 1988

Canadian-US Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA) and find that human capital endowments

(proxied by education level or occupation) significantly affect whether an individual supported

the CUSFTA. Likewise, Scheve and Slaughter (2001) use U.S. individual responses to a 1992

American National Election Survey (ANES) question about general import restrictions and find

that human capital endowments affect an individuals’ position on trade protection. Finally,

Mayda and Rodrik (2006) find strong support in international survey data that highly-skilled

individuals favor open trade in skill-abundant countries, but do not favor (or even oppose) open

trade in skill-poor less-developed countries.

         In contrast, the effect of the trade characteristics of the individuals’ current employment

industry is ambiguous across these studies. Beaulieu (2002a) and Mayda and Rodrik (2006) find

that employment industry also matters, while Scheve and Slaughter (2001) find that the export



1
 As Beaulieu (2002b) points out, most studies of determinants of trade votes by legislators do not even control for
human capital (or other) endowments of the legislators constituents, but simply assume that industry characteristics
and composition of the representatives “district” are primary determinants.


                                                          3
exposure of an individuals’ employment industry does not matter. Balistreri’s (1997) analysis

does not control for individuals’ employment industry.

       In this paper, I revisit the data on individuals’ preferences for trade protection. Like

Scheve and Slaughter (2001), I use data on individual’s responses to a question posed by the

ANES about whether the US should increase or decrease import restrictions. These data have

much more detailed data on individual characteristics than other surveys used, including direct

information on individuals’ employment industry. These data also have a number of features that

are unexploited by the Scheve and Slaughter (2001) study. First, the identical question was asked

not only in a 1992 survey (the one used by Scheve and Slaughter), but also asked in 1986, 1988,

1996, and 1998. This provides a lengthy time series of data to examine the robustness of the

empirical relationships. Second, the posed question also asks respondents whether they feel they

know enough about the issue to have an opinion on the matter of import restrictions. Almost 30

percent of respondents answer that they do not know enough to express a stance on import

protection and these observations are not included in the Scheve and Slaughter (2001) study. In

this paper, I estimate the factors that make an individual “uninformed” on the trade policy issue,

as well as control for sample selection on this criterion when examining the factors that affect the

opinion of the “informed” respondents.

       My analysis uncovers a number of new results that have important theoretical

implications. First, I show that the Scheve and Slaughter (2001) result that the import exposure of

an individuals’ occupation does not affect trade policy preferences is sensitive to expanding the

sample beyond 1992. Once other years are added to the sample both skills and the trade exposure

of an individuals’ industry matter for trade policy preferences. This result is robust to a wide




                                                 4
variety of specifications and control variables, and suggests that, in practice, models with either

complete mobility or complete immobility of labor are incorrect representations.

       A second finding of this paper’s analysis is that a large group of individuals are

“uninformed” – almost 30% of the sample – and one can easily find factors that explain which

individuals fall into this group. In fact, less-skilled individuals, as well as poor individuals and

females, are more likely to feel “uninformed” on the issue of trade protection. Controlling for this

systematic selection of individuals affects statistical inferences about which factors make an

average “informed” individual more likely to support trade protection. This evidence of

uninformed individuals among the population suggests that political economy trade models

should consider the effect of systematic “costs” of various populations to inform themselves.

Modeling these effects may translate into quite different implications for the economy-wide

support for various trade policies.

       This point directly relates to a third main finding regarding the non-linearity of trade

protection preferences with respect to skills. Recent theoretical work by Blanchard and Willmann

(2008) and Costinot and Vogel (2008) endogenize individuals’ choices of skill acquisition in

general equilibrium models of trade. Their models allow for non-linearities in observed skill and

effects of trade liberalization. In particular, Blanchard and Willmann focus on equilibria where

“middle-skilled” workers’ wages in a skill-abundant country face pressure from trade

liberalization, whereas both low- and high-skilled workers potentially gain from trade

liberalization. This is consistent with recent work by Bradford (2008) that finds import protection

levels across US industries are non-linear in this same manner with respect to the skill

composition of the industry. Low- and high-skill industries have low levels of import protection,

while industries with medium skill compositions have the highest levels of import protection.




                                                  5
Using data on stated trade policy preferences, I find in my data this same non-linear relationship

when examining who supports trade protection across all individuals (both informed and non-

informed), however no such relationship across only informed individuals. This suggests that

actual trade policy decisions may be non-linear in skills, not because trade liberalization would

not hurt low-skill workers, but because a disproportionate number of them are not informed on

the issue.

        Finally, I find large effects of a life-cycle change, retirement, on an individual’s trade

policy preferences. Retirement may affect both an individual’s decision to inform themselves and

their trade policy preference once they are informed. Importantly, retirement means that the

individual is no longer in the workforce which likely means a significant change in their source of

income. For example, individuals who were in trade sensitive industries are now likely have

income sources that are less trade-sensitive. In addition, non-participation in the workforce may

make it more costly for an individual to inform themselves. My empirical estimates show that

retired individuals are much more likely to be uninformed about trade policy, and that neither

their skills nor the trade exposure of their former occupation industry matter anymore for their

trade policy preferences. These results have obvious implications in the coming years as the baby

boomer generation hits retirement age.



2. Hypotheses

2.1. Skills, occupation industry, and trade preferences

        Trade-focused political economy models either assume that labor is freely mobile across

sectors within a country or that agents (laborers or capitalists) have endowments that are specific

to their own industry and cannot be transferred across industries/sectors. An example of the




                                                  6
former model is the standard Heckscher-Ohlin 2×2×2 framework which yields the well-known

Stolper-Samuelson result -- a rise in the price of one of the two goods will increase the real return

of the factor endowment that the good uses relatively intensely, and lower the real return of the

other factor. Thus, for example, in a model with skilled and unskilled labor as the two factors of

production, a rise in the price of the good employing relatively more unskilled labor will benefit

all unskilled laborers (regardless of sector). And by the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem, a country with

a relatively greater proportion of skilled labor in its workforce (i.e., a developed country) would

be exporting the skilled-labor-intensive good and importing the unskilled-labor-intensive good.

Thus, if you ask workers in a developed country, such as the US, whether they prefer new import

limits, a model with freely mobile workers across sectors predicts that unskilled workers will

favor such limits (which would raise the domestic relative price of the unskilled-intensive

product), while skilled workers will oppose new import limits.

       This is in contrast with a model where factors are sector-specific, not mobile across

sectors. In these models, workers and/or capital owners will only lobby for import protection

when their sector faces greater imports from other countries. If they are successful, price

increases from the import limits will provide benefits to only the factors of production being

employed in the sector at the expense of factors in other sectors. In contrast, factor owners (either

labor or capital) in exporting sectors will oppose limits on imports. In these models then, whether

an individual’s occupation industry faces competitive pressure from imports will determine their

stance on import limits.

       In summary, correlation between trade policy preferences and individuals’ skills (or

human capital endowment), with no correlation between the individual’s industry of occupation

(and the import competition it faces), rejects the sector-specific model in favor of a model with




                                                 7
freely mobile labor. Alternatively, evidence that industry of occupation, not skills, correlates with

individuals’ trade policy preferences supports sector-specific models and rejects models of freely-

mobile factors. Evidence for both suggests that mobility of factors across sectors is only partially

true in some manner, and calls for further investigation.2 No evidence for either skills or

occupation industry correlating with trade policy preferences would suggest that trade policy

models need to begin anew in their assumptions.



2.2. Costly information

        Current political economy models used to address trade policy issues almost invariably

assume that individuals have full information about the state of the world. In reality, this means

that an individual knows, depending on the assumed underlying model, their relative skill type

and their countries relative factor endowment differences, or the nature of import competition for

their occupation industry. In practice, however, obtaining this information may involve non-

trivial costs and may lead an individual to choose to be uninformed on the issue. The decision to

become informed then depends on expected costs and benefits of information acquisition.

        For simplification, assume the ex ante expected benefits of acquiring information are

identical across individuals, but costs of information acquisition may vary. I hypothesize that a

number of observed individual characteristics will correlate with higher costs of information

acquisition. First, lower education levels will increase the personal cost of an individual to obtain

and understand the relevant information. Second, controlling for education levels, lower income

will make individuals less likely to inform themselves. In other words, these two hypotheses

simply follow from the idea that both intellectual and financial resources are necessary to inform


2
 The sector-specific model can be seen as a short-run version of the Heckscher-Ohlin framework. Thus, Mayda and
Rodrik (2006) suggest that evidence for both is consistent with a world where some voters have a short-run


                                                       8
one self. These predictions are in line with a recent political economy literature on the role of

information and individuals’ decisions to vote in an election.3

        It is now straightforward to see that costly information acquisition can lead to a much

different mapping of welfare effects of trade policy outcomes to expressed trade policy

preferences, particularly if skills drive individual welfare effects, than a world where everyone is

fully informed. For example, suppose that there is sufficient labor mobility that skills matter for

individuals’ trade policy outcomes and that individuals’ differing skills are distributed

continuously over an interval of finite length. Further, assume that in a skilled abundant country

such as the United States, the net costs of eliminating import restrictions and adopting free trade

(changes in wage income plus changes in consumer prices) are continuously decreasing in skill –

the costs of free trade are highest for the least-skilled. This is depicted in the top panel of Figure

1, which graphs the net cost of free trade by skill level.4 This graph represents the extent to which

an individual of a certain skill level will favor or oppose import restrictions, assuming all agents

are informed about this relationship. The individual with the skill level associated with a zero

personal cost of free trade is indifferent to trade protection.

        Now assume that the costs of information acquisition about free trade costs are decreasing

in skill, while benefits are constant, as discussed above. This is depicted graphically in the lower

panel of Figure 1. Individuals with skill levels below s* will choose to not inform themselves

and, by default, have an expected net cost of free trade equal to zero. This creates a non-linearity

in expected net costs of free trade, which is shown by the wider lines in the upper panel of Figure

1. If the critical s* occurs before the skill level where actual net costs of import protection are



perspective, whereas others have a longer-run perspective.

  Such papers include Larcinese (2007a; 2007b) which examine voter’s use of information and turnout in Britain.
There are other papers that explore information acquisition and voter turnout (see, for example, Fedderson and


                                                        9
zero, we get a pattern whereby the medium-skill individuals (ones who are high-skilled enough to

be informed, but low-skilled enough to have a net cost of free trade) will be opposed to free trade,

whereas the low- and high-skilled individuals will not oppose (or even favor) free trade. If less-

skilled individuals are more likely to be hurt by trade, but less likely to inform themselves on the

issue, they may not be any more likely to vote for trade protection than skilled workers.

Translating this into a representative democracy setting, legislators representing less-skilled

workers may not be more likely to vote for trade protection even if freer trade would hurt less-

skilled workers.

         This is obviously a very particular example to show just one way in which information

acquisition can affect the expected costs of free trade and, ultimately, trade policy outcomes. As

mentioned, prior literature has constructed trade models with perfect information where net costs

of free trade may not be a continuously decreasing function of skill. However, as we will show

below, our data are consistent with the model depicted in Figure 1, where stated preferences for

trade protection are decreasing in skill for fully informed individuals, but the overall sample of

stated preferences by individuals take this specific non-linear shape because so many low-skill

individuals in the sample are uninformed.



2.3. Life-cycle considerations: Retirement

         Standard political economy models assume that agents have a consistent source of labor

(or capital) income. However, retirement represents a real-life event where individuals

significantly reduce or completely stop employment and, hence, their source of income

significantly moves away from employment income to other sources. Statistics calculated by the


Pesendorfer, 1996), but this is the first I am aware of that examines a particular policy question, rather than election
turnout.


                                                           10
Employee Benefit Research Institute using data from the 2004 U.S. Consumer Population Survey

shows retirees’ income sources to consist of the following primary components on average: 1)

40% from social security benefits from the federal government, 2) 19.4% from continued

employment, 3) 16.8% from personal asset holdings, 4) 9.3% from public-sector defined-benefit

(i.e., pension) plans, and 5) 9.2% from private-sector defined-benefit plans.5

           From these statistics, it is clear that the majority of a retirees’ income source is no longer

tied to an employment industry – it is only important for income coming from continued

employment (19.4%) or from a private-sector defined-benefit plan (9.2%), where presumably the

private sector entity is their former employer. Likewise, their skill would only matter for their

income from employment (19.4%) after retirement. These us, we data suggest that there will be

a significant reduction of skills and employment industry as determinants of an individual’s

income after retirement towards income sources (social security, personal-asset holdings, and

public-sector defined-benefit plans) that should roughly correlate with the overall growth of the

economy. Since trade theories generally suggest that trade protection is harmful for overall

welfare and growth of an economy, I hypothesize that retirement should significantly decrease the

effect of an individual’s skill and/or trade exposure of their (former) employment industry on

their trade policy preferences.

           Retirement may also affect whether individuals inform themselves about trade policies.

On one hand, it may be more costly to inform themselves once they are no longer (or significantly

less involved) in the workforce. Relatedly, the expected benefit of informing themselves about

returns to their own skill set or employment industry from certain trade policies will have gone

down considerably. This leads to the hypothesis that retirement will lead individuals to be less

likely to acquire information about trade policy impacts, everything else equal. Potentially

mitigating or reversing these effects, is the notion that the opportunity cost of time has declined

for retirees, making them more likely to acquire information on public policy questions.



3. Data and Empirical Specification

         To test these various hypotheses, I create a dataset from the ANES surveys that follows

Scheve and Slaughter (2001) as closely as possible, while expanding beyond year 1992 (which is

the only year they examine) to include survey years 1986, 1988, 1996, and 1998. In all these

years the ANES asked the same following question:

         ‘‘Some people have suggested placing new limits on foreign imports in order to protect
         American jobs. Others say that such limits would raise consumer prices and hurt
         American exports. Do you favor or oppose placing new limits on imports, or haven’t you
         thought much about this?’’6


Scheve and Slaughter (2001) construct a dependent variable for their analysis which assigns a “1”

when the individual responded that they favor new limits on imports, and a “0” when they oppose

new limits. In my analysis below, I begin with this same dependent variable construction. Given

that the dependent variable is binary, Scheve and Slaughter (2001) use a logistic regression as

their empirical specification. I use a probit specification which yields qualitatively identical




6
  In 1990, the ANES survey asked a similar, but not identical, question that asked respondents to rank their
preferences for new import limits over a range from 1 to 7, where “1” indicated “increase limits a lot”, while “7”
indicated “decrease limits a lot.” Since it is not obvious how to correspond these responses into a binary variable in
analogous fashion to my other survey years, I do not include this survey year. In 1986, the ANES survey first asked
respondents if they had thought about import issues, then if they responded that they had, they were asked the same
question about whether they favored or opposed new limits. I include respondents from this year in my sample as it
easy to construct a dependent variable in analogous fashion to my other survey years. Finally, I exclude the year
2000, the final year the question was asked, because the individual’s county of residence is not reported in this
year’s survey. County residence is necessary for construction of a couple key independent variables discussed
below.


                                                          12
empirical estimates, but more easily allows a specification extension to address the issue I raise

next.

        Constructing a dependent variable in the manner just described leaves out a potentially

important group of respondents – those who do not feel they know enough about the issue to

express a “favor” or “oppose” opinion. I label these individuals as “uninformed” on the issue of

import limits and, in fact, they comprise a significant portion of the overall sample – 27.2%.

Modeling whether an individual is informed or not is important for two reasons. First,

understanding the attributes that correlate with an individual’s choice to be uninformed is

important and has direct implications for models of political economy that invariably assume

informed agents. Second, if there is correlation between the types of individuals who choose to

be uninformed and those that favor or oppose new import limits, then statistical inferences on

only the informed groups (as in Scheve and Slaughter, 2001) will suffer from sample selection

bias. To directly address these issues, I run a probit specification with a Heckman-style sample

selection that first estimates the determinants of whether an individual has thought about new

import restrictions and, second, whether they favor such import restrictions conditional on

whether they have thought about the topic..

        I use identical control regressors as those employed by Scheve and Slaughter (2001),

constructing them in analogous fashion to the greatest extent possible. Scheve and Slaughter

(2001) use two alternative measures of an individual’s skill and two alternative measures for the

trade exposure of the industry in which the individual works.

        Their measures of skill are years of education and wage levels. Years of education are

directly asked of the individual in the ANES surveys across all years. Wage levels are not asked




                                                 13
of ANES respondents, but instead they are asked to identify their occupation.7 Following Scheve

and Slaughter (2001) I take U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on average weekly wages

by occupation to assign wage levels to individuals in the surveys based on their stated occupation.

Because I have multiple years of surveys in my sample, I construct my wage data as a “Relative

Wage” variable that is an occupation’s average wage relative to the average wage across all

occupations in a given survey year. Scheve and Slaughter (2001) simply used wage levels which

is appropriate (and equivalent to my construction) because they only examine a single survey

year.

        Like Scheve and Slaughter (2001), the two measures of industry trade exposure I construct

are the tariff level and net export share of output (or sales) for a survey respondent’s industry of

employment. The ANES asks respondent’s to identify the industry they work in, which are

classified into 3-digit Census of Industry Codes (CIC). For tariff levels, I use the applied tariffs

(duties collected divided by customs value of imports) found in U.S. trade data, available through

the Schott and Feenstra datasets at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) website. I

construct the weighted average tariff by 4-digit Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes

from the NBER data and then concord to 3-digit CIC codes. Non-traded sectors, as well as all

service sectors, are assigned an import tariff of zero. Net export shares for manufacturing are

straightforward to construct using the NBER data for the trade flows (exports and imports by

sector), and U.S. Census data for value of shipments. These data are constructed by SIC codes

and then concorded to the CIC codes. Constructing net export shares for non-manufacturing

sectors relied on a variety of sources, primarily U.S. Census data for shipments, NBER trade data

for tradeable agriculture and mining sectors, and BEA data for tradeable service sectors. A data


7
 Retired and unemployed persons in the sample are asked to identify the occupation of their last job. I get
qualitatively identical results throughout my analysis whether I sample all individuals or sample only working


                                                         14
appendix describes the construction of this variable (and all my variables) in more detail. Non-

tradeable sectors were assigned a net export share of zero. I expect a positive correlation between

average tariffs in an individual’s employment industry and their preference for import protection,

and a negative correlation between their employment industry’s net export share and their

preference for import protection.

         Scheve and Slaughter (2001) have a secondary focus of their paper which examines the

hypothesis that home owners in trade-sensitive locations will be more likely to prefer trade

protection. This is because houses are often an important asset for individuals and home values

depend on economic activity in the immediate location. Following Scheve and Slaughter (2001) I

then use Census data to calculate the share of the individual’s county’s employment in two-digit

SIC sectors with above-median tariffs (called County 1 Exposure) or with net-import balances

(County 2 Exposure).8 I then interact these two county exposure share variables with a binary

variable indicating whether the individual owns a house, which is asked directly by the ANES

survey in all my sample years. This creates two alternative interaction variables - County 1

Exposure × House and County 2 Exposure × House. By the hypotheses developed in Scheve and

Slaughter, I expect a positive correlation between these variables and the likelihood that an

individual prefers new import limits.

         Finally, after initial estimates, I will also include other individual characteristics in my

individuals.

  The county location of an individual is identified by the ANES survey. I use the same 2-digit SIC industries as
used by Scheve and Slaughter (2001) for these variables which are based 1992 data.

4. Empirical Results

       In this section, I present my statistical results. I begin with estimates that stem from

identical specifications as those in Scheve and Slaughter (2001) using only 1992 data, as in that

paper, and obtain qualitatively identical results to their paper. I then examine the robustness of

these results by first expanding the sample to all available years. I next model the uniformed

individuals, providing evidence of the characteristics that correlate with whether or not an

individual is uninformed or not, as well as exploring the robustness of other results when

accounting for uninformed individuals. I then explore the relationship between skills and trade

policy preferences, allowing for a non-linear relationship. Finally, I examine the impact of

retirement on information acquisition and trade policy preferences.



4.1. Base Results

       In columns 1 through 4 of Table 2 I provide probit estimates of the determinants of an

individual’s preference for higher import restrictions using identical specifications to that in

Scheve and Slaughter (2001), where I alternate using education and relative wages as measures of

an individual’s skills and using tariff rates or net imports as a share of sales as measures of the

trade exposure of an individual’s employment industry. For ease of understanding the economic

significance of my regressors on the dependent variable, I show marginal effects and their

associated standard errors in these tables, where the reported marginal effects provide the change

in the dependent variable (probability of favoring new import restrictions in decimal form) for a

one-unit change in the regressor.




                                                  16
         My results are qualitatively identical to those in Scheve and Slaughter (2001) –

specifically, models 9, 10, 13, and 14 in Table 6 of their paper.9 Both measures of skill are

statistically significant and indicate important effects on trade policy preferences. As found by

Scheve and Slaughter (2001), trade exposure of an individual’s employment industry is not

significant in explaining trade policy preferences. Thus, the evidence is consistent with a model

with intersectoral factor mobility assumed in Heckscher-Ohlin models where skills determine

welfare impacts of trade policy, while inconsistent with a sector-specific (or Ricardo-Viner)

model where factors are not mobile between sectors and trade exposure would affect individual

welfare and, hence their trade policy preferences. As in Scheve and Slaughter (2001), I also find

that individuals who own homes in trade sensitive areas are much more likely to favor new import

restrictions.



4.2. Expanding the sample

         I next run the same specification, but this time with the full sample of years available, and

report these estimates in columns 5 through 8 of Table 2. I also add dummy variables for each

year to control for any common year-specific effects on all individuals’ trade policy preferences.

The surprising result is that while the skill variables come in with similar magnitude and

statistical significance, the industry trade exposure variables are now correct sign and generally

statistically significant – the exception is the Sector Tariff variable in the column 7 specification

which has a p-value of 0.168. These findings that both skill and industry matter contrast with

Scheve and Slaughter (2001), but are consistent with Beaulieu’s (2002a) results using Canadian

survey data, and suggest that labor is neither perfectly mobile nor perfectly immobile.


9
 I get qualitatively identical results to Scheve and Slaughter for all specifications reported in their paper, but just
show these for the sake of brevity. Full “replication” results are available upon request.


                                                            17
         The magnitude of the both the skill variables and industry trade exposure variables are

economically significant as well. A one-standard deviation increase in the Relative Occupation

Wage of an individual decreases their likelihood to favor new import limits by 5.8 percentage

points (from a mean of about 55%), while a one-standard deviation increase in Education Years

decreases an individual’s likelihood of favoring trade protection by 10.8 percentage points, ceteris

paribus. Using column 5’s estimates, a one-standard deviation in the Sector Tariff increases an

individual’s likelihood of favoring trade protection by 2.4 percentage points. Using column 6’s

estimates, a one-standard deviation in the Sector Net Export Share decreases an individual’s

preference for trade protection by 4.7 percentage points.10

         For the rest of the paper’s analysis, I now only use Education Years as my measure of skill

and the Sector Net Export Share as the industry trade exposure measure. Relative Occupation

Wage and Sector Tariff yield qualitatively identical sign patterns throughout, though sometimes

slightly weaker statistical significance.



4.3. Controlling for information acquisition

         To this point, my specification has not controlled for whether an individual has thought

about the issue. In Table 3, I present estimates from a probit regression where the dependent

variable is “1” if the individual has thought about trade protection and “0” if they have not. As

discussed in section 2, I assume that whether an individual has thought about trade protection

depends largely on the costs of information acquisition, which are decreasing in education and


10
  I obtain results that are nearly quantitatively identical for the skill and industry trade when using the County 2
Exposure and County 2 Exposure × House variable. This is the case throughout the results reported in this paper
and I, therefore, only show specifications with “County 1” variables throughout. Interestingly, coefficient estimates
on these “County 2” variables are significantly different than the coefficient estimates on the “County 1” variables
when all sample years are included, which contrasts with Scheve and Slaughter (2001) results using only data from
1992. I find that using “County 2” variables suggests that all individuals in a county with significant trade exposure
are more likely to support trade protection, not just those that own homes. Results available upon request.


                                                          18
income. To control for income, I use ANES reported household income to construct and include

dummy variables for whether an individual’s household income is in the lower quartile, second

quartile, or third quartile for that sample year.11 As robustness checks, I also include other

variables from the trade policy preference equation, including the Sector Net Export Share and

“County 1 Exposure” variables. These could possibly come in significantly if expected benefits

of information acquisition depend on how individuals are affected by trade policy. Finally, I also

include a number of demographic variables that are readily available from the ANES survey,

including age, gender, ethnicity, political affiliation and labor union participation.12

         Table 3 provides results from the probit estimation using the dependent variable indicating

whether an individual has thought about trade protection. The variables used to proxy for

information costs come in with expected signs and are statistically significant. The estimated

marginal effects suggest that each additional year of education adds 2.8 percentage points to the

likelihood that an individual will have thought about trade protection (from a mean around 70%).

Individuals in the lowest household income quartile are 7.7 percentage points less likely to have

thought about trade protection than the highest household-income quartile, while those in the

second quartile are 5.5 percentage points less likely. There is no statistical difference between

those in the third and fourth household-income quartiles. Thus, as hypothesized, low-education

and low-income individuals are less likely to acquire information about trade protection.

         The expected benefit variables – the ones that proxy for how trade may affect the welfare

of an individual – do not come in statistically significant. This is consistent with my assumption

that expected benefits of information may be ex ante identical across individuals.


11
   I exclude a dummy variable for household income in the top quartile to avoid perfect multicollinearity with an
included constant term in the regression.
12
   These are the same demographic variables that Scheve and Slaughter (2001) use for robustness checks in their
work.


                                                         19
       Finally, the demographic variables provide quite interesting statistical results. First, an

individual is more likely to have thought about trade protection as they age – ten years of age

makes an individual about 2 percentage points more likely to have informed themselves enough

to provide an opinion on new import limits. Ethnicity is estimated to have some impact as well,

with African Americans and Hispanics less likely to have thought about trade protection, ceteris

paribus. Both political affiliation and union membership do not have any statistical impact.

Finally, gender has an unexpectedly large effect, with women almost 15 percentage points lower

in their likelihood of thinking about trade protection than men, ceteris paribus (i.e., after

controlling for age, income, race, and education). Such a large gap brings up the possibility of an

alternative interpretation for my results. Perhaps these estimates are not only uncovering who

becomes informed about trade policies, but also who is confident enough to feel sufficiently

informed to offer an opinion on trade policies.

       To examine this further, I collect data on a couple variables from the ANES survey that

may be good proxies of whether individuals inform themselves: 1) whether an individual has

discussed politics with friends or family in the past week, and 2) whether the individual has read a

newspaper in the past week. I then run a probit specification using these two variables separately

as dependent variables on the same regressor matrix used in the specification used to explain

whether an individual has thought about import restrictions. The marginal effects from these

separate probit regressions are reported in with the Columns 2 and 3 of Table 3. I find that all

three dependent variables have many correlates in common. Age, education and income are

positively correlated with all three, while being female means a significantly lower probability for

all three. These results then provide some confirmatory evidence that information acquisition




                                                  20
(not simply some other factor such as an individual’s confidence) is a true underlying reason why

some individuals suggest they are not informed enough to offer an opinion on import restrictions.

           In summary, variables proxying for information acquisition costs, as well as some

interesting demographic variables, are quite significant in explaining variation in individuals’

likelihoods of being informed about trade policies. I next want to explore how this selection of

individuals affects both my estimates of trade policy preferences, as well as some evidence on

trade outcomes.

           Table 4 provides re-estimates of the determinants of individuals’ trade policy preferences

after controlling for sample selection bias due to conditioning on only those who have thought

about trade policy. In technical terms, I re-estimate the same specification as columns 5 through

8 using a two-step Heckman sample selection correction, where the sample selection equation is

the one used in Table 3. While statistical tests confirm that there is a sample selection bias13, I

find that the bias is fairly small in economic magnitude, as I get qualitatively identical results on

the determinants of trade policy preferences with or without a sample selection correction.



4.4. Is there a non-linear relationship between skills and trade policies?

           As mentioned in the introduction, Bradford (2008) recently shows that trade policy

outcomes in the U.S. are non-linear in skills, with the lowest- and highest-skilled industries

having significantly lower tariff rates than medium-skilled industries. Are individuals’ trade

policy preferences, like these trade policy outcomes, also non-linear in skills in this same way? In

answering this question with my data, I show that information acquisition is a key factor in

explaining this non-linear pattern and is consistent with the model results depicted in Figure 1.



13
     A likelihood ratio test rejects independence of the two equations at the 1% significance level in all specifications.


                                                             21
         To explore this issue, I first categorize individuals into standard education classifications

that represent progressively higher degrees of education: 1) less than high school, 2) high school

degree, 3) some college, 4) college bachelor’s degree, and 5) graduate or professional degree

beyond college degree.14 I then replace Education Years in my specification with dummy

variables for whether an individual falls into one of these categories (excluding the last category

to avoid perfect multicollinearity with the constant term) and run this on alternative data samples

and dependent variables in Table 5.

         Column 1 of Table 5 provides estimates when I estimate this new specification on only

those individuals in my sample who felt sufficiently informed to provide an opinion on whether

they favor new import limits. Column 2 provides estimates when I also include a sample-

selection correction when estimating preferences for this informed group. In both sets of

estimates, I see that support for new import limits are simply decreasing in education. There is

not a non-linear relationship in trade policy preferences amongst the informed individuals in my

sample, as found by Bradford (2008) with respect to trade policy outcome patterns.

         However, in column 3 of Table 5, I sample all individuals (informed and uninformed) and

create a dependent variable that simply takes the value of “1” if an individual favors new import

limits, and a “0” if they do not, which includes individuals who explicitly say they oppose new

limits, as well as those that simply say they have not thought about trade protection enough to

offer an opinion. Estimates using this sample show the same pattern across skills/education as

Bradford (2008) found for trade policy outcomes. The least skilled group (those with less than

high school education) do not express their preference for new import limits any more than those

with a college (or higher) degree, while the medium-skilled groups (high school education or


14
  I get qualitatively identical results by simply adding a term that squares an individual’s Education Years, but find
this construction of education categories is easier for immediate interpretation and presentation.


                                                          22
some college) express preference for new import limits in rates that are about 7-8 percentage

points higher than the other skill groups. These results suggest that while low-skill workers are

more likely to want new import limits when they are informed about trade policy outcomes, since

a disproportionately large share of them are not informed, they do explicitly favor trade protection

any more than high-skill workers. To the extent that political representatives only respond to

voiced opinions by their constituents, the low information acquisition by low-skill workers can

explain the non-linear trade policy outcomes across skill levels documented by Bradford (2008).

Importantly, this evidence is not supportive of the recent theory papers by Blanchard and Willman

(2008) and Costinot and Vogel (2008) to the extent that they predict a non-linear relationship

between welfare impacts of trade policies and skills. Informed low-skill individuals in my

sample, who presumably have a reasonable sense of trade protection impacts on their own

welfare, are among the most protectionist individuals in my sample.



4.5. Life-cycle effects: Retirement

       A final aspect of my data that I explore is the effect of retirement. Standard political

economy models do not consider life-cycle changes and retirement is a significant life-cycle

change which may affect both whether an individual acquires information on issues such as trade

protection, and whether they favor or impose trade protection with the significant change in the

source of their annual income. The ANES survey asks individuals of their retirement status

allowing us to easily explore this issue.15

       I first include a dummy variable indicating whether an individual is retired in the

specification that examines the determinants of whether an individual has thought about trade




                                                23
protection (reported in Table 3). The coefficient on retirement status comes in negative and

highly statistically significant. In fact, retired individuals are about 8 percentage points less likely

to have thought about import limits, ceteris paribus. Thus, just as with low-skill workers, this

suggests that legislators with a higher proportion of retired individuals in their districts are less

likely to have constituents voice their opinion for trade protection.

         I next turn to an examination of whether retired individuals who acquire information on

trade policies are more or less likely to favor new import limits. As discussed in section 2,

retirees experience a significant de-linking of their income source from their (former) occupation

industry and workforce skills. Thus, I hypothesize an individual’s skill and trade exposure of

their (former) industry have a much weaker effect an individual’s trade policy preferences once

they are retired.

         Importantly, the ANES survey gathers data on retirees’ last occupation industry in which

they were employed. This allows me to interact the skill and industry trade exposure variables

with retirement status to examine the hypothesis that retirement will decrease support for trade

protection from those previously exposed to harm from freer trade. Table 6 presents results when

I add the Retired dummy variable, as well as its interactions with the skill and trade exposure

variables, to the same specifications examining the determinants of support for new import limits

after controlling for sample selection (as reported in Table 4). The results provide support that

retirement leads those that formerly supported new import limits to decrease that support. In

every instance the sign of the coefficient of an interaction term is opposite of the associated skill

or industry trade exposure variable, indicating that retirement mitigates these variables’ effect on

an individual’s trade policy preference. Table 7 shows this more clearly by providing marginal


15
 The survey actually gathers information on whether individuals are fully retired or partially retired and still
working part-time. I aggregate these two types into one “retired” category and my estimates are qualitatively


                                                          24
effects of the skill and industry occupation variables separately for retired individuals and those

not retired. In virtually every case the effect of a skill or industry trade measure is statistically

insignificant for a retired individual,16 while its independent effect (on all non-retired individuals

in the sample) are generally statistically significant and of the same magnitude as those reported

in Table 4.

         In summary, the life-cycle change of retirement has a significant impact on expressed

trade policy preferences. First, retirees are much less likely to be informed on the issue of trade

policy. Second, skill and industry trade exposure variables are generally no longer significant in

explaining their trade policy preferences. This life-cycle change effect on trade policy

preferences is, of course, important for the United States and many other countries as their

population ages.



5. Conclusion

         This paper provides new empirical evidence for important features of trade policy

preference formation that current models of political economy rarely, if ever, address. First,

information acquisition by individuals on policy matters is potentially costly and the data suggest

that many do not feel sufficiently informed to state an opinion on trade policy. These

“uninformed” individuals are systematically those with less education and income, and I show

that this can explain why trade policy outcomes may be non-linear in skills (with low-skill and

high-skill have lower preferences for trade protection than medium-skill workers), even though

freer trade may be progressively more harmful to one’s income the lower skill one has. Second, I



identical to when one classifies retired individuals as only those fully retired.
16
   The effect of a skill or industry trade exposure for a retired individual is the coefficient on the skill or industry
trade exposure variable plus the coefficient on the interaction term of that variable with the variable Retired. A

show that the life-cycle change surrounding retirement has significant impacts on individuals’

stated trade policy preferences, lowering the likelihood that an individual will acquire information

on trade policies, and fully mitigating any effects of skill or industry trade exposure effects on an

individuals’ preferences for trade protection. Thus, the evidence in this paper suggests that future

political economy modeling of trade policy outcomes will need to incorporate these features to

obtain realistic predictions of trade policy formation. Another contribution of the paper is to

show that both an individual’s skills and the trade exposure of their occupation industry matter,

which contrasts with the Scheve and Slaughter (2001) study using these same ANES data, and

which suggests that workers are neither freely mobile nor freely immobile in their ability to

switch occupation industries.

         A final result is the puzzlingly large impact of gender on trade policy preferences. This

paper confirms that women are much more likely to favor trade protection, as also found in

Beaulieu and Napier (2008). But it also documents that women are much more likely to be

uninformed about policy matters. Unlike the other results in this paper, there are no clear

theoretical reasons for why such large gender differences exist on the topic of trade policy.




simple Chi-squared test of the sum of these two coefficients determines if it is statistically significant at
conventional levels.

Data Appendix

Many of the variables used in this study come directly from questions in the ANES survey,
including our dependent variables, as well as the following regressors: Education Years, House,
Age, Female, African American, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, Democrat, Republican,
Union Membership, and Retired. The income variables I use come from household income
questions which had respondents report where the income fell across a number of given ranges. I
use the information on how many in the survey fell into each range, to construct variables
indicating whether an individual’s household income as in the first, second, or third quartile of
income range responses for the given survey year.

A number of the variables used required combining ANES survey responses with other data.
Relative Occupation Wage is constructed by combining individuals’ responses on their
occupation, which are coded according to 1980 Census Occupation Codes and matching that to
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) on average weekly wages by occupation from their
Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. This is identical to the procedure used by Scheve
and Slaughter (2001). However, because we have multiple years in the sample, I normalize these
by dividing each of the occupation wages by the average wage across occupations for a given
year.

To construct the Sector Tariff variable I first obtain data on applied tariff rates at the 4-digit
Standard Industrial Classification (duties divided by customs value of imports) reported in U.S.
trade data. These data, compiled by Robert Feenstra and co-authors from official U.S. Customs
data, can be found at the data page of the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER):
www.nber.org/data. I then create a concordance between 4-digit SIC and the 3-digit Census
Industry Code reported in the ANES survey to match tariff data to the survey respondents’
reported industry/sector. (Concordance available upon request) The data construction for this
variable differs from Scheve and Slaughter (2001) in using applied tariff rates, rather then tariff
rate schedules, due to the relative inaccessibility of tariff rate schedules over my sample years.
Like Scheve and Slaughter (2001), I record a “0” tariff for all non-traded goods, as well as traded
service sectors.

Construction of the Net Export Share variable follows Scheve and Slaughter (2001) closely, but
was more involved than any of the other variables and relied on a variety of data sources due to
having to span many years of data. Import and export data by 4-digit SIC sector are available for
traded industries in agriculture, mining, and manufacturing from the NBER data mentioned
above. Data on imports and exports for traded service sectors come from an October 2001 Survey
of Current Business article titled “Cross-border trade in services, 1986-2000.” All other sectors
are considered non-tradeable and are assigned a “0” for their net export share. For the traded
sectors, we also needed a measure of sector size to normalize the net export data in order to create
our measure of Net Export Share. For manufacturing industries, we use the value of shipments of
a sector reported annually in the U.S. Census’ Annual Survey of Manufactures. For non-
manufacturing sectors, the Census has, at best, 5-year censuses which we used to interpolate and
extrapolate shipment values for years corresponding to our sample. These include the Census of
Mining, Census of Construction, and censuses of a variety of service sectors which one can access
at the following U.S. Census webpage: http://www.census.gov/svsd/www/economic.html. Ship-



                                                38
ment value data for our agricultural sectors were proxied by “cash receipts” and were taken from
http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/FarmIncome/FinfidmuXls.htm.

Finally, our measures of county exposure to trade, primarily County Exposure 1 in this paper,
follows Scheve and Slaughter’s (2001) methodology. I use the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
data provided in their Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which provides employment
by U.S. county by SIC sectors covering agriculture, manufacturing and mining. I then calculate
the employment share of the ten 2-digit SIC sectors with the highest tariffs in total county
employment – these ten sectors by Scheve and Slaughter’s calculations are SIC 21, 22, 23, 28, 30,
31, 32, 34, 38, and 39. County Exposure 2 is calculated in the same manner, except using the
fourteen 2-digit SIC sectors that Scheve and Slaughter find have the highest net imports – SIC 22,
23, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, and 39.
