The Effects of Non-Contributory Pensions on Material and Subjective Well Being

                                         ABSTRACT

Public expenditures on non-contributory pensions are equivalent to at least 1 percent of GDP in
several countries in Latin America and is expected to increase. We explore the effect of non-
contributory pensions on the well-being of the beneficiary population by studying the Pension 65
program in Peru, which uses a poverty eligibility threshold. We find that the program reduced the
average score of beneficiaries on the Geriatric Depression Scale by nine percent and reduced the
proportion of older adults doing paid work by four percentage points. Moreover, households with
a beneficiary increased their level of consumption by 40 percent. All these effects are consistent
with the findings of Galiani, Gertler and Bando (2016) in their study on a non-contributory
pension scheme in Mexico. Thus, we conclude that the effects of non-contributory pensions on
well-being in rural Mexico can be largely generalized to Peru.

   I.      Introduction

While pensions are believed to be critical for protecting material well-being after
retirement, only 20 percent of seniors worldwide receive pension benefits (Pallares-
Miralles, Romero and Whitehouse, 2012). For those who have coverage, the benefits are
often inadequate (ILO, 2014; Gasparini et al., 2007). Additionally, poverty rates among
the elderly are substantially higher in countries where social security coverage is limited;
the number of people who are 60 years of age or older is estimated to double by 2050
(United Nations, 2013); and the life expectancy of the elderly is also estimated to
substantially increase by 2050 (Bosch, Melguizo and Pagés 2013). For these reasons,
improving the effectiveness of pensions and expanding pension programs compel
immediate attention.

A number of governments have responded to high poverty rates among the elderly with
non-contributory pensions. In OECD countries, 59 percent of the income of individuals
over age 65 comes from public pension transfers (OECD, 2015). In Latin America, at
least 15 countries have implemented non-contributory pension programs covering about
20 percent of the region’s population (Bosch, Melguizo and Pagés, 2013; Pallares-
Miralles, Romero and Whitehouse, 2012). In Latin America, these programs constitute a
large part of social safety nets. For example, in Mexico, the Adultos Mayores program is
the second largest social program behind the conditional cash transfer program Progresa
(formerly Oportunidades), and in Peru, Pension 65, a non-contributory pension program
for the elderly, is second only to the conditional cash transfer program Juntos (Rubio and
Garfias, 2010; Aguila et al., 2013, MIDIS, 2012).

In this paper, we explore the effects of Pension 65 in Peru. The program’s main goal is to
provide economic security to persons who are 65 years of age or older and living in
poverty (Presidencia del Consejo de Ministros, 2011). At the time this study was
conducted, the program provided beneficiaries with US$ 78 every two months. This
study makes use of a strong identification strategy by exploiting an exogenous poverty
cutoff to determine eligibility. As a result, we are able to analyze household survey data
using a sharp regression discontinuity approach. We estimated effects for a sample of
                                             2
households that is within 0.3 standard deviations of the threshold. As a result, program
participation was statistically ignorable in the neighborhood that we studied.

We find that households with a beneficiary increased their level of consumption by 40
percent and that the program reduced the proportion of older adults doing paid work by 4
percentage points. These effects contributed to their subjective welfare as indicated by a
9-percentage-point reduction in the Geriatric Depression Scale. However, we do not find
impacts on the use of health services, physical health outcomes, enrollment of minors in
school or household composition. However, we find that transfers to persons residing
outside the household increased as the proportion of households that reported
expenditures on transfers rose from 46 percent to 61 percent.

Several studies have focused on the effects of non-contributory pension schemes on the
health and material welfare of beneficiaries. Some examine the effects of such schemes
on consumption (Fan, 2010; Blau, 2008; Case and Deaton, 1998), physical health (Kadir
and Barret, 2014), and labor supply (de Carvalho, 2008; Bosch, Melguizo and Pagés,
2013; Grueber and Wise, 1998). Other studies have analyzed the effects of pensions on
other family members. For example, Case and Deaton (1998), Duflo (2003), Hamoudi
and Thomas (2014) and Fan (2010) explore program effects on children’s school
enrollment, household composition and private transfers. Our work is also related to the
work of Finkelstein et al. (2012) and Baicker et al. (2013) who find access to Medicaid
health insurance lowered self-reported depression in low-income adults. Indeed, the
literature shows unemployment results in more depression because of the lack of work,
but also in less depression as people can spend more time in pleasant activities (Knabe et
al., 2010; Krueger and Muller, 2012; and Ruhm, 2001).

In contrast, in previous work, we took a comprehensive approach in examining the
influence of Mexico’s non-contributory pension schemes of Adultos Mayores on both
material and subjective well-being (Galiani, Gertler and Bando, 2016). Indeed, pensions
may allow older adults to reduce their time working and increase their time enjoying life.
We found that beneficiaries used part of the transfer to finance an increase in household
consumption and used the rest to offset reduction in labor earnings from beneficiaries
                                             3
reducing paid work. These changes resulted in an improvement in mental health as
measured by the Geriatric Depression Scale.1

When we compare the results in this paper with the effects of the Adultos Mayores
program in Mexico, we find that we can broadly generalize the estimates for Mexico to
Peru. We find that the effects of the programs are not that different across the two
countries. The depression score in Peru decreased by 8.68 percent, while it decreased in
Mexico by 9.11 percent. Paid work decreased by 4 percentage points in both countries. In
addition, consumption rose by 40 percent in Peru and by 14 percent in Mexico. For food
consumption, households in Peru allocated 67 percent of the increase, while in Mexico,
they allocated 54 percent.

This study is important in that it constructs external validity of the effects of non-
contributory pensions, since in principle, the effects of any program are contingent on the
context of the study (Angrist, J., 2004; Campbell, 1969; Fisher, 1935). Understanding
program effects in multiple economic and cultural contexts is necessary in order to
construct external validity and inform policy. A number of studies use similar multi-
country strategies to generalize cause-and-effect constructs. For example, Cruces and
Galiani (2007) examine the effects of fertility on labor outcomes in three counties,
Banerjee et al. (2015) study microcredit in six countries, Gertler et al. (2015) study health
promotion in four countries, Dupas et al. (2016) examine the effects of opening savings
accounts in 3 countries, and Galiani et al. (2016) investigate slum upgrading in three
countries.

This paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the Pension 65 program. Section
III describes the data, and section IV describes the identification strategy. Section V
presents the empirical results. Section VI compares our findings with the results obtained
in Mexico. Section VII concludes.

 Mental health is a widely accepted indicator of quality of life among the elderly (Campbell et al., 1976;
Walker, 2005).

    II.      The Pension 65 Non-Contributory Pension Program

The program provides beneficiaries with a pension of US$ 39 per month, which is paid
out in bi-monthly transfers (Presidencia del Consejo de Ministros, 2011). In addition,
beneficiaries receive care in public health facilities at no cost and are eligible for the
Integral Health Insurance Program (Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS)) (MIDIS, 2016). The
program significantly increased the number of pension beneficiaries in 2013 as coverage
expanded from 40,700 to 247,700 beneficiaries between January and November of that
year.

To be eligible, a person has to be at least 65 years old, possess a government-issued
identification document that attests to his or her age and be certified as living in a
household that is below the poverty line. Persons who receive benefits from other pension
programs are not eligible.

The government defines poverty based on its Household Targeting System (Sistema de
Focalización de Hogares (SISFOH)) index. A person’s SISFOH index score is a
weighted average of a number of household characteristics.2 A household is classified as
poor if its score falls below a set threshold value. Government-defined poverty thresholds
are set for geographic areas known as “conglomerates” (conglomerados). The SISFOH
index is used universally for targeting all government programs, including the Pension 65
program, and the data used to construct the SISFOH index were collected long before the
Pension 65 program established the eligibility threshold. The Ministry of Economic
Affairs and Finance (MEF, 2010) provides details on the estimation of the SISFOH
scores and poverty thresholds.

 These characteristics include the type of fuel used for cooking; electricity; water and sewerage
access; the materials that the floor, walls and roof are made of; health insurance and assets. Assets
include refrigerators, washing machines, laptops, and cable and Internet connections. They also
include the level of education of the head of household and the extent of overcrowding.

    III.     Data Sources

The data used in this study come from two surveys carried out by the National Institute of
Statistics and Informatics (Instituto Nacional de Estadística e Informática or INEI). The
sampling frame was restricted to the 12 out of 24 departments in Peru in which 70
percent of program beneficiaries resided as based on administrative records.3 Households
were then randomly sampled based on the following eligibility criteria: having at least
one adult between the ages of 65 and 80, whose available SISFOH information could
determine household poverty status and whose SISFOH score(s) were 0.3 standard
deviations above and below the SISFOH eligibility threshold.4

There were two rounds of data collection. The first round was conducted in November
and December of 2012, and the second round, in the period from July to October of 2015.
In the first round, data were collected on 4,031 individuals in 3,031 households. INEI
excluded 58 households that had errors in their eligibility score in the SISFOH system
from the second round. Of the 2,973 remaining households, 234 were not found and
therefore lost to attrition. We further excluded another 155 households from the analysis
whose SISFOH scores at baseline were more than .3 standard deviations from the
eligibility cutoff. Excluding these observations allows us to reduce the average distance
of the SISFOH score from the eligibility threshold by 52 percent.5 All in all, excluding all
of these households did not likely affect our results as treatment status is uncorrelated
with exclusion status (p-value = 0.559), and the baseline characteristics of the excluded
households are not statistically different from those included in the sample (Table A1 in
online Appendix A). In summary, the analysis sample used in this study consists of 3,342
individuals living in 2,584 households.

(Cajatambo, Canta, Huarochiri, Oyón and Yauyos), Loreto, Pasco, Piura and Puno.

  For a detailed description of the selection of the sample, see the Ministry of Development and Social
Inclusion (MIDIS y MEF, 2013). The INEI monitored actual transfers from January 2012 to June 2015, and
the data can therefore be used to check for actual transfer reception.

  The score distance from the eligibility threshold in the final sample is between -0.32 and 0.31. If we
were to include the 155 observations that were located in the tail of the distribution, the score would
take on values of between -0.46 and 0.86.
                                                   6
The survey questions were designed to collect detailed information on the older adults
and their households, as well as basic information on all other household members. More
specifically, the survey collected labor information for persons 14 years of age or older.
This information included labor market participation, hours worked and monetary
compensation. Anthropometric measurements for the older adults in the sample
(hypertension, waist circumference and body mass index (BMI)) were also taken. In
addition, the survey included a series of questions designed to assess the cognitive health
of these older adults. We then used these data to build a health status index based on a
weighted average of standardized indicators. Standardization is relative to the distribution
in the control group for the corresponding year.

The survey also collected data on perceptions about life related to the well-being of older
adults, including life satisfaction, empowerment, contribution to household expenditures
and self worth. We summarize the information on these indicators in an index. The
method used for the construction of this index was analogous to the one used to construct
the health index summary indicator.

Finally, the survey collected information on food and non-food expenditure. Online
Appendix B includes definitions for all the variables used in this study. All variables have
non-missing values for at least 96 percent of the observations, with three exceptions. The
share of missing values for labor income is 13 percent. For household expenditures, the
share of missing values is 7 percent, and for the welfare index, the share of missing
values is 8 percent. However, the missing data are not related to treatment in any of these
cases (p-value = 0.587 for labor earnings, p-value = 0.230 for the contribution index and
p-value = 0.784 for expenditures).

   IV.     Identification Strategy

To identify the impact of the program on the outcomes of interest, we rely on a regression
discontinuity design (RD) approach with SISFOH score as the running variable. Since the
thresholds vary across the 15 conglomerates in the sample, we estimate the RD model



                                             7
also conditioning on conglomerate fixed effects. Specifically, we estimate the following
empirical model:

        𝑦𝑖𝑐 = 𝜂𝑐 + 𝛽1 𝑇𝑖𝑐 + 𝛽2 𝑥𝑖𝑐 + 𝛽3 𝑥𝑖𝑐 𝑇𝑖𝑐 + 𝜀𝑖𝑐                                  (1)

where 𝑦𝑖𝑐 is the outcome for individual i living in conglomerate c, 𝑇𝑖𝑐 denotes treatment
status and varies at the household level, 𝑥𝑖𝑐 denotes the distance from the conglomerate
threshold, and 𝜀𝑖𝑐 denotes an error term. The term 𝜂𝑐 denotes a conglomerate fixed effect.
We cluster errors at the conglomerate level.

Note that we control for distance from the threshold using a linear specification rather
than polynomials because we restricted our survey sample to being very close to the
thresholds. We provide evidence supporting the validity of this model specification in the
baseline balance section below.

It is important to note that households could not manipulate the SISFOH score as the data
used to estimate the SISFOH score were collected before Pension 65 had established the
eligibility threshold. While compliance with treatment assignment was high, it was not
perfect. After implementation, monitoring data revealed that 260 individuals who were
receiving transfers were not eligible; 20 individuals in the control group were also
receiving transfers; and 177 eligible individuals never received a transfer. Thus, our
estimates are interpreted as intention-to-treat effects.

   V.      Descriptive Statistics and Baseline Balance

In this section, we provide descriptive statistics of the study population and investigate
baseline balance in the context of our estimation strategy. Table 1 reports the baseline
means of individual characteristics for the control group and differences in the baseline
means of the treatment and control groups. Table 2 reports the same for household
characteristics. In both tables, column (1) reports the baseline means for the control
group; column (2) reports the difference of the treatment and control group baseline
means; and column (3) reports the standard error of the difference in (2). Columns (4),



                                               8
(5) and (6) show p-values for tests of balance estimated using RD with conglomerate
fixed effects, simple RD, and simple differences, respectively.

The individual and household characteristics reflect the targeting criteria. The individuals
are older than 65, live in poor households and are mostly physically and mentally healthy.
As shown in Table 1, Column (1), Panels A and B, 68 percent of the respondents reported
working in the previous week with 58 percent reporting having done so for pay. Panel C
shows statistics on the physical health of these older adults. The prevalence of
hypertension in the sample was 32 per cent. To put this number in context, we note the
prevalence of hypertension worldwide in adults aged 25 and over was 40% in 2008
(WHO, 2016). The average waist circumference was 88 centimeters, and the average
BMI was 24. This average BMI is in the normal range, and the average waist
circumference is below the threshold for a greater risk of metabolic complications
according to the standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO) (2008).

The well-being indicator reflects the extent of an individual’s overall satisfaction with
life. Higher values indicate higher values in any of the other well-being indicators. The
indicator is standardized to the distribution of the control group. According to our
findings, the average older adult feels content or very content with respect to six (75
percent) of the eight aspects of their lives covered in the survey (contentment with health,
self, ability to carry out daily activities, interpersonal relations, place where the adult
lives, relationship with children, relationship with other family members and life in
general). The average score was 0.89 on a scale from 0 to 1 for empowerment, and 81
percent of the respondents said that they contribute to household expenditures. In
addition, the support that these older adults feel that they provide to the household results
in a self-worth score of 0.60 on a scale from 0 to 1.

Column (1) of Table 2 shows that the average household has three individuals. The
average age of the head of household is 68 years; 66 percent of the heads of household
are married, and 75 percent are male. The average education level is 7.5 years (equivalent
to a completed elementary education). The average level of labor income and of
household expenditure per adult equivalent are both equal to US$ 51, which indicates that
                                               9
many of these households are indeed poor, have elderly members and obtain resources
for expenditure on consumption from sources other than the formal labor market.

Overall, there are no statistically significant differences between the treatment and
control groups for RD with conglomerate fixed effects (Column 4), our preferred model,
that are consistent with the assumption behind our identification strategy. However, the
simple RD (column 5) is next best with 4 out of 31 characteristics being statistically
different at conventional levels of significance. Finally, as expected, the simple difference
in means (column 6) produces the most violations of baseline balance with 10 out of 31
characteristics being significantly different.

V. Empirical Results

In this section we present estimates of the impact of non-contributory pensions on labor
supply, health, well being and consumption. We start out by discussing our preferred
specification. More specifically, we focus on the intention-to-treat estimates arrived at
using the RD model with conglomerate fixed effects. We then discuss how our results
vary under alternative specifications in the previous to last subsection.

       a. Labor Supply

Table 3 reports the results for labor market participation. Column (2) shows estimation
without controls. Column (3) shows results with controls. Column (4) shows p-values
adjusted for the family-wise error rate from multiple hypothesis testing following the
procedure presented in Anderson (2008). The adjusted p-values control for the
probability of false rejection for the family of outcomes listed in each table.

These results indicate that the program did not affect labor supply or hours worked. The
share of individuals who were working remained at 59 percent. The number of hours
worked in the previous week remained at 15.55. However, the receipt of pensions

                                                 10
decreased the level of work for pay by 8.85 percent (from 0.51 to 0.47). And, indeed,
labor income fell by 20.34 percent (from US$ 22.93 to US$ 18.27). The number of hours
worked for pay in the previous week remained at 13.45, and there are thus no statistically
significant differences in that variable.

                                         [Insert Table 3 here]

       b. Health and Well-Being

Table 4 shows the results for health and well-being. The values of program estimates
given in Column (2) for Panel A show that physical health was not affected. More
specifically, hypertension, waist circumference, BMI and memory scores were not altered
by the program. Consistent with this, older adults did not feel that their health had
improved or that they were having less difficulty than before in performing daily
activities. The physical health scores confirm this.

Table 4 Panel B, which focuses on subjective well being, shows a different story. The
program reduced the older adults’ score on the Geriatric Depression Scale by 8.68
percent (from 0.43 to 0.39). In addition, the contribution-to-household expenditures score
increased by 12.92 percent (from 0.83 to 0.94), and the self-worth score rose by 6.54
percent (from 0.57 to 0.61). However, the program did not affect the satisfaction score,
which remained at 0.74, or the empowerment score, which remained at 0.88. The overall
well-being score, shown in the last row of Panel B, indicates that the program led to an
increase in well-being equivalent to 0.17 standard deviations.

                                        [Insert Table 4 Here]

As the program made beneficiaries eligible for the public Integral Health Insurance
Program (Seguro Integral de Salud (SIS)), we find that the share of older adults affiliated
with this insurance program increased by 12 percent (from 79 percent to 89 percent).
However, we find no effects on the use of health services. Table 5 reports estimates of
program effects on health perception, insurance and health services.

                                        [Insert Table 5 Here]
                                              11
       c. Household Income and Consumption

Table 6 reports impact estimates for household labor income and consumption
expenditures, with income and expenditures being presented in US dollars (US$) and in
terms of adult equivalents. Column (2) shows that the program did not affect total
household labor income. Indeed, total labor income remained at US$ 38.46. The program
did not affect the labor income of older adults either, which remained constant at
US$ 25.94. However, the program increased household expenditure by 39.73 percent
(from US$ 45.16 to US$ 63.11). Older adults allocated 67 percent of their expenditure to
food consumption and 33 percent to non-food consumption.

To get a sense of how these changes relate to the pension transfers, consider the
following. The program transferred US$ 39 (125 Peruvian Soles (S$)) per month per
person. Considering that the average household size is 2.84, and additionally that, on
average, the sample includes 1.29 older adults per household. Therefore, the average
transfer per adult equivalent to each household was US$ 39*1.29/2.84 = US$ 17.71. This
amount is not statistically different from the increase in consumption (p=0.948).
Consistent with this, we find household consumption changes in line with the total
transfer. In other words, households with two older adults increase consumption twice as
much as households with one older adult. Online Appendix C shows estimates by the
number of older adults in the household.

                                           [Insert Table 6 Here]

       d. Benefits to Other Family Members and Transfers

Increases in household consumption may benefit other household members, in addition to
the older adults. Thus, we seek to determine if pension transfers affected school
enrollment, where we define enrollment as the percentage of household members who are
3 to 15 years old and enrolled in an educational institution. Table 7 in Panel A shows the
results of this analysis. No effects were found.




                                             12
We then look at whether pensions influence living arrangements. As may be seen from
the same panel, we do not find any effects on household size. Next, we try to determine if
transfers at the older-adult and/or household-level change. Panel B shows impact
estimates for current transfers at the household level. The share of households with
individuals who reported having received a transfer in the previous six months decreases
from 51 percent to 43 percent. However, column (4) shows this effect is not statistically
significant when adjusting for multiple testing. We find no impact when transfers to older
adults are excluded. We also find the share of private transfers sent increased from 46 to
62 percent.

We therefore conclude that the receipt of non-contributory pensions did not affect
children’s school enrollment or household composition. These results differ from those of
Duflo (2003) and Hamoudi and Thomas (2014), who find that the receipt of pensions did
influence these two variables. We do not find evidence that the receipt of these pensions
leads to a decrease in transfers either. Our results for this variable therefore differ from
those of Fan (2010), who finds that pension transfers translate into decreases in private
transfers to the elderly equivalent to 39 cents for every pension dollar. In contrast, the
receipt of a pension is likely to benefit family members who reside elsewhere.

        d. Robustness Tests

In this section, we discuss the sensitivity of our results to alternative specifications. In
summary, our findings are robust. First, we compare the results just discussed with those
obtained with the inclusion of controls. In the empirical section, we also report estimates
while also conditioning on a set of observable control variables. Nevertheless, we expect
local estimation to replicate the conditions of a local experiment. If so, the introduction of
controls should not affect our point estimates previously reported. However, their
introduction may increase the efficiency of the estimator of the parameter of interest.

For individual outcomes, controls include each individual's age, sex, marital status and
years of schooling. For household outcomes, controls include age, marital status, sex and
                                              13
education of the head of household. We compare the results shown in Column (2) with
those given in Column (3) in Tables 3 to 7. We find that, for all variables in Tables 3
through 7, the estimates are both similar in magnitude and statistical significance. This
evidence is consistent with the assumption that eligibility thresholds successfully provide
local exogenous variation in treatment assignment.

Next, we use monitoring information to incorporate differences between planned and
actual treatment. We estimate program effects excluding the 260 non-eligible households
that were identified ex-post. We also estimate local average treatment effects using
eligibility as an instrument for the receipt of transfers. We find that these alternative
specifications yield estimates that do not differ from our intent-to-treat estimates in our
preferred specification. However, instrumental variable estimates are less efficient than
ordinary least squares. We conclude that our average local treatment effects are within
the margin of error of the intent-to-treat estimates. Tables that compare these estimates
with our intent-to-treat estimates may be found in Online Appendix D. We conclude our
results are robust to alternative specifications.

VI. Generalizing the Results

In this section, we compare our findings with those of Galiani, Gertler and Bando (2016).
The Pension 65 program in Peru and the Adultos Mayores program in Mexico have three
main features in common. First, both are federal programs intended to provide social
security coverage to the elderly in poor areas. Second, both programs provide bi-monthly
transfers of similar amounts (at the time these studies were conducted, the bi-monthly
transfer in Mexico was equivalent to US$ 95, while it was equivalent to US$ 78 in Peru).
Third, both programs have minimum eligibility requirements, since they both target
persons above a set age threshold who are living in poverty.

However, the two programs differ in two important ways as well. First, the Mexican
government originally implemented the Adultos Mayores program only in rural areas (see
Galiani, Gertler and Bando (2016) for a rigorous evaluation of the program’s
implementation in rural localities with fewer than 2,500 habitants). Over time, however,

                                              14
Adultos Mayores was expanded to urban areas. The Peruvian government, on the other
hand, did not introduce any geographic restrictions based on population size. Second,
until the 2013 fiscal year, persons in Mexico did not become eligible for the Adultos
Mayores program until they reached 70 years of age; whereas, in Peru, people have been
eligible at age 65 for the Pension 65 program ever since its inception.

In summary, we find that the results in the two countries are similar: the Geriatric
Depression Scale scores in Peru decreased by 8.68 percent, while in Mexico they
decreased by 9.11 percent; paid work decreased by 4 percentage points in both countries;
and consumption rose by 40 percent in Peru and by 14 percent in Mexico. In Peru, 67
percent of the increase in consumption was allocated to food, while in Mexico the
corresponding figure was 54 percent. The magnitude of program effects thus does not
differ to a statistically significant extent across the two countries. Figure 1 illustrates the
comparison of the consumption, depression and labor variables in Mexico and Peru.

                                        [Insert Figure 1 Here]

The two populations have many similarities. The average age of the beneficiaries is
around 71.5 years in both countries, and approximately half of the population is male.
Household consumption per adult is equivalent to US$ 45 for Peru and US$ 40 for
Mexico. There were some significant differences between these sample populations,
however. The program in Mexico targeted rural populations, while the program in Peru
did not. As a result, the households in the sample for the Mexican study were larger, and
the education level of the older adults was lower than in the Peruvian sample population.
Another difference was that 59 percent of older adults work in Peru, while the
corresponding figure was 36 percent in Mexico. Because of these differences, the labor
impact of non-contributory pension systems is similar in magnitude in the two countries
but is smaller as a percentage of initial outcomes in Peru than it is in Mexico.

The two surveyed populations are similar in terms of the age and gender of older adults,
as well as household consumption levels. However, there are some significant differences
between the two populations that need to be identified, as they allow us to learn how the

                                               15
effects of non-contributory pensions vary in different contexts. We identify two main
differences. First, the percentage of older adults who are working is higher in Peru. (A
full 51 percent of the older adults reported having worked in the previous week for pay in
Peru, while in Mexico the corresponding figure was 23 percent.) Accordingly, older
adults’ labor earnings amount to US$ 23 in Peru but to only US$ 16 in Mexico. Both
programs triggered a decrease of four percentage points in paid work. This change
represents a 20 percent decrease (from 23 percent to 18 percent) in Mexico, but a
decrease of only nine percent in Peru (from 51 percent to 46 percent).

In addition, the household size in terms of adult equivalents is larger in Mexico, where an
average household has 5.6 adult equivalents, while a household in Peru has 3.2. In
addition, the average older adult in Peru has almost eight years of education, while the
average older adult in Mexico has only two. These differences may, in part, be a result of
the difference in targeting criteria, since the Adultos Mayores program in Mexico targets
rural populations, while Pension 65 in Peru does not.

We conclude that the results for Peru contribute to our knowledge about the effects of
non-contributory pensions and allow us to apply that knowledge to a different context.
The evidence suggests that the findings of Galiani, Gertler and Bando (2016) in rural
Mexico can be reasonably well generalized to Peru in qualitative terms and, in many
cases, in quantitative terms as well.

VII. Conclusions.

In order to study the effects of non-contributory pensions in Peru, we exploit a regression
discontinuity design around the poverty score threshold for eligibility. Since we focus on
a sample of households within 0.3 standard deviations from the threshold, this study
provides a stronger identification strategy than that of previous studies.

We find that the receipt of non-contributory pensions in Peru benefited older adults in
several ways. For instance, it led to improvements in mental health, as evidenced by a
reduction of nine percentage points in the overall Geriatric Depression Scale score. We
do not find impacts on the use of health services or health, but the receipt of those
                                             16
pensions did decrease the amount of paid work performed by older adults by 4 percentage
points. The bulk of the cash transfer was used to finance an increase in consumption of
40 percent. In addition, recipient households are more likely to support members who
reside elsewhere, as the share of households that made transfers to other individuals or
households increased from 46 percent to 61 percent. More importantly, we find that our
results are qualitatively similar to those of Galiani, Gertler and Bando (2016) in Mexico
and hence both sets of results help us to construct external validity.

Our findings should be viewed in the light of a number of caveats that point to directions
for future research. First, we have observed these program effects after only one year, at
most, since beneficiaries started receiving these program transfer payments, and it is
possible that households may adjust their behavior in the long run. For example, Zhu and
Xiaobo (2015) find that retirement leads to an immediate increase in life satisfaction, but
they also find that the level of satisfaction decreases with time (see also Galiani, Gertler
and Undurraga, 2016). A second caveat is that the data do not allow us to study how the
receipt of non-contributory pensions may affect persons of working age near retirement
age. Galiani, Gertler and Bando (2016), however, do not find anticipation effects in
Mexico.

The number of people in need of non-contributory pensions is likely to increase
significantly in the coming years, and government expenditure on non-contributory
pension schemes will probably climb. The findings of this study suggest that public
expenditure on such pension systems results in welfare improvements among
beneficiaries. Moreover, these pensions benefit not only older adults but also other
household members. Therefore, non-contributory pensions appear to be an effective
means of enhancing welfare among the older population and of reducing poverty.

Appendix A. Comparison of households included and those excluded from analysis

In Table A1 of this appendix, we show a comparison of households included in and
excluded from the analysis. The share of households excluded from the analysis amounts
to 14 percent of the sample. Columns (A) and (B) give the means for each group. The
different rows in the table indicate the factors used in the comparison. We include
household-level outcomes, such as labor income and expenditure. In addition, we include
treatment status, distance from the threshold value and household head characteristics.
Column (C) shows differences and column (D) shows p-values for a test of equality in
means. We find that the excluded households do not differ from included households in
most areas. We do, however, find differences in distance from the threshold value with
households that have been excluded from the analysis having lower SISFOH scores,
which indicates that more of the poorer households have been excluded from the study.
We also find differences in the marriage status of the head of household. However, these
differences are not likely to bias our results. Indeed, our results hold true even when
controls for these dimensions are included.

Appendix D. Comparison of intent-to-treat estimates with local average treatment
effects
Table E1 shows the number of households according to their eligibility status and receipt
of transfers. Monitoring data are available for all the households except for 176 out of the
2,584 in the sample. Missing data do not differ across households above or below the
eligibility threshold (p=0.612). Of those 2,408 households for which information is
available, 260 received at least one pension transfer but transfers were later discontinued.
Of these 260 households, 247 were households that had been deemed eligible when the
program started (treatment). Thus, we estimate the program effects excluding these 260
households on the assumption that their exclusion improves data quality.
Among the 2,148 households that were deemed eligible, 1,302 were in the treatment
group. However, 177 never received a transfer. Out of the 846 eligible households in the
control group, 20 received at least one transfer. Thus, we instrument actual treatment with
treatment status before the program started.
Tables D2, D3 and D4 show estimates for three specifications. The first column shows
estimates with the RD model with conglomerate fixed effects and controls based on all
2,584 households and 3,342 individuals. This column shows the same estimates that are
listed in Column (5) in Tables 3, 4 and 5. The second column shows estimates for the
same model as in Column (1) but focuses on the 2,148 eligible households and 2,772
eligible individuals. The third column shows estimates for the same sample as the second
column, but uses SISFOH score eligibility as an instrument for actual treatment. In
summary, Columns (1) and (2) show intention-to-treat estimates and Column (3) shows
local average treatment effects. Column (1) is based on the full sample, and Columns (2)
and (3) are based on households whose treatment status was verified with monitoring
data.
Table D2 shows estimates of pension transfer effects on individual labor supply. Table
D3 shows estimates of pension effects on health and well-being. Table D4 shows effects
on household income and expenditure. In all three tables, the results do not differ to a
statistically significant extent across models. Differences are larger for labor income in
Table D2 between the RD model with controls (Column 1) and the local average
treatment effect (Column 3). The average labor income in the control group for the full
sample is US$ 22.93. Thus, the effect of these pensions varies from a reduction of 25
percent to a decrease of 56 percent in labor income. However, these two results do not
differ to a statistically significant extent at the 10 percent level. As expected, local
average treatment effects are larger than intention-to-treat estimates but are estimated less
efficiently.
We conclude that any errors related to eligibility classification are unlikely to explain
differences between treatment and control groups. In addition, average local effects are
larger and are consistent with intent-to-treat effects.
