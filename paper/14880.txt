Carbon Motivated Regional Trade Arrangements: Analytics and Simulations

JEL No. F13,Q54

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper presents both analytics and numerical simulation results relevant to proposals for carbon
motivated regional trade agreements summarized in Dong & Whalley(2008). Unlike traditional regional
trade agreements, by lowing tariffs on participant’s low carbon emission goods and setting penalties
on outsiders to force them to join such agreements , carbon motivated regional trade agreements reflect
an effective merging of trade and climate change regimes, and are rising in profile as part of the post
2012 Copenhagen UNFCC negotiation. By adding country energy extraction cost functions, we develop
a multi-region general equilibrium structure with endogenously determined energy supply. We calibrate
our model to business as usual scenarios for the period 2006-2036. Our results show that carbon motivated
regional agreements can reduce global emissions, but the effect is very small and even with penalty
mechanisms used, the effects are still small. This supports the basic idea in our previous policy paper
that trade policy is likely to be a relatively minor consideration in climate change containment.

1.     Introduction
     This paper presents both analytics and numerical simulation results relevant to
recent debate on carbon motivated regional trade agreements (see Chatham House
(2007) and Dong & Whalley (2008)). Proposals which circulate include explicitly
lowering or eliminating tariffs among parties to a regional agreement on low carbon
intensive goods and products used in low carbon technologies,border adjustments on
trade with parties outside the area based on differential emissions content of goods,
and the use of trade sanctions against countries outside the area to enforce compliance
with emissions reduction targets set for them. Such proposals reflect an effective
merging of trade and climate change regimes, and are rising in profile as part of the
post 2012 Copenhagen UNFCC negotiations (See Walsh & Whalley (2008), and
Lockwood & Whalley(2008)). Here we discuss carbon motivated regional agreements
in terms similar to customs union and regional trade agreements based literature (See
Viner(1950)) .
      We note that agreements with lower within-region barriers on low carbon
intensive products need not reduce emissions globally if emissions intensities of
production differ sharply within and inside the region. This reflects the differential
impact of trade creation and trade diversion on emissions. We also note that unlike
conventional customs union literature the welfare effects of a regional agreement now
also include welfare impacts on climate change from emissions changes.
      We use a multi-region general equilibrium structure in which countries produce
commodities of varying emissions intensities using substitutable fossil fuel based
energy and non-energy inputs. Commodities are differentiated by country of origin
following Armington (1969). Preferences are defined over both consumption of goods
and climate change, with lower utility from higher global temperature change.
      Unlike in conventional trade models in which there is a fixed endowment of
factor inputs for each country, here we model energy supply globally as integrated
with a single global market and price, and there being a supply function for each
country reflecting increasing extraction costs. We do not separately differentiate


                                         -3-
between fossil and non fossil fuels, but in a further model extension we could do so.
We model the extraction cost function in constant elasticity form to yield a
specification consistent with alternative values of the supply elasticity of energy. We
then treat emissions in each country as fixed coefficient in energy use, and in this way
incorporate endogeneity of emissions levels. Global emissions levels can thus rise or
fall under any given regional trade agreement. This differs from other equilibrium
structures, (see OECD(1993),Bhattacharyya(1996) and Wing(2004) ) in which the
energy endowment is fixed (perfectly inelastic supply).
    We next turn to numerical simulation, and using a number of data sources
construct a benchmark global equilibrium data set based on data for 2006. This covers
production, consumption and trade for each of a number of regions (US, EU, China,
ROW) which we then project forward using 2004-2006 average growth rates for the
period 2006-2036. In our static equilibrium model we thus treat the thirty year period
2006-2036 as a single period. The data set also contains estimates of energy use by
sector and emissions for 2006 which are growth rate projected forward for period
2006-2036. We calibrate our model to this data set using literature based estimates of
key elasticities.
    Results from our analysis support the conjecture made verbally in our previous
policy paper (see Dong & Whalley (2008) ) that carbon motivated trade policies such
as carbon free trade areas can only have a relatively small role in reducing carbon
emissions. Carbon motivated regional agreements may increase world welfare, but the
effects on participating countries may be negative or positive, when with penalties,
the effect of carbon motivated trade policies on carbon emissions is still small.
Though the carbon motivated regional agreements will have larger effects with
emissions of high and low emissions intensities countries involved, the effects are still
small.

2.    Relevant Literature and Model Structure

2.1   Literature Review

      Discussion of both the form and impact of carbon free trade agreements is
related to the long studied customs union issue originally analyzed by Viner (1950).
Viner, the initiator of subsequent customs union literature, pointed out that regional
trade agreements do not necessarily result in gains to members, even though bilateral
tariffs are eliminated by the agreement. He developed what later became known as the
trade creation – trade diversion approach to regional trade agreements to help
understand this ambiguity. Following Viner’s work, for many years trade creating
regional agreements were seen as good, and trade diverting regional agreements were
seen as bad.
      Viner’s work was also the driving force behind later literature that subsequently
sought to set out the conditions under which regional trade agreements would either
improve or worsen welfare. This work was still based on trade creation—trade
diversion considerations, but Meade (1955), Lipsey(1957) and others discovered that
preference considerations also enter in trying to make such determinations. This was
to lead to Lipsey and Lancaster’s (1956) characterization of the general theory of the
second best, confirmation that no general customs union results were possible.
Dissatisfaction with the trade creation – trade diversion dichotomy resulted in Lipsey
(1970), Kemp(1969), Riezman(1979) and others trying to develop other approaches
that would yield clear propositions. The approach known as the terms of trade-volume
of trade approach became popular, under which the impact of a regional trade
agreement can be summarized by its effects on both terms of trade (prices) and trade
volumes. Most traditional literature on regional trade agreements falls into the
traditional Vinerian framework.
      In Dong & Whalley(2008), we proposed three different forms of possible carbon
motivated regional trade arrangements. One is regional trade agreements with varying
types of trade preferences towards low carbon intensive products, low carbon new
technologies and inputs to low carbon processes being used to stimulate trade (and

                                          -5-
hence consumption) in low carbon intensive products. In this way they are designed to
contribute directly to emissions reduction through changed trade patterns. A second
type focuses on the anti-competitive effects on domestic producers when significant
joint emissions reduction commitments are made which others do not follow. Such
commitments raise costs for domestic producers and whether there should be offsets
for these relative cost effects compared to third country producers operating outside of
such arrangements is an issue, as well as the form they should take. The perceived
need for border tax adjustments had already arisen in Europe who saw themselves as
going father and faster on emissions reductions than partner countries. A third type of
arrangement could be where countries enter into free trade or other regional trade
agreements and use joint and discriminatory carbon motivated trade barriers against
third parties as a way of pressuring countries to join their joint environmental
agreement. This form of trade arrangement is similar to that contained in the Montreal
Protocol of 1987.
      This paper follows Dong & Whalley (2008), and numerically evaluates the
economic effects of type one and type three carbon free trade areas in that paper. In
their simplest form, carbon free trade areas would involve free trade in low carbon
containing products among countries jointly committing to significant emissions
reductions or renewable commitments, and also with external trade barriers against
third countries that do not follow. Discussion of both their form and impact is related
to the long studied customs union issue originally analyzed by Viner(1950), but now
there are also impacts of carbon pricing/reduction policies on emissions via
endogenous energy supply. The paper focuses on two departures from Vinerian form,
one includes climate change effects in utility, and the other changes traditional free
trade areas and Customs Unions to carbon motivated free trade areas and Customs
Unions. In carbon free trade agreements, traditional zero-tariffs on all goods changes
to structural preferential trade policies setting high tariffs on high carbon intensive
products and zero tariffs on low carbon intensive goods. We also consider a new form
of carbon motivated Customs Unions of only setting zero tariffs on low carbon
intensive goods.
                                          -6-
       We argue that agreements with lower within region barriers on low carbon
intensive products need not reduce emissions globally if emissions intensities of
production differ sharply within and outside the region. This reflects the differential
impact of trade creation and trade diversion on emissions. We also note that unlike
conventional customs union literature the welfare effects of a regional agreement also
include welfare impacts on climate change from emissions changes.

2.2      The Model
      We present our carbon free trade area model in algebraic form. In its simplest
form, there are three regions, i=1,2,3,where regions 1 and 2 form a carbon free trade
agreement, although in empirical implementation we can consider more regions.
There are two goods, j=1,2, in production, good 1 has high energy intensity, and good
2 has low energy intensity. The model specifies two factors, N a non-energy input,
which is immobile across countries, but mobile across sectors within a country, and E
an energy input which is mobile across both countries and sectors.
       On the production side, we consider a two sectors (a high emission good and a
low emissions good), two factors (energy and non energy inputs) structure. We
assume production is CES. The production function for each good in each country can
be written as
                                   σ ij −1                                σ ij −1     σ ij
                      1 / σ ij            σ ij              1 / σ ij             σ ij      σ ij −1
       Yij = Φ ij [aij1          Eij             + aij 2               N ij             ]                   i=country, j=sector   (1)

       where Yij is the output of good j produced in country i, pE is the price of energy,

σ ij is the elasticity of substitution between the two inputs. We assume that energy is

mobile across countries, so that the energy price in each country (the world price) is

the same. piN is the price of the non-energy input in country i, goods prices are Pij .

      First order conditions imply the following:
                                                                                                                σ ij
                                                                                                                       1−σ ij

                                                                                                                 σ ij
                                                                                                                        1−σ ij

                                                                                         1
                                                                                          1−σ ij
                                                   1−σ ij                     1−σ
                      Pij = Φ ij−1[aij1 pE                   + aij 2 piN ij ]                                                     (4)

                                                                                -7-
   Unlike traditional general equilibrium models which use a fixed endowment of
energy, here, by introducing an extraction cost function for each country into the
model, energy supply now is endogenously determined.
     The extraction cost function can be written as

                 K i = Fi (Qi ) = Bi1 + Bi 2QiBi 3                                                                                (5)

where K i is the extraction cost in country i, and Qi is energy extraction in country i .

     We assume the energy market is perfectly competitive, and from the first-order
conditions for the extraction cost function, we get

                          dKi dFi (Qi )
                   pE =       =         = Bi 2 Bi 3QiBi 3 −1                                                                      (6)
                          dQi   dQi

and the energy supply elasticity is

                           dK i K i
                  EQi =             = Bi 3 − 1                                                                                    (7)
                           dQi Qi

     Dividing the extraction cost function by the energy price, we can calculate the
resources that are used in energy extraction.

                          K i Bi1 + Bi 2QiBi 3
                  Ri =       =                                                                                                    (8)
                          pE        pE

   The utility function is
                                                     σ 1i −1                            σ 1i −1     σ 1i

                                                                            σ 1i               σ 1i      σ 1i −1       C − ΔT β
       U i = U i ( RX i , ΔT ) = [γ Hi          Hi                 + γ Li          Li              ]               (         )    (9)
                                                                                                                         C

     This utility function follows Cai, Riezman & Whalley (2009). RX i is composite

consumption, ΔT is temperature change. In this specification ,C can be thought of
as the global temperature change at which all economic activity ceases (say, 20℃). In
this case, as ΔT approaches C, utility goes to zero. In this form, as ΔT goes to
zero, there is no welfare impact of temperature change.

     For the final good demand functions, RX i is a two level nested CES function.

Each region is assumed to maximize utility by first choosing among high and low




                                                               -8-
emission goods, and each region then chooses using among domestic goods and the
other country goods at a second level.

           RX i = f ( X i11 , X i 21 ,L X i1r , X i 2 r )                          (10)

      Each of the four regions maximizes top level utility subject to a budget

constraint. I i is income in country i .

           ∑P
            ji′
                  iji′   X iji′ = I i                                              (11)


     income includes non-energy income, energy income, tariff revenue, and transfers
from abroad (financing net goods import and net energy import).

           I i = piNWiN + [ pE Qi − K i ] + Ri + TRi                                (12)

         For country i, piN is the price of non-energy input, WiN is the non-energy

  endowment, K i is the extraction cost of energy, and Qi is energy extraction in

  country i. Ri is tariff revenue, and TRi are exogenous transfers between countries

  (net goods import plus net energy import). These can be zero, but incorporating
  them allows calibration to unbalanced trade data.
        Figure 1 shows the structure of two level nested CES utility functions used.
        For each good j produced in country i’, we can define the seller’s price (net of

tariff) as p ji′ , and allow each country i to impose tariffs at rate tiji′ ( country i ’s tariff

on good j imported from country i′ ) on each imported good. Tariffs are set to zero

for exports. Internal (gross of tariff ) prices for good j produced in country i’ are thus

           Piji′ = [1 + tiji' ]Pji′                                                (13)

     Temperature change in physical form is assumed to be a function of energy
consumption, ie
         ΔT = g (∑ Eij ) = a (∑ Eij )b + c                                               (14)

     In equilibrium, goods and factor markets clear. Goods market clearing implies:

         ∑X
          i
                 iji′   = Yi′j       i =1,2,3 , j =1,2                                   (15)

     Non-energy is only mobile across sectors within regions and immobile across
regions, so each region’s non-energy consumption equals its non-energy endowment.
The non-energy clearing condition is:

         ∑N
          j
                 ij     = WiN        i =1,2,3                                            (16)

   Energy is mobile across countries and so global energy consumption equals global
energy extraction. The energy clearing condition is:

         ∑ E = ∑Q
          ij
                 ij

3.       Data and Parameterization
      We build a model compatible benchmark general equilibrium data set which we
use in calibration. Our base case assumes a single 30 year period, forward projecting a
business as usual scenario for trade, production, and consumption data (as well as
energy use) for a 2 good (energy / non energy intensive), 2 factor (energy inputs,
other inputs) structure for 4 regions (China, US , EU, ROW). We forward project
2006 data using 2004-2006 average growth rates, for the period 2006-2036.
     In Table 1-1 GDP data is from the World Bank’s WDI database. The high-
emission sector reflects manufacturing industry. The low-emission sector includes
service and agricultural sectors. For Table 1-2, trade data is taken from the
UNCOMTRADE database, F.o.b. export values as reported by exporting countries
are used. Since data on EU’s exports to China and US in 2006 were not available at
the time of model execution, we use the import data of China and the US from the EU
instead. Since China’s growth rates is high relative to other regions ,to keep trade
balance in the data, we use China’s growth rate for China’s imports and exports ,
while for other data , we use the import country’s growth rate in our projections, tariff
data is from the WTO Statistical Database.
         In Table 1-3 , energy data for 2005 is calculated from IEA energy statistics. The
unit of account of the IEA statistics data is thousand of tonnes of oil equivalent, which
we adjust to billion US dollars, (1 toe=7.33 barrel of oil equivalent, oil price
(average)=$ 50.64/per barrel) . In 2005, the energy balances for world were crude oil
imports of 4476208 Ktoe, while exports were 4484919 Ktoe, comparable with world
crude oil trade balance. The extraction cost is calculated using the IEA trade balance
table.
      In the data presented in Table 1-4 , adjustments are made to consumption by
calculating GDP minus exports. There are also some small differences in goods
classifications between the underlying consumption, production and tariff rate data.
Table 1-5 gives energy consumption data from IEA statistics.

     As for elasticities, in the central case , model analyses elasticity parameters are
used as follows: for all countries the production elasticity is 0.5, the extraction /
energy supply elasticity is 0.5, the consumption elasticity, that is the substitution
elasticity between high and low emission goods in consumption is equal to 0.5, and
the trade elasticity ,that is the substitution elasticity between domestic and imported
goods is equal to 2. The substitution elasticities between domestic and imported
commodities follows the “rule of two”, as discussed in Hertel al. (2009). This rule
was first proposed by Jomini et al.(1991) and later tested by Liu, Arndt,and
Hertel(2002) in a back-casting exercise with a simplified version of the GTAP model.
The model Global 2100 uses a capital and labour nest against energy with a
substitution elasticity of 0.4 (see Manne and Richels, 1992), Kemfert(1998) studied
the case of Germany, and the substitution elasticities in all sectors between composite
of capital and labor , trading off against energy was 0.458. We thus use the setting of
0.5 as the substitution elasticity between energy and non-energy inputs.

     Using the data for 2006,2036, and 2056 in table 1-5, and assuming the
temperature change at these three points to be 0℃,2℃, and 5℃ respectively, we can
solve for the values of parameters a,b,and c in equation (14) as

                             0 = a (2936.75 - 2936.75) b + c

                             2 = a (221832.56) b + c

                             5 = a (987245.64 ) b + c

  Solving these equations for the parameters a,b,and c yields values of 0.0010,
0.6137 and 0. Substituting these values in the temperature equation yields

                             ΔT = g (∑ Eij ) = 0.001(∑ Eij ) 0.6137          (18)

   Assuming a temperature change ΔT of 5℃ between 2006 and 2056 (consistent
with Stern(2002)), Table 2 reports the calibrated preference parameters in equation (9)
under alternative damage assumptions. If we assumed half temperature change, at
these three points to be 0℃,1℃, and 2.5℃ respectively, we can solve for the values
of parameters a,b,and c, 0.0005, 0.6137 and 0. If we double temperature change,
temperature change at these three points will be 0℃,4℃, and 10℃ respectively, and
the values of parameters a,b,and c are 0.0021 , 0.6137, and 0 .
   The specification C can be thought of the global temperature change at which all
economic activity ceases (say 20℃). In this case, as ΔT approaches C utility goes to
zero. In this form , as ΔT goes to zero there is no welfare impact of temperature

change. As discussed in Cai et al.(2009), the share parameter β reflects the assumed

severity of damage from temperature change, which we later (in Table 7) calibrate to
various damage estimates from business as usual global temperature change scenarios
reported by Stern(2006) and Mendelson(2007).
  Table 2 also reports remaining parameter values in production, preferences and
extraction cost functions generated by calibration. These are independent of the
assumed utility damage due to temperature change.

4.    Model Experiments and Results for Carbon Motivated Regional
Trade Agreements
     We have used our calibrated model to simulate the impacts of carbon motivated
regional trade agreements on emissions and welfare. Following Dong & Whalley
(2008), we analyze the first type of carbon motivated regional agreement (lower
tariffs on low carbon intensive goods) and the third types of carbon motivated
regional agreements(added penalties on third parties). Results are presented in Table 3
to Table 8.
     These experiments confirmed the conjectures in our previous policy paper (see
Dong & Whalley (2008)), that while carbon motivated regional agreements can
reduce global carbon emissions, the effect on carbon emissions is small. Carbon
motivated regional agreements may increase world welfare, but the effects on
participating countries may be negative or positive. When we consider third party
penalties, the effects of carbon motivated trade policies on carbon emissions are still
small. Even though carbon motivated regional agreements will have larger effects on
emissions when high and low emissions countries are involved compared to more
uniform emissions levels, the effects are still small.
     In Tables 3,4,5, using central case model specifications, we analyze four
groupings of regional trade agreements, these are EU-US, EU-China, US-China, and
EU-US-China. In each group, there are two sub forms. One is carbon free trade
agreements, which eliminates interior tariffs on low carbon intensive goods, and keep
tariffs on high carbon intensive goods unchanged. The other is carbon motivated
customs unions, besides within region tariff reductions as in carbon free trade
agreements, we assume a common 5% external tariff on low carbon motivated goods.
Totally we analyze eight kinds of carbon motivated regional trade agreements in our
central case analyses.
     Table 3 reports the impacts of carbon motivated trade arrangements on welfare
and emissions. Most carbon motivated trade arrangements will reduce global
emissions, but the effect is small. In Table 3-1, the global emissions are reduced in
seven cases; the exception being in the US-China carbon CU case. The biggest
reduction is from a EU-US-China carbon FTA, -0.0221% (very small change), and
smallest reduction is from a EU-US carbon FTA, -0.0008%, Since China has much



                                           - 16 -
higher emissions intensity than the EU or the US, the carbon FTAs that involve China
will have larger effects.
     We can also compare carbon FTAs and carbon CUs. In case 1 and case 4,
EU-US, EU-US-China, since China and ROW are respectively outside the agreement
and both of these two regions have a higher emission intensity than the insiders
(measured in average emissions intensity across sectors), carbon CUs has more
impact than carbon FTAs in these two scenarios. In cases 2 and 3, EU-China,
US-China, the outside countries have lower emissions levels than insiders (average
level). In this case carbon FTAs have more impacts on emissions than a carbon CU. A
carbon CU has a larger role than a carbon FTA in reducing carbon emissions when
the outsider has higher emission intensity than insiders.
     Table 3-1 also reports separate effects on country’s emissions. The EU increases
emissions in most cases, since EU’s carbon intensity is low, and increased trade
increases production in other member countries who have a relative higher carbon
intensity. For China, participating in the carbon free trade areas will decrease China’s
carbon emissions, such that EU-China carbon FTA, US-China carbon FTA ,
EU-US-China FTA will decrease China’s emissions 0.0227%, 0.0002%, 0.0202%.
For US, in most cases, participating in carbon FTAs and CUs will reduce it’s carbon
emissions.
     In Table 3-2, for welfare analysis, we use Hicksian CV and EV measures
capturing the effects of temperature change.
                          ΔU i      U i1 − U i0
             CVi =               =                            (19)
                       C − ΔT0 β    C − ΔT0 β
                      ( i      )   ( i         )
                          Ci           Ci

                         ΔU i      U i1 − U i0
             EVi =              =                             (20)
                      C − ΔT1 β    C − ΔT1 β
                     ( i      )   ( i         )
                         Ci           Ci

     In Table 3-2, since the temperature change is small, ΔT0 ≈ ΔT1 , and CV and EV

measures from equations (19) and (20) are similar. We only focus on the CV measure.
For the global economy, in most cases (except a US-China carbon FTA), carbon
motivated regional trade agreements are welfare improving. And comparing carbon
FTA and CU, in case 1, since the outsider has higher carbon emissions, the total
welfare increase is small, for a EU-US FTA, when reducing the tariff on outsider’s
low carbon goods to a 5% CET , A EU-US CU however, seems to improve global

                                            - 17 -
welfare more. In cases 2,3 and 4, the high emission country China is involved in the
carbon arrangement, so a carbon CU is more powerful than carbon FTAs in increasing
global welfare. For insiders, in EU-US FTA/CU, EU-China FTA/CU , EU-US-China
FTA/EU, the EU will benefit most from these arrangements, in US-China CU, China
will benefit most. For outsiders, in all cases, outsiders increase welfare in carbon
FTAs, but lose in a carbon CU.

   In Table 4, we compare the welfare effects of carbon based regional trade
agreements and traditional trade agreements, also calibrating a non climate change
traditional trade model to the same trade, production and consumption data for
2006-2036. This allows us to compare the welfare impacts of similar tariff
arrangements with and without climate change considerations. There are four country
cases where the sign change from a negative CV (in traditional carbon regional
agreements) to a positive CV (in carbon based regional agreement). The four cases
are: in EU-US FTA, the welfare of EU, and total welfare, in US-China CU, the
welfare of US and in EU-US-China CU, the welfare of China. That suggests carbon
motivated regional trade agreements increase welfare for participating countries over
conventional regional agreements.
     In Table 4, comparing impacts on total welfare, in most cases, carbon motivated
regional trade agreements reduce welfare compared to traditional regional trade
agreements. In the 6 cases(all except EU-US FTA/ CU) ,since these carbon regional
trade agreements have no tariff preferences towards high energy intensive goods,
which will reduce the consumption of such kind of goods, the negative consumption
effect is bigger than the positive temperature effect, so the total welfare effect is
negative.
     In Table 4, we also consider the welfare change of individual countries, and for
the ROW. All 8 cases show welfare reductions under a carbon regional trade
agreements compared to traditional trade agreements which means that carbon
motivated regional trade agreements offer more incentives for the outsiders to join
environmental trade agreements. For China, only under a EU-US FTA/CU does
China’s welfare reduce under carbon free trade agreements. For EU, as an outsider the
EU faces losses in US-China carbon regional trade agreements compared to
traditional trade agreements. But when considering US , there is some change in
EU-US FTA/EU cases where the US loses in carbon agreements compared to
traditional agreements.

   In Table 5 , we analyze the impacts of carbon based regional trade agreements on
trade flows and production. In nearly all eight cases, carbon FTA/CU will increase
insider’s imports, except in the case of EU-China carbon FTA for China, and the
EU-US-China FTA for China. For outsiders the results are that carbon FTAs will
increase outsider’s imports, but a carbon CU (5% CET) will reduce outsider’s
imports.
   Table 5 also reports the impacts on production in nearly all cases. China, US, Row
increase low energy intensive goods, production, and reduce high energy intensive
goods production, except in an EU-US FTA(China production), a US-China CU
(China ,ROW Production), a EU-China FTA(US production). As for the EU, except
for US-China a FTA/CU increases low energy intensive goods production, and
reduces high energy intensive goods production. In all other cases ,the EU reduces
low energy intensive goods production and increases high energy intensive goods
production. That means that high emission countries will tend to produce more low
energy intensive goods, and less high energy intensive goods, no matter whether they
are outsiders or insiders. For a low emission country (EU), when it is an outsider, it
will tend to produce more low energy intensive goods, and less high energy intensive
goods, and when it is an insider, vice versa. That means if carbon regional trade
agreements are signed between high emission countries, it will be more forceful in
reducing carbon emissions.

          In Table 6-1, we report sensitivity results for elasticities and other key model
     parameters for carbon based regional trade agreements analysis. If we choose the case
     of a EU-US-China carbon FTA, decreasing trade elasticities increases the global
     emissions impact of the agreement. The outsider increases emissions, and for the
     insider, China emissions increases, while EU and US reduce emissions. Decreasing
     production elasticities, all insiders will reduce emissions, but for outsiders, the result
     is not clear. Reducing extraction elasticities, all regions increase emissions. With a
     combined reduction of trade elasticities, production elasticities and extractions
     elasticities together, total emissions increase, and outsiders still increase emissions,
     and for the insiders, EU and US emissions fall while the China increases emissions.
          In Table 6-2, when considering welfare inputs, lower trade elasticities will
     increase all regions welfare impacts, and a fall in production elasticities increases the
     welfare of EU,US and ROW and decreases the welfare of the China and total welfare.
     Also a fall in extraction elasticities will increase the welfare of EU, US, Row, and
     decrease the welfare of the China and total welfare. With a combined reduction of
     trade elasticities, production elasticities and extractions elasticities together, all
     regions welfare impacts of trade agreements will increase.

          Table 7 reports sensitivity analysis of key parameters in the environmental
     component of the modeling structure. We choose two cases, EU-US-China FTA and
     EU-China FTA, both cases show that if we increase damage cost estimates, the
     welfare impacts will increase. And also if we increase temperature change,the welfare
     impacts of agreements will increase with increasing temperature change.
          In Table 8 ,we analyze the impacts of carbon based regional trade agreements on
     emissions and welfare with trade penalties on third parties. Results show that
     increasing penalties on outsiders effectively decreases the emissions of outsiders, but
     increase the emission of insiders, and also increase the world total emissions. The
     EU-US FTA involves zero tariff on low emission goods, increasing domestic
     production (and consumption) of high emission goods. Imports from China of high
     emission goods fall, and emissions rise in the EU and the US. Interestingly, there are
     peaks for the implied emissions reduction as a function of external penalty rates,
     suggesting an optimal external tariff in terms of maximizing emissions reduction.

5.    Concluding Remarks

     We build on an earlier policy piece by Dong & Whalley(2008) and develop a
multi-region general equilibrium model calibrated to a single period data set reflecting
a business as usual scenario between 2006 and 2036. We use this to evaluate the
impacts of both carbon motivated free trade agreements and customs unions on trade,
emissions and welfare. Our results confirm the widely held view that as a mechanism
for reducing carbon emissions trade policy would seem to only offer quantitatively
small and indirect effects, since it is economic growth more so than trade and its
composition that seemingly fuels growing emissions.
     Results from model analysis show that carbon motivated trade arrangements may
reduce global carbon emissions. And as conjectured by Dong & Whalley(2008), the
effect of such agreements on emissions are relatively small comparing carbon FTAs
and carbon CU, carbon CUs seem more powerful than carbon FTAs in terms of
emissions impacts when outsiders have higher emission intensities than insiders.
     For welfare analysis , most carbon RTAs are welfare improving. When including
high emission countries in the agreements, carbon based CUs are more effective than
carbon FTAs. Comparing carbon RTAs to traditional RTAs, since carbon RTAs do
not eliminate tariffs on high emission goods, the negative consumption effect is
bigger than the positive temperature effects, so the total welfare effect is negative.
Carbon RTAs also give a much bigger incentive than traditional RTAs for the
outsider to join agreements. In most cases, carbon based RTAs will increase insider’s
imports, For outsiders , the impacts on imports are unclear: carbon based RTAs will
increase the production of low energy intensive goods, and reduce the production of
high energy intensive goods; Finally even with trade penalties on third parties there
are still not large effects in terms of carbon emissions reductions
     As the global debate on a new Post 2012 climate change regime moves forward
to the 2009 Copenhagen UNFCCC negotiation, trade and climate issues will likely
link prominently. These results seemingly support the general argument that as a way
of addressing climate change, trade policy has only small impacts.
