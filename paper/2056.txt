   The Demand for Workers and Hours and the Effects of Job Security Policies:

                                 Theory and Evidence




                                      ABSTRACT



         There has been a wide variety of research on worker—hours
substi tution arid  the effects of various costs on the speed and
extent to which labor demand adjusts. Much of this 1iterature
t.hough confuses various types of fixed costs and fails to provide a
guide for identifying how chanQes in labor—cost structures affect
static relative demands for workers and hours and the paths by which
they adjust. This study presents a typology o-f labor cost
structures and examines how they affect these and other aspects of
labor demand. Some of the many recently adopted changeE. in 1 abor-
market policies in OECD countries are pigeonhol ed by their effects
on labor cc'sts.
         A    review cf the cvi dence indicates clearly that there is some
slight       substitution between workers and hours along a constant
effecti ye—i abor I soquarit..     The evidence is clear that erripl oyers
adjust the demand for hours more rapidly than that for workers and
that both adjust fairly rapidly. It also shows that a major effect
of cost-increasing policies designed to induce substitution from
hours to workers is a reduction in the total amount of worker—hours
demanded. Original analysis demonstrates that lags in the adjustment
of employment in response to chanctes in demand lengthened in most
OECD countries during the 1970s.

averane labor costs among groups of workers, as I have analyzed
and summarized evidence on them elsewhere (Hamermesh, 1986).

A. Fixed E.ploym.nt Costs
      The simplest example of a labor—cost structure is a fixed cost

per worker, V, that the employer must pay each time period no matter
how many hours a particular worker's services are utilized or how

much the worker's hourly labor cost is. Examples of such costs
include employer—provided health insurance (life insurance too in

some cases); clerical costs of maintaining payroll and other records

on the worker; and, in the United States, the (relatively low level

of) taxes that finance unemployment insurance benefits.a
      Following Rosen (1978), assume that the total cost of labor

is W(H)EH+VE, where W is the hourly wage rate, expressed as a
function of hours per worker, and H is the average hours worked per
employee. Then the marginal cost of a worker is WH+V; the cost of
an extra hour of labor is approximately EWCI+p], where E is total

employment, and p is the elasticity of the wage rate with respect
to hours. Under certain simplifying assumptions p is the premium
rate for overtime work.   (I assume overtime is worked, but that it
constitutes a small fraction of total hours.) Assume that
production is characterized by.
Cl) Q = FCK, G(E,H)),
where K is the typical firm's capital input.   I assume here that

employment—hours substitution is separable from capital—labor
substitution, which may or may not be correct.3
      Consider the effect of an increase in V if 14 remains constant.

Labor costs per worker rise, so that the cost of a given number of
                                      2
war ker—hours   ri ses.      ihi s :i ncrease has three separate effects.,
First     and most ohvi ousi    y, the scale effect reduces employers labor
demand by the product of the labor—demand elast I          ci   ty and   the

percentage increase in total labor costs for a given empi oyment
1 sve.1 One i inpact of this increase is thus a dec:l ins in EH, total
worker—hours demanded
         The sec::ond impact is a substitution effect on the firms
re]. ati vs demand for employees and hours, The rel ati vs price of
these two labor inputs, EWH+V]/[EW( l±p) J rises, inducir
substi tutic3n away from employment and toward hours,             As 1. onoas some
substitution    is possible,     the imposed change wi 11 induce erripi oyers
to    lengthen workweeks by adding      overtime hours   and reducing
employment to achieve a given         rate of   output. At a given wage rate
and a constant premium for overtime work, increased fixed costs of
employing a worker cause a decrease in the employment—hours ratio.
         The third effect is more subtle and arises from the

heterogeneity of labor inputs. Assume for analytical simplicity
that there are only two types of labor, working H1 and H hours
respectively, and that the firm uses E1 and E employees in each
category. Total labor costs are then
(2)               EEW (H)H + VJE1,
where the subscript i refers to the particular group of labor.
Assume that production is characterized by
(1'> Q     = FK, GE1,H1,E,H
so that labor inputs are still assumed to be separable from                capital.
If    fixed costs c-f employment increase by the same nominal amount,

the rel ative   prices a-f    employment and hours of the two types of
worker change in proportion only if "i±V, p±p, W±W, and their
employment and hours are the same,              if the two groups a-f
workers are functionally identical, so that the case is
uni nteresti ng.
        In general a constant nominal increase in the fixed cost of
employment represents a greater percentage increase        in the price of
worker—hours of low— than of hi gh—wage empl oyees arid a qreater
increase   in   the   price of employment relative to hours among low— than

among high—skilid workers If all six pairs of employment—hours
combinations are p—substitutes, and labor is separable from capital,

a constant nominal increase in V and V will induce substitution
away from low--skilled worker—hours and toward high—skilled labor (in

addition to the substitution away from labor generally and toward
capital) Moreover, within each group of workers there will be
substitution toward greater hours per worker, with greater
substitution toward more hours per low—skilled empioyee

        Under di. fferent assumptions about the nature of production
this    conclusion does not. nocessari ly stand up For example suppose
hours   of each type c:f worker must be the same (H and H are perfect
p—complements), perhaps because a plant must operate for a shi ft o-f
a given duratic:r'i We will still observe a relative decrease in
total worker--hours of low—skilled employees, because there will he a

elasticities Clearly, once one disaci-gregates labor and abandons
capitai-labor separability, very little can be concluded                 jgi
       A large array of policies can he viewed as mi xirg imposed
changes in hourly labor costs and fixed employment costs
Increases in payroll tax rates to finance taxes on which there is a
ceiling   on earnings, and increases in the ceiling at a constant tax

rate, raise the cost of employment if the ceiling is low, and have
no effect on the cost of an addi t i onal hour        They are both
equivalent to increases in fixed employment costs If the ceiling
is higher the effect of these changes on the relative size of fixed
and variable employment costs may differ
      Reductions in the standard workweek (that require penalty
rates on hours beyond the normal week) raise the fixed cost of

employment,   since   the cost of an additional worker is raised by the
penalty times the reduction in the      normal workweek; but the cost of
an additional. hour also increases for employees who had been
working marginally less than the previous standard weeks The net

impact depends on the    distribution   of hours per worker before the

change was imposed Changes in the penalty rate for overtime pay,
and restri ctions on the amount cf overtime that may be used, are
other examples. In each case the impacts of the pure policy on
labor—labor and employment—hours substitution will be attenuated
because the marginal cost of an additional hour is raised; but, to
the extent that the fixed—cost component of the change dominates,
the ratio of employment to hours and the mix of workers employed
will change in the directions indicated above. However, the
potentially ambiguous effect of mixed policies underscores the

importance of analyzing the specifics of each proposed change.
B. Costs of changing Employment
      A variety of natural and imposed labor costs accompanies gross
changes in a firm's employment. Costs of searching for and

processing new employees, including advertising costs and part of
the overhead costs of maintaining a personnel department; initial
training costs (those that must be incurred to make the employee
minimally productive in the firm), to the extent the employer shares

in these costs; and payroll costs that accompany layoffs, including
higher payroll taxes or direct payments, are some examples.
      Most of the analysis of the cost of adjusting employment has
assumed that the average cost increases the larger is the change in
employment. The assumption is embodied in Figure 1A in the positive
slope of CK.' That average costs are increasing is usually
rationalized by pointing to an ever—greater disruption of the firm's
operations as the change in employment increases. Consider a
standard downward—sloping labor—demand schedule, D1 (shown in Figure
18), with the firm confronted by an imposed increase in the hourly
cost of labor, from W0 to W2. We deal here with a decrease in
equilibrium employment; a rise in employment can be handled mutatis

c:osts empi oycrient would -fail from E0 to Es..        With these costs
though.    an immediate drop in empi oyment engenders casts equal to
OAFD in Figure iPi:      Making the entire adjustment at once leads to
very   large   transac:tions costs.. The profit—maximizing firm can do
better    than this for exampleq by ma::ing half the adjustment in the
first. time periodq and the ather half in the next.. While the firm

sacrifices profits in the amount DBE in Figure lB when it is away

from   its new static profit—maximizing           position this loss is more
than   offset by the saving in         adjustment   costs.. These latter are
only OHE ——— two times the per—period cost of making the
adjustment.. The       firm   saves EHFD of adjustment costs, a larger
amount    than the DBE of static profits that it foregoes..
         Increasing average costs of adjustment thus lead firms to

spread out changes in employment when a permanent change in wages
is imposed. In general the adjustment takes               forever,   with

employment     approaching the new static equilibrium asymptotically
(see the (ppendix).. The bulk of attention t.o these casts has been
focussed on their effects on the timing of adjustment.. Consider now
how the timing is affected when average costs increase, for example
by an upward shift from         CF(   to CK..    Even though the average cost of
a particular adjustment is greater the gain to spreading the costs
over two periods is still the difference between the rectangle EHFD
and the triangle DBE.. Only if the line CF( becomes steeper

of EFGH. The -firm could make higher profits over the cycle i-f it
reduced its first—period employment and rai sed its second-period
employment.        Indeed, it   should    set

employment    at   levels       and       such    that the sum of the triangles
FGH in Figure 2A and ABC in Figure               2B is just equal to the rectangle
E'F'GH in Figure        2EL     Adjustment    costs thus lead to smoothing of
-fluctuations in     factor' demand      over the cycle.
      Adjustment      costs, like any other factor cost, also reduce the
average   factor input. More generally, adjustment costs             reduce

average   employment by a greater amount  1) The greater              the per—
worker cost is; 2) The greater the firms rate of time preference;

and 3) The greater the firms elasticity of demand for labor.                  I-f


adjustment costs differ among workers, the firm will also substitute
labor of one type for that of another. If, for example, the average
cost over an entire business cycle of employing older workers rises

due to an increase in the cost of laying them off5 their employment
will fall relative to that of younger workers (unless their supply

is perfectly inelastic and relative wages are flexible).
      In the standard anal ysi s exposi ted above, asymmetries between

hiring and discharge costs were ignored, so that increases and
decreases in employment were treated identically.'7 It should be
clear from the list of the sources of adjustment costs that there is
                                                   9
no reason to expect the cost of a hire to be the same as that of a
discharcie. The total costs of the change or the variation a-f
averacie cost. with the size a-f the chanQe need not be the same for
hires and discharges. The costs of searching for and processing new
workers are entirely different from layoff costs. This distinction
sugQests   that the     elasticity of employment with respect to a

particular demand shock and the length of the lag in the response to

that   shock will vary    with its direction.

C. Indirect and Potential Costs of Adjustment                             -




       A   third variety of          nonwage casts that affect firms' behavior

differently  from wages and fringes are costs imposed by regulation
of the apcess of adjusting employment. In some senses these are
similar to the costs discussed above. I distinguish them here
because they relate to less aggregated problems of adiustment such
as who may be laid off,1 what information must be provided to
employeesq etc. Consider             first regulations on the order in which

workers    are laid off. Included in such             regulations are

collectively--bargained        requirements that layoffs be made according
to inverse seniorityq and legal restrictions on layoffs of more
senior workers. These regulations will not impose any cost on the
firm i-f the wacie paid to each worker exactly reflects his/her
productivity. in that case the firm can abide by the regulatic'ris at
no cost for it would be mdi +-ferent about the order of layoffs in
their absence.
       The more likely case is that wages increase with tenure:
(3)        W = F(TN),      F    :>    0,   F'   0,
where W is the wage rate and TN i s              the worker' s seniity. The
                                                     10
positive relationship may be due to shared investment in firm—

specific training (Becker, 1964) or be part of some long—term
implicit contract between the worker and the firm (Lazear, 1951).
Assume also that productivity rises with tenure:
(4)     ii =   S(TN), 6' > 0,
where n is the worker's productivity per period, and that F—6
increases monotonically with TN. We assume more senior workers earn
a wage above their current productivity as part of some optimal

long—term implicit contract, perhaps because this wage—productivity
relationship induces higher lifetime output by workers.
Alternatively, the excess of wages over productivity among more

senior workers might be "explained" by custom.
      Assuming now that there are no other costs of layoff or of
hiring, how will the employer behave in the presence of fluctuations

in product demand? The regulation of layoffs by inverse seniority
obviously imposes an adjustment cost on the firm. However, the
average cost is decreasing with the size of the adjustment: A
small adjustment requires that the least senior worker-, whose

productivity exceeds the wage by the greatest amount, be laid off.
That first layoff is quite costly. As more layoffs are made in a
particular time period, the cost per layoff declines, as more senior

workers, for whom W—u is greater, become subject to layoff. With a
declining average cost of adjustment, it pays the firm to
concentrate in one period all the layoffs it intends to make in
response to expected changes in product demand. As in Section B
above, though, the imposition of adjustment costs makes the employer
less likely to change employment in response to a particular shift
                                      11
-in product demand, and reduces the size of adjustments that do
occur. These costs also represent an increase in total cost per

worker, leading firms to reduce average employment over the cycle.
      If wages do not equal productivity, the imposition of this

regulation will lead to changes in relative employment by seniority.
In the short run the work force will clearly become more senior; but
with the regulation the cost of employing more senior workers rises
relative to that of more junior workers, especially in those firms
whose product demand is more variable. This change in relative
costs leads employers to undertake policies, such as a flattening of

the wage—tenure profile, that eventually change the quit—tenure
relationship and raise the ratio of junior to senior employees.

Even if no layoffs ever occur, the possibility of layoffs being
conducted under inverse seniority, coupled with the systematic
departure of wage rates from productivity, induces employers to seek
a less senior work force.

      This point applies equally well to other restrictions on
layoffs that differ by seniority. If restrictions are imposed on
laying off more senior workers, employers will seek to substitute
junior for senior workers by changing wage structures to alter the

quit—tenure relationship. Conversely, if junior workers are

protected, employers will try to steepen wage—tenure profiles and
induce senior workers to remain on the job longer. Any restriction
on severing members of a particular group of employees will lead
employers to hire other groups of workers in preference to them.'
      A second potential cost of adjustment is the requirement that
information about planned changes in labor demand be made public.

them to change any decisions that affect the extent to which they
are tied to their current employers. Investment in firm—
specific training will be reduced so that the stock of firm—specific
human capital will be smaller than otherwise at the time the layoff
occurs (Hamermeshq 1987). The rcduced investment will increase
workers' likelihood a-f quitting for the discrepancy between their
current wage and their alternative wages elsewhere will be reduced.

Ta the extent that workers do not anticipate layoffs or plant

closings well requirements of openness about them         will   induce a

more rapid reallocation of labor to expanding industries. However,
those workers with the greatest past investment in training specific
to the firm (and to the industry, if the entire industry is

endangered) may act on the information by seeking governmental
protection for their employers; with greater specific investment
public requirements of notification are more likely to lead to

increased voice rather than more rapid exit.

investment, the firm's profits will decline still more rapidly than
in the absence of the requirement, assuming the government does not
try to protect the firm. lsa if, as I assumed above, the
difference between wages and productivity rises with tenure, the
firm    will    be left with an increasingly older stock of workers as the

date of layoff or plant closing approaches Under the assumptions

layoffs occur or the plant closest

D. Partial Coverage
         The discussion has assumed that each particular job—security
policy applies uniformly to all workers and firms (This assumption
has been implic:it in our use          of a typical   firm as the focus c-f

analysis)            [n reality, though, the policies do not apply equally to
all employees in a firm, all firms in an industry or all industries
in    the   economy. Most are characterized by partial coverage, which
changes their impact on the economy and allows room for their net

wages in that sector can fall to absorb the increased supply. The
policy of partial coverage thus leads to a reduction in the size of
•the covered sector and an expansion in the uncovered sector. This
kind of two—tier policy gives employers a continuing incentive to
substitute unprotected for protected workers and to contract
services out to firms in the unprotected sector.
        Partial coverage also affects the propensity of covered

workers to quit their protected Jobs. Since these jobs must be
rationed (because of the supply of uncovered workers seeking them),
incumbents are less likely to quit, for the alternative is a lower—

payingj insecure job in the uncovered sector. Obversely, those in
the uncovered sector have an increased probability of quitting, for
the lower wage rates there combine with the attraction of protected
jobs to induce more turnover. The economy—wide impact on turnover

of job—security policies involving partial coverage is unclear.
             III.   Analysis of Job Security Provisions
        In this section 1 pigeonhole a variety of policies that have
been undertaken to promote job security. While the set examined is
by no means exhaustive, it is sufficiently representative to provide
indications of how other policies might be categorized in light of

the theoretical discussion.     I discuss the policies in the order in

which the various types of costs were considered in Section II.

A.   Policies Affecting Fixed Costs
        In the United Kingdom and the   FRG a number of industries have

collectively negotiated a ouaranteed oeriodic oavment (Gennard,
1979, pp. 43, 51). Such a policy converts an hourly, variable cost
into a fixed cost exactly like those we discussed in Section II.A.

after some amount of overtime hours used         (If the ban were total
the c:ivertirne penalty would be infinite for even the first hour c-f
overtime work. > Assuming the limit is effective (the -Firm would
otherwise have used more overtime) this pci IL ' offsets -fIxed
employment costs and induces firms to substitute workers for haurs
      Shorter workweeks have been introduced in several countries
recently Thus France chaned the standard workweek to 39 hours in
1982. The c-f fect of such chariQcs is uncl ear it depends as we saw
in Section II.A., on the distribution c-f current employees by the
amount c-f hours worked per week. Many governments offer subsidies
to short-ti me work as in Japan where only reductions of entire
days are subsi di zed or in the FRG France anc:t ltd y where
reductions in hours generally are encouraged (Gennard 1985) Suc:h
policies lower the pricE:' cf workers relative to hours and provide an
incentive to substi tute addi t I onal workers -for 1 anger workweeks.
B.      Policies Affecting Adjustment Costs
          The   1.965 Redundanc:y Payments Act in the Uni ted Kingdom offered
workers lump—sum payments i -f they were i nvo] untar i 1 y severed through
no -F      t of their own payments that, were i n some c:asczs ton:'ped up
                                             16
by coliectively-neç1otiated plans (Gennard i979     pp 41 6) Such
provi si crs represent adjustment costs in whi c:h the averane cost i s
probably constant. If SOq the policy will inhibit layoff I:i...t. will
ensure that any 1 ayoffs that do c:ccur are lumped together. In
addi ti on the imposition of redundancy pay will i nhi bi t   eipl ayers

from expandinci empi oyment when product demand rises arid wi Ii. result
in       employment on average. Most, redundancy payments e g.
     lower

those created through collective negoti at ion i rr some German
ndust.rjes (Gennard 1979 p          increase with years of serv:Lce.
i-f the more seni or workers are no more productive than junior
workers the ratio of their cost to thei. r productivity relative to
that of junior workers rises. This will induce employers to
substitute toward more junior workers.
       The United Kingdom's Temporary Employment Subsidy provided
fixed payments to employers   who agreed to forego laying off
employees who would otherwise have been discharged (Gennard 19795

p. 31); Sweden offers training subsidies linked to workers' wage

rates to employers who forego layoffs (McKersie—Senenbergerq 1983)
These policies bsidize retention of workers and thus implicitly
raise the relative cost of adjustment As such, firms are less
likely to vary employment over the cycle. However because           labor
costs are subsidized, employment expands beyond what it otherwise
would have been in those firms that qualify for the subsidy.          In

that sense, the policy can be viewed as a cost reduction       in
declining    industries
       These policies are aimed particularly at collective layoffs

A host of specific policies designed to protect against unfair
                                         17
dismissals of individuals has arisen         in Western Europe. Most
(Gerinard   1985) define fair dismissal in terms only of a worker's
conduct and provide for appeals to courts or labor tribunals. To

some extent these policies do raise the cost of workers relative to
hours and thus tend to reduce employment—hours ratios. They are
thouchq explicitly related to adJustment. and as such they induce
the effects that we noted in Section II.B.
       In the past several years there has been some loosening of the

policies that have raised adjustment costs, bath an collective
layoffs and individual dismissals. For example, the FF<S in 198
increased the fraction of the work force scheduled far layoff before
the provisions of protective legislation become effective and
exempted new firms from        the legislation       entirely.   Spain in 1980
reduced   the amount of redundancy payments required to be awarded to
workers   laid off because of economic factors (Gennard 1985). There
has  al sc:' been a general loosening of the restrictions on individual
diSmissals to allow the invocation of economic necessity as a
.j usti. f i cati on f or such layoffs, 411 these changes reduce the
impacts we noted above: They make adjustments more likely than
under the more rigid leqislation and they increase average
empl oyment in the sectors covered by the 1 eqi sl at ion.
C. Policies That Produce Indirect Costs

       Lff       by_inverse senioriti     characterizes      most collect:ive
agreements in the United States and the United Kingdom. In the FRG,
France and Italy legislation requires that length o-f service and

employment fluctuations is, as I showed in Section II, unclear *

priori. Assume, however, that they impose costs on the employer
because they impose a different ordering from the (private) cost—

minimizing ordering that the employer would choose. If so, they
induce all the short— and long—run effects on employment, wage
structures and mobility that were discussed in Section II.C. Most

important in terms of aggregate employment, they reduce cyclical
fluctuations, and also reduce average levels of employment.
      Limits or bans on hiring have been introduced through
collective negotiations in the Berman steel industry and elsewhere

(Bennard, 1979, pp. 63, 72). Assuming that employers would hire
workers into some jobs while discharging them from others, such a
ban represents an additional adjustment cost. It will reduce
employment fluctuations while raising labor costs, thus reducing the
average amount of labor demanded.

      Prenotification of impending plant closings or major layoffs
must be provided to governments and/or employee representatives in a
number of OECD countries. In the United Kingdom, Italy and the FRG
prenotification must be given to certain workers even in cases of

impending individual dismissals. All such requirements operate as
indicated in Section lIt They affect the speed with which
adjustments take place, the willingness of firms to invest in new

capital equipment and of workers and firms to invest in training,
and the mobility patterns of workers in the affected firms.

D. The Partial Coverage of Jab—Security Legislation
      A   wide variety of restrictions in the various provisions of
job—security legislation make that legislation conform to the model
                                        19
of partial coverage that was outlined in Section II.D. For

example:     1) Canada is considering requiring that part—time
employees (those working more than 20 hours per week) be covered by

pensions (effectively decreasing problems that arise from partial
coverage of protective legislation);'° 2) Exemptions from job—
security legislation exist for workers and firms that do not meet
various criteria (Gennard, 1985). Thus in the United Kingdom claims
of unfair dismissal are not allowed for employees with less than two

years of seniority. The seniority requirement is even more
stringent for part—time employees. In Italy some of the legislation
excludes employers of fewer     than 35 workers, while in the FRG
employers of fewer than 5 workers are excluded from employment
protection legislation generally; 3) In Germany and Italy
prenotification requirements are much more stringent for white— than
for blue—collar workers.
         To the   extent that employers can   substitute part— for full—
time workers exemptions will result in an expansion of the part—time.
work force. Similarly, they should favor the relative expansion of
smaller enterprises, especially in those sectors in which economies
of   scale do not exist or are not very substantial. Indeed, to the
extent   that substitution by employers and consumers is possible,

                             job—security legislation may have
exemptions from the panoply of

created the beginning of two—tier societies, one with rigid job—
security   requirements covering high—paid, senior, full—time workers
in large firms, the other more flexible, with part—time, low—paid,

contract because of the imposed rigidity, while the low—paid tier
will expand.                              20

second strand tries to measure cost structures and, in most cases,
to    examine how they affect    employers' demands for civerti me

         Recent   evidence from standard labor—demand equations on this
issue is quite mixed Fr          U. S. manufacturinc,    i9é-—1981 II, Rossana
(1983) estimates a                      for hours as a function of
                       model of the demand

employment levels, measures of output and orders, and real wages.
This type of model is insp:ired, as are similar models discussed in

this Section, by Nadiri--Rosen (1969). The estimates suggest that
for   each 10—percent long—run increase in employment there is a

percent drop in hours per worker           Similar equati crs in Rossana

(198) estimated using monthly U.S. data far 1959—19826 over six
two—digit SIC industries find no significant effect of the stock of

employees on the dcmand 'for hours.. Somewhat perplexing, though,
sinc::e they imply an asymmetry, equations describing employment
demand for the same industries mostly show a small but significant
psiUve effect of hours per' worker on the demand far' workers..
However since the hours and employment equations were not estimated
jointly, this          asymmetry may be a  result of the estimation techni que
(or    perhaps of       a specific:ation having little grounding in
rnicroec:onomic: theory).. Yamamoto (1982) finds negative effects of
employment on hours per worker and vice—versa using quarterly data
for Japanese manufacturing from 1970—1978..                        Howeverq the sample
period is quite short so it is unclear whether these really

represent long—run relationships..
         One    study on U..S.. data using similar                models but decomposing
output changes into permanent and transitory coinpanents estimates
the si z e o-f    an   hours—employment trade—off using data on overt i me
hours    (Craw+ord 1979)..            For manufacturing 1958—1976 (monthly), it

finds a small but significant positive relationship between
employment levels and the demand for hours.. Comparing this result

to those cited above it seems quite clear that this approach
provides little evidence of a long—run trade—off between employment
and    normal    hours,    I e..    of    whether hours and employment are
substitutes or complements. This may be because such                           a trade—off
truly does       not   exist       Evi derice   + or the        very   long run suggests hours

per    week are determined mainly by workers' preferences, not by
product i on technol c:gy          (see   Hmermesh--Rees, 1984) ..          However,   insofar
as these studies do not.            even attempt to measure the relative costs
of    hours and workers, their' lack of cvi dence is                     not. too critical
                                                      ._)   ,
      Several studies of the demand + or overtime hours have attempted

to divide employment costs into fixed and variable components.

Their choice of data allows for much greater variability in the
underlying marginal costs of employment and hours, and thus at least

makes it possible to measure the extent of substitution of
employment for hours. The three analyses for the U.S. summarized in
Ehrenberg—Schumann (1982) and that study itself all suggest that
higher fixed costs of employment do reduce the long—run employment—
hours ratio. ln all these studies, though, the trade—of fs are quite
smalls A one—third increase in the relative cost of an hour of
overtime would produce no more than a 4 percent decline in the ratio
of overtime to other hours. A somewhat larger effect is produced

for West Germany using time—series data, 1964—1983, by Iconig—
Pohlmeier (1996;.

      Using annual data, 1951—1981, for West Germany, Hart—Kawasaki

(1986) decompose payments to labor, particularly payroll taxes, into
fixed and variable measures and examine their effects on employment
and hours. Their model treats hours, employment and the capital
stock as jointly determined by their lagged values, fixed and
variable payroll taxes, output, nonwage fixed and variable labor
costs, and capital costs. The authors find surprisingly that a cut
in the payroll—tax ceiling in a tax structure with a high ceiling

relative to the average wage level increases employment and reduces
hours per worker. They attribute this perverse result to their use
of a model that includes both capital and labor. Hart—Kawasaki
(1986) also produce the expected finding that decreased variable

payroll taxes reduce the employment/hours ratio.
                                      23
        While the evidence seems fairly clear that an increase in the

fixed costs of employment induces only slight substitution away from
workers and toward hours, holding total worker—hours constant, that
does not mean the negative employment effects of job—security

policies that impose fixed employment costs are small. Elsewhere
(Hamermesh, 1986) I have summarized an immense body of evidence on
the elasticity of labor demand with respect to labor costs. The
overwhelming bulk of studies that use modern estimation techniques
finds that the net (including all adjustments among firms) long—run

constant—output labor—demand elasticity characterizing broad
aggregates of industries is between .1 and .5. The total
elasticity, which allows for scale effects, is larger still. That
being the case, policies that increase the fixed costs of employment
may reduce the employment—hours ratio only slightly, but can effect
substantial reductions in the total amount of worker—hours employed.
B.    Adjustment Casts and Lagged Labor Demand
        There is a huge mass of empirical evidence demonstrating that
the demand for workers and hours lags behind output. Moreover, the
lags in the adjustment of employment are greater than those in the

adjustment of hours per worker. Hamermesh (1976) summarizes a large
number of early studies demonstrating this fact. More recent
evidence corroborates this conclusion in more carefully specified
models. Using a model like that of Nadiri—Rosen (1969), but

decomposing changes in product demand into expected and unexpected
components, Topel (1982) suggests a similar conclusion based on data
for   1958—1975 for six U.S. manufacturing industries. For the
automobile industry Chang (1983) demonstrates this both for the
                                       24
United States and for the state of Michigan..
       The averane length of the lags of employment and hours behind
output changes is not so closely determined as are their rd at i ye
1 encths. However the cvi dence sumrnar I ed I n Hamermesh (1976)
suiests that. near-i y all the adjustment is compi eted i thin one
year.     Recent studies of the FRG   and   Franc:e (Bucher, 1984) using
si ml icr techn ques produce similar results. Early studies on
aggregate    U.S. data (Sargent 197Grn and Meese      1980)   that paid close
attention to the structure of expectations and its implications for
error terms in the estimating equations found very long lags c-f
employment behind output (average length over        one year>    These may
well be artifacts of the estimating procedure        rather than reversals
of previous evidence. More recently Shapiro (1986) has employed a

dynamic expectational model of the adjustment of production iabor
nonproduction labor and capital that suggests that adjustment lags
for workers exceed those for hours per workerq and that the lags are

not very long.      It seems safe to conclude that the lags in adjusting
labor inputs are fairly short.

        Theoretical work underlying the estimation of lagged factor
adjustment rests on the theory of adjustment costs., in most cases on

these costs has not. been demonstrated.. However, Morrison—Berndt

(1981) use annual US. data for 1952-1971 to show that the

adjustment   of   nonproduction worker employment to chanes in output
demand is much     slower than that of production workers. (ssuming
that    adjustment costs are quadraticq Shapiro (1986) infers that they

        ssuming that the lags arise from adjustment costs there is
some evidence that these costs are asymmetric. Hamermesh (1969)

rapidly   than that of employment declines. What this finding implies
about potential asymmetries in the effects of job—security policies
is unclear without a specification of how those policies affect

adjustment c:osts.

        The short-run effects of specific policies have received very
little serious empirical attention. Nickell (1979) examined British

manufacturing data 195—1976 and found that the lag in employment
rose during this periods while the lag in hours declined. He
attributed these changes to the increased requirements of job—
security policies. More recently Nickell (1982) showed that between
1967 and 1977 an i rjc:rease             in the use      of unfaa r dismissal legislation

caused a reduction in both hiring and flows from employment with
the   latter   dominating (so that the net effect was a reducti on in

unemployment). For the United States Hamermesh (1978) showed that

expansi c:n    of the   unemployment insurance program which is financed

concentrate on determining whether                and      how the rate o-f adjustment to
changes in produc:t demand changed in the 1970s from what it had been
earlier. We have seen that               many   countries adopted policies during
the 1970s that were desinnec:I to slow the adjustment o-f empi oyrnent to
output shoc:ks.          At. the same time though, we know that. large
i ncreases occurred the price c-f energy which is a p—substi tute + or
labor. These changes may also have altered the lag structure in
empi oyment---output and hours—output rd ati ors (though there is no a
pri reason to believe this happened). All we can test,
therefore, is whether or not changes in lag structures occurred.
      For each country with available data an integrated vector—
autoregression model was estimated for the manufacturing sector:
(3)              = aY— + EbQ- ct +
where a, b and c are parameters; V is the dependent variable (in
logarithms) Q is the logarithm of output; t is a time trend and E
is a di sturbance term. The dependent variable V is either
emp]. oyment or total hours worked. For all couritri es the 'earl yU
time period ended in 1973 III and the lat.e' time period began with
1973:IV. This break point is. chosen to coincide with the first oil
shock. Obviously the timing of the impacts of job—security policies
differs in different c:ountries, and it would he more appropriate to
                                                        z.. p
search for structural changes in each country separately. Failing
that, we follow standard practice and use the oil shock to demarcate

the point at which the structure may have changed. For most
countries the initial observation in the early period is 1961:1, and
the final observation in the late time period is 19851j1ta
      The results of estimating equation (5) are shown in Table 1.
In addition to the usual coefficients and t—statistics, the table
also shows: The chi—square statistic on the likelihood—ratio test
for including the vector of four terms in        i0,...,3; Durbin's
(1970) h—statistic, distributed n(0,1)p and the estimated average
lag of adjustment of the dependent variable to an output shock. For
the six large countries the estimates are fairly satisfactory,
though there is some tendency for the h—statistic to reject the null

hypothesis of no serial correlation in the employment equations.
The average lag of employment adjustment in the six large countries
exceeds that of hours adjustment in eleven out   of   the twelve pairs

of equations estimated. Among the six smaller countries the
estimates are either less precise (Greece and Finland) or imply lags
of ridiculous length (Ireland).
      Recognizing that the application of a common specification to

data from a large number of economies will produce some anomalies,
it is still worthwhile examining common trends in the results. The
numbers without parentheses in Table 2 (from which Ireland is
excluded because the estimated lags made no sense) are totals

including only the six large countries, while those in parentheses
include all eleven countries. Considering only the employment—
output equations (the last line of the table), there is a tendency

samples of fairly junior workers (Bishop—Stephenson, 1982, and
Brown, 1983) suggests that productivity increases with seniority at
least over the initial years of an employment relation; and evidence
on a sample that allows a direct measure of productivity (Maranto—
Rodgers, 1984) indicates that seniority and productivity are
positively related. The best conclusion at this point is that there
is a positive relation between seniority and productivity, but that
it may not be so strong as the wage—seniority relation.

      There is remarkably little evidence on the employment effects

of specific policies that attempt to prevent layoffs by changing
indirect costs. Metcalf (1984) used cross—section British data on
industries to show that the Temporary Employment Subsidy succeeded

in reducing permanent layoffs. (His results also showed     that   short—
time compensation increased layoffs, a result that is hard to
credit.)   As we saw in Section IV.B., Nickell (1982) demonstrated a
similar effect of unfair dismissal legislation in the U.K. The
difficulties with broad—brush empirical work that uses gross
measures in aggregate time—series equations to estimate the effects
of complex policies are by now well known. It seems clear that
serious evaluation of policies that affect indirect costs will
require both more detailed specification of the programs' parameters
and use of more disaggregated data. At this point we simply have
very little information on the employment effects of anti—layoff
programs that operate by affecting costs indirectly.
      If markets worked   well,   in the sense that information was
good, there would be little need for many of the programs

restricting employers' rights to lay off workers. For example, if
                                         30
workers kncw that a permanent               layoff is :imperidinq they will reduce
i. nvestment    in + i   rm—speci   fi c capital to the poi nt where its value
j 1 1 be zero      when the layoff occurs. The cvi derce (Hamermesh               1987)
indiL:ate       however     that substantial firm—specific investment still
takes   place    immediately before the           layoff1   implying that workers
in-formation     about i mpendi rig     layoffs    is not very good. This    in   turn
suggests    that    requiring       prenotification    of layoffs   can prevent
useless investment in firm—specific capital arid can aid adjustment
by enc:ouraging workers to substitute general training that will make
subsequent 3Db search easier.                Indeed, cvi dence for a particular

labor market (Foibre et a1 1984) and for a nationwide sample of
workers     (Addison—F'ortuqal. 1986) indicates that prenotification does
reduce the costs of dislocation.

D. Partial Coverage——Substitution of Unprotected for                  Protected
         Workers
            have been no studies of whether protective legislation
        There

covering only part of a economy has induced a rel aU ye expansion of
the uncovered sector. However some impressionistic evidence does

exist     and there have been a few             studies that allow us to infer the
extent to whi ch substi tut.          ion   between the types of workers who are

protected      and unprotected is possible. l 1 the evidence suggests
that partial cc:iverage produces substantial substi tuti on away from
empi oyment in the covered sector.     Gennard (1985) argues that

          The    major purpose of this discussion has been to analyze how
Job—security pa]. iries affect labor costs. Simple time—series or
c:rass—secti on regressions that I nd ucla the cxi stance or magnitude a-f

e:xpendi tures under a particular prc:nram c:annot. yield any useful
information about its a-f facts Those depend in a camp 1 cx way an how
the prociram affects c:osts; and, as we have seen, the paths through
which costs may h= changed are quite di verse. They include possible
a-f-f acts on the empi ciyrsent—hours rat I a, rn employment adjustment and
on the level of total labor input, through their effects on average
labor cc ;ts,
          The cvi dance e.ucigests there is a short—run trada—of+ between
empl oyment and hours per worker, but that. in the Long run pal i c . es

have only a el. I nht i mpac:t on em:1 oyment .                           They do, however, a-f-f act
the magni tucle c::+ adjustments I n ampi oyment in respc:nsE' to changes in
product demand. When average labor costs are changed by job—

security policies, average levels of employment demand will change
through the standard routes of capital—labor substitution and scale

effects. Not all job—security policies impose costs that reduce
total labor demands To the extent that policies provide information
that functions as a public good (such as prenotification of

impending layoffs), they may increase labor—market efficiency.
However, the role of job—security policies in reducing total worker—
hours, should not be ignored: Studies that are relevant to
assessing the impact of job—security policies on the mix of
employment and hours are not conclusive, but those that allow us
infer their effects on total worker—hours are.
      The discussion in Section IV makes it apparent how little we

know about how job—security programs in general affect labor costs,
and what the impacts of particular policies have been. The few
studies of job—security policies that were enacted in the
industrialized countries during the 1970s and early 1980s do suggest
they achieved their aims, but at the expense of reducing total
worker—hours in protected employment. Better evidence is provided
by studies of the impact of labor costs more generally: These
suggest that the policies could have produced some short—run

increase in employment. Given the lengths of lags in adjustment,
though, the evidence indicates that it is unlikely they induced a
substitution of employment for hours that lasted beyond several
years. Moreover, to the extent that they raised labor costs, as
most did, they contributed to a decline in total worker—hours
through the elasticity of demand for labor services.
                                      33
      The discussion of   the   theory of labor costs and the evidence

on it imply that job—security policies can induce a temporary
substitution of employment for hours, and can permanently mitigate
short—run employment fluctuations ———    both decreases and increases
in employment. They accomplish this at the cost of reducing the
equilibrium level of labor input and of output. They thus offer an
industrialized economy a choice between greater employment stability
(with fewer total hours worked on average) and greater employment
fluctuations Cwith more total hours worked on average). Moreover,
to the extent they cover only part of the labor market, they help
create a two-tier labor market consisting of secure Jobs in a

declining sector and insecure Jobs in an expanding sector.

        Let the firm maximize:



(1)            [F(L) - wL -            C(L)] ertdt


where L =       labor        input, w =      cost   per unit of labor services, r is the firm's

discount rate, C(L) is the adjustment cost, and I have assumed labor is the

only input in a production function F, with F' > 0, F'' < 0. Assume that the

marginal cost of adjustment can be increasing and in particular that. C is

quadratic:



(2)         C(L) =      at   + bL2     ,
                                           a > 0, b         0



(The marginal cost of adjustment is then 2bL +                      a.)   The Euler equation

describing the firm's profit—maximizing path is:



(3)         2bL — 2brL +         F'(L)     — w —   ra   =       0




where L denotes d2L/dt2.

        If b > 0, the steady state is described by L = L = 0 and L* such that:


                *
(14)    F'(L        )   =w   +   ra.


(This is the standard marginal—productivity condition for labor demand, with
                                                                                         *
the user—cost of adjustment added.) Assume that the firm has L = L0                          at

t =    0,    and that w increases. The new equilibrium is shown as L* in Figure


                                                        —   40 —
A.l. The line along which L = 0 is negatively sloped, for as L increases in
                                                           *     *
(3), F'(L) decreases, as must L. The adjustment path from    to L is

indicated by the arrow. A similar analysis applies if the firm begins

at L1, and is then shocked at t = 0 by a wage decrease.

       If b = 0, the marginal cost of adjustment is constant in L, and (4) holds

for all t.     Thus any change in w causes the firm to adjust instantaneously to

the new L* that satisfies (4). That this is true when b = 0, but adjustment

is slow when b > 0, shows that a more rapid increase in the marginal cost

as L increases reduces the rate of adjustment. A higher marginal cost of

adjustment--a--reduces L*, as does a higher discount rate. Employment on

average is lower where adjustment costs are greater.

       That greater adjustment costs reduce employment fluctuations when shocks

occur can be seen by assuming the firm is in equilibrium at t =                       0, given w0,
and that w changes temporarily to w1 for some known period of time, T. The

maximand (1) becomes:



(1')       [F(L) -        - aL   -   bL] e_rtdt +      [F(L) -         -   aL   -   bL} e_rt
                     w1                                          w0



Since the firm's adjustment is slower when b is greater, the shock to w will

result in a smaller movement away from L0 by t = T than if b were smaller. If

b = 0 the firm will choose either to maintain L =                     for all t, or to jump
                                                             L0
to L1 at t =    0, then jump back to L0 at t = T.          With constant marginal

adjustment costs the fluctuation will be the same size if it occurs; but the

employer's willingness to vary L at all decreases as a is larger.
