                                            ABSTRACT

We examine the concerns that new technologies will render labor redundant in a framework in
which tasks previously performed by labor can be automated and new versions of existing tasks,
in which labor has a comparative advantage, can be created. In a static version where capital is
fixed and technology is exogenous, automation reduces employment and the labor share, and may
even reduce wages, while the creation of new tasks has the opposite effects. Our full model
endogenizes capital accumulation and the direction of research towards automation and the
creation of new tasks. If the long-run rental rate of capital relative to the wage is sufficiently low,
the long-run equilibrium involves automation of all tasks. Otherwise, there exists a stable
balanced growth path in which the two types of innovations go hand-in-hand. Stability is a
consequence of the fact that automation reduces the cost of producing using labor, and thus
discourages further automation and encourages the creation of new tasks. In an extension with
heterogeneous skills, we show that inequality increases during transitions driven both by faster
automation and introduction of new tasks, and characterize the conditions under which inequality
is increasing or stable in the long run.

1    Introduction
The accelerated automation of tasks performed by labor raises concerns that new technologies will
make labor redundant (e.g., Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2012, Akst, 2014, Autor, 2015). The recent
declines in the labor share in national income and the employment to population ratio in the U.S.
(e.g., Karabarbounis and Neiman, 2014, and Oberfield and Raval, 2014) are often interpreted as
supporting evidence for the claims that, as digital technologies, robotics and artificial intelligence
penetrate the economy, workers will find it increasingly difficult to compete against machines, and
their compensation will experience a relative or even absolute decline. Yet, we lack a comprehensive
framework incorporating such effects, as well as potential countervailing forces.
    The need for such a framework stems not only from the importance of understanding how and
when automation will transform the labor market, but also from the fact that similar claims have
been made, but have not always come true, about previous waves of new technologies. Keynes
famously foresaw the steady increase in per capita income during the 20th century from the in-
troduction of new technologies, but incorrectly predicted that this would create widespread tech-
nological unemployment as machines replaced human labor (Keynes, 1930). In 1965, economic
historian Robert Heilbroner confidently stated that “as machines continue to invade society, du-
plicating greater and greater numbers of social tasks, it is human labor itself—at least, as we now
think of ‘labor’—that is gradually rendered redundant”(quoted in Akst, 2014). Wassily Leontief
was equally pessimistic about the implications of new machines. By drawing an analogy with the
technologies of the early 20th century that made horses redundant, in an interview he speculated
that “Labor will become less and less important. . . More and more workers will be replaced by
machines. I do not see that new industries can employ everybody who wants a job”(The New York
Times, 1983).
    This paper is a first step in developing a conceptual framework to study how machines re-
place human labor and why this might (or might not) lead to lower employment and stagnant
wages. Our main conceptual innovation is to propose a unified framework in which tasks previ-
ously performed by labor are automated, while at the same time other new technologies complement
labor—specifically, in our model this takes the form of the introduction of new tasks in which labor
has a comparative advantage. Herein lies our answer to Leontief’s analogy: the difference between
human labor and horses is that humans have a comparative advantage in new and more complex
tasks. Horses did not. If this comparative advantage is sufficiently important and the creation of
new tasks continues, employment and the labor share can remain stable in the long run even in the
face of rapid automation.
    The importance of these new tasks is well illustrated by the technological and organizational
changes during the Second Industrial Revolution, which not only involved the replacement of the
stagecoach by the railroad, sailboats by steamboats, and of manual dock workers by cranes, but also
the creation of new labor-intensive tasks. These tasks generated jobs for a new class of engineers,
machinists, repairmen, conductors, back-office workers and managers involved with the introduction


                                                  1
and operation of new technologies (e.g., Landes, 1969, Chandler, 1977, and Mokyr, 1990).
       Today, while industrial robots, digital technologies and computer-controlled machines replace la-
bor, we are again witnessing the emergence of new tasks ranging from engineering and programming
functions to those performed by audio-visual specialists, executive assistants, data administrators
and analysts, meeting planners and computer support specialists. Indeed, during the last 30 years,
new tasks and new job titles account for a large fraction of U.S. employment growth. To document
this fact, we use data from Lin (2011) to measure the share of new job titles—in which workers per-
form newer tasks than those employed in more traditional jobs—within each occupation. In 2000,
about 70% of computer software developers (an occupation employing one million people at the
time) held new job titles. Similarly, in 1990 radiology technician and in 1980 management analyst
were new job titles. Figure 1 shows that for each decade since 1980, employment growth has been
greater in occupations with more new job titles. The regression line indicates that occupations with
10 percentage points more new job titles at the beginning of each decade grow 5.05% faster over
the next 10 years (standard error=1.3%). From 1980 to 2007, total employment in the U.S. grew
by 17.5%. About half (8.84%) of this growth is explained by the additional employment growth in
occupations with new job titles relative to a benchmark category with no new job titles.1

       We start with a static model in which capital is fixed and technology is exogenous. There are
two types of technological changes: the automation of existing tasks and the introduction of new
tasks in which labor has a comparative advantage. Our static model provides a rich but tractable
framework to study how automation and the creation of new tasks impact factor prices, factor

Survey. Additional information on the data and our sample is provided in Appendix B, where we also document in
detail the robustness of the relationship depicted in Figure 1.



                                                                                                       2
shares in national income and employment. Automation allows firms to substitute capital for tasks
previously performed by labor, while the creation of new tasks enables the replacement of old tasks
by new variants in which labor has a higher productivity. In contrast to the more commonly-used
models featuring factor-augmenting technologies, here automation always reduces the labor share
and employment, and may even reduce wages. Conversely, the creation of new tasks increases
wages, employment and the labor share. These comparative statics follow because factor prices are
determined by the range of tasks performed by capital and labor, and exogenous shifts in technology
alter the range of tasks performed by each factor (see also Acemoglu and Autor, 2011).
   We then embed this framework in a dynamic economy in which capital accumulation is en-
dogenous, and we characterize restrictions under which the model delivers balanced growth with
automation and creation of new tasks—which we take to be a good approximation to economic
growth in the United States and the United Kingdom over the last two centuries. The key restric-
tions are that there is exponential productivity growth from the creation of new tasks and that
the two types of technological changes—automation and the creation of new tasks—advance at
equal rates. A critical difference from our static model is that capital accumulation responds to
permanent shifts in technology in order to keep the interest rate and hence the rental rate of capital
constant. As a result, the dynamic effects of technology on factor prices depend on the response of
capital accumulation as well. The response of capital ensures that the productivity gains from both
automation and the introduction of new tasks fully accrue to labor (the relatively inelastic factor).
Although the real wage in the long run increases because of this productivity effect, automation
always reduces the labor share.
   Our full model endogenizes the rates of improvement of these two types of technologies by mar-
rying our task-based framework with a directed technological change setup. This full version of the
model remains tractable and allows a complete characterization of balanced growth paths. If the
long-run rental rate of capital is very low relative to the wage, there will not be sufficient incen-
tives to create new tasks, and the long-run equilibrium involves full automation—akin to Leontief’s
“horse equilibrium”. Otherwise, however, the long-run equilibrium involves balanced growth based
on equal advancement of the two types of technologies. Under natural assumptions, this (inte-
rior) balanced growth path is stable, so that when automation runs ahead of the creation of new
tasks, market forces induce a slowdown in subsequent automation and more rapid countervailing
advances in the creation of new tasks. This stability result highlights a crucial new force: a wave
of automation pushes down the effective cost of producing with labor, discouraging further efforts
to automate additional tasks and encouraging the creation of new tasks.
   The stability of the balanced growth path implies that periods in which automation runs ahead
of the creation of new tasks tend to trigger self-correcting forces, and as a result, the labor share
and employment stabilize and may even return to their initial levels. Whether or not this is the
case depends on the reason why automation paced ahead in the first place. If this is caused by
the random arrival of a series of automation technologies, the long-run equilibrium takes us back
to the same initial levels of employment and labor share. If, on the other hand, automation surges


                                                  3
because of a change in the innovation possibilities frontier (making automation easier relative to
the creation of new tasks), the economy will tend towards a new balanced growth path with lower
levels of employment and labor share. In neither case does rapid automation necessarily bring
about the demise of labor.2
       We also consider three extensions of our model. First, we introduce heterogeneity in skills, and
assume that skilled labor has a comparative advantage in new tasks, which we view as a natural
assumption.3 Because of this pattern of comparative advantage, automation directly takes jobs
away unskilled labor who specialize in lower-indexed tasks and thus increases inequality, while new
tasks directly benefit skilled workers and at first increase inequality as well. However, we also show
that standardization of new tasks over time tends to help low-skill workers. This extension thus
formalizes the intuitive idea that both automation and the creation of new tasks increase inequality
in the short run, but also points out that standardization may limit the increase in inequality, and
characterizes the conditions under which this force is sufficient to restore stable inequality in the
long run. Our second extension modifies our baseline patent structure and reintroduces the creative
destruction of the profits of previous innovators, which is absent in our main model, though it is
often assumed in the endogenous growth literature. The results in this case are similar, but the
conditions for uniqueness and stability of the balanced growth path are more demanding. Finally,
we study the efficiency properties of the process of automation and creation of new technologies,
and point to a new source of inefficiency leading to excessive automation: when the wage rate is
above the opportunity cost of labor (due to labor market frictions), firms will choose automation
to save on labor costs, while the social planner, taking into account the lower opportunity cost of
labor, would have chosen less automation.
       Our paper can be viewed as a combination of task-based models of the labor market with di-
rected technological change models.4 Task-based models have been developed both in the economic
growth and labor literatures, dating back at least to Roy’s (1955) seminal work. The first important
recent contribution, Zeira (1998), proposed a model of economic growth based on capital-labor sub-
stitution. Zeira’s model is a special case of our framework. Acemoglu and Zilibotti (2000) developed
a simple task-based model with endogenous technology and applied it to the study of productivity
differences across countries, illustrating the potential mismatch between new technologies and the
skills of developing economies (see also Zeira, 2006, Acemoglu, 2010). Autor, Levy and Murnane
(2003) suggested that the increase in inequality in the U.S. labor market reflects the automation
and computerization of routine, labor-intensive tasks.5 Our static model is most similar to Ace-
moglu and Autor (2011). Our full framework extends this model not only because of the dynamic
   2
     Yet, it is also possible that some changes in parameters can shift us away from the region of stability to the full
automation equilibrium.
   3
     This assumption builds on Schultz (1965) (see also Greenwood and Yorukoglu, 1997, Caselli, 1999, Galor and
Moav, 2000, Acemoglu, Gancia and Zilibotti, 2010, and Beaudry, Green and Sand, 2013).

     On directed technological change and related models, see Acemoglu (1998, 2002, 2003, 2007), Kiley (1999), Caselli
and Coleman (2006), Gancia (2003), Thoenig and Verdier (2003) and Gancia and Zilibotti (2010).

     Acemoglu and Autor (2011), Autor and Dorn (2013), Jaimovich and Siu (2014), Foote and Ryan (2014), Burstein
and Vogel (2012), and Burstein, Morales and Vogel (2014) provide various pieces of empirical evidence and quantitative
evaluations on the importance of the endogenous allocation of tasks to factors in recent labor market dynamics.

equilibrium incorporating capital accumulation and directed technological change, but also because
tasks are combined with a general elasticity of substitution, and because the equilibrium allocation
of tasks critically depends both on factor prices and the state of technology.6
       Three papers from the economic growth literature that are particularly related to our work are
Acemoglu (2003), Jones (2005), and Hemous and Olson (2015). The first two papers develop growth
models in which the aggregate production function is endogenous and, in the long run, adapts to
make balanced growth possible. In Jones (2005), this occurs because of endogenous choices about
different combinations of activities/technologies. In Acemoglu (2003), this long-run behavior is a
consequence of directed technological change in a model of factor-augmenting technologies. Our
task-based framework here is a significant departure from this model, especially since it enables us to
address questions related to automation, its impact on factor prices and its endogenous evolution. In
addition, our framework provides a more robust economic force ensuring the stability of the balanced
growth path: while in models with factor-augmenting technologies stability requires an elasticity
of substitution between capital and labor that is less than 1 (so that the more abundant factor
commands a lower share of national income), we do not need such a condition in this framework.7
Finally, Hemous and Olson (2015) develop a model of automation and horizontal innovation with
endogenous technology, and use it to study consequences of different types of technologies on
inequality. High wages (in their model for low-skill workers) encourage automation. But unlike
in our model, the unbalanced dynamics that this generates are not countered by other types of
innovations in the long run.8
       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents our task-based framework
in the context of a static economy. Section 3 introduces capital accumulation and clarifies the
conditions for balanced growth in this economy. Section 4 presents our full model with endogenous
technology and establishes, under some plausible conditions, the existence, uniqueness and stability
of a balanced growth path with two types of technologies advancing simultaneously. Section 5
considers the three extensions mentioned above. Section 6 concludes. Appendix A contains the
proofs of our main results, while Appendix B, which is not for publication, contains the remaining
proofs, some additional results and the details of the empirical analysis presented above.
   6
      Acemoglu and Autor’s model, like ours, is one in which a discrete number of labor types are allocated to a
continuum of tasks. Costinot and Vogel (2010) develop a complementary model in which there is a continuum of
skills and a continuum of tasks. See also the recent paper by Hawkins, Ryan and Oh (2015), which shows how a task-
based model is more successful than standard models in matching the co-movement of investment and employment
at the firm level.
    7
      The role of technologies replacing tasks in this result can be seen by noting that with factor-augmenting techno-
logical changes, the impact on relative factor prices is ambiguous and the direction of innovation may be dominated
by a strong market size effect (e.g., Acemoglu, 2002). Instead, in our model, the difference between factor prices
regulates the future path of technological change and thus generates a powerful force that ensures stability.
    8
      Kotlikoff and Sachs (2012) develop an overlapping generation model in which automation may have long-lasting
effects, but this is for a very different reason—automation reduces the earnings of current workers, and via this
channel, depresses their savings and capital accumulation.

2        Static Model
We start with a static version of our model with exogenous technology, which allows us to introduce
our main setup in the simplest fashion and characterize the impact of different types of technological
change on factor prices, employment and the labor share.

2.1       Environment

The economy produces a unique final good Y by combining a unit measure of tasks, y(i), with an
elasticity of substitution σ ∈ (0, ∞):
                                               Z    N                     σ−1
                                                                             σ
                                                                  σ−1
                                          e
                                       Y =B                y(i)    σ    di      ,                             (1)
                                                    N −1

      e > 0. All tasks and the final good are produced competitively. The fact that the limits of
where B
integration run between N − 1 and N imposes that the measure of tasks used in production always
remains at 1. A new (more complex) task replaces or upgrades the lowest-index task. Thus, an
increase in N represents the upgrading of the quality (productivity) of the unit measure of tasks.9
        Each task is produced by combining labor or capital with a task-specific intermediate q(i), which
embodies the technology used either for automation or for production with labor. To simplify the
exposition, we start by assuming that these intermediates are supplied competitively, and that they
can be produced using ψ units of the final good. Hence, they are also priced at ψ. In Section 4 we
relax this assumption and allow intermediate producers to make profits so as generate endogenous
incentives for innovation.
        All tasks can be produced with labor. We model the technological constraints on automation
by assuming that there exists I ∈ [N − 1, N ] such that tasks i ≤ I are technologically automated in
the sense that it is feasible to produce them with capital. Although tasks i ≤ I are technologically
automated, whether they will be produced with capital or not depends on relative factor prices
as we describe below. Conversely, tasks i > I are not technologically automated, and must be
produced with labor.
        The production function for tasks i > I takes the form
                                       h 1      ζ−1          1
                                                                            i ζ
                                                                         ζ−1 ζ−1
                            y(i) = B(ζ) η ζ q(i) ζ + (1 − η) ζ (γ(i)l(i)) ζ      ,                            (2)

where γ(i) denotes the productivity of labor in task i, ζ ∈ (0, ∞) is the elasticity of substitution
between intermediates and labor, η ∈ (0, 1) is the share parameter of this constant elasticity of
substitution (CES) production function, and B(ζ) is a constant included to simplify the algebra.
In particular, we set B(ζ) = ψ η (1 − η)η−1 η −η when ζ = 1 and B(ζ) = 1 otherwise.
    9
    This formulation imposes that once a new task is created at N it will be immediately utilized and replace the
lowest available task located at N − 1. This is ensured by Assumption 3 imposed below, and avoids the need for
additional notation at this point. We view newly-created tasks as higher productivity versions of existing tasks.
  We are also assuming that task i is not compatible and will not be used together with tasks i′ < i − 1 (see also
footnote 19).


                                                           6
       Tasks i ≤ I can be produced using labor or capital, and their production function is identical to
(2) except for the presence of capital and labor as perfectly substitutable factors of production:10

                                                                           i ζ
                                                                        ζ−1 ζ−1
                    y(i) = B(ζ) η q(i)
                                   ζ     ζ  + (1 − η) (k(i) + γ(i)l(i))

       Throughout, we impose the following assumption:

Assumption 1 γ(i) is strictly increasing

       Assumption 1 implies that labor has strict comparative advantage in tasks with a higher index,
and will guarantee that, in equilibrium, lower-indexed tasks will be automated, while higher-indexed
ones will be produced with labor.
       We model the demand side of the economy using a representative household with preferences
given by
                                          (Ce−ν(L) )1−θ − 1
                                          u(C, L) =         ,                            (4)
                                               1−θ
where C is consumption, L denotes the labor supply of the representative household, and ν(L)
designates the utility cost of labor supply, which we assume to be continuously differentiable,
increasing and convex, and to satisfy ν ′′ (L) + (θ − 1)(ν ′ (L))2 /θ > 0 (which ensures that u(C, L) is
concave). The functional form in (4) ensures balanced growth (see King, Plosser and Rebelo, 1988;
Boppart and Krusell, 2016). When we turn to the dynamic analysis in the next section, θ will be
the inverse of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution.
       Finally, in the static model, the capital stock, K, is taken as given (and will be endogenized via
household saving decisions in Section 3).

2.2      Equilibrium in the Static Model

Given the set of technologies I and N , and the capital stock K, we now characterize the equilibrium
in terms of Y , factor prices, employment and the threshold task I ∗ .
       In the text, we simplify disposition by imposing:

Assumption 2 One of the following two conditions holds: (i) η → 0, or (ii) ζ = 1.

       These two special cases ensure that the demand for labor and capital is homothetic. More
generally, our qualitative results are identical as long as the degree of non-homotheticity is not
too extreme, though in this case we no longer have closed-form expressions and this motivates our
choice of presenting these more general results in Appendix A.11
  10
      A simplifying feature of the technology described in equation (3) is that capital has the same productivity in all
tasks. This assumption could be relaxed with no change to our results in the static model, but without other changes,
it would not allow balanced growth in the next section. Another simplifying assumption is that non-automated tasks
can be produced with just labor. Having these tasks combine labor and capital would have no impact on our main
results as we show in Appendix B.
   11
       The source of non-homotheticity in the general model is the substitution between factors (capital or labor)
and intermediates (the q(i)’s). A strong substitution creates implausible features. For example, automation, which
increases the productivity of capital, mayend up raising
                                                          the demand for labor more than the demand for capital. As-

                                          γ(N)
                                                        > |σ −ζ|, and ensures that the degree of non-homotheticity
is not too extreme and automation always reduces the relative demand for labor.


                                                             7
       We proceed by characterizing the unit cost of producing each task as a function of factor prices
and the automation possibilities represented by I. Because tasks are produced competitively, their
price, p(i), will be equal to the minimum unit cost of production:

where W denotes the wage rate and R denotes the rental rate of capital.
       In equation (5), the unit cost of production for tasks i > I is given by the effective cost of
labor, W/γ(i) (which takes into account that the productivity of labornin taskoi is γ(i)). The unit
                                                                           W
cost of production for tasks i ≤ I, on the other hand, depends on min R, γ(i)    reflecting the fact
that capital and labor are perfect substitutes in the production of automated tasks. In these tasks,
firms will choose whichever factor has a lower effective cost—R or W/γ(i).
    Because labor has a strict comparative advantage in tasks with a higher index, the expression
for p(i) implies that there is a (unique) threshold Ie such that

                                                       W     e

                                                       R
This threshold represents the task for which the costs of producing with capital and labor are equal.
                  e we have R < W/γ(i), and without any other constraints, these tasks will be
For all tasks i < I,
produced with capital. However, if Ie > I, firms cannot use capital all the way up to task Ie because
of the constraint imposed by the available automation technology. This implies that there exists a
unique equilibrium threshold task
                                                                e

such that all tasks i < I ∗ will be produced with capital, while all tasks i > I ∗ will be produced
with labor.12
       Figure 2 depicts the resulting allocation of tasks to factors and also shows how, as already
noted, the creation of new tasks replaces existing tasks from the bottom of the distribution.
       As noted in footnote 9, we have simplified the exposition by imposing that new tasks created at
N immediately replace tasks located at N − 1, and it is therefore profitable to produce new tasks
with labor (and hence we have not distinguished N , N ∗ and Ne ). In the static model, this will be
the case when the capital stock is not too large, which is imposed in the next assumption.

                                                    W
Assumption 3 Let K be such that R =                γ(N ) .   We have K < K.

                                                W
       This assumption ensures that R >        γ(N )   and consequently that new tasks will increase aggregate
output and will be adopted immediately. Outside of this region, new tasks would not be utilized,
  12
    Without loss of generality, we impose that firms use capital when they are indifferent between using capital or
labor, which explains our convention of writing that all tasks i ≤ I ∗ (rather than i < I ∗ ) are produced using capital.

which we view as the less interesting case. This assumption is relaxed in the next two sections
where the capital stock is endogenous.
    We next derive the demand for factors in terms of the (endogenous) threshold I ∗ and the
technology parameter N . We choose the final good as the numeraire, which from equation (1) gives

    We can now define a static equilibrium as follows. Given a range of tasks [N −1, N ], automation
technology I ∈ (N − 1, N ], and a capital stock K, a static equilibrium is summarized by a set of
factor prices, W and R, threshold tasks, Ie and I ∗ , and aggregate output, Y , such that:

Proof. See Appendix A.
     Equation (12) shows that aggregate output is a CES aggregate of capital and labor, with the
elasticity between capital and labor being σ̂. The share parameters are endogenous and depend on
the state of the two types of technologies in the economy. An increase in I ∗ —which corresponds
to greater equilibrium automation—increases the share of capital and reduces the share of labor in
this aggregate production function, while the creation of new tasks does the opposite.
     Figure 3 illustrates the unique equilibrium described in Proposition 1. The equilibrium is given
                                                                                  W
by the intersection of two curves in the (ω, I) space, where ω =                  RK   is the wage level normalized by
capital income; this ratio is a monotone transformation of the labor share and will play a central role
in the rest of our analysis.14 The upward-sloping curve represents the cost-minimizing allocation
of capital and labor to tasks represented by equation (6), with the constraint that the equilibrium
level of automation can never exceed I. The downward-sloping curve, ω(I ∗ , N, K), corresponds to
the relative demand for labor, which can be obtained directly by differentiating equation (12) as
                                                            RN              !
                                                                  γ(i)σ̂−1 di

As we show in Appendix A, the relative demand curve always starts above the cost minimization
condition and ends up below it, so that the two curves necessarily intersect, defining a unique
equilibrium, as shown in Figure 3.
     The figure also distinguishes between the two cases highlighted above. In the left panel, we have
I∗   = I < Ie and the allocation of factors is constrained by technology, while the right panel plots
the case where I ∗ = Ie < I and firms choose the cost-minimizing allocation given factor prices.
     A special case of Proposition 1 is also worth highlighting, because it leads to a Cobb-Douglas
production function with an exponent depending on the degree of automation, which is particularly
tractable in certain applications.
   13
      This representation clarifies that the equilibrium implications of our setup are identical to one in which an upward-
sloping quasi-labor supply determines the relationship between employment and wages (and does not necessarily
equate marginal cost of labor supply to the wage). This follows readily by taking (11) to represent this quasi-
labor supply relationship. Appendix B provides a non-competitive micro-foundation for such a quasi-labor supply
relationship.
   14                                                                                          WL

         dN    > 0 and, when I ∗ = I,   dI   < 0.

Proof. The proof follows by straightforward differentiation of the relevant terms and is provided
in Appendix B for completeness.
       The main implication of Proposition 2 is that the two types of technological changes—automation
and the creation of new tasks—have polar implications. An increase in I—an improvement in au-
tomation technology—reduces W/R, the labor share and employment (unless I ∗ = Ie < I and firms
are not constrained by technology in their automation choice), while an increase in N —the creation
of new tasks—raises W/R, the labor share and employment.16
                                e automation always reduces employment. Because automation
    Importantly, when I ∗ = I < I,
raises aggregate output per worker more than it raises the wage (automation may even reduce the
equilibrium wage as we will see next), the negative income effect on labor supply resulting from
the greater aggregate output dominates any substitution effect that might follow from the higher
wage. On the other hand, the creation of new tasks always increase employment—new tasks raise
the wage more than aggregate output, increasing labor supply. Although these exact results rely
on the balanced growth preferences in equation (4), similar forces operate in general and create a
tendency for automation to reduce employment and for new tasks to increase it.
       These comparative static results are illustrated in Figure 3 as well: automation moves us along
the relative labor demand curve in the technology-constrained case shown in the left panel (and has
no impact in the right panel), while the creation of new tasks shifts out the relative labor demand
curve in both cases.
    A final implication of Proposition 2 is that the “technology-constrained” elasticity of substitu-
                                                                 e differs from the “technology-free”
tion between capital and labor, σ̂, which applies when I ∗ = I < I,
elasticity, σ free , which applies when the decision of which tasks to automate is not constrained by
technology (i.e., when I ∗ = Ie < I). This is because in the former case, as relative factor prices
change, the set of tasks performed by each factor remains fixed. In the latter case, as relative factor
prices change, firms reassign tasks to factors. This additional margin of adjustment implies that
σ free > σ̂.

Proposition 3 (Impact of technology on productivity, wages, and factor prices) Suppose
that Assumptions 1, 2 and 3 hold, and denote the changes in productivity—the change in aggregate
output holding capital and labor constant—by d ln Y |K,L .

     Throughout, by “automation” or “automation technology” we refer to I, and use “equilibrium automation” to
refer to I ∗ .

         That is, a higher N always increases the equilibrium wage but may reduce the rental rate,
         while a higher I always increases the rental rate but may reduce the equilibrium wage. In
         particular, there exists K > K such that an increase in I increases the equilibrium wage when
         K < K and reduces it when K > K.

         That is, an increase in N (more new tasks) always increases the equilibrium wage but may
         reduce the rental rate, while an increase in I (greater technological automation) has no effect
         on factor prices.

Proof. See Appendix B.
                                                                          e automation—an increase
       The most important result in Proposition 3 is that, when I ∗ = I < I,
in I—always increases aggregate output, but has an ambiguous effect on the equilibrium wage. On
the one hand, there is a positive productivity effect captured by the term d ln Y |K,L : by substituting
cheaper capital for expensive labor, automation raises productivity, and hence the demand for labor
in the tasks that are not yet automated.17 Countering this, there is a negative displacement effect
  17
    This discussion also clarifies that our productivity effect is similar to the productivity effect in models of offshoring
such as Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008), Rodriguez-Clare (2010) and Acemoglu, Gancia and Zilibotti (2015).
In these models, the productivity effect results from the substitution of cheap foreign labor for domestic labor in
certain tasks.


                                                                     13
                                   1
captured by the term            σ̂+εL ΛI .   This negative effect occurs because automation contracts the set
of tasks performed by labor. Because tasks are subject to diminishing returns in the aggregate
production function, (1), bunching workers into fewer tasks puts downward pressure on the wage.
As the equation for d ln Y |K,L reveals, the productivity gains depend on the cost savings from
                                                                                                   W
automation, which are given by the difference between the effective wage at I ∗ ,                 γ(I ∗ ) ,   and the
rental rate, R. When the productivity gains are small—which is guaranteed when K > K—the
                   W
gap between       γ(I ∗ )   and R is small, and so is the productivity effect; in this case, the overall impact
is necessarily negative.
         Finally, Proposition 3 shows that an increase in N always increases productivity and the equi-
                                                                       W
librium wage (recall that Assumption 3 imposes that R >               γ(N ) ),   and when the productivity gains
from the creation of new tasks are small, it can reduce the rental rate.
         The fact that automation may increase productivity while simultaneously reducing wages is
a key feature of the task-based framework developed here. With factor-augmenting technologies,
capital-augmenting technological improvements always increase the equilibrium wage, but this is no
longer the case when technological change alters the range of tasks performed by both factors (see
also Acemoglu and Autor, 2011).18 Furthermore, with factor-augmenting technologies, whether
different types of technological improvements are biased towards one factor or the other, and hence
their impact on factor shares, depends on the elasticity of substitution. But this too is different in
our task-based framework; here automation is always capital-biased (that is, it reduces both W/R
and the labor share), while the creation of new tasks is always labor-biased (that is, it increases
both W/R and the labor share).


3         Dynamics and Balanced Growth
In this section, we extend our model to a dynamic economy in which the evolution of the capital
stock is determined by the saving decisions of the representative household. We then investigate
the conditions under which the economy admits a balanced growth path (BGP), where aggregate
output, the capital stock and wages grow at a constant rate. We conclude by discussing the long-run
effects of automation on wages, the labor share and employment.

3.1        Balanced Growth

We assume that the representative household’s dynamic preferences are given by
                                   Z ∞
                                       e−ρt u(C(t), L(t))dt,                                                     (14)
                                                  0

where u(C(t), L(t)) is as defined in equation (4) and ρ > 0 is the discount rate.
    18
     For instance, with a constant returns to scale production function and two factors, capital and labor are
q−complements. Thus, capital-augmenting technologies always increases the marginal product of labor . To see
                                                                           dW
this, let F (AK K, AL L) be such a production function. Then W = FL , and dA K
                                                                               = KFLK = −LFLL > 0 (because of
constant returns to scale).



                                                            14
       To ensure balanced growth, we impose more structure to the comparative advantage schedule.
Because balanced growth is driven by technology, and in this model sustained technological change
comes from the creation of new tasks, constant growth requires the productivity gains from new
tasks to be exponential.19 Thus, in what follows we strengthen Assumption 1 to:

Assumption 1′ γ(i) satisfies:
                                               γ(i) = eAi with A > 0.                                                                                (15)

       The path of technology, represented by {I(t), N (t)}, is exogenous, and we define

                                                 n(t) = N (t) − I(t)

as a summary measure of technology, and similarly let n∗ (t) = N (t) − I ∗ (t) be a summary measure
of the state of technology used in equilibrium (since I ∗ (t) ≤ I(t), we have n∗ (t) ≥ n(t)). New
automation technologies reduce n(t), while the introduction of new tasks increases it.
       From equation (12), aggregate output net of intermediates, or simply “net output,” can be
                                                                                                                  ∗ (t)

K(t), and the level of employment, L(t), as

    Notice also that in this dynamic economy, as in our static model, the productivity of capital is the same in all
automated tasks. This does not, however, imply that any of the previously automated tasks can be used regardless of
N . As N increases, as emphasized by equation (1) and in footnote 9, the set of feasible tasks shifts to the right, and
only tasks above N − 1 remain compatible with and can be combined with those currently in use. Just to cite a few
motivating examples for this assumption: power looms of the 18th and 19th century are not compatible with modern
textile technology; assembly lines based on the dedicated machinery are not compatible with numerically controlled
machines and robots; first-generation calculators are not compatible with computers; and bookkeeping methods from
the 19th and 20th centuries are not compatible with the modern, computerized office.

      We also define a balanced growth path (BGP) as a dynamic equilibrium in which the economy
grows at a constant rate, factor shares are constant, and the rental rate of capital R(t) is constant.
      To characterize the growth dynamics implied by these equations, let us first consider a path
for technology such that g(t) → g and n(t) → n, consumption grows at the rate g and the Euler
equation holds R(t) = ρ + δ + θg. Suppose first that n∗ (t) = n(t) = 0, in which case F becomes
linear and R(t) = B. Because the growth rate of consumption must converge to g as well, the Euler
equation (18) is satisfied in this case only if ρ is equal to

                                                           ρ = B − δ − θg.                                                               (21)

Lemma A2 in Appendix A shows that this critical value of the discount rate divides the parameter
space into two regions as shown in Figure 4. To the left of ρ, there exists a decreasing curve n
                                                                                               e(ρ)

                             e(ρ) = 0, and to the right of ρ, there exists an increasing curve n(ρ)

   The next proposition provides the conditions under which a BGP exists, and characterizes the
BGP that results in each case. In what follows, we no longer impose Assumption 3, since depending
on the value of ρ, the capital stock can become large and induce full automation.

Proposition 4 (Dynamic equilibrium with exogenous technological change) Suppose that
Assumptions 1′ and 2 hold. The economy admits a BGP if only if we are in one of the following
cases:

                                                                                1−θ
  1. (Full automation) if ρ < ρ and N (t) = I(t) with B > δ + ρ >                θ (B − δ    − ρ) + δ, then
         there exists a unique and globally stable BGP. Moreover, in this     BGP n∗ (t) =   0, all tasks are
         produced with capital, and the labor share is zero;

                                                         ˙ = ∆ with ρ + (θ − 1)A∆ > 0
  2. (Interior BGP with immediate automation) if Ṅ(t) = I(t)
                                  e(ρ)}, then there exists a unique and globally stable BGP. In this
         and n(t) = n > max{n(ρ), n
         BGP n∗ (t) = n and I ∗ (t) = I(t).

   3. (Interior BGP with eventual automation) if ρ > ρ, Ṅ (t) = ∆ and I(t) ≥ ∆ with
         ρ + (θ − 1)A∆ > 0, and n(t) < n(ρ), then there exists a unique and globally stable BGP. In
                                              e > I(t).
         this BGP n∗ (t) = n(ρ) and I ∗ (t) = I(t)

   4. (No automation) if ρ > ρmin and Ṅ (t) = ∆ with ρ + (θ − 1)A∆ > 0, then there exists a
         unique and globally stable BGP. In this BGP all tasks are produced with labor, and the capital
         share is zero.

Proof. See Appendix A.
       The first type of BGP in Proposition 4 involves the automation of all tasks, in which case
aggregate output becomes linear in capital. This case was ruled out by Assumption 3 in our static
analysis, but as the proposition shows, when the discount rate, ρ, is sufficiently small, it can emerge
in the dynamic model. A BGP with no automation (case 4), where growth is driven entirely by
the creation of new tasks, is also possible if the discount rate is sufficiently large.
       More important for our focus are the two interior BGPs where automation and the introduction
of new tasks go hand-in-hand, and as a result, n∗ (t) is constant at some value between 0 and 1;
this implies that both capital and labor perform a fixed measure of tasks. In the more interesting
case where automated tasks are immediately produced with capital (case 2), the proposition also
highlights that this process needs to be “balanced” itself: the two types of technologies need to
advance at the same rate so that n(t) = n.
       Balanced growth with constant labor share emerges in this model because the net effect of
automation and the creation of new technologies proceeding at the same rate is to augment labor
while keeping constant the share of tasks performed by labor—as shown by equation (16). In this
case, the gap between the two types of technologies, n(t), regulates the share parameters in the
resulting CES production function, while the levels of N (t) and I(t) determine the productivity
of labor in the set of tasks that it performs. When n(t) = n, technology becomes purely labor
augmenting on net because labor performs a fixed share of tasks, and labor becomes more productive
over time in producing the newly-created tasks.21
       To illustrate the main implication of the proposition, let us focus on part 2 with I˙ = Ṅ = ∆
and n(t) = n ≥ n(ρ). Along such a path, n∗ (t) = n and g(t) = A∆. Figure 5 presents the phase
diagram for the system of differential equations comprising the Euler equation (equation (18))
and the resource constraint (equation (20)). This system of differential equations determines the
structure of the dynamic equilibrium and is identical to that of the neoclassical growth model with
pure labor-augmenting technological change and endogenous labor supply (which makes the locus
for ċ = 0 downward-sloping because of the negative income effect on labor supply).
  21
    This intuition connects Proposition 4 to Uzawa’s Theorem, which implies that balanced growth requires a rep-
resentation of the production function with purely labor-augmenting technological change (e.g., Acemoglu, 2009, or
Grossman, Helpman and Oberfield, 2016) as the one that we obtain when n(t) = n.

3.2   Long-Run Comparative Statics

We next study the log-run implications of an unanticipated and permanent decline in n(t), which
corresponds to automation running ahead of the creation of new tasks. Because in the short run
capital is fixed, the short-run implications of this change in technology are the same as in our
static analysis in the previous section. But the fact that capital adjusts implies different long-run
dynamics.
   Consider an interior BGP in which N (t) − I(t) = n ∈ (0, 1). Along this path, the equilibrium
wage grows at the rate A∆. Define wI (n) = limt→∞ W (t)/γ(I ∗ (t)) as the effective wage paid in the
least complex task produced with labor and wN (n) = limt→∞ W (t)/γ(N (t)) as the effective wage
paid in the most complex task produced with labor. Both of these functions are defined well-defined
and thus depend only on n. Figure 4 shows how these effective wages compare to the BGP value
of the rental rate of capital, ρ + δ + θg.
   The next proposition characterizes the long-run impact of automation on factor prices, employ-
ment and the labor share in the interior BGPs.

Proposition 5 (Long-run comparative statics) Suppose that Assumptions 1′ and 2 hold. Con-
sider a path for technology in which n(t) = n ∈ (0, 1) and g(t) = g (so that we are in case 2 or 3
in Proposition 4). Then, in the unique BGP we have R(t) = ρ + δ + θg, and

   • for n < n(ρ), wI (n) = wI (n(ρ)) and wN (n) = wN (n(ρ)). Consequently, small changes in n
      do not affect the paths of effective wages, employment and the labor share.

   • For n > n(ρ), wI (n) is increasing and wN (n) is decreasing in n. Moreover, the asymptotic
      values for employment and the labor share are increasing in n. Finally, if the increase in n
      is caused by an increase in I, the capital stock also increases.

Proof. The proof is straightforward and is presented in Appendix B for completeness.

                                                    19
       We discuss this proposition for n > n(ρ), so that we are in the most interesting region of the
parameter space where I ∗ = I and the level of automation is constrained by technology. The key
implication in this case is that the long-run implications of automation are very different than
its short-term impact. Automation reduces employment and the labor share in the long run, but
always increases the long-run equilibrium wage. This result follows because wN (n) is decreasing
in n, and thus a lower n implies a higher wage level;22 but because wI (n) is increasing in n, this
increase is less than proportional to γ(I(t)). Unlike the wage, the rental rate of capital reverts to
its initial value of ρ + δ + θg, which is pinned down by the Euler equation, (18), regardless of the
extent of automation.




Figure 6: Dynamic behavior of wages (ln W ), the rental rate of capital (R), the labor share (sL ), and the capital
stock following a permanent increase in automation.


       Figure 6 illustrates the response of the economy to permanent changes in automation. It plots
two potential paths for all variables. The dotted line depicts the case where wI (n) is large relative
to R, so that there are significant productivity gains from automation. In this case, an increase in
automation raises the wage immediately, followed by further increases in the long run. The solid
line depicts the dynamics when wI (n) ≈ R, so that the productivity gains from automation are
very small. In this case, an increase in automation reduces the wage in the short run and leaves

       This result can also be understood by noting that the ideal price index condition implies

                                         d ln Y |K,L = sL d ln W + (1 − sL )d ln R.

In general, productivity gains from technological change accrue to both capital and labor. In the BGP, however,
capital adjusts to keep the rental rate fixed at R = ρ + δ + θg, and as a result, d ln W = s1L d ln Y |K,L > 0, meaning
that productivity gains accrue only to the inelastic factor—labor.



                                                            20
it approximately unchanged in the long run. In contrast to the concerns that highly productive
automation technologies will reduce the wage and employment, our model thus shows that it is
precisely when automation fails to raise productivity significantly that it has a more detrimental
impact on wages and employment. In both cases, the duration of the period with stagnant or
depressed wages depends on θ, which determines the speed of capital adjustment following an
increase in the rental rate.
    The remaining panels of the figure show that automation reduces employment and the labor
share, as stated in Proposition 5. If σ̂ < 1, the resulting capital accumulation mitigates the short-
run decline in the labor share but does not fully offset it (this is the case depicted in the figure). If
σ̂ > 1, capital accumulation further depresses the labor share—even though it raises the wage.
    The long-run impact of a permanent increase in N (t) can also be obtained from the proposition.
In this case, new tasks increase the wage (because wI (n) is increasing in n), aggregate output,
employment, and the labor share, both in the short and the long run. Because the short-run impact
of new tasks on the rental rate of capital is ambiguous, so is the response of capital accumulation.
    In light of these results, the recent decline in the labor share and the employment to population
ratio in the United States can be interpreted as a consequence of automation outpacing the creation
of new labor-intensive tasks. Faster automation relative to the creation of new tasks might be driven
by an acceleration in the rate at which I(t) advances, in which case we would have stagnant or
lower wages in the short run while capital adjusts to a new higher level. Alternatively, it might be
driven by a deceleration in the rate at which N (t) advances, in which case we would also have low
growth of aggregate output and wages. We return to the productivity implications of automation
once we introduce our full model with endogenous technological change in the next section.


4     Full Model: Tasks and Endogenous Technologies
The previous section established, under some conditions, the existence of an interior BGP with
Ṅ = I˙ = ∆. This result raises a more fundamental question: why should these two types of
technologies advance at the same rate? To answer this question we now develop our full model,
which endogenizes the pace at which automation and the creation of new tasks proceeds.

4.1   Endogenous and Directed Technological Change

To endogenize technological change, we deviate from our earlier assumption of a perfectly compet-
itive market for intermediates, and assume that (intellectual) property rights to each intermediate,
q(i), are held by a technology monopolist which can produce it at the marginal cost µψ in terms of
the final good, where µ ∈ (0, 1) and ψ > 0. We also assume that this technology can be copied by
a fringe of competitive firms, which can replicate any available intermediate at a higher marginal
cost of ψ, and that µ is such that the unconstrained monopoly price of an intermediate is greater
than ψ. This ensures that the unique equilibrium price for all types of intermediates is a limit price
of ψ, and yields a per unit profit of (1 − µ)ψ > 0 for technology monopolists. These profits generate


                                                   21
incentives for creating new tasks and automation technologies.
    In this section, we adopt a structure of intellectual property rights that abstracts from the
creative destruction of profits. We assume that developing a new intermediate that automates or
replaces an existing task is viewed as an infringement of the patent of the technology previously
used to produce that task. Consequently, a firm must compensate the technology monopolist who
owns the property rights over the production of the intermediate that it is replacing. We also
assume that this compensation takes place with the new inventors making a take-it-or-leave-it offer
to the holder of the existing patent.
    Developing new intermediates that embody technology requires scientists.23 There is a fixed
supply of S scientists, which will be allocated to automation (SI (t) ≥ 0) or the creation of new
tasks (SN (t) ≥ 0),
                                                    SI (t) + SN (t) ≤ S.

    When a scientist is employed in automation, she automates κI tasks per unit of time and receives
a wage WIS (t). When she is employed in the creation of new tasks, she creates κN new tasks per
unit of time and receives a wage WNS (t). We assume that automation and the creation of new tasks
proceed in the order of the task index i. Thus, the allocation of scientists determines the evolution
of both types of technology—summarized by the level of I(t) and N (t)—as

                                     ˙ = κI SI (t), and Ṅ (t) = κN SN (t).
                                     I(t)                                                                           (22)

    Because we want to analyze the properties of the equilibrium locally, we make a final assumption
to ensure that the allocation of scientists varies smoothly when there is a small difference between
WIS (t) and WNS (t) (rather than having discontinuous jumps). In particular, we assume that scien-
tists differ in the cost of effort: when working in automation, scientist j incurs a cost of χjI Y (t), and
when working in the creation of new tasks, she incurs a cost of χjN Y (t).24 Consequently, scientist j
                                WIS (t)−WN  S (t)
will work in automation if            Y (t)         > χjN − χjI . We also assume that the distribution of χiN − χiI
among scientists is given by a smooth and increasing distribution function G over na support [−υ, υ],
                                                                                                   o
                                                                                                     κN VN (t) κI VI (t)
where we take υ to be small enough that χjN and χjS are always less than max                           Y (t) , Y (t)
and thus all scientists always work. For notational convenience, we also adopt the normalization
           κN
G(0) =   κI +κN .


4.2    Equilibrium with Endogenous Technological Change

We first compute the present discounted value accruing to monopolists from automation and the
creation of new tasks. Let VI (t) denote the value of automating task i = I(t) (i.e., the highest-
indexed task that has not yet been automated, or more formally i = I(t) + ε for ε arbitrarily small
and positive). Likewise, VN (t) is the value of a new technology creating a new task at i = N (t).
  23
     Focusing on an innovation possibilities frontier using just scientists, rather than variable factors such as in the
lab-equipment specifications (see Acemoglu 2009), is convenient because it enables us to focus on the direction of
technological change—and not on the overall amount of technological change.
  24
     The cost of effort is multiplied by Y (t) to capture the income effect on the costs of effort in a tractable manner.



                                                             22
       To simplify the exposition, let us assume that in this equilibrium n(t) > max{n̄(ρ), n
                                                                                            e(ρ)}(ρ), so
that I ∗ (t) = I(t) and newly-automated tasks start being produced with capital immediately. The
flow profits that accrue to the technology monopolist that automated task i are:25

                                                               π I (t, i) = bY (t)R(t)ζ−σ̂ ,                                                     (23)

where b = (1 − µ)B σ̂−1 ηψ 1−ζ . Likewise, the flow profits that accrue to the technology monopolist
who created the labor-intensive task i are:

       The take-it-or-leave-it nature of offers implies that a firm that automates task I needs to com-
pensate the existing technology monopolist by paying her the present discounted value of the profits
that her inferior labor-intensive technology would generate if not replaced. This take-it-or-leave-it
offer is given by:26
                                              Z    ∞           Rτ
                                                                                                      ζ−σ̂

Likewise, a firm that creates task N needs to compensate the existing technology monopolist
by paying her the present discounted value of the profits from the capital-intensive alternative
technology. This take-it-or-leave-it offer is given by:
                                  Z ∞ R
                                            τ

                                                       t

In both cases, the patent-holders will immediately accept theses offers and reject less generous ones.
       We can then compute the values of innovating and becoming a technology monopolist as:
                              Z ∞ R                                       Rτ        ζ−σ̂ 

                                                                                              et                        − R(τ )ζ−σ̂       dτ ,   (26)

for automation and creation of new tasks, respectively, where gy (t) is the growth rate of aggregate
output at time t and as noted above, g(t) is the growth rate of γ(N (t)).
       The expressions for the value functions, VI (t) and VN (t), share a common form: they subtract
the lower cost of producing a task with the factor for which the new technology is designed from
the higher cost of producing the same task with the older technology.27 Because new entrants
  25
     This follows because the demand for intermediates is q(i) = B σ̂−1 ηψ −ζ Y (t)R(t)ζ−σ̂ , each intermediate is sold at
a price ψ, and the technology monopolist makes a per unit profit of 1 − µ.
  26
     This expression is written by assuming that the patent-holder will also turn down subsequent less generous offers
in the future. Writing it using dynamic programming and the one-step ahead deviation principle leads to the same
conclusion.
  27
     There is an important difference between the value functions in (25) and (26) and those in models of directed
technological change building on factor-augmenting technologies (such as in Acemoglu, 1998, or 2002). In the latter
case, the direction of technological change is determined by the interplay of a market size effect favoring the more


                                                                             23
compensate the incumbent technology monopolists that they replace, our patent structure removes
the creative destruction of profits, which is present in other models of quality improvements under
the alternative assumption that new firms do not have to respect the intellectual property rights of
the technology on which they are building (e.g., Aghion and Howitt, 1992; Grossman and Helpman,
1991). In Section 5, we explore how our main results change when the intellectual property rights
regime allows for the creative destruction of profits.
    To ensure that the value functions are well-behaved and non-negative, for the rest of the paper
we impose the following assumption:

Assumption 4 σ̂ > ζ.

    This ensures that innovations are directed towards technologies that allow firms to produce
tasks by using the cheaper (or more productive) factors, and consequently, that the present dis-
counted values from innovation are positive. This assumption is intuitive and reasonable: since
intermediates embody the technology that directly works with labor or capital, they should be
highly complementary with the relevant factor of production in the production of tasks.28
    An equilibrium with endogenous technology is given by paths {K(t), N (t), I(t)} for capital and
technology (starting from initial values K(0), N (0), I(0)), paths {R(t), W (t), WIS (t), WNS (t)} for
factor prices, paths {VN (t), VI (t)} for the value functions of technology monopolists, and paths
{SN (t), SI (t)} for the allocation of scientists such that all markets clear, all firms and prospec-
tive technology monopolists maximize profits, the representative household maximizes its utility.
Using the same normalizations as in the previous section, we can represent the equilibrium with
endogenous technology by a path of the tuple {c(t), k(t), n(t), L(t), SI (t), VI (t), VN (t)} such that:

    • consumption satisfies the Euler equation (18) and the labor supply satisfies equation (17);

    • the transversality condition holds
                                                               Rt
                                       lim (k(t) + Π(t))e−      0 (ρ−(1−θ)g(s))ds   = 0,                           (27)
                                       t→∞

abundant factor and a price effect favoring the cheaper factor. The task-based framework here, combined with the
assumption on the structure of patents, makes the benefits of new technologies only a function of the factor prices—
in particular, the difference between the wage rate and the rental rate. This is because factor prices determine the
profitability of producing with capital relative to labor. Without technological constraints, this would determine the
set of tasks that the two factors perform. In the presence of technological constraints restricting which tasks can be
produced with which factor, factor prices then determine the incentives for automation (to expand the set of tasks
produced by capital) and the creation of new tasks (to expand the set of tasks produced by labor).
   We should also note that despite this difference, the general results on absolute weak bias of technology in Acemoglu
(2007) continue to hold here—in the sense that an increase in the abundance of a factor always makes technology
more biased towards that factor.
   28
      The profitability of introducing an intermediate that embodies a new technology depends on its demand. As a
factor (labor or capital) becomes cheaper, there are two effects. First, the decline in costs allows firms to scale up
their production, which increases the demand for the intermediate good. The extent of this positive scale effect is
regulated by the elasticity of substitution σ̂. Second, because the cheaper factor is substituted for the intermediate
it is combined with, the demand for that intermediate good falls. This countervailing substitution effect is regulated
by the elasticity of substitution ζ. The condition σ̂ > ζ guarantees that the former, positive effect dominates, so
that prospective technology monopolists have an incentive to introduce technologies that allow firms to produce tasks
more cheaply. When the opposite holds and ζ > σ̂, we have the paradoxical situation where technologies that work
with more expensive factors are more profitable, and consequently, in this case the present discounted values from
innovation is negative.

definition of the equilibrium shows that the profits from automation and the creation of new tasks

more scientists will be allocated to that activity.

vI (n) = limt→∞ VI (t)/Y (t) and vN (n) = limt→∞ VN (t)/Y (t), which only depend on n. Equation
(28) implies that ṅ(t) > 0 if and only if κN VN (t) > κI VI (t), and ṅ(t) < 0 if and only if κN VN (t) <
κI VI (t). Thus if κI vI (n) 6= κN vN (n), the economy converges to a corner with n(t) equal to 0 or 1,
and for an interior BGP with n ∈ (0, 1) we need

                                               κI vI (n) = κN vN (n).                                               (29)

       The next proposition gives the main result of the paper, and characterizes different types of
BGPs with endogenous technology.

Proposition 6 (Equilibrium with endogenous technological change) Suppose that Assump-
tions 1′ , 2, and 4 hold. Then, there exists S such that, when S < S, we have:29
  29
    The condition S < S ensures that the growth rate of the economy is not too high. If the growth rate is above
the threshold implied by S, the creation of new tasks is discouraged (even if current wages are low) because firms
anticipate that the wage will grow rapidly, reducing the future profitability of creating new labor-intensive tasks.
This condition also allows us to use Taylor approximations of the value functions in our analysis of local stability.

   1 (Full automation) For ρ < ρ, there is a BGP in which n(t) = 0 and all tasks are produced
     with capital.

   For ρ > ρ, all BGPs feature n(t) = n > n(ρ). Moreover, there exist κ ≥ κ > 0 such that:

                                        κI
   2 (Unique interior BGP) if           κN   > κ there exists a unique BGP. In this BGP we have
     n(t) = n ∈ (n(ρ), 1) and κN vN (n) = κI vI (n). If, in addition, θ = 0, then the equilibrium is
     unique everywhere and the BGP is globally (saddle-path) stable. If θ > 0, then the equilibrium
     is unique in the neighborhood of the BGP and is asymptotically (saddle-path) stable;
                                 κI
   3 (Multiple BGPs) if κ >      κN   > κ, there are multiple BGPs;
                                 κI
   4 (No automation) If κ >      κN ,   there exists a unique BGP. In this BGP n(t) = 1 and all tasks
     are produced with labor.

Proof. See Appendix A.
   This proposition provides a complete characterization of different types of BGPs. Figure 7
shows visually how different BGPs arise in parts of the parameter space.




                                      Figure 7: Varieties of BGPs.

   Further intuition can be gained by studying the behavior κI vI (n) and κN vN (n), which we do
in Figure 8. Lemma A3 shows that, for S small, the normalized value functions can be written as
                                                                                         
               b (ρ + δ + θg)ζ−σ̂ − wI (n)ζ−σ̂            b wN (n)ζ−σ̂ − (ρ + δ + θg)ζ−σ̂
      vI (n) =                                   vN (n) =                                   .
                        ρ + (θ − 1)g                               ρ + (θ − 1)g

These expressions show that, asymptotically, the profitability of the two types of technologies
depend on the effective wages, wI (n) and wN (n). As n increases, so does wI (n) and it becomes
more expensive to produce the least complex tasks with labor, and this makes automation more
profitable and triggers further improvements in the automation technology. As a result, vI (n) is
increasing in n (recall that σ̂ > ζ). However, vN (n) is also increasing in n because, as explained

                                                  26
in the previous section, wN (n) is decreasing in n owing to the productivity effect and the fact that
the rental rate is constant in the long run.
     Panel A of Figure 8 illustrates the first part of Proposition 6 (which parallels the first part of
Proposition 4): when ρ < ρ, κI vI (0) is above κN vN (0) for n < n
                                                                 e(ρ). In this region it is not optimal
to create new tasks. Consequently, there exists a BGP with full automation, meaning that all
tasks will be automated and produced with capital. Reminiscent of Leontief’s “horse equilibrium,”
in this BGP labor becomes redundant. Intuitively, as also shown in Figure 4, when ρ < ρ and
n<n
  e(ρ), we have wN (n) > ρ + δ + θg, which implies that labor is too expensive relative to capital.
This ensures that utilizing and thus creating new tasks is not profitable. Economic growth in this
BGP is driven by capital accumulation (because when all tasks are automated, aggregate output
is linear in capital).




Figure 8: Asymptotic behavior of normalized values. In the left panel, κI vI (n) is everywhere above κN vN (n), and
thus there is no effort devoted to creating new tasks in the BGP involves full automation. In the right panel, if κI /κN
is sufficiently large, the two curves intersect and we have an interior BGP with both automation and creation of new
tasks. The right panel also shows the effect of an increase in the productivity of scientists in automating tasks from
κI to κ′I .


     Panel B of the figure illustrates the remaining three types of BGPs, which apply when ρ > ρ.
In this case, at n = 0 (or at any n ≤ n̄(ρ)), κI vI (n) is strictly below κN vN (n), and thus a full
automation BGP is not possible, and the two curves can only intersect for n ∈ (n̄(ρ), 1], implying
that in any BGP, utilizing and creating new labor-intensive tasks will be profitable. As explained
                                                                                                κI            κI
above, both of these curves are increasing, but their relative slopes depend on                 κN .   When   κN   < κ,
κI vI (n) is not sufficiently steep relative to κN vN (n), and the two never intersect. This means that
even at n = 1, it is not profitable to create new automation technologies, and all tasks will be

                                                          27
produced with labor. In this BGP, capital becomes redundant, and growth is driven by endogenous
technological change increasing labor’s productivity as in the standard quality ladder models such
as Aghion and Howitt (1992) or Grossman and Helpman (1991).
                       κI
    Conversely, when   κN    > κ, the curve κI vI (n) is sufficiently steep relative to κN vN (n) so that the
two curves necessarily intersect and can only intersect once. Hence there exists a unique interior
BGP (interior in the sense that now the BGP level of n is strictly between 0 and 1, and thus some
tasks are produced with labor and some with capital).
                        κI
    Finally, when κ >   κN    > κ, the two curves will intersect, but will do so multiple times, leading
to multiple interior BGPs.
                                           κI
    Proposition 6 also shows that, for     κN    > κ, the unique interior BGP is globally stable provided
that the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is infinite (i.e., θ = 0), and locally stable otherwise
(i.e., when θ > 0). The critical economic force generating stability is that, as noted above, it is
factor prices that guide the direction of technological change. This is the reason why vI (n) is in-
creasing in n—implying that greater automation, i.e., lower n, reduces the profitability of additional
automation. Countering this is the fact that, because of the productivity effect highlighted above,
                                                                                                    κI
vN (n) is also increasing in n. The condition for a unique interior BGP in Proposition 6,           κN   > κ,
is sufficient to ensure that κI vI (n) is steeper than κN vN (n), guaranteeing asymptotic stability.
    The asymptotic stability of the interior BGP implies that there are powerful self-correcting
market forces pushing the economy towards balanced growth. An important consequence of this
stability is that technological shocks that reduce n, for example the arrival of a series of new
automation technologies, will set in motion self-correcting forces. Following such a change, there
will be an adjustment process restoring the level of employment and the labor share back to their
initial values.
    This does not, however, imply that all shocks will leave the long-run prospects of labor un-
changed. For one, this would not necessarily be the case in a situation with multiple steady states,
and certain changes in the environment (for example, a large increase in B or a decline in ρ), can
shift the economy from the region in which there is a unique interior BGP to the region with full
automation, with disastrous consequences for labor. In addition, the next corollary shows that,
if there is a change in the innovation possibilities frontier (in the κ’s) that makes it permanently
easier to develop new automation technologies, self-correcting forces still operate but will now only
move the economy to a new BGP with lower employment and a lower labor share.

                                            κI
Corollary 2 Suppose that ρ > ρ and          κN   > κ. A one-time permanent increase in κI /κN leads to
a BGP with lower n, employment and labor share.

    This corollary follows by noting that an increase in κI /κN shifts the intersection of the curves
κI vI (n) and κN v(n) to the left as shown by the blue dotted curve in Figure 8, leading to a lower
value of n in the BGP. This triggers an adjustment process in which the labor share and employ-
ment decline over time, but ultimately settle to their new (interior) BGP values. The transition
process will involve a slower rate of increase of N and a more rapid rate of increase of I than the

                                                       28
BGP. Interestingly, if new tasks generate larger productivity gains than automation, this transition
process will also be associated with a slowdown in productivity growth because automation crowds
out resources that could be used to develop new tasks.30
    In summary, Proposition 6 characterizes the varieties of BGPs, and together with Corollary 2,
it delineates the types of changes in technology that trigger self-correcting dynamics. Starting from
the interior BGP, the effects of (small) increases in automation technology will reverse themselves
over time, restoring employment and the labor share back to their initial values. Permanent changes
in the ability of society to create new automation technologies trigger self-correcting dynamics as
well, but these will take us towards a new BGP with lower employment and labor share.


5     Extensions
In this section we discuss three extensions. First we introduce heterogeneous skills, which allow us
to analyze the impact of technological changes on inequality. Second, we study a different structure
of intellectual property rights that introduces the creative destruction of profits. Finally, we discuss
the welfare implications of our model.

5.1    Automation, New Tasks and Inequality

To study how automation and the creation of new tasks impact inequality, we now introduce
heterogeneous skills. This extension is motivated by the observation that both automation and new
tasks could increase inequality: new tasks favor high-skill workers who tend to have a comparative
advantage in complex tasks, while automation substitutes capital for labor in lower-indexed tasks
where low-skill workers have their comparative advantage.
    The natural assumption that high-skill workers have a comparative advantage in new tasks
receives support from the data. For instance, the left panel of Figure 9 shows that in each decade
since 1980, occupations with more new job titles had higher skill requirements in terms of the
average years of schooling among employees at the start of each decade (relative to the rest of the
economy). However, the right panel of the same figure also shows a pattern of “mean reversion”
whereby average years of schooling in these occupations decline in each subsequent decade, most
likely, reflecting the fact that new job titles became more open to less skilled workers over time.
    To incorporate these features, we assume that there are two types of workers: low-skill workers
with time-varying productivity γ L (i, t) in task i, and high-skill workers with productivity γ H (i).
We parametrize these productivities as follows:
  30
     Forgone productivity gains from from slower creation of new tasks will exceed the gains from automation, causing
a productivity slowdown during a transition to a higher level of automation, if ρ > ρP , where ρP is defined implicitly
as the solution to the equation
                    1                                     1
                       (wI (n)1−σ − (ρP + δ + θg)1−σ ) =    ((ρ + δ + θg)1−σ − wN (n)1−σ ).

Assumption 1′′ The productivities of high-skill and low-skill workers are given by

                                                        γ H (i) =eAH i                                                     γ L (i, t) =eξAH i Γ(t − T (i)),

where Γ is increasing with limx→∞ Γ(x) = 1, ξ ∈ (0, 1], and T (i) denotes the time when task i was
first introduced.

                  Assumption 1′′ is similar to but extends Assumption 1′ in several dimensions. First, because Γ is
increasing, it implies that the productivity of low-skill workers in a task is greater when that task has
been in existence for longer. This captures the idea that as new tasks become “standardized,” they
can be more productively performed by less skilled workers (e.g., Acemoglu, Gancia and Zilibotti,
2010), or that workers adapt to new technologies by acquiring human capital through training,
on-the-job learning and schooling (e.g., Schultz, 1965, Nelson and Phelps, 1966, Greenwood and
Yorukoglu, 1997, Caselli, 1999, Galor and Moav, 2000, Beaudry, Green and Sand, 2013, and Goldin
and Katz, 2008). Second, because of standardization and the assumption that ξ ∈ (0, 1], the ratio
γ H (i)
γ L (i,t)                              is increasing in i. This implies that high-skill workers have a comparative advantage in
higher-indexed tasks, as these tasks have had little time to be standardized. Finally, since the
function Γ limits to 1 over time, the parameter ξ determines whether this standardization effect is
complete or incomplete. When ξ < 1, as the time during which a task has existed tends to infinity,
the productivity of low-skill workers relative to high-skill workers converges to γ L (i, t)/γ H (i) =
γ H (i)ξ−1 , and limits to zero as more and more advanced tasks are introduced. In contrast, when
ξ = 1, the relative productivity of low-skill workers converges to 1 for tasks that have been around
for a long time.
                  The structure of comparative advantage ensures that there exists a threshold task M such that
high-skill labor performs tasks in [M, N ], low-skill labor performs tasks in (I ∗ , M ), and capital

                                                                                                        30
performs tasks in [N − 1, I ∗ ]. In what follows, we denote the wages of high and low-skill labor by
WH and WL , respectively, and to simplify the discussion, we focus on the economy with exogenous
technology and assume that the supply of high-skill labor is fixed at H and the supply of low-skill
labor is fixed at L.

Proposition 7 (Automation, new tasks and inequality) Suppose Assumptions 1′′ and 2 hold.
Suppose also that technology evolves exogenously with Ṅ = I˙ = ∆ and n(t) = n > max{n(ρ), n
                                                                                           e(ρ)}
(and AH (1 − θ)∆ < ρ). Then, there exists a unique BGP. Depending on the value of ξ this BGP
takes one of the following forms:

  1. If ξ < 1, in the unique BGP we have limt→∞ WH (t)/WL (t) = ∞, the share of tasks performed
      by low-skill workers converges to zero, and capital and high-skill workers perform a constant
      share of tasks.

  2. If ξ = 1, in the unique BGP WH (t) and WL (t) grow at the same rate as the economy, the wage
      gap, WH (t)/WL (t), remains constant, and capital, low-skill and high-skill workers perform
      constant shares of tasks. Moreover, limt→∞ WH (t)/WL (t) is decreasing in n. Consequently,
      a permanent increase in N raises the wage gap WH (t)/WL (t) in the short run, but reduces
      it in the long run, while a permanent increase in I raises the wage gap both in the short and
      the long run.

   Like all remaining proofs in the paper, the proof of this proposition is in Appendix B.
   When ξ < 1, this extension confirms the pessimistic scenario about the implications of new
technologies for wage inequality and the employment prospects of low-skill workers—both automa-
tion and the creation of new tasks increase inequality, the former because it displaces low-skill
workers ahead of high-skill workers, and the latter because it directly benefits high-skill workers
who have a comparative advantage in newer, more complex tasks relative to low-skill workers. As
a result, low-skill workers are progressively squeezed into a smaller and smaller set of tasks, and
wage inequality grows without bound.
   However, our extended model also identifies a countervailing force, which becomes particularly
potent when ξ = 1. Because new tasks become standardized, they can over time be as productively
used by low-skill workers. In this case, automation and the creation of new tasks still reduce the
relative earnings of low skill-workers in the short run, but their long-run implications are very
different. In the long run, inequality is decreasing in n (because a higher n translates into a greater
range of tasks for low-skill workers). Consequently, automation increases inequality both in the
short and the long run, while the creation of new tasks that leads to a permanently lower level of n
increases inequality in the short run, but reduces it in the long run. These observations suggest that
inequality may be high following a period of adjustment in which the labor share first declines (due
to increases in automation), and then recovers (due to the introduction and later standardization
of new tasks).


                                                  31
5.2   Creative Destruction of Profits

In this subsection, we modify our baseline assumption on intellectual property rights and revert
to the classical setup in the literature in which new technologies do not infringe the patents of
the products that they replace (Aghion and Howitt, 1992, and Grossman and Helpman, 1991).
This assumption introduces the creative destruction effects—the destruction of profits of previous
inventors by new innovators. We will see that this alternative structure has similar implications,
but necessitates more demanding conditions to guarantee its uniqueness and stability.
   Let us first define VN (t, i) and VI (t, i) as the time t values for technology monopolist with,
respectively, new task and automation technologies. These value functions satisfy the following
Bellman equations:

              r(t)VN (t, i) − V̇N (t, i) =π N (t, i)          r(t)VI (t, i) − V̇I (t, i) =π I (t, i).

Here π I (t, i) and π N (t, i) denote the flow profits from automating and creating new tasks, respec-
tively, which are given by the formulas in equations (23) and (24).
   For a firm creating a new task i, let T N (i) denote the time at which it will be replaced by a
technology allowing the automation of this task. Likewise, let T I (i) denote the time at which an
automated task i will be replaced by a new task using labor. Since firms anticipate these determin-
istic replacement dates, their value functions also satisfy the boundary conditions VN (T N (i), i) = 0
and VI (T I (i), i) = 0. Together with these boundary conditions, the Bellman equations solve for

Here, the function ι(n(t)) is included and assumed to be nondecreasing to capture the possibility
that automating tasks closer to the frontier (defined as the highest indexed task available) may be
more difficult.

   Let us again define the normalized value functions as vICD (n) = limt→∞                 Y (t)

         VNCD (t)

                                                                         n
tasks are automated after a period of length T N (N (t)) − t =           ∆ , and newly-automated tasks        are
                                                                         1−n               κI κN ι(n)
replaced by new ones after a period of length T I (I(t)) − t =            ∆ , where ∆ = κI ι(n)+κN S is       the
endogenous rate at which N and I grow. The endogenous value of n in an interior BGP satisfies

                                         κI ι(n)vICD (n) = κN vN

                                                                  (n).

   The next proposition focuses on interior BGPs and shows that, because of creative destruction,
we must impose additional assumptions on the function ι(n) to guarantee stability.

                                                       32
Proposition 8 (Equilibrium with creative destruction) Suppose that ρ > ρ, Assumptions
1′ , 2 and 4 hold and there is creative destruction of profits. Then:

  1. There exist ι and ι < ι such that if ι(0) < ι and ι(1) > ι, then there exists at least one locally
      stable interior BGP with n(t) = n ∈ (n(ρ), 1).

  2. If ι(n) is constant, there is no stable interior BGP (with n(t) = n ∈ (n(ρ), 1)). Any stable
      BGP involves n(t) → 0 or n(t) → 1.

   The first part of the proposition follows from an analogous argument to that in the proof of
Proposition 6, with the only difference being that, because of the presence of the function ι(n) in
equation (30), the key condition that pins down n becomes κI ι(n)vICD (n) = κN vN
                                                                                CD (n).

   The major difference with our previous analysis is that creative destruction introduces a new
source of instability. Unlike the previous case with no creative destruction, we now have that vICD (n)
is decreasing in n. As more tasks are automated, the rental rate remains unchanged and newly-
automated tasks will be replaced less frequently (recall that newly-automated tasks are replaced
after (1 − n)/∆ units of time). As a result, automating tasks renders further automation more
                       CD (n) continues to be increasing in n. This is for two reasons: first, as
profitable. Moreover, vN
before, the productivity effect ensures that the effective wage in new tasks, wN (n), is decreasing
                                                                        n
in n; and second, because newly-created tasks are automated after       ∆   units of time, an increase
in n increases the present discounted value of profits from new tasks. These observations imply
                                                                     CD (n) and κ ι(n)v CD (n) would
that, if ι(n) were constant, the intersection between the curves κN vN           I     I
correspond to an unstable BGP.
   Economically, the instability is a consequence of the fact that, in contrast to our baseline model
(and the socially planned economy that we will describe in the next subsection), here innovation
incentives depend on the total revenue that a technology generates rather than its incremental
value created by their innovation (the difference between these revenues and the revenues that
the replaced technology generated). In our baseline model, the key force ensuring stability is that
incentives to automate are shaped by the cost difference between producing a task with capital or
with labor—by lowering the effective wage at the next tasks to be automated, current automation
reduces the incremental value of additional automation. This force is absent when innovators
destroy the profits of previous technology monopolists because they no longer care about the cost
of production with the technology that they are replacing.

5.3   Welfare

We study welfare from two complementary perspectives. First, in Appendix B we discuss the
socially optimal allocation in the presence of endogenous technology and characterize how this
allocation can be decentralized. One of the main insights from Proposition 6 is that the expected
path for factor prices determines the incentives to automate and create new tasks. We show that a
planner would also allocate scientists according to the same principle—guided by the cost savings


                                                  33
that each technology grants to firms. Although similar to the efficient allocation of scientists in
this regard, the decentralized equilibrium is typically inefficient because the technology monopolists
neither capture the full benefits from the new tasks they create nor internalize how their innovation
affects other existing and future technology monopolists.
   The second perspective is more novel and relevant to current debates about automation reducing
employment and its policy implications. We examine whether an exogenous increase in automation
could reduce welfare. Even though automation expands productivity—a force which always raises
welfare—it also reduces employment. When the labor market is fully competitive as in our baseline
model, this reduction in employment has no first-order welfare cost for the representative household
(which was previously setting the marginal cost of labor supply equal to the wage). As a result,
automation increases overall welfare. Next suppose that there are labor market frictions. In
particular, suppose that there exists an upward-sloping quasi–labor supply schedule, Lqs (ω), which
constrains the level of employment, so that L ≤ Lqs (ω). This quasi-labor supply schedule then
acts in a very similar fashion to the labor supply curve derived in (11) in Section 2, except that
the marginal cost of labor supply is no longer equated to the wage. Crucially, the reduction in
employment resulting from automation now has a negative impact on welfare, and this negative
effect can exceed the positive impact following from the productivity gains, turning automation,
on net, into a negative for welfare.
   The next proposition provides the conditions under which automation can reduce welfare in
the context of our static model with exogenous technology. Our focus on the static model is for
transparency. The same forces are present in the dynamic model and also in the full model with
endogenous technology.

Proposition 9 (Welfare implications of automation) Consider the static economy and sup-

    The first part of the proposition shows that both types of technological improvements increase
welfare when the labor market has no frictions. In this case, automation increases productivity
by substituting cheaper capital for human labor, and this leads to less work for workers, but since
they were previously choosing labor supply optimally, a small reduction in employment does not
have a first-order impact on welfare, and overall welfare increases. The implications of the creation
of new tasks are similar.
    The situation is quite different in the presence of labor market frictions, however, as shown
in the second part. Automation again increases productivity and reduces employment. But now,
because workers are constrained in their labor supply choices, the lower employment that results
from automation has a first-order negative effect on their welfare. Consequently, automation can
reduce welfare if the productivity gains, captured by the first term, are not sufficiently large to
compensate for the second, negative term. Interestingly, new tasks increase welfare even more than
before, because they not only raise productivity but also expand employment, and by the same
logic, the increase in labor supply has a welfare benefit for the workers (since they were previously
constrained in their employment).
    An important implication of this analysis emphasized further in Appendix B is that when labor
market frictions are present and the direction of technological change is endogenized, there will
be a force towards excessive automation. In particular, in this case, assuming that labor market
frictions also constrain the social planner’s choices, the decentralized equilibrium would have too
much effort being devoted to improving automation relative to what she would like—because the
social planner recognizes that additional automation has a negative effect through employment.


6    Conclusion
As automation, robotics and AI technologies are advancing rapidly, concerns that new technologies
will render labor redundant have intensified. This paper develops a comprehensive framework in
which these forces can be analyzed and contrasted. At the center of our model is a task-based
framework. Automation is modeled as the (endogenous) expansion of the set of tasks that can be
performed by capital, replacing labor in tasks that it previously produced. The main new feature
of our framework is that, in addition to automation, there is another type of technological change
complementing labor. In our model, this takes the form of the introduction of new, more complex
versions of existing tasks, and it is assume that labor has a comparative advantage in these new
tasks. We characterize the structure of equilibrium in such a model, showing how, given factor


                                                 35
prices, the allocation of tasks between capital and labor is determined both by available technology
and the endogenous choices of firms between producing with capital or labor.
   One attractive feature of task-based models is that they highlight the link between factor prices
and the range of tasks allocated to factors: when the equilibrium range of tasks allocated to capital
increases (for example, as a result of automation), the wage relative to the rental rate and the labor
share decline, and the equilibrium wage rate may also fall. Conversely, as the equilibrium range of
tasks allocated to labor increases, the opposite result obtains. In our model, because the supply of
labor is elastic, automation tends to reduce employment, while the creation of new tasks increases
employment. These results highlight that, while both types of technological changes undergird
economic growth, they have very different implications for the factor distribution of income and
employment.
   Our full model endogenizes the direction of research towards automation and the creation of new
tasks. If in the long run capital is very cheap relative to labor, automation technologies will advance
rapidly and labor will become redundant. However, when the long-run rental rate of capital is not
so low relative to labor, our framework generates a BGP in which both types of innovation go hand-
in-hand. Moreover in this case, under reasonable assumptions, the dynamic equilibrium is unique
and converges to the BGP. Underpinning this stability result is the impact of relative factor prices
on the direction of technological change. The task-based framework—differently from the standard
models of directed technological change which are based on factor-augmenting technologies—implies
that as a factor becomes cheaper, this not only influences the range of tasks allocated to it, but also
generates incentives for the introduction of technologies that allow firms to utilize this factor more
intensively. These economic incentives then imply that by reducing the effective cost of labor in
the least complex tasks, automation discourages further automation and generates a self-correcting
force towards stability.
   We further show that, though market forces ensure the stability of the BGP, they do not
necessarily generate the efficient composition of technology. If the elastic labor supply relationship
results from rents (so that there is a wedge between the wage and the opportunity cost of labor),
there is an important new distortion: because firms make automation decisions according to the
wage rate, not the lower opportunity cost of labor, there will be a natural bias towards excessive
automation.
   In addition to claims about automation leading to the demise of labor, several commentators
are concerned about the inequality implications of automation and related new technologies. We
study this question by extending our model so that high-skill labor has a comparative advantage
in new tasks relative to low-skill labor. In this case, both automation (which squeezes out tasks
previously performed by low-skill labor) and the creation of new tasks (which directly benefits
high-skill labor) increase inequality. Nevertheless, the long-term implications of the creation of
new tasks could be very different, because new tasks are later standardized and used by low-skill
labor. If this standardization effect is sufficiently powerful, there exists a BGP in which not only
the factor distribution of income (between capital and labor) but also inequality between the two


                                                  36
skill types stays constant.
     We consider our paper to be a first step towards a systematic investigation of different types of
technological changes that impact capital and labor differentially. Several areas of research appear
fruitful based on this first step. First, our model imposes that it is always the tasks at the bottom
that are automated; in reality, it may be those in the middle (e.g., Acemoglu and Autor, 2001).
Incorporating the possibility of such “middling tasks” being automated is an important general-
ization, though ensuring a pattern of productivity growth consistent with balanced growth is more
challenging. Second, there may be technological barriers to the automation of certain tasks and the
creation of new tasks across industries (e.g., Polanyi, 1966, Autor, Levy and Murnane, 2003). An
interesting step is to construct realistic models in which the sectoral composition of tasks performed
by capital and labor as well as technology evolves endogenously and is subject to industry-level
technological constraints (e.g., on the feasibility or speed of automation). Third, in this paper we
have focused on the creation of new labor-intensive tasks as the type of technological change that
complements labor and plays a countervailing role against automation. Another interesting area is
to theoretically and empirically investigate different types of technologies that may complement la-
bor. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, our model highlights the need for additional empirical
evidence on how automation impacts employment and wages (which we investigate in Acemoglu
and Restrepo, 2017) and how the incentives for automation and the creation of new tasks respond
to policies, factor prices and supplies.


Appendix A: Proofs
General Model

The analysis in the text was carried out under Assumption 2, which imposed η → 0 or ζ = 1, and
significantly simplified some of the key expressions. Throughout the Appendix, we relax Assumption
2 and replace it with:

Assumption 2′ One of the following three conditions holds: (i) η → 0, or (ii) ζ = 1, or (iii)
         2+2σ+η
  γ(N −1)
   γ(N )          > |σ − ζ|.

     All of our qualitative results remain true and will be proved under this more general assumption.
Intuitively, the conditions in Assumption 2 ensured homotheticity (see footnote 11). Assumption
 ′
2 , on the other hand, requires that the departure from homotheticity is small relative to the inverse
of the productivity gains from new tasks (where γ(N )/γ(N −1) measures these productivity gains).

which again simplifies to the ideal price index condition in the text, (10), under Assumption 2.

Proofs from Section 2

Proof of Proposition 1: We prove Proposition 1 under the more general Assumption 2′ .
   To prove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium, we proceed in three steps. First, we
show that I ∗ , N and K, determine unique equilibrium values for R, W and Y , thus allowing us to
define the function ω(I ∗ , N, K) representing the relative demand for labor, which was introduced
in the text. Second, we prove a lemma which ensures that ω(I ∗ , N, K) is decreasing in I ∗ (and
                                              e is nondecreasing in ω and conclude that there is a
increasing in N ). Third, we show that min{I, I}
                                                e and ω ∗ = ω(I ∗ , N, K). This pair uniquely determines
unique pair {ω ∗ , I ∗ } such that I ∗ = min{I, I}
the equilibrium relative factor prices and the range of tasks that get effectively automated.
   Step 1: Consider I ∗ , N and K such that I ∗ ∈ (N − 1, N ). Then, R, W and Y satisfy the
system of equations given by capital and labor market clearing, equations (A2) and (A3), and the
ideal price index, equation (A4).

                                                                       38
   Taking the ratio of (A2) and (A3), we obtain

                            L RK (I − N + 1)c (R)       u   ζ−σ R −ζ   K

In view of the fact that Ls is increasing and the function cu (x)ζ−σ x−ζ is decreasing in x (as it can
be verified directly by differentiation), it follows that the left-hand side is decreasing in W and
increasing in R . Therefore, (A5) defines an upward-sloping relationship between W and R, which
we refer to as the relative demand curve.
   On the other hand, inspection of equation (A4) readily shows that this equation gives a
downward-sloping locus between R and W as shown in Figure A1, which we refer to as the ideal
price curve.
   Provided that an intersection exists and is unique, for a given I ∗ , N and K, the intersection
point between the relative demand and the ideal price curves determines the equilibrium factor
prices.
   Because the relative demand curve is upward sloping and the ideal price index curve is downward
sloping, there can be at most one intersection. To prove that there always exists an intersection,
observe that limx→0 cu (x)ζ−σ x−ζ = ∞, and that limx→∞ cu (x)ζ−σ x−ζ = 0. These observations
imply that as W → 0, the numerator of (A5) limits to infinity, and hence, so must the denominator,
i.e., R → 0. This proves that the relative demand curve starts from the origin. Similarly, as
W → ∞, the numerator of (A5) limits to zero, and so must the denominator (i.e., R → ∞). This
then implies that the relative demand curve goes to infinity as R → ∞. Thus, the upward-sloping
relative demand curve necessarily starts below and ends above the ideal price curve, which ensures
that there always exists an intersection between these curves. The unique intersection defines the
                                                                                   W
equilibrium values of W and R, and therefore the function ω(I ∗ , N, K) =          RK .

   Step 2: This step follows directly from the following lemma, which we prove in Appendix B.

Lemma A1 If Assumption 2 , ω(I ∗ , N, K) is decreasing in I ∗ and is increasing in N .

   Although the general proof for this lemma is long (and thus relegated to Appendix B), the
lemma is trivial under Assumption 2. In that case, equation (A5) yields:
                                                             RN
                               ∗       σ̂   s    ∗           I∗   γ(i)σ̂−1 di 1−σ̂
                           ω(I , N, K) L (ω(I , N, K)) =                     K     .
                                                             I∗   −N +1
Taking logs, we obtain equation (13) in the main text, which implies that ω(I ∗ , N, K) is increasing
in N and decreasing in I ∗ .
    Step 3: We now show that I ∗ = min{I, I}     e is uniquely defined. Since γ(I)  e = ωK, Ie is
                                        e is nondecreasing in ω. Consider the pair of equations
increasing in ω, and thus I ∗ = min{I, I}
                                   e plotted in Figure 3. Because ω = ω(I ∗ , N, K) is decreasing in
ω = ω(I ∗ , N, K) and I ∗ = min{I, I}
                     e is increasing in ω, there exists at most a single pair (ω, I ∗ ) satisfying these
I ∗ and I ∗ = min{I, I}
two equations (or a single intersection in the figure).
   To prove existence, we again verify the appropriate boundary conditions. Suppose that I ∗ →
N − 1. Then from (A2), R → 0, while W > 0, and thus ω → ∞. This ensures that the curve
                                        e in Figure 3. Since I ∗ = min{I, I},
ω(I ∗ , N, K) starts above I ∗ = min{I, I}                                e it is bounded above
by I, and cannot be below ω = ω(I ∗ , N, K) at I ∗ = I, ensuring that there must exist a unique
intersection between the two curves over the interval I ∗ ∈ (N − 1, I], which completes the proof of
the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium.
   Finally, when Assumption 2 holds, the market clearing conditions, (8) and (9), imply

which combined with (10) yields (12), completing the proof of Proposition 1. 

Proofs from Section 3

Lemma A2 (Derivation of Figure 4) Suppose that Assumptions 1′ and 2 hold. Consider a
path of technology where n(t) → n and g(t) → g, consumption grows at the rate g and the Euler
equation (18) holds. Then, there exist ρmin < ρ < ρmax such that:

  1. If ρ ∈ [ρmin , ρ], there is a decreasing function n
                                                       e(ρ) : [ρmin , ρ] → (0, 1] such that, for all
      n > n
          e(ρ) we have wI (n) > ρ + δ + θg > wN (n), and ρ + δ + θg = wN (e
                                                                          n(ρ)). Moreover,
      n
      e(ρmin ) = 1 and n
                       e(ρ) = 0.

  2. If ρ ∈ [ρ, ρmax ], there is an increasing function n(ρ) : [ρ, ρmax ] → (0, 1] such that, for all
      n > n(ρ) we have wI (n) > ρ + δ + θg > wN (n) and ρ + δ + θg = wI (n(ρ)). Moreover,
      n(ρmax ) = 1 and n(ρ) = 0.

  3. If ρ > ρmax , for all n ∈ [0, 1] we have ρ + δ + θg > wI (n) ≥ wN (n), which implies that
      automation is not profitable for any n ∈ [0, 1].


                                                      40
  4. If ρ < ρmin , for all n ∈ [0, 1] we have wI (n) ≥ wN (n) > ρ + δ + θg, which implies that new
     tasks do not increase aggregate output and will not be adopted for any n ∈ [0, 1].

Proof. Because consumption grows at the rate g and the Euler equation (18) holds, we have

                                                    R(t) = ρ + δ + θg.

The effective wages wI (n) and wN (n) are then determined the ideal price index condition, (A4), as

Because the function        1−σ c (x)         is increasing, we have ρ > ρmin .
   Using the ideal price index condition, (A4), we define n

   Differentiating the above expression with respect to ρ shows that n
                                                                     e(ρ) is decreasing. Moreover,
n
e(ρmin ) = 1 and n
                 e(ρ) = 0, so the function is well-defined for ρ ∈ [ρmin , ρ].
   For n = n
           e(ρ), we have wI (e                        n(ρ)). Thus, the formulas for wI′ (n) and
                             n(ρ)) > ρ + δ + θg = wN (e
 ′ (N ) show that, for ρ ∈ [ρ
wN                            min , ρ] and starting at n
                                                       e(ρ), the curve wN (n) decreases in n and the
curve wI (n) is increasing in n. Thus, for all n > n
                                                   e(ρ), we have

                              wI (n) > wI (e
                                           n(ρ)) > ρ + δ + θg = wN (e
                                                                    n(ρ)) > wN (n),

as claimed. On the other hand, for all n < n
                                           e(ρ), we have wN (n) > ρ + δ + θg.
   To prove part 2, define ρmax > ρ as

                                              ρmax + δ + θg = wI (1).

To show that ρ < ρmax , a similar argument establishes
                                                      Z 1

                                                  1−σ 0
                                                   1 u
                                                =     c (ρ + δ + θg)1−σ .
                                                  1−σ
                              1 u     1−σ
Because the function         1−σ c (x)      is increasing, we have ρ < ρmax .
   Using (A6), we define the function n(ρ) implicitly as
                                                                 Z       n(ρ)
                    1−σ̂                u              1−σ
                B          = (1 − n(ρ))c (ρ + δ + θg)        +                  cu ((ρ + δ + θg)/γ(i))1−σ di.
                                                                     0

Differentiating this expression with respect to ρ shows that n(ρ) is increasing in ρ on [ρ, ρmax ].
Moreover, n(ρmax ) = 1 and n(ρ) = 0, so the function is well-defined for all ρ ≥ ρ.
   For n = n(ρ), we have wI (e                        n(ρ)). Thus, the formulas for wI′ (n) and
                             n(ρ)) = ρ + δ + θg > wN (e
 ′ (n) show that, for ρ ∈ [ρ, ρ
wN                              max ] and starting at n(ρ), the curve wN (n) decreases in n and the
curve wI (n) is increasing in n. Thus, for all n > n(ρ), we have

                              wI (n) > wI (n(ρ)) = ρ + δ + θg > wN (n(ρ)) > wN (n),

as claimed. On the other hand, for all n < n(ρ), we have wI (n) < ρ + δ + θg. In this region we
have n∗ = n(ρ) > n, and not all automated tasks are produced with capital.
   To prove part 3, note that for ρ > ρmax , we have

                                            ρ + δ + θg > wI (1) > wN (1).

The expressions for wI′ (n) and wN
                                 ′ (n) show that, in this region, as n decreases, so does w (n). Thus
                                                                                           I
ρ + δ + θg > wI (n) > wN (n), and for all these values we have n∗ = 1, and no task will be produced
with capital.

   To prove part 4 note that for ρ < ρmin , we have

                                        ρ + δ + θg < wN (1) < wI (1).

The expressions for wI′ (n) and wN
                                 ′ (N ) show that, in this region, as n decreases, both w (n) w (n)
                                                                                         N     N
increase. Thus ρ + δ + θg < wN (n) < wI (n) and for these values of ρ new tasks do not raise
aggregate output.
                                                                                                              ′
   Proof of Proposition 4: We prove this proposition under the more general Assumption 2 .
   We start by deriving necessary conditions on N (t) and I(t) such that the economy admits a
BGP, and then show that these are also sufficient for establishing the existence of a unique and
globally stable BGP.
   The capital market clearing condition implies that:
                                                      K(t)
                                cu (R(t))ζ−σ R(t)−ζ         = (1 − n∗ (t)).
                                                      Y (t)
                                                                                                           K(t)
Because in a BGP the rental rate of capital, R(t), and the capital to aggregate output ratio,              Y (t) ,
are constant, we must have n∗ (t) = n, or in other words, labor and capital must perform a fixed
measure of tasks.
   Lemma A2 shows that we have four possibilities corresponding to the four cases in Proposition
4, each of which we now discuss in turn.
   1. All tasks are automated: n∗ (t) = n = 0. Because in this case capital performs all
tasks, Lemma A2 implies that we must have ρ < ρ and I(t) = N (t). In this part of the parameter
                                                                                  AK −δ−ρ
space, net output is given by AK K, and the economy grows at the rate                θ    .   The transversality
                                                          AK −δ−ρ
condition, (19), is satisfied if and only if AK − δ >        θ    —or     r > g. Moreover, positive growth
imposes AK > δ + ρ. The (generalized version of the) ideal price index condition, equation (A4),
                                 1−σ̂                              1−σ̂
then implies that R = cu−1 (B 1−σ ), and thus AK = cu−1 (B 1−σ ). Under Assumption 2, this last
expression further simplifies to AK = B as claimed in the text.
   We now show that The necessary conditions in this case are sufficient to generate balanced
growth. Suppose ρ < ρ and I(t) = N (t) so that n∗ (t) = 0. Because all tasks all tasks are
produced with capital, we also have FL = 0, and thus the representative household supplies zero
labor. Consequently, the dynamic equilibrium can be characterized as the solution to the system
of differential equations
                                 Ċ(t) 1
                                      = (AK − δ − ρ)
                                 C(t) θ
                                                                        θ−1
                                 K̇(t) =(AK − δ)K(t) − C(t)eν(0)         θ    ,

together with the initial condition, K(0) > 0 and the trasversality condition, (19). We next show
that there is a unique solution to the system, and this solution converges to the full automation
BGP described in the proposition.
               C
   Define e
          c=   K.   The behavior of e
                                    c is governed by the differential equation,
                            ė
                            c(t)  1                                   θ−1
                                                             c(t)eν(0) θ .
                                 = (AK − δ − ρ) − (AK − δ) + e
                            e
                            c(t)  θ

                                                     43
This differential equation has a stable rest point at zero and an unstable rest point at cB =
                              1−θ
 Ak − δ − 1θ (AK − δ − ρ) eν(0) θ > 0. There are therefore three possible equilibrium paths for
e
c(t): (i) it immediately jumps to cB and stays there; (ii) it starts at [0, cB ) and converges to zero;
(iii) it starts at (cB , ∞) and diverges. The second and third possibilities violate, respectively, the
transversality condition (19) (because the capital stock would grow at the rate Ak − δ, implying r =
g), and the resource constraint (when e
                                      c(t) = ∞). The first possibility, on the other hand, satisfies
the transversality condition (since asymptotically it involves r > g), and yields an equilibrium path.
In this path the economy converges to a unique BGP in which C(t) and K(t) grow at a constant
       AK −δ−ρ
rate      θ    ,   thus also establishing uniqueness and global stability.
   2. Interior equilibrium in which automated tasks are immediately produced with
capital: n∗ (t) = n(t) = n ∈ (0, 1). Because capital performs all automated tasks, Lemma A2
implies that n > max{n(ρ), n                  ˙
                           e(ρ)} and Ṅ (t) = I(t). Moreover, because in this candidate BGP R(t)
is constant, the general form of the ideal price index condition, (A4), implies that W (t)/γ(I(t))
                                                     ˙
must be constant too, and this is only possible if I(t)  = ∆. Consequently, the growth rate of
aggregate output is A∆. Finally, the transversality condition, (19), is satisfied given the condition
ρ + (θ − 1)A∆ > 0 in this part of the proposition. Lemma A2 then verifies that n∗ (t) = n >
n(ρ). Substituting the market clearing conditions for capital and labor, (A2) and (A3), into (1),
(2) and (3) and then subtracting the costs of intermediates, we obtain net output as F (k, L; n).
(When Assumption 2 holds, F (k, L; n) is given by the CES aggregate in equation (16)). F (k, L; n)
exhibits constant returns to scale, and because factor markets are competitive, we also have R(t) =
FK (k(t), L(t); n) and w(t) = FL (k(t), L(t); n).
   To establish uniqueness, let wB denote the BGP value of the wage rate, kB the BGP value of
the normalized capital stock, cB the BGP value of normalized consumption, LB the BGP value of
employment, and RB the BGP value of the rental rate of capital. These variables are, by definition,
all constant. Then, the Euler equation, (18), implies
                                                                                        kB
   RB = ρ + δ + θg, and because RB = FK (kB , LB ; n), we must also have                LB   = φ, where φ is the
unique solution to
                                          FK (φ, 1; n) = ρ + δ + θg.
Lemma B1 in Appendix B shows that, for n ≥ max{n(ρ), n
                                                     e(ρ)}, F (φ, 1; n) satisfies the following
Inada conditions,

                   lim FK (φ, 1; n) >ρ + δ + θg               lim FK (φ, 1; n) <ρ + δ + θg,
                   φ→0                                        φ→∞

which ensure that φ is well defined. Combining labor supply condition, (17), with the resource
                                                              FL (φ,1)
constraint, (20), we obtain (F (φ, 1; n) − (δ + g)φ)LB =      ν ′ (LB ) .   The left-hand side of this equation
is linear and increasing in L (the concavity of F in k implies that F (φ, 1; n) > φFK (φ, 1; n) >
(δ + g)φ), while the right-hand side is decreasing in L. This ensures that there exists a unique value
LB > 0 that satisfies this equation, and also pins down the value of the normalized capital stock
as kB = φLB . Finally, cB is uniquely determined from the resource constraint, (20), as
                                                                              1−θ
                                  cB = (F (φ, 1; n) − (δ + g)φ)LB eν(LB )      θ    .

                                                      44
Note also that there cannot be any BGP with LB = 0, since this would imply cB = 0 from the
                                                              θ−1            FL (φ,1;n)
                                                                  ν(0)
resource constraint, (20). But then we would have ν ′ (0)e     θ         <       cB     ,   which contradicts the
labor supply optimality condition, (17). Hence, the only possible BGP is one in which k(t) = kB ,
c(t) = cB and L(t) = LB > 0. Moreover, in view of the fact that ρ + (θ − 1)A∆ > 0, this
candidate BGP satisfies the transversality condition (19), and is indeed the unique BGP. The
proof of the global stability of this unique BGP is similar to the analysis of global stability of the
neoclassical growth model with endogenous labor supply, and for completeness, we provide the
details in Appendix B.
   Interior equilibrium in which automated tasks are eventually but not immediately
produced with capital: n∗ (t) = n(ρ) > n(t). Because capital does not immediately perform
all automated tasks, Lemma A2 implies that n(t) < n(ρ) and ρ > ρ. Moreover, because R(t) is
constant, the ideal price index condition, (A4), implies that W (t)/γ(I ∗ (t)) must be constant too.
Thus, to generate constant growth of wages we must have I˙∗ (t) = ∆ ≤ I(t), so that the growth rate
of the economy is given by A∆. Because n∗ (t) = n(ρ), this also implies that Ṅ ∗ (t) = ∆. Finally,
the transversality condition, (19), is satisfied in view of the fact that this part of the proposition
imposes ρ + (θ − 1)A∆ > 0. The uniqueness and global stability of the BGP follow an identical
arguments to part 2, with the only modification that n(ρ) plays the role of n in the preceding proof.
   All tasks are always produced with labor: n∗ (t) = 1. Because labor performs all tasks,
Lemma A2 now implies ρ > ρmin and n(t) ≥ 1, while the ideal price index condition, (A4), imposes
that W (t)/γ(N (t)) must be constant. Thus, to generate constant wage, aggregate output and
capital growth, we must have Ṅ (t) = ∆, with ρ + (θ − 1)∆ > 0 (where the last condition again
ensures transversality). To show sufficiency of these conditions for balanced growth, let wB denote
the BGP value of the normalized wage, which is defined by
                                 Z 1
                                     cu (wB /γ(i))1−σ = B 1−σ̂ .
                                      0

Consequently, net output is given by F (k, L; n) = wB γ(N (t) − 1)L(t), and thus depends linearly
on labor and is independent of capital. This implies K(t) = 0 and C(t) = wB γ(N (t) − 1)L(t). The
representative household’s labor supply condition, (17), implies that in this BGP

                                                wB γ(N (t) − 1)    1
                                 ν ′ (L(t)) =                   =      ,
                                                     C(t)         L(t)

which uniquely defines a BGP employment level LB . Because this allocation also satisfies the
transversality condition (in view of the fact that ρ + (θ − 1)A∆ > 0), it defines a unique BGP. Its
global stability follows by noting that starting with any positive capital stock, K(0), the represen-
tative household chooses zero investment and converges to this path. 

            e(ρ) (and ρ < ρ), we have κI vI (n) > 0 > κN vN (n). Moreover, in this region, vI (n) is
      decreasing and vN (n) is increasing in n.

Proof. See Appendix B.
   Proof of Proposition 6: We first show that all the scenarios described in the proposition are
BGPs with endogenous technology. We then turn to analyzing the stability of interior BGPs.
   Part 1: Characterization of the BGPs with endogenous technology.
   Suppose that S < Se so that Lemma A3 applies. We consider the two cases described in the
proposition separately.
   1. ρ < ρ: Suppose that n < n
                              e(ρ). As depicted in the left panel of Figure 8 and shown in Lemma
A3, in this region vI (n) is positive and decreasing in n, and vN (n) is negative and increasing in
n. Thus, the only possible BGP in this region must be one with n(t) = 0. No interior BGP exists
with n ∈ (0, n
             e(ρ)). Proposition 4 shows that for ρ < ρ, a path for technology with n(t) = 0 yields
balanced growth. Moreover, along this path all tasks are produced with capital, which implies that
VI (t) = VN (t) = 0. Thus, a path for technology in which n(t) = 0 is consistent with the equilibrium
allocation of scientists. The resulting BGP is an equilibrium with endogenous technology.
   2. ρ > ρ: Suppose n(t) ≤ n(ρ). Then, we have n∗ (t) = n(ρ) and therefore vN (n) = vN (n(ρ))
and vI (n) = vI (n(ρ)). Moreover, Lemma A3 implies that κN vN (n(ρ)) > κI vI (n(ρ)) and vI (n(ρ)) =
                                      e Therefore, in this region this region we always have that
O(g) with g small (again because S < S).
all scientists will be employed to create new tasks, and thus ṅ > 0 (and is uniformly bounded away
from zero). But this contradicts n(t) < n(ρ). Suppose, instead, that n(t) > n(ρ). Then, Proposition
4 shows that the economy admits a BGP only if n(t) = n. Thus, a necessary and sufficient
condition for an interior BGP is (29) in the text. Consequently, each interior BGP corresponds to
a solution to this equation in (n(ρ), 1). Lemma A3 shows that at n, κN vN (n) is above κI vI (n), and
                                       κI
κI vI (n) = O(g). Moreover, when       κN   = 0, the entire curve κN vN (n) is above the curve κI vI (n). As
this ratio increases, the curve κI vI (n) rotates up, and eventually crosses κN vN (n) at a point to the
right of n(ρ). This defines the threshold κ. Above this threshold, there exists another threshold κ
                κI
such that if    κN   > κ, there is a unique intersection of κI vI (n) and κN vN (n). (Note that one could
have κ = κ). By continuity, there exists Ŝ such that, the thresholds κ and κ are defined for all
S < Ŝ (recall that g = A κκII+κ
                              κN
                                  S). It then follows that for S < min{S,  e Ŝ} and κI > κ, there
                                N                                                     κN
                                                                                              e Ŝ}
exists a unique BGP, which is interior and satisfies n(t) = n∗ (t) = nB ∈ (n, 1). For S < min{S,
           κI
and κ <    κN    < κ (provided that κ < κ), the economy admits multiple BGPs with endogenous

                                                       46
                                 e Ŝ} and
technology. Finally, for S < min{S,                   κI
                                                           < κ, the only potential BGP in this case is the
                                                      κN
corner one with n(t) = 1, which we also described in Proposition 4. Because κN vN (1) > κI vI (1),
this path for technology is consistent with the equilibrium allocation of scientists and provides a
BGP with endogenous technology.
    Part 2: Stability analysis.
                                                                       e Ŝ} and
    The stability analysis applies to the case in which ρ > ρ, S < min{S,                    κI
                                                                                                  > κ. In this
                                                                                             κN
case, the economy admits a unique BGP defined by nB ∈ (n(ρ), 1). We denote by cB , kB and LB
the values of (normalized) consumption and capital, and employment in this BGP.
    Proof of global stability when θ = 0: Because θ = 0, we also have R = ρ + δ, and capital
adjusts immediately and its equilibrium stock only depends on n, which becomes the unique state
variable of the model.
    Let v = κI vI − κN vN . Now starting from any n(0), an equilibrium with endogenous technology
is given by the path of (n, v) such that the evolution of the state variable is given by

                                         ṅ = κN S − (κN + κI )G (v) S;

and the evolution of the difference of the normalized value functions, v, satisfies the forward looking
equation:
                                                                              
      ρv − v̇ = bκI cu (ρ + δ)ζ−σ − cu (wI )ζ−σ − bκN cu (wN )ζ−σ − cu (ρ + δ)ζ−σ + O(g);

and in addition the transversality condition (19) holds.
    When g = 0, the locus for v̇ = 0 crosses zero from below at a unique point (recall that we are in
the parameter region where there is a unique BGP). By continuity there exists a threshold S̆ such
that, for S < S̆, the locus for v̇ = 0 crosses zero from below at a unique point nB , which denotes
the BGP value for n(t) derived from (29).




Figure A2: Phase diagram and global saddle path stability when θ = 0. The figure plots the locus for v̇ = 0 and
the locus for ṅ = 0. The unique BGP is located at their interception.


    We now analyze the stability properties of the system and show that the BGP is globally saddle-
path stable. Figure A2 presents the phase diagram of the system in (v, n). The locus for v̇ = 0

                                                         47
crosses v = 0 at nB from below only once. This follows from the fact that κI vI (n) cuts κN vN (n)
from below at nB as shown in Figure 8. The laws of motion of the two variables, v and n, take the
form shown in the phase diagram.31 This implies the existence of the unique stable arm, and also
establishes that there are no equilibrium paths that are not along this stable arm. In particular,
all paths above the stable arm feature v̇ > 0 and eventually n → 0 and v → ∞, and since vN is
positive, vI → ∞. But this violates the transversality condition, (27). Similarly, all paths below
the stable arm feature v̇ < 0 and eventually n → 1 and v → −∞, and thus vN → ∞, once again
violating the transversality condition.
       Proof of local stability of the unique BGP when θ > 0:                    Appendix B shows that there
exists a threshold Š such that the BGP in this case is locally stable for S < Š, and thus the
                                                      e Ŝ, S̆, Š}. 
conclusions of the proposition follow setting S = min{S,

    This can also be verified locally from the fact that the behavior of n and v near the BGP can be approximated by
the linear system ṅ = −(κN + κI )G′ (0)Sv and v̇ = ρv − Q, where Q > 0 denotes the derivative of −M κI cu (wI )ζ−σ +
M κN cu (wN )ζ−σ with respect to n (this derivative is positive because κI vI (n) cuts κN vN (n) from below at nB ).
Because the eigenvalues of the characteristic polynomial of this system add up to ρ > 0, and their product is
−Q(κN + κI )G′ (0)S < 0, there is one positive and one negative eigenvalue.

Results
Details of the Empirical Analysis

Here we provide information about the data used in constructing Figures 1 and 9. We also provide
a regression analysis documenting the robustness of the patterns illustrated in these figures.
   Data: We use data on the demographic characteristics of workers and employment counts in
each of the 330 consistently defined occupations proposed by David Dorn (see http://www.ddorn.
net/data.htm). Our sources of data are the U.S. Censuses for 1980, 1990 and 2000, and the
American Community Survey for 2007. We focus on the set of workers between 16 and 64 years of
age.
   Our measure of new job titles is taken from Lin (2011), who computes the share of new job
titles within each occupation for 1980, 1990 and 2000. Lin defines new job titles by comparing
changes across waves of the Dictionary of Occupational Titles, and also by comparing the 1990
Census Index of Occupations with its 2000 counterpart. The data is available for 329 occupa-
tions in 1980, and 330 occupations for 1990 and 2000. The data are available from his website
https://sites.google.com/site/jeffrlin/newwork.
   Detailed Analysis for Figure 1: To document the role of new job titles in employment
growth, we estimate the regression

                             ln Eit+10 − ln Eit = βNit + δ t + Γt Xit + εit .                    (B1)

Here, the dependent variable is the percent change in employment from year t to t + 10 in each
occupation i. We stack the data for t = 1980, 1990, 2000. For t = 2000, we use the change from
2000 to 2007 as the dependent variable and re-scale it to a 10-year change. In all regressions
we include a full set of decadal effects δ t , and in some models we also control for differential
decadal trends that vary depending on observable characteristics of each occupation, Γt Xit . These
characteristics include the share of workers in different 5-year age brackets and from different races
(Black, Hispanic), and the share of foreign and female workers. These covariates flexibly control for
demographic changes that may affect the labor supply that is relevant for each occupation. Finally,
εit is an error term. Throughout, all standard errors are robust against arbitrary heteroskedasticity
and serial correlation of the error term within occupations.
   The coefficient of interest is β, which represents the additional employment growth in occupa-
tions with a large share of new job titles, Nit .
   Panel A in Table B1 presents estimates of equation (B1). Column 1 contains no additional
covariates (the number of observations in this column is 989. We miss one observation because
Lin’s measure only covers 329 occupations in 1980). Our estimates indicate that occupations with
10 percentage points more new job titles at the beginning of each decade grew 5.05% faster over the
decade (standard error= 1.29%). If occupations with more new job titles did not grow any faster
than the benchmark category with no novel jobs, employment growth from 1980 to 2007 would

                                                    B-1
have been, on average, 8.66% instead of the actual 17.5%, implying that approximately 8.84% of
the 17.5% growth is accounted for by new job titles as reported at the bottom rows of the panel.

Notes: The table presents 10-years stacked-differences estimates (Panel A) and long-differences estimates (Panel
B) of the share of new job titles in an occupation on subsequent employment growth. The bottom row in each
panel reports the observed growth and the share explained by growth in occupations with more new job titles.
The bottom rows indicate additional covariates included in each model. In column 5 we reweight the data using
the baseline share of employment in each occupation in 1980, and in column 6 we exclude three large employment
categories that are outliers in the model of column 5. These include office supervisors, office clerks, and production
supervisors. Standard errors robust against heteroskedasticity and serial correlation within occupations are presented
in parentheses.


    In column 2 we control for the log of employment at the beginning of the decade (year t). The
coefficient of interest increases slightly to 0.560 and continues to be precisely estimated. The log of
employment at year t appears with a negative coefficient, which indicates that smaller occupations
tend to grow more over time. The quantitative contribution of new tasks and job titles remains


                                                           B-2
very similar to column 1, increasing slightly to 9.8%.
   In column 3 we control for the trends that depend on the demographic covariates described
above, which have little effect on the quantitative results. In column 4, we also control for the
average years of schooling among workers in each occupation at the beginning of the decade.
Although this covariate reduces the magnitude of the coefficient of the share of new job titles, our
estimate for β remains highly significant. The contribution of new job titles is now estimated at
6.62% out of the 17.5% growth between 1980 and 2007.
   Column 5 repeats the specification of column 4, but this time we reweight the data by the 1980
share of employment in each occupation. This weakens the relationship of interest, and the share of
novel tasks and jobs is no longer statistically significant. However, this lack of significance is driven
by a few large occupations that are outliers in the estimated relationship. (In contrast, there are
no major outliers in the unweighted regressions reported in columns 1-4). These outliers include
office supervisors, office clerks, and production supervisors; three occupations that had combined
employment of about 4 million workers in 1980 and have been contracting since then. Though these
occupations introduced a significant number of new job titles in 1980, they shed a large amount
of workers in the subsequent years. In column 6, we exclude these three occupations from our
analysis, and obtain a similar pattern to that of column 4.
   Finally, in Panel B, we present a set of regressions, which are analogous to those in the top
panel, but that focus on a long difference specification between 1980 and 2007. The overall patterns
are very similar, and now the contribution of novel tasks and new job titles to the 17.5% growth
in employment between 1980 and 2007 is between 7.27 and 8.5%.
    Detailed Analysis for Figure 9: To document the presence of some amount of “standard-
ization” of occupations with greater new job titles,

                                   ∆Yit = βNit + δt + Γt Xit + εit .                                (B2)

Here, the dependent variable is the change in the average years of schooling among workers employed
in occupation i and measured over different time horizons (10 years, 20 years or 30 years). We
stack the data for t = 1980, 1990, 2000, but our sample becomes smaller as we measure the change
in average years of schooling over longer periods of time. We again use the ACS dayear 2007. The
covariates and independent variable are the same ones that we used in equation (B1).
   Panel A in Table B2 presents estimates of equation (B2). Columns 1 and 2 present models
in which the dependent variable is the change in average years of education over a 10-year period
(hence, we get 989 observations for 330 occupations). Columns 3 and 4 focus on the change in
average years of education over a 20-year period. Columns 5 and 6 focus on the change in average
years of education over a 30-year period. In the models presented in the even columns we include
a full set of trends that are allowed to vary depending on the composition of employment in each
occupational category.
   Our estimates indicate that, although occupations with more new job titles tend to hire more
skilled workers initially, this pattern slowly reverts over time. Figure 9 shows that, at the time of

Notes: The table presents OLS estimates that explain the change in average years of schooling among workers
employed in a given occupation. These changes are computed over 10 years (Columns 1 and 2), 20 years (Columns
3 and 4) and 30 years (Columns 5 and 6). In Panel A we explain the subsequent change in years of schooling
as a function of share of new job titles in each occupation at the start of the decade. In Panel B we explain the
subsequent change in years of schooling as a function of the years of schooling in each occupation at the start of
the decade. The bottom rows indicate additional covariates included in each model. Standard errors robust against
heteroskedasticity and serial correlation within occupations are presented in parentheses.


their introduction, occupations with 10 percentage points more new job titles hire workers with 0.35
more years of schooling). But our estimates in Column 6 of Table B2 show that this initial difference
in the skill requirements of workers slowly vanishes over time. 30 years after their introduction,
occupations with 10 percentage points more new job titles hire workers with 0.0411 fewer years of
education than the workers hired initially (standard error= 0.0176).
    Relatedly, Panel B of the same table shows a similar pattern when we look at occupations
that start with greater average years of schooling at the beginning of a decade. In particular,
for each decade since 1980, employment growth has been faster in occupations with greater skill
requirements—as measured by the average years of education among employees at the start of each
decade (see Table B1). But estimating a version of (B2) with average years of schooling at the
beginning of the decade on the right-hand side, we find significant mean reversion. For example,
Column 6 shows that occupations that used to hire workers with one additional year of schooling
workers reduce their average years of schooling by 0.149 years relative to baseline after 30 years
(standard error=0.021).

Remaining Proofs from Section 2

We start by providing the proof of Lemma A1.

   Taking total derivatives of this equation with respect to I ∗ , N , we obtain

 Here, ŝ(i) is the share of labor in the production of task i and ŝk is the share of capital in
tasks produced with capital. The last term in the above equation captures the non-homotheticity
introduced by the presence of intermediate goods. When (ŝ(i) − ŝk )(σ − ζ) = 0, the demand system
is homothetic and the results outlined in Lemma A1 follow easily. These cases include the limits
when ζ → 1 (and ŝ(i) = ŝk are constant) or η → 0 (and ŝ(i) = ŝk = 1 are constant).
    When (ŝ(i) − ŝk )(σ − ζ) 6= 0, we also need to take into account the movements in the ideal price
curve in equation (A4) to determine the behavior of relative factor prices.
   Differentiation of (A4) gives:

   We now show that, under the conditions of Lemma A1, we have Θ, PN , PI > 0.
  A sufficient condition for Θ > 0 is that:
   Z N                   ζ−σ                            !      Z N                1−σ !

    I∗               γ(i)                                         I∗            γ(i)
   Z N                1−σ !           Z N                   ζ−σ                                !
                   W                                       W

    I ∗           γ(i)                   I ∗              γ(i)

After canceling common terms on both sides of this inequality, it boils down to:
      Z   N                            ζ−σ                                        Z    N                          ζ−σ
                                  W                                                                            W
              γ(i)ζ−1 cu                        [ŝ(i)(σ − ζ) + ζ] di ≥                      γ(i)ζ−1 cu                     [(ŝ(i) − ŝk )(σ − ζ)] di.
        I∗                       γ(i)                                                   I∗                    γ(i)
This can be rewritten as:
             Z N                  
                      ζ−1 u    W ζ−σ
                  γ(i) c             [ŝ(i)(σ − ζ) + ζ − (ŝ(i) − ŝk )(σ − ζ)] di ≥ 0.
              I∗              γ(i)
The last inequality always holds because ŝ(i)(σ − ζ) + ζ − (ŝ(i) − ŝk )(σ − ζ) = σŝk + ζ(1 − ŝk ) > 0.
   To determine the signs of PN and PI , we regroup terms as follows. First, we group the terms
that are multiplied by ŝk in the expression for PI . To guarantee that these terms add up to a
positive number, a sufficient condition is given by:

   We can use equations (A2) and (A3) to cancel terms on both sides of the above inequality and
obtain the sufficient condition:
                                                                                             1−σ                         !

   Second, we group the terms that are multiplied by ŝ(i) in the expression for PI . To guarantee
that these terms add up to a positive number, a sufficient condition is given by:
                          ζ−σ      !     Z N               1−σ !

After removing common terms and re-grouping, this condition becomes
Z                                                    ζ−σ                         1−σ                                    ζ−σ                                 1−σ                       !!

 I∗                                         γ(I ∗ )                        γ(i)                                      γ(i)               1−σ              γ(I ∗ )
                                                                                                                                                                                                 (B4)



        We now show that, for this condition to hold, it suffices that
                                  max{σ,ζ}−1                                      1−σ                                                 1−σ                                  !

                                                              c                                  ≥                      c                            − c (R)                         .         (B5)
                          γ(i)                                            γ(i)                     1−σ                           γ(I ∗ )

        We first show this in the case in which σ > ζ. In this case, we have
                                                                             ζ−σ                             ζ−σ                      ζ−σ

This follows from the fact that                                                              

an inequality which can be proven by straightforward differentiation of the function cu (x)/x, which
is decreasing.
    Plugging this in the inequality in equation (B4), we obtain the sufficient condition

which holds provided that

This inequality coincides with the condition in equation (B5), completing this step of the proof.
        We now turn to the case ζ ≥ σ. Because the cost function is increasing we have:
                                                                                           ζ−σ                                ζ−σ
                                                                       u           W                         u           W

                                                                                  γ(I ∗ )                               γ(i)

        Plugging this in the sufficient condition in equation (B4) yields:

once again establishing the sufficiency of (B5).

        Third, we group the terms that are multiplied by ŝ(i) in the expression for PN . To guarantee
that these terms add up to a positive number, a sufficient condition is given by:

This condition can be rewritten as:

 I∗                         γ(i)                               γ(N )                  1−σ                             γ(N )                                γ(i)


 In Step 1 of the proof of this proposition, we showed that x−ζ cu (x)σ−ζ is decreasing in x. This
                             ζ−σ                  ζ−σ
                          W                      W
implies that γ(N )ζ cu γ(N  )      > γ(i)ζ cu
                                                γ(i)      .
    Therefore, a sufficient condition for the terms that are multiplied by ŝ(i) in the expression for
PN to add up to a positive number is
          Z                                   ζ−σ              "                       1−σ                                                  1−σ ! #
              N                          W                           γ(I) u         W                 σ−ζ                                 W
                  ŝ(i)γ(i)ζ−1 cu                     W −ζ ×               c                      −          cu (R)1−σ − cu                                  di ≥ 0.
           I∗                           γ(i)                         γ(N )         γ(i)               1−σ                                γ(N )

This expression implies that, to guarantee that these terms are positive, the following relationship
would be sufficient
                                                          1−σ                                                                 1−σ !
                               γ(I) u                W                   σ−ζ                                              W
                                     c                                 ≥                   cu (R)1−σ − cu                                        .                     (B6)
                               γ(N )                γ(i)                 1−σ                                             γ(N )

        Fourth, and lastly, we group the terms that are multiplied by sK in the expression for PN . To
guarantee that these terms add up to a positive number, a sufficient condition is given by:

Ls cu (r)ζ−σ r −ζ × (I ∗ − N + 1)sk cu (r)1−σ
                                     1−σ !                                              Z   N                                ζ−σ                  !
     σ−ζ        u   1−σ     u    W                                                                       ζ−1 u            W                  −ζ
≥             c (r)      −c                   ×                                       K           sk γ(i)    c                           W           di .
     1−σ                        γ(N )                                                       I∗                           γ(i)

        Using the market clearing conditions for capital and labor in equations (A2) and (A3), we can
rewrite the sufficient condition as:
                                                                                                   1−σ                         !
                                           u        1−σ      σ−ζ                   u        W                    u        1−σ
                                          c (R)            ≥                      c                         − c (R)                  .                                 (B7)
                                                             1−σ                           γ(N )

        To finalize the proof of the lemma, we use the fact that for any effective factor prices p1 , p2 (the
price per effective unit of labor or capital at any given task), we have
                                                                               −σ
              σ−ζ  u        1−σ     u     1−σ
                                               
                                                           u      W       u  W
                      c (p1 )    − c (p2 )       ≤ |σ − ζ|c              c            .                                                                                (B8)
              1−σ                                              γ(N − 1)     γ(N )
                                            1
This inequality follows because f (x) = 1−σ    x1−σ is a concave function and the effective factor prices
                 h               i
                   W        W                                                   W
satisfy p1 , p2 ∈ γ(N ) , γ(N −1) (recall that because K > K, we have that γ(N ) < R. Likewise, the
                                                        W
definition of I ∗ imposes that                        γ(N −1)     > R).

                                                                                       B-8
    Inequality (B8) then implies that to guarantee (B3), (B5), (B6) and (B7), the following would
suffice
                                                                                                            −σ

These inequalities can be, in turn, rewritten as

    From the properties of unit cost functions, it follows that for all p ∈ γ(N ) γ(N −1) we have
                                                                                 ,

                                     γ(N ) ≥ c (p) γ(N ) . Using these properties, it follows that
the sufficient conditions above hold whenever
                                                
                                         γ(N − 1) 1+σ

                                           γ(N )

The first inequality above ensures the sufficient conditions (B3) and (B7) simultaneously; the second
inequality above ensures the sufficient condition (B5); and the last inequality above ensures the
sufficient condition (B6)
    Thus a sufficient condition for all three inequalities to hold is

     Note:      In this proposition, we do not explicitly treat the case in which I ∗ = I = Ie in order
to save on space and notation, since in this case left and right derivatives with respect to I are
different.
Proof. We first establish the comparative statics of ω with respect to I, N and K when both
I ∗ = I < Ie and I ∗ = Ie < I.

     Comparative statics for K: The curve I ∗ = min{I, I}
statics are entirely determined by the effect of capital on ω(I ∗ , N, K). An increase in K shifts up
the relative demand locus in Figure A1 (this does not affect the ideal price index condition, which
                                                                                                      W
simplifies the analysis in this case), and thus increases W and reduces R . The impact on ω =         RK
depends on whether the initial effect on W/R has elasticity greater than one (since K is in the
denominator).
     Notice that the function ω(I ∗ , N, K) already incorporates the equilibrium labor supply response.
To distinguish this supply response from the elasticity of substitution determined by factor de-
mands, we define ω L (I ∗ , N, K, L) as the static equilibrium for a fixed level of the labor supply
L.
                                                  L                             L

                                           ∂K ω L = σ cons − 1 and − ∂L ω L = σcons . Thus, when

where we have used the fact that ω(I ∗ , N, K) = ω L (I ∗ , N, K, Ls (ω)). This establishes the claims
about the comparative statics with respect to K when I ∗ = I < I.    e
    For the case where I ∗ = Ie < I, we have that the change in K also changes the threshold task

where we define σ free as in the proposition.
     Comparative statics with respect to I: The relative demand locus ω = ω(I ∗ , N, K) does
not directly depend on I . Thus, the comparative statics are entirely determined by the effect of
                                 e schedule depicted in Figure 3. When I ∗ = Ie < I, small changes
changes in I on the I ∗ = min{I, I}

an increase in I shifts the curve I ∗ = min{I, I}
ω(I ∗ , N, K) is decreasing in I ∗ . Thus, the shift in I increases I ∗ and reduces ω—as stated in the
proposition. Moreover, because I ∗ = I, we have

     We now derive the formulas for the impact of technology on factor prices. Let sL denote the
labor share in net output. Because W L + RK = (1 − η)Y , we obtain:

                                sL d ln W + (1 − sL )d ln R = d ln Y |K,L .                             (B9)

Moreover, Proposition 2 implies that
                                                    1               1

Solving the system of equations given by (B9) and (B10), we obtain the formulas for d ln W and
d ln R in the proposition.
      Now, consider the case in which I ∗ = Ie < I. In this case we have:
                                                                                               

Thus, changes in I ∗ do not affect aggregate output because the marginal firm at Ie is indifferent
between producing with capital or producing with labor. On the other hand, because I is not
binding, changes in I do not affect aggregate output.
     We derive the formulas for the impact of technology on factor prices as before, with the difference
that now equation (B10) becomes

Remaining Proofs from Section 3

We start by providing an additional lemma showing that, for a path of technology in which g(t) = g
and n > max{n, n
               e(ρ)}, the resulting production function F (k, L; n) satisfies the Inada conditions
required in a BGP.


                                                    B-13
Lemma B1 (Inada conditions) Suppose that Assumptions 1′ and 2 hold. Consider a path of
technology in which n(t) → n and g(t) → g. Let F (k, L; n) denote net output introduced in the
proof of Proposition 4. If n ≥ max n(ρ), n
                                         e(ρ) we have F satisfies the Inada conditions:

              lim FK (φ, 1; n) >ρ + δ + θg                   lim FK (φ, 1; n) <ρ + δ + θg.
              φ→0                                           φ→∞

                  k
Proof. Let φ =    L.   Let M P K(φ) = FK (φ, 1; n) and w(φ) = FL (φ, 1; n) denote the rental rate of
capital and the wage at this ratio, respectively.
   When n ≥ max n(ρ), n
                      e(ρ), these factor prices satisfy the system of equations given by the ratio
of the market clearing conditions (A2) and (A3),
                                 (1 − n)cu (M P K(φ))ζ−σ M P K(φ)−ζ
                              φ = Rn     ζ−1 cu (w(φ)/γ(i))ζ−σ w(φ)−ζ
                                                                      ,
                                   0 γ(i)



coupled with the ideal price index condition in equation (A4), which we can rewrite succinctly as:
                                                       Z n
                   B 1−σ̂ = (1 − n)cu (M P K(φ))1−σ +      cu (w(φ)/γ(i))1−σ di.            (B11)
                                                             0

   We start by considering the limit case in which φ = 0. The factor-demand equation requires
that either (i) M P K(φ) = ∞, or (ii) w(φ) = 0. In the first case, we have M P K(φ) > ρ + δ + θg
as claimed. In the second case we have:
                                                 
                                        u             0 if ζ ≥ 1
                                       c (0) =
                                                     cu0 if ζ < 1.
   We show that in both cases M P K(0) > ρ + δ + θg:

  1. Suppose that ζ ≥ 1. For the ideal price index condition in (B11) to hold, we require 1 > σ
     (otherwise the right-hand side diverges). Moreover, the ideal price index condition in (B11)
     implies that M P K(0) is implicitly given by:

                                     (1 − n)cu (M P K(0))1−σ = B 1−σ̂ .

     First, suppose that ρ ≤ ρ. We have that

                cu (M P K(0))1−σ > (1 − n)cu (M P K(0))1−σ = B 1−σ̂ = cu (ρ + δ + θg)1−σ .

     Here we have used the fact that n ≥ 0 and the definition of ρ introduced in Lemma A2.
     Because 1 > σ, the above inequality implies M P K(0) > ρ + δ + θg ≥ ρ + δ + θg as claimed.
     Finally, suppose that ρ > ρ. Because n ≥ n(ρ), we have:

     (1 − n(ρ))cu (M P K(0))1−σ ≥ (1 − n)cu (M P K(0))1−σ
                                   = B 1−σ̂
                                                                       Z    n(ρ)
                                   = (1 − n(ρ))cu (ρ + δ + θg)1−σ +                cu ((ρ + δ + θg)/γ(i))1−σ di
                                                                        0
                                   > (1 − n(ρ))cu (ρ + δ + θg)1−σ .

                                                     B-14
     Here we have also used the definition of n(ρ) introduced in Lemma A2. Because 1 > σ, the
     above inequality implies M P K(0) > ρ + δ + θg as claimed.

  2. Suppose that ζ < 1. We have that 0 < cu0 ≤ cu (x)∀x. The ideal price index condition in
     (B11) implies that M P K(0) is implicitly given by:

                               (1 − n)cu (M P K(0))1−σ + ncu0 1−σ = B 1−σ̂ .

     When 1 > σ, we have the following series of inequalities:

          (1 − n(ρ))cu (M P K(0))1−σ + n(ρ)cu0 1−σ ≥ (1 − n)cu (M P K(0))1−σ + ncu0 1−σ
                                                      = B 1−σ̂
                                                     = (1 − n(ρ))cu (ρ + δ + θg)1−σ
                                                       Z n(ρ)
                                                     +        cu ((ρ + δ + θg)/γ(i))1−σ di
                                                          0
                                                      > (1 − n(ρ))cu (ρ + δ + θg)1−σ + n(ρ)cu0 1−σ .

     Here, we have used the fact that n ≥ n(ρ) and 0 < cu0 ≤ cu (x)∀x, and the definition of n(ρ)
     introduced in Lemma A2. Because 1 > σ, the above inequality implies M P K(0) > ρ + δ + θg
     as claimed.
     When 1 < σ, the previous inequalities are reversed, and we get:

          (1 − n(ρ))cu (M P K(0))1−σ + n(ρ)cu0 1−σ < (1 − n(ρ))cu (ρ + δ + θg)1−σ + n(ρ)cu0 1−σ .

     Because 1 < σ, the above inequality implies M P K(0) > ρ + δ + θg as claimed.

   We next consider the limit case in which φ = ∞. With a slight abuse of notation, we define
M P K(∞) = limφ→∞ M P K(φ) and w(∞) = limφ→∞ w(φ). The factor-demand equation requires
that either (i) M P K(∞) = 0, or (ii) w(∞) = ∞. In the first case,             M P K(∞) < ρ + δ + θg.
In the second case we have:                    
                                      u            ∞ if ζ ≥ 1
                                     c (0) =
                                                   cu∞ if ζ > 1.
   We show that in both cases M P K(∞) < ρ + δ + θg.

  1. Suppose that ζ ≤ 1. For the ideal price index condition in (B11) to hold, we require σ > 1
     (otherwise the right-hand side diverges). Moreover, the ideal price index condition in (B11)
     implies that M P K(∞) is implicitly given by:

                                   (1 − n)cu (M P K(∞))1−σ = B 1−σ̂ .

     First, suppose that ρ ≥ ρ. We have that

              cu (M P K(∞))1−σ > (1 − n)cu (M P K(∞))1−σ = B 1−σ̂ = cu (ρ + δ + θg)1−σ .

                                                   B-15
     Here we have used the fact that n ≥ 0 and the definition of ρ introduced in Lemma A2.
     Because σ > 1, the above inequality implies M P K(∞) < ρ + δ + θg ≤ ρ + δ + θgas claimed.
     Finally, suppose that ρ < ρ. Because n ≥ n
                                              e(ρ), we have:

          e(ρ))cu (M P K(∞))1−σ ≥ (1 − n)cu (M P K(∞))1−σ

                                         e(ρ))cu (ρ + δ + θg)1−σ .
                                  > (1 − n

     Here we have also used the definition of n
                                              e(ρ) introduced in Lemma A2. Because σ > 1, the
     above inequality implies M P K(∞) < ρ + δ + θg as claimed.

  2. Suppose that ζ > 1. We have that 0 < cu (x) ≤ cu∞ ∀x. The ideal price index condition in
     (B11) implies that M P K(∞) is implicitly given by:

                             (1 − n)cu (M P K(∞))1−σ + ncu∞ 1−σ = B 1−σ̂ .

     When 1 > σ, we have the following series of inequalities:

     When 1 < σ, the previous inequalities are reversed, and we get:

                                     e(ρ)cu∞ 1−σ > (1 − n
             e(ρ))cu (M P K(∞))1−σ + n
        (1 − n                                                                    e(ρ)cu∞ 1−σ .
                                                        e(ρ))cu (ρ + δ + θg)1−σ + n

     Because 1 < σ, the above inequality implies M P K(∞) < ρ + δ + θg as claimed.



   Proof of Global Stability for Part 2 of Proposition 4: Here we provide the details of
global stability of the interior equilibrium where all automated tasks are immediately produced
with capital (part 2 of Proposition 4). In particular, we show that the BGP given by k(t) = kB ,
c(t) = cB and L(t) = LB is globally stable.


                                               B-16
   For a given level of capital and consumption, we can define the equilibrium labor supply schedule,
LE (k, c), implicitly as the solution to the first-order condition:
                                                       FL (k, LE (k, c))
                                                  E (k,c)) θ−1
                               ν ′E (k, c))eν(L             θ    =       .
                                                               c
The left-hand side of this equation is increasing in LE . Thus, the optimal labor supply LE (k, c) is
increasing in k (because of the substitution effect) and is decreasing in c (because of the income
                                                                                                     L
effect). In addition, because FL is homogeneous of degree zero, one can verify that                  k   > LE
                                                                                                            k > 0, so
that labor responds less than one-to-one to an increase in capital.
   Any dynamic equilibrium must solve the system of differential equations:
                 ċ(t) 1
                      = (FK (k(t), LE (k(t), c(t)); n) − δ − ρ) − g
                 c(t) θ
                                                                                E (k(t),c(t))) θ−1
                 k̇(t) =F (k(t), LE (k(t), c(t)); n) − (δ + g)k(t) − c(t)eν(L                   θ    ,

together with the transversality condition in equation (19).
   We analyze this system in the (c, k) space. We always have one of the two cases portrayed in
Figure B1; either limc→0 LE (k, c) = L or limc→0 LE (k, c) = ∞.




Figure B1: The left panel shows the phase diagram of the equilibrium system when
limc→0 LE (k, c) = L. The right panel shows the phase diagram of the equilibrium system when
limc→0 LE (k, c) = ∞.

   The locus for k̇ = 0 yields a curve that defines the maximum level of consumption that can be
sustained at each level of capital. This level is determined implicitly by:
                                                                      E (k,c)) θ−1
                             F (k, LE (k, c); n) − (δ + g)k = ceν(L             θ    .

   The locus for ċ = 0 is given by k = φLE (k, c), which defines a decreasing curve between c and
k. Depending on whether ν ′ (L) has a vertical asymptote or not, as c → 0, this locus converges to
k = φL (left panel in figure B1) or k = ∞ (right panel in figure B1).
   Importantly, we always have that, as c → 0, the locus for k̇ = 0 is above the locus for ċ = 0. This
is clearly the case when limc→0 LE (k, c) = L. To show this when limc→0 LE (k, c) = ∞, consider a
point (c0 , k0 ) in the locus for k̇ = 0. We have that
                                                                  
                                LE (k0 , c0 )          LE (k0 , c0 )
                        FK 1,                   < F 1,                 = δ + g + O(c0 )
                                     k0                    k0


                                                         B-17
Thus, for c0 → 0, the condition ρ + (θ − 1)g > 0 implies that
                                                     
                                        LE (k0 , c0 )
                                FK 1,                   < ρ + δ + θg.
                                            k0
                                      LE (k0 ,c0 )
This inequality implies that              k0          < φ, which is equivalent to the point (c0 , k0 ) being in the
northeast region of the locus for ċ = 0.
   As shown in Appendix A, both when limc→0 LE (k, c) = L or limc→0 LE (k, c) = ∞, we have a
unique interior equilibrium at (cB , kB ). Moreover, because as c → 0 the locus for ċ = 0 is below the
locus for k̇ = 0, we must have that the locus for ċ = 0 always cuts the locus for k̇ = 0 from above
at (cB , kB ). Thus, as shown in the phase diagrams in Figure B1 the unique interior equilibrium at
(cB , kB ) is saddle-path stable.
   One could also establish the saddle-path stability locally as follows. Around the interior BGP,
the system of differential equations that determines the equilibrium can be linearized as (suppressing
the arguments of the derivatives of the production function)
                                                                           

        ċ(t) = (FKK + FKL Lk )(k(t) − kB ) +      FKL Lc (c(t) − cB ).
                θ                                θ
   The characteristic matrix of the system is therefore given by
                                                                                 θ−1

   To analyze the properties of this matrix, we will use two facts: that FL LE           E
                                                                             K + cB FKL Lc = 0 and
FKK + FKL LE
           K < 0. The first fact follows by implicitly differentiating the optimality condition for
labor, which yields:
                                 1                                                             1

                                                                                               c2 L

The second fact follows by noting that, because LE
                                                 K <                   k ,   we have

                                                                             LE

                                                 K < FKK + FKL                  = 0.
                                                                              k
   Using these facts, we can compute the trace of Mexog :
                                           1        cB
                Tr(Mexog ) = ρ + (θ − 1)g + FL LE
                                                k +    FKL LE
                                                            c = ρ + (θ − 1)g > 0.
                                           θ         θ
In addition, the determinant of Mexog is given by:
                                                                                            
               cB      E                  1     E   cB             E     1     E    ν(LB ) θ−1
Det(Mexog ) =     FKL Lc ρ + (θ − 1)g + FL Lk −        (FKK + FKL Lk )     FL Lc − e        θ    < 0.
                θ                         θ          θ                   θ
                                                                1
The inequality follows by noting that FKL LE                          E                E
                                           c < 0 ρ + (θ − 1)g + θ FL Lk > 0 FKK + FKL Lk < 0
                       θ−1
and 1θ FL LE
           c −e
               ν(L)     θ     < 0.

                                                               B-18
   (The negative determinant is equivalent to the fact established above that the curve for ċ = 0
cuts the curve for k̇ = 0 from above. Moreover, the algebra here shows that, at the interception
point (cB , kB ), the locus for k̇ is increasing).
   The sign of the trace and the determinant imply that the matrix has one positive and real
eigenvalue and one negative and real eigenvalue. Theorem 7.19 in Acemoglu (2009) shows that,
locally, the economy with exogenous technology is saddle-path stable as wanted.
   To show the global stability of the unique BGP (cB , kB ), all we need is to discard two types of
paths: the candidate paths that converge to zero capital, which we will show are not feasible, and
the candidate paths that converge to zero consumption, which we will show are not optimal.
   To rule out the paths that converge to zero capital, note that all of them converge to an
allocation with k(t) = 0 and c(t) > c. Here c ≥ 0 is the maximum level of consumption that can
be sustained when k = 0, which is given by:
                                                                E (0,c)) θ−1
                                     F (0, LE (0, c)) = ceν(L             θ    .

   To rule out the paths that converge to zero consumption, we show that they violate the transver-
sality condition in equation (19). In all these paths we have c(t) → 0. There are two possible paths
for capital. Either capital converges to k—even at zero consumption the economy only sustains a
finite amount of capital—, or capital grows with no bound. In the first case, note that:
                                                            
                                  LE (k, c)          LE (k, c)
                          FK 1,               ≤ F 1,             = δ + g.
                                      k                 k
Thus, the transversality condition in (19) does
                                                not hold. In the second case, we have that capital
                                      LE (k,c)
grows at an asymptotic rate of F 1, k           − δ − g. This is greater than or equal to the discount
                                                                               E
                                                                                     
rate used in the transversality condition in equation (19), which is FK 1, L (k,c)k    − δ − g. Thus,
the transversality condition does not hold in this case either. 
   Proof of Proposition 5: We prove the proposition in the more general case in which As-
sumption 2’ holds.
   Proposition 4 shows that for this path of technology the economy admits a unique BGP.
   If n < n(ρ), we have that in the BGP n∗ (t) = n(ρ) > n. Thus, small changes in n do not affect
the BGP equations; n does not affect effective wages, employment, or the labor share.
   If n > n(ρ), we have that in the BGP n∗ (t) = n. In this case, the behavior of the effective wages
follows from the formulas for wI′ (n) and wN
                                           ′ (N ) in equation (A7), whose signs can be determined

given the ordering between wI (n), ρ + δ + θg, and wN (n) derived in Lemma A2.
   To characterize the behavior of employment, note that we can rewrite the first order condition
for the BGP level of employment in equation (17) as
                               1       c    1 ρ + (θ − 1)g     δ+g
                               ′
                                    =    =                 +            .
                             Lν (L)   wL   sL ρ + δ + θg     ρ + δ + θg
It follows that, asymptotically, there is a positive relationship between employment and the labor
share. Thus, we can denote the BGP level of employment by an increasing function LLR (ω), whose
elasticity we denote by εLR
                         L .


                                                     B-19
   To characterize the behavior of the labor share we use Lemma A1. This lemma was derived for
the static model when the labor supply was given by Ls (ω), but we can use it here to describe the
asymptotic behavior of the economy when the supply of labor is given by LLR (ω) . In what follows
we use the same terminology employed in Proposition 2.
   We consider two cases. First, suppose that σ const ≤ 1. Let kI (n) denote the BGP value for
K(t)/γ(I(t)). The definition of ω(I ∗ , N, K) implies that
                                                             wI (n)
                                   ω(0, n, kI (n)) =                      .
                                                       (ρ + δ + θg)kI (n)
Differentiating this expression, we obtain
                                                             1       ∂ω
                                                    wI′ (n) Rk −
                                        kI′ (n) =                    ∂N
                                                                          .
                                                       ω      1+εLRL
                                                       k   σ const +εLR
                                                                     L


Using this expression for kI′ (n), it follows that the total effect of technology on ω is given by
                            dω ∂ω    ∂ω ′
                              =    +     k (n)

                                ∂ω σ const + εLR
                                              L      wI′ (n) 1 − σ const
                              =                    +                       .

                                            L         Rk      1 + εLLR

          ∂ω
Because   ∂N     > 0 and wI′ (n) > 0, we have that, whenever σ const ≤ 1, ω is increasing in n. More-
over, because the BGP level of employment is given by the increasing function LLR (ω), n raises
employment too.
   Next suppose that σ const > 1. Let kN (n) denote the BGP value for K(t)/γ(N (t)). The definition
of ω(I ∗ , N, K) implies that
                                                                 wN (n)
                                  ω(−n, 0, kN (n)) =                          .

Differentiating this expression, we have

                                                wN                 ∂ω

                                                    ω 1+εL
                                                    k σ const +εLR
                                                                L

                           ′ (n), it follows that the total effect of technology on ω is given by

Because   ∂I ∗   < 0 and wN                                   const ≥ 1, ω is increasing in n. More-
over, because the BGP level of employment is given by the increasing function LLR (ω), n raises
employment too.
   The previous observations show that automation reduces the labor share in the long run. In
                              ′ (n) < 0, which implies that in response to automation, capital

increases above its trend. The induced capital accumulation implies that the impact of automation
on the labor share worsens over time if σ const > 1 and eases if σ const < 1.                  
                                                                                            R(t) 1−σ̂
   (When Assumption 2 holds the capital share is given by sK (t) = (1 − n)                   B        .   In this
case, it follows trivially that n reduces the capital share and thus increases the labor share. This
expression also shows that, by bringing back the rental rate of capital to its BGP level, the induced
capital accumulation may worsen the decline in the labor share if σ̂ > 1 or partially offset it if
σ̂ < 1.) 

Remaining Proofs from Section 4

Proof of Lemma A3: In a BGP we have that the economy grows at the rate g = A κκII+κ
                                                                                 κN
                                                                                   N
                                                                                     S.
   Suppose that n ≥ max{n, n  e}, we can write the value functions in the BGP as:
                        Z ∞               h                                        i
            vN (n) = b       e−(ρ−(1−θ)g)τ cu (wN (n)egτ )ζ−σ − cu (ρ + δ + θg)ζ−σ dτ ,
                        Z0 ∞              h                                       i
             vI (n) = b      e−(ρ−(1−θ)g)τ cu (ρ + δ + θg)ζ−σ − cu (wI (n)egτ )ζ−σ dτ .
                           0

Thus, the value functions only depend on the unit cost of labor wN (n) and wI (n), and on the rental
rate, which is equal to ρ + δ + θg in the BGP.
   Now consider Taylor expansions of both of these expressions (which are continuously differen-
tiable) around S = 0—so that the growth rate of the economy is small:
                              bh u                                  i
                    vN (n) =    c (wN (n))ζ−σ − cu (ρ + δ + θg)ζ−σ + O(g),                                 (B12)
                              ρ
                              bh u             ζ−σ    u        ζ−σ
                                                                   i
                     vI (n) =   c (ρ + δ + θg)     − c (wI (n))      + O(g).
                              ρ
Because O(g) → 0 as S → 0, we can approximate the above integrals when S is small with the
explicit expressions evaluated at g = 0.
   Differentiating the value functions in (B12) establishes that they are both strictly increasing in
n. This follows from the result established in Proposition 5 that, in this region, wI (n) increases in
n and wN (n) decreases in n. Moreover, as S → 0 we find that both vN (n) and vI (n) are positive.
Thus, there exists Se1 such that for S < Se1 , both vN (n) and vI (n) are positive ans strictly increasing
in n.
   Now suppose that n ≤ n(ρ) (this case requires that ρ > ρ). In this region we have n∗ (t) = n
and therefore vN (n) = vN (n) and vI (n) = vI (n). The value of automating a task is given by:

vI (n) = vI (n)
          Z ∞                   h                                                                         i
       =b       e−(ρ−(1−θ)g)τ       cu (ρ + δ + θg)ζ−σ − cu (min{wI (n(ρ))γ(n − n(ρ))egτ , ρ + δ + θg})ζ−σ dτ .
             0
          Z ∞                   h                                                                    i
       =b       e−(ρ−(1−θ)g)τ       cu (ρ + δ + θg)ζ−σ − cu ((ρ + δ + θg) min{γ(n − n(ρ))egτ , 1})ζ−σ dτ .
             0

The min operator min{wI (n(ρ))γ(n − n(ρ))egτ , ρ + δ + θg} shows that a task that is automated at
time t will only generate profits in the future starting at a time τ > t such that I ∗ (τ ) = I(t). At

                                                      B-21
this point in time, wI (n)γ(n − n(ρ))egτ = ρ + δ + θg, and it becomes profitable to use capital to
produce the automated task.
   Because limg→0 vI (n) = 0, we have vI (n) = O(g). On the other hand, we have vN (n) = vN (n)
and this value function remains bounded away from zero as S → 0 . Thus, there exists Se2 > 0 such
that for S < Se2 , κN vN (n) > κI vI (n) > 0 as claimed, and vI (n) = O(g).
                                            e(ρ) (this case requires that ρ < ρ). Because wN (n)egτ >
    Finally, consider the case in which n < n
ρ + δ + θg and wI (n)egτ > ρ + δ + θg for all τ ≥ 0, it follows that, in this region, vI (n) > 0 > vN (n)
as claimed. Moreover, the derivatives for wI (n) and wN (n) in equation (A7) imply that, in this
region, both wI (n) and wN (n) are decreasing in n. Thus, in this region, vI (n) is decreasing and
vN (n) is increasing in n.
   To finalize the proof of the Lemma we simply take Se = min{Se1 , Se2 } if θ ≥ 1, and Se =
                 ρ(κI +κN )
min{Se1 , Se2 , (1−θ)Aκ I κN
                             } if θ < 1. This choice also ensures that ρ + (θ − 1)g > 0 as required in
the Lemma. 

    An equilibrium is given by a solution to the following system of differential equations: Starting
from any n(0), k(0) the equilibrium with endogenous technology can be summarized by paths for
{c(t), k(t), n(t), v(t), SI (t)} such that:

   1. The normalized consumption satisfies the Euler equation:
                                       ċ  1
                                          = (FK (k, L; n) − δ − ρ) + O(g).
                                       c   θ

   2. The endogenous labor supply is given by LE (k, c; n), and is defined implicitly by:
                                                         θ−1
                                              cν ′ν(L)    θ    ≥ FL (k, L; n),

      with equality if LE (k, c; n) > 0.

   3. Capital satisfies the resource constraint:
                                                                                           θ−1

                                                                   R n∗                  ζ−σ
                                                                                   FL

      intermediate sales.

   4. Households face the transversality condition:
                                                     Rt
                              lim (k(t) + π(t))e−        0
                                                             FK (k(s),L(s);n(s))−δ−O(g))ds
                                                                                                   = 0,
                              t→∞

      where π(t) = I(t)vI (t) + N (t)vN (t) are (the normalized) corporate profits.

   5. Technology evolves endogenously according to:

                                          ṅ = κN S − (κI + κN )G(v)S.

   6. The value function, v = κI vI − κN vN , satisfies

                         (FK − δ − g)v − v̇ = bκI π I (k, L; n) − bκN π N (k, L; n) + O(g).

   Around g = 0, the above system of differential equations is Lipschitz continuous (on their right-
hand side, the equations for ċ, k̇, ṅ and v̇ have bounded derivatives around the BGP {cB , kB , nB , vB }.
This can be seen from the matrix containing these derivatives Mendog , which we present below).
Thus, from the theorem of the continuous dependence of trajectories of a dynamical system on
parameters (e.g., Walter, 1998, page 146, Theorem VI), there exists a neighborhood of g = 0 and
a threshold S 1 such that, for S < S 1 , the trajectories that solve the above system have the same
direction as the trajectories of the system evaluated at g = 0. In particular, for S < S 1 , the BGP
is locally saddle-path stable if and only if it is also locally saddle path stable in the limit in which
g = 0.
   The previous argument shows that, to analyze the local stability of the BGP when S < S 1 , it
is enough to analyze the limit case in which g = 0. Thus, in what follows we focus on this limit.
   As in the proof of Proposition 4, the Euler equation and the resource constraint can be linearized
around the BGP (denoted with the subscript B) as follows:

   Here, XK , XL , Xn are the partial derivatives of X(k, L; n) with respect to each of its arguments.
Moreover, we have XK , XL > 0—that is, the demand for intermediates increases with K and L.
We show that this property holds under Assumption 4, which imposes that σ > ζ, and ensures that
capital and labor are complements to intermediates. We first show this for L. We can rewrite X as
                                                    Z n         
                                   b         ζ          u    FL ζ−σ
                         X = σ̂−1          kR + by     c              di.
                             B     (1 − η)           0      γ(i)
Thus:
                          b
            XL =                  kζRζ−1 FKL

Here, seL (i) is the share of labor in the production of task i. The above inequality follows from the
fact that yL > 0, FKL > 0, and FLL < 0 (recall that Assumption 4 requires σ > ζ).

The last line in inequality (B13) follows from Chebyshev’s sum inequality, which applies here
because both γ(i)ζ−1 and seL (i) are increasing in i (when ζ > 1) or both are decreasing in i (when
ζ < 1).
      Now, we have

Here sek is the share of capital in the production of automated tasks. The inequality follows from
the fact that yK > 0, FKK < 0 (recall that σ > ζ under Assumption 4), and the inequality in
equation (B13) derived above.
                                                     η
      (When Assumption 2 holds, we have X =         1−η F (k, L; n).   In this case, it is clear that XK , XL >
0).
      In addition, let Qn , Qk , Qc > 0 denote the change in the incentives to automate (vs the incentives
to introduce new tasks) as n, k, c increase. All of these are positive.

   Because we are focusing on a BGP in which, asymptotically, κI vI (n) intercepts κN vN (n) from

(Note that this is equivalent to the derivative of the profit function Q with respect to n when the
capital adjusts to keep the interest rate constant. This derivative is positive precisely when κI vI (n)
intercepts κN vN (n) from below). Because FKK + FKL LE
                                                     k < 0 (as shown in the proof of Proposition
4), we also have that

                                          k ) − Qk (FKn + FKL Ln ) < 0.

Thus, both terms in the determinant are positive and Det(Mendog ) > 0 (recall that LE
                                                                                    c < 0 and
LE
 k > 0, and XL , XK > 0).



                                                    B-25
   Let Z(Mendog ) = λ1 λ2 λ3 + λ2 λ3 λ4 + λ3 λ4 λ1 + λ4 λ1 λ2 . We also have that

                                 Z(Mendog ) =ρ Det(Mexog ) + O(S).

Because Det(Mexog ) < 0 and this determinant does not depend on S, we have that there exists a
S 2 such that, for S < S 2 we have that Z(Mendog ) < 0.
   We now show that the matrix has exactly two eigenvalues with negative real parts for S < S 2 .
Descarte’s rule of signs shows that the matrix has 0 or 2 positive real eigenvalues.
   Suppose that the matrix has two positive real eigenvalues, p1 , p2 > 0. Suppose to obtain a
contradiction that the remaining eigenvalues are complex and have a real part. Let z and its
conjugate z denote the eigenvalues. We then have:

                            S(Mendog ) = 2ℜ(z)p1 p2 + |z|2 (p1 + p2 ) > 0,

a contradiction. Thus, in this case, exactly two eigenvalues have a negative real part.
   Now suppose that the matrix has no positive real eigenvalues. Then we have two possible cases.
First, we could have that the eigenvalues are all complex and given by λ1 , λ2 and their conjugates
λ1 , λ2 . We then have:
                             Z(Mendog ) = 2ℜ(λ1 )|λ2 | + 2ℜ(λ2 )|λ1 | < 0.

Thus, at least one of λ1 or λ2 has a negative real part. Moreover, exactly one of them has a negative
real part because
                                Tr(Mendog ) = 2ℜ(λ1 ) + 2ℜ(λ2 ) > 0.

Second, we could have that the matrix has two negative real eigenvalues and a complex pair, λ and
λ. In this case, because the trace is positive, the real part of λ must be positive as well.
   These observations show that when S < S 2 , Mendog has exactly two eigenvalues with negative
real parts. Thus, Theorem 7.19 in Acemoglu (2009) shows that, in the limit case in which g → 0
the economy with endogenous technology is saddle-path stable. Let Š = min{S 1 , S 2 }. Thus, for
S < Š, the unique BGP is locally stable. 

Proofs from Section 5

Proof of Proposition 7: We prove this proposition under Assumption 2 only. Consider an
exogenous path for technology in which Ṅ = I˙ = ∆ (with ρ + (θ − 1)AH ∆ > 0) and suppose that
                 e(ρ)}. This implies that in any candidate BGP I ∗ (t) = I(t) and n∗ (t) = n(t).
n(t) > max{n(ρ), n
   Define M ∈ [I, N ] as in the main text. Two equations determine M . First, because firms are
indifferent between producing task M with low-skill or high-skill workers, we have:
                             WH (t)   γ (M (t))       γ (M (t))1−ξ
                                    = H             = H               .
                             WL (t)  γ L (M (t), t)  Γ(t − T (M (t)))
In addition, the relative demand for high-skill and low-skill labor yields:

                                                B-26
These two equations can be combined into the equilibrium condition:
                            R N (t)     σ̂−1 di                      σ̂
                         L M (t) γ H (i)              γ H (M (t))1−ξ
                           R                     =                        .
                         H M (t) γ (i, t)σ̂−1 di     Γ(t − T (M (t)))
                               I(t)       L

Let m(t) = M (t) − I(t) and n = N (t) − I(t). Using the formula for γ L (i, t) and the change of
variables i = N − i′ to rewrite the integrals in the previous equations we get that m(t) is uniquely
pinned down by:
                        R n−m(t)
                L        0      γ H (i)1−σ̂ di                    γ H (N (t))1−ξ

                H n      γ  (i)ξ(1−σ̂) Γ i         di                  σ(1−ξ)     n−m(t) σ̂
                   n−m(t) H               ∆             γ H (n − m(t))        Γ     ∆

                                                                                                         N (t)−i
This expression also uses the fact that, because both Ṅ = I˙ = ∆, we have t − T (i) =                      ∆ .
The left-hand side of equation (B14)—the relative demand curve—is decreasing in m(t), converges
to zero as m(t) → n, and converges to infinity as m(t) → 0. Moreover, the right-hand side—the
comparative advantage schedule—is increasing in m(t). Thus, this equation uniquely determines
m(t) as a function of N (t) and n.
     To prove the first part of the proposition, consider the case in which ξ < 1. Taking the limit
as t → ∞ we have that the right-hand side of equation (B14) converges to infinity. To maintain
the equality, we must have m(t) → 0, which implies that asymptotically M (t) = I(t) and low-skill
workers produce no task. Moreover, we have that inequality explodes, since
                                      WH (t)   γ (N (t))1−ξ
                                             → H 1−ξ      
                                                         n → ∞.
                                      WL (t)  γ(n) Γ ∆
     To prove the second part of the proposition, consider the case in which ξ = 1. We now show
                                                        WH (t)
that there is a BGP in which m(t) = m and               WL (t)   is constant. Equation (B14) shows that, in this
case, m only depends on n as claimed. Moreover, the wage gap is also constant over time and given
by
                                                WH (t)      1
                                                       =   n−m
                                                               .
                                                WL (t)   Γ ∆
     Now, consider an increase in n, and let s = n − m denote the measure of tasks performed by
high-skill workers. Holding s constant, the left-hand side of equation (B14) is decreasing in n.
Because the left-hand side of equation (B14) is increasing in s and the right-hand side of equation
(B14) is decreasing in s, we must have that s increases as a result. This implies that, as stated in
the proposition, the wage gap, which is a decreasing function of s, declines with n. 
     Proof of Proposition 8:
     We prove this proposition in the more general case in which Assumption 2′ holds.
     From the Bellman equations provided in the main text, it follows that along a BGP we have
                                  Z n
                                    ∆
                       vN (n) = b     e−(ρ−(1−θ)g)τ cu (wN (n)egτ )ζ−σ dτ ,

                                               ∆
                         vI (n) = b                 e−(ρ−(1−θ)g)τ cu (ρ + δ + θg)ζ−σ dτ .
                                          0


                                                          B-27
             κI κN ι(nD )
Here ∆ =    κI ι(nD )+κN
                          S   is the endogenous rate at which both technologies grow in a BGP and
g = A∆.
   As before, a BGP requires that n satisfies

                                         κI ι(n)vI (n) = κN vN (n).

Using these formulas, the proof of the proposition follows from the properties of the effective wages
derived in Proposition 5. Following the same steps involved in the proof of Proposition 6, we also
obtain that the equilibrium in this case is locally stable whenever κI ι(n)vI (n) cuts κN vN (n) from
below. 
   We now turn to Proposition 9. We prove a similar statement in the more general case in which
Assumption 2′ holds. In particular, we show that:

Proposition B2 (Welfare implications of automation in the general model) Consider the
                                                                                 e Let
static economy and suppose that Assumptions 1, 2′ and 3 hold, and that I ∗ = I > I.
W = u(C, L) denote the welfare of households and let F (K, L; I, N ) denote the resulting replace
when the amount of labor supplied is L and capital is K.

  1. Consider the baseline model without labor market frictions, so that the representative house-

     hold chooses the amount of labor without constraints, and thus       C   = ν ′ (L). Then:

  2. Suppose that there are labor market frictions, so that employment is constrained by a quasi-
     labor supply curve L ≤ Lqs (ω). Suppose also that the quasi-labor supply schedule Lqs (ω) is
                                        εL > 0, and is binding in the sense that W

Proof. The unconstrained allocation of employment maximizes:

                                      W = max u(F (K, L; I, N ), L).
                                             L

Thus, the envelope theorem implies that:

(recall that FI > 0 because we assumed I ∗ = I).

   Properties of the constraint efficient allocation:
   We now derive the constrained efficient allocation both when the labor market is frictionless
and when there is a friction as the one introduced in Proposition 9. We focus on the case in which
Assumption 2 holds, although similar insights apply in general.
   First the planner removes markups. This implies that net output is given by
                                                                                                                 σ̂

                                                                                    I∗

                                  = µ η−1 F (K, L; I ∗ , N ).

Using this expression, we can write the planner’s problem as:
                                         Z ∞
                                                  [C(t)e−ν(L(t)) ]1−θ − 1

   Let µN (t) denote the marginal value of new tasks (increasing N ) in terms of the final good.
Let µI (t) denote the marginal value of automation (increasing I) in terms of the final good. These
marginal values are the social counterparts to VN (t) and VI (t) in the decentralized economy. As-
suming that the planner operates in the region where I ∗ (t) = I(t), we can write these marginal
values as

With some abuse of notation and to maximize the parallel with the decentralized expressions for
                                                                                                η
VN and VI , we are using R(t) to denote the marginal product of capital µ η−1 FK and w(t) to denote

the (normalized) marginal product of labor µ η−1 FL e−AI                       .
   These observations show that the efficient allocation satisfies similar conditions to the decen-
tralized economy in our main model in Section 4. The only difference is that now, the allocation
of scientists is guided by µN (t) and µI (t) and satisfies:
                                                                                       
                        κI µI (t) − κN µN (t)                        κI µI (t) − κN µN (t)
         SI (t) = SG                            , SN (t) = S 1 − G                            ,

so that in the efficient allocation, n(t) changes endogenously according to:
                                                                           

                         ṅ(t) = κN S − (κN + κI )G                           S.
                                                               Y (t)
   One of the key insights from Proposition 6 is that the expected path for factor prices determines
the incentives to automate and create new tasks. The equations for µN and µI show that a planner
would also allocate scientists to developing both types of technologies following a similar principle;
guided by the cost savings that each technology grants to firms. However, the fact that µN 6= VN
and µI 6= VI shows that the decentralized allocation is not necessarily efficient. The inefficiency
arises because technology monopolists do not earn the full gains that their technology generates,
nor internalize how their innovations affect other existing and future technology monopolists.
   We now show that labor market frictions change the planner’s incentives to allocate scientists.
By contrast, conditional on the wage level, such frictions do not change the market incentives to
automate or create new tasks.
   Without frictions, the efficient level of labor satisfies

   Now suppose that there is an exogenous constraint on labor that requires L ≤ Lqs (ω). Let µL
be the multiplier of this constraint. We have that:

Because the planner takes into account the first-order effects from changes in the employment level,
the values for µN and µI change to:

Thus, when the level of employment is below its unconstrained optimum, the planner values the
introduction of new tasks more because they raise the marginal product of labor and ease the
constraint on total employment. Likewise, the planner values automation less because she recognizes
that by reducing employment automation has a first-order cost on workers. Importantly, the market
does not recognize the first-order costs from automation or the first-order benefits from introducing
new tasks. As the expressions for VN and VI show, only factor prices—not the extent of frictions
in the labor market— determine the incentives to introduce these technologies.

When New Tasks Also Use Capital

In our baseline model, new tasks use only labor. This simplifying assumption facilitated our
analysis, but is not crucial or even important for our results. Here we outline a version of the
model where new tasks also use capital and show that all of our results continue to hold in this
case. Suppose, in particular, that the production function for non-automated tasks is
                                                                                            ζ
                                       ζ−1
                                                                   ν       1−ν
                                                                                  ζ−1       ζ−1
                     y(i) = ηq(i)       ζ    + (1 − η) Bν (γ(i)l(i)) k(i)          ζ
                                                                                                   ,         (B15)

where k(i) is the capital used in the production of the task, ν ∈ (0, 1), and Bν = ν −ν (1 − ν)−(1−ν)
is a constant that is re-scaled to simplify the algebra.
   Automated tasks i ≤ I can be produced using labor or capital, and their production function
takes the form
                                                                                                  ζ
                                 ζ−1

                                                                                        ζ−1       ζ−1
                  y(i) = ηq(i)    ζ    + (1 − η) k(i) + Bν (γ(i)l(i)) k(i)               ζ
                                                                                                         .   (B16)

Comparing these production functions to those in our baseline model (2) and (3), we readily see
that the only difference is the requirement that labor has to be combined with capital in all tasks
(while automated tasks continue not to use any labor). Note also that when ν → 1, we recover
the model in the main text as a special case. It can be shown using a very similar analysis to
that in our main model that most of the results continue to hold with minimal modifications. For
example, there will exist a threshold Ie such that tasks below I ∗ = min{I, I}
                                                                            e will be produced
using capital and the remaining more complex tasks will be produced using labor. Specifically,

                                                      B-31
                    n            ν o
                              W
whenever R ∈ arg min R, R1−ν γ(i)      and i ≤ I, the relevant task is produced using capital,
and otherwise it is produced using labor. Since γ(i) is strictly increasing, this implies that there
exists a threshold Ie at which, if technologically feasible, firms would be indifferent between using
capital and labor. Namely, at task I, e we have R = W/γ(I),  e or

                                                 W     e
                                                   = γ(I).
                                                 R
This threshold represents the index up to which using capital to produce a task yields the cost-
minimizing allocation of factors. However, if Ie > I, firms will not be able to use capital all the way
up to task Ie because of the constraint imposed by the available automation technology. For this
reason, the equilibrium threshold below which tasks are produced using capital is given by

                                                          e
                                             I ∗ = min{I, I},

meaning that I ∗ = Ie < I when it is technologically feasible to produce task Ie with capital, and
I ∗ = I < Ie otherwise.
   The demand curves for capital and labor are similar, with the only modification that the demand
for capital also comes from non-automated tasks. Following the same steps as in the text, we
can then establish analogous results. This requires the more demanding Assumption 2′′ , which
guarantees that the demand for factors is homothetic:

Assumption 2′′ : One of the following three conditions holds:

        1. σ − ζ → 0, or
        2. ζ → 1, or
        3. η → 0.

   The following proposition is very similar to Proposition 1, with the only difference being in the
ideal price condition.

Proposition B3 (Equilibrium in the static model when ǫ ∈ (0, 1)) Suppose that Assumption
1′′ holds. Then, for any range of tasks [N −1, N ], automation technology I ∈ (N −1, N ], and capital
stock K, there exists a unique equilibrium characterized by factor prices, W and R, and threshold
tasks, Ie and I ∗ , such that: (i) Ie is determined by equation (6) and I ∗ = min{I, I};
                                                                                     e (ii) all tasks
i ≤ I ∗ are produced using capital and all tasks i > I ∗ are produced using labor; (iii) the capital and
labor market clearing conditions, equations (8) and (9), are satisfied; and (iv) factor prices satisfy
the ideal price index condition:
                                                 Z    N                              ν 1−σ

                                                      B-32
Proof. The proof follows the same steps as Proposition 1.
   Comparative statics in this case are also identical to those in the baseline model (as summarized
in Proposition 2) and we omit them to avoid repetition. The dynamic extension of this more general
model is also very similar, and in fact, Proposition 4 applies identically, and is also omitted. One
can also define ρ, n(ρ) and n
                            e(ρ) in an analogous nway as we did in the proof of Lemma A2. To
highlight the parallels, we just present the equivalent of Proposition 6.

Proposition B4 (Equilibrium with endogenous technology when ν ∈ (0, 1)) Suppose that
Assumptions 1′ , 2′′ , and 4 hold. Then, there exists S such that, when S < S, we have:

   1 (Full automation) For ρ < ρ, there is a BGP in which n(t) = 0 and all tasks are produced
     with capital.

   For ρ > ρ, all BGPs feature n(t) = n > n(ρ). Moreover, there exist κ > κ > 0 such that:

                                        κI
   2 (Unique interior BGP) if           κN   > κ there exists a unique BGP. In this BGP we have
     n(t) = n ∈ (n(ρ), 1) and κN vN (n) = κI vI (n). If, in addition, θ = 0, then the equilibrium is
     unique everywhere and the BGP is globally (saddle-path) stable. If θ > 0, then the equilibrium
     is unique in the neighborhood of the BGP and is asymptotically (saddle-path) stable;
                                 κI
   3 (Multiple BGPs) if κ >      κN   > κ, there are multiple BGPs;
                                 κI
   4 (No automation) If κ >      κN ,   there exists a unique BGP. In this BGP n(t) = 1 and all tasks
     are produced with labor.

Proof. The proof of this result closely follows that of Proposition 6, especially exploiting the fact
that the behavior of profits of automation and the creation of new tasks behave identically to those
in the baseline model, and thus the value functions behave identically also.

Microfoundations for the Quasi-Labor Supply Function

We provide various micro-foundations for the quasi-labor supply expression used in the main text,
    W
      
Ls RK   .
   Efficiency wages: Our first micro-foundation relies on an efficiency wage story. Suppose that,
when a firm hires a worker to perform a task, the worker could shirk and, instead of working, use
her time and effort to divert resources away from the firm.
   Each firm monitors its employees, but it is only able to detect those who shirk at the flow rate q
. If the worker is caught shirking, the firm does not pay wages and retains its resources. Otherwise,
the worker earns her wage and a fraction of the resources that she diverted away from the firm.
   In particular, assume that each firm holds a sum RK of liquid assets that the worker could
divert, and that if uncaught, a worker who shirks earns a fraction u(i) of this income. We assume
that the sum of money that the worker may be able to divert is RK to simplify the algebra. In


                                                 B-33
general, we obtain a similar quasi-supply curve for labor so long as these funds are proportional to
total income Y = R K + W L.
   In this formulation, u(i) measures how untrustworthy worker i is, and we assume that this
information is observed by firms. u(i) is distributed with support [0, ∞) and has a cumulative
density function G. Moreover, we assume there is a mass L of workers. A worker of type u(i) does
not shirk if and only if:
                                                           W    q
                            W ≥ (1 − q)[W + u(i)RK] →               ≥ u(i).
                                                           RK 1 − q
Thus, when the market wage is W , firms can only afford to hire workers who are sufficiently
trustworthy. The employment level is therefore given by:
                                                      
                                      s        W    q
                                    L =G                 L.
                                              RK 1 − q
                                                                                      
                                                                              W q
When q = 1—so that there is no monitoring problem—, we have G                 RK 1−q       = 1, and the supply
of labor is fixed at L for all wages W ≥ 0. However, when q < 1—so that there is a monitoring
problem—, we have Ls < L. Even though all workers would rather work than stay unemployed,
the monitoring problem implies that not all of them can be hired at the market wage. Notice that,
                                                                   W q
though it is privately too costly to hire workers with u(i) >      RK 1−q ,   these workers strictly prefer
employment to unemployment.
   Alternatively, one could also have a case in which firms do not observe u(i), which is private
information. This also requires that firms do not learn about workers. To achieve that, we assume
that workers draw a new value of u(i) at each point in time.
   When the marginal value of labor is W , firms are willing to hire workers so long as the market
     f satisfies:
wage W
                                    !                        Z ∞             !
                           f q
                           W
                   f )G
              (W − W                   − (1 − q) W f + RK             udG(u) ≥ 0.
                          RK 1 − q                             f
                                                               W   q
                                                                    RK 1−q


This condition guarantees that the firm makes positive profits from hiring an additional worker,
whose type is not known.
   Competition among firms implies that the equilibrium wage at each point in time satisfies:
                                    !                     Z ∞            !
                          f q

                  f )G
             (W − W                   − (1 − q) W f + RK          udG(u) = 0.
                         RK 1 − q                           f
                                                            W   q
                                                                    RK 1−q


                                               W         f
                                                         W
This curve yields an increasing mapping from   RK   to   RK ,   which we denote by

                                         f         
                                         W       W
                                            =h        .
                                         RK      RK
Therefore, the effective labor supply in this economy, or the quasi-supply of labor, is given by
                                              !                    

                            s
                           L =G                  =G h                   L.
                                    RK 1 − q              RK 1 − q

                                               B-34
   As in the previous model, even though the opportunity cost of labor is zero, the economy only
manages to use a fraction of its total labor.
   Minimum wages: Following Acemoglu (2003), another way in which we could obtain a quasi-
labor supply curve is if there is a binding minimum wage. Suppose that the government imposes
a (binding) minimum wage W    f and indexes it to the income level (or equivalently the level of
consumption):
                                       f = ̺ · (RK + W L),
                                       W

with ̺ > 0. Here, RK + W L represents the total income in the economy (net of intermediate
goods’ costs).
   Suppose that the minimum wage binds. Then:
                                                     1
                                                L=     sL ,
                                                     ̺
which defines the quasi-labor supply in this economy as an increasing function of the labor share.
