                                            ABSTRACT

We investigate how cognitive ability and financial literacy shape older Americans’ demand for
financial advice using an experimental module in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study. We
show that cognitive ability and financial literacy strongly improve the quality, but not the
quantity, of financial advice sought. Most importantly, the financially literate and more
cognitively able tend to seek financial help from professionals rather than family members, and
they are less likely to accept so-called ‘free’ financial advice that may entail conflicts of interest.
Nevertheless, those with higher cognitive function also tend to distrust financial advisors, leading
them to eschew their services.

                          How Cognitive Ability and Financial Literacy
                      Shape the Demand for Financial Advice at Older Ages

        The last four decades have seen a global trend toward disintermediation of retirement saving and
decumulation, as company-provided defined benefit pensions gave way to defined contribution plans and
government old-age benefit programs experienced shortfalls. Nevertheless, shifting the risks of saving too
little, investing poorly, and outliving assets to individuals does not make such risks disappear. Additiona lly,
there is growing evidence that retail investors have a difficult time setting spending goals, paying debt,
deciding how much and where to invest, determining when to stop working and claim their retirement
benefits, and handling insurance needs (e.g., Brüine de Bruin, 2017; Mitchell, 2018). Financial
disintermediation poses an even larger challenge when a large segment of the older population lacks
financial sophistication (c.f., Finke, Howe, and Huston, 2016; Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014).
        This paper explores how cognitive ability and financial literacy shape older Americans’ demand for
financial advice. This is of concern since the older population holds more wealth than do younger people,
and when cognitive function deteriorates with age (Horn, 1968; Schroeder and Salthouse, 2004), this can
undermine retirement security (Agarwal et al., 2009). Prior research linking cognitive ability and financial
management skills has examined stock market participation and allocation patterns, and many have
demonstrated that more cognitively able and financially literate people are more likely to participate in the
stock market and reap better investment returns (e.g., Bogan and Fertig, 2013; Christelis, Jappelli, and
Padula, 2010; Clark, Lusardi, and Mitchell, 2015; Cole and Shastry, 2014; Grinblatt, Keloharju, and
Linnainmaa, 2011; Kézdi and Willis, 2003; and van Rooij, Lusardi, and Alessie, 2011).
        It has also been reported that investors lose financial skills as cognitive ability declines with age
(Korniotis and Kumar, 2011). Of course, those unable to manage their finances in later life may be able to
hire investment professionals, thus substituting financial advisors’ inputs for their own (Kim, Maurer, and
Mitchell 2016; 2017). Yet cognitive ability and financial literacy can also affect the decision to delegate,
since delegation requires a complicated process of acquiring, screening, and monitoring information about
financial advisors and their services.
        Accordingly, to evaluate whether cognitive ability and financial literacy have a protective role
helping older people make better decisions about when to seek – or avoid – financial advice, we designed a
purpose-built experimental module and fielded it in the 2016 Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Here we
asked people age 50+ several questions about whether they had obtained financial advice, and if so, which
types of advice they sought. For those who did not access financial advice, we also asked them why not. To
this module we linked a rich array of information from the core HRS including cognitive ability scores,
financial literacy scores, socio-demographic factors, wealth, and health. Using a novel instrumental variable
(IV) approach, we trace the causal impacts of cognitive ability and financial literacy on older peoples’
financial behavior focusing on their demand for financial advice.
                                                                                                                          2


         Our results show that cognitive ability and financial literacy affect the quality, but not the quantity,
of financial advice that older persons seek out. Specifically, cognitive ability and financial literacy do not
affect the likelihood of seeking financial advice in any form, but they do influence the types of financial
advice people receive. For instance, greater cognitive ability positively affects older peoples’ likelihood of
seeking financial advice about sophisticated financial tasks such as investments, rather than simply paying
bills. In addition, the more cognitively able and financially literate are more likely to obtain financial advice
from professional advisors, and they report being less likely to receive ‘free’ financial consultations with
possible embedded conflicts of interest. The economic significance of these results is also sizable: for
instance, in our preferred IV specification, a standard deviation increase in cognitive ability leads to a 10.6
percent greater chance of seeking professional financial advice and a 12.1 percent smaller chance of having
gotten ‘free’ advice. A standard deviation higher financial literacy score boosts the probability of obtaining
financial advice by 3.4 percent, and reduces the chance of having sought ‘free’ advice by 8.5 percent.
         Only around one-third (35 percent) of our respondents said they ever sought financial advice, we
also asked the others why they did not. Our evidence indicates that more cognitively able respondents lacked
trust in financial advisors, such that a standard deviation higher cognition score was associated with a 28.2
percent higher chance of distrusting financial advisors. Accordingly, cognitive ability plays an important
role in determining who trusts financial advisors, and trust is a significant predictor of the demand for
financial advice (Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny, 2015).
         In what follows, we first briefly summarize prior studies on older persons’ financial management
patterns. The subsequent section discusses anticipated hypotheses linking cognitive ability, financial
literacy, and the demand for financial advice in our HRS module. Following a discussion of empirical results,
a final section concludes.


Related Studies
         Three related threads in the literature are relevant to our research: studies on rational delegation and
inattention, analyses of financial illiteracy, and inquiries into the complex institutional environment in
which older persons must make financial decisions. We touch on each, in turn.
         In the context of a life-cycle model with stochastic labor income and endogenous work effort, Kim,
Maurer and Mitchell (2016, 2017) showed that individuals deriving utility from consumption and leisure
rationally devote little or no attention to their retirement portfolios early in life. 1 This is because managing

1 Other authors have also postulated that a rational, fully-informed, forward-looking individual makes optimal decisions
regarding saving, portfolio choice, asset location, benefit claiming, while taking into consideration individual factors
such as preferences (risk, time, leisure, bequest, intertemporal substitution, loss aversion), mortality, health, and family
status (e.g., Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout, 2005, Gomes, Kotlikoff, and Viceira, 2008, Hubener, Maurer, and Mitchell,
2016, and Horneff, Maurer, and Mitchell, 2016). However none integrates the opportunity cost of managing one’s own
finances, however, which we believe to be an important factor driving the life cycle demand for financial advice. Pagel
(2018) recently introduced news-utility theory to show within a life-cycle portfolio choice model that such (behavioral)
preferences are able to account for inattention, predict realistic stock portfolio shares, involve non-participation in the
                                                                                                              3


one’s portfolio is time-consuming, and devoting time to the task reduces the opportunity to invest in on-the-
job training. Since people who manage their own investments must do so at the cost of future earnings
growth, workers can benefit from hiring financial advisors to reduce the cost of managing their own finances.
Naturally, delegating one’s investments to an advisor also entails a cost, so this tradeoff must be re-evaluated
over the life cycle. Young workers have little wealth, but they have the longest time horizon over which to
reap the rewards of good financial advice. Older individuals may value input from financial advisors to the
extent that they experience declining mental faculties, making it more difficult to do a good job on their
own. Accordingly, this literature predicts that incentives to outsource financial advice peak near and into
retirement, and fall after that.
        A second reason that older people may seek financial advice is that many of them are financially
illiterate, leading them to undersave and underinvest (Lusardi and Mitchell, 2014; Lusardi, Michaud, and
Mitchell, 2017; Clark, Lusardi, and Mitchell, 2015; Choi, Laibson, and Madrian, 2011; Choi, 2015).
Somewhat surprisingly, and despite objective confirmation of an age-linked decline in financial capability
at older ages, the evidence shows that older persons’ self-confidence in their own financial ability rises with
age, peaking at about age 88. 2 To this point, there is now a substantial literature on the consequences of
poor financial capability in later life (Agarwal et al., 2009). For instance, the FINRA Investor Education
Foundation (2013) found that over 80 percent of adults of all ages had been solicited for potentially
fraudulent offers, with older Americans the most likely targets and most likely to lose money when targeted
(DeLiema and Deevy, 2017). Even worse, education has a limited impact on increasing elders’ financial
management capability (Choi, Laibson, and Madrian, 2005; Fernandes, Lynch, and Netemeyer, 2014). Old
adults making mistakes in their financial management are widely observed both in developed and
developing countries (e.g., Badarinza, Campbell, and Ramadorai, 2016; Badarinza, Balasubramaniam, and
Ramadorai, 2019).
        A third reason that older persons may seek financial advice is that institutional complexity bedevils
the decisions people must confront when planning for, making provision for, and moving into retirement.
In the US, for instance, rules regarding when to claim one’s Social Security benefits are extremely
complicated, particularly if one has a spouse who is also entitled (or will be entitled) to Social Security
benefits (Kotlikoff, Moeller, and Solman, 2016). There are also numerous complex regulations regarding
how much people may save in tax-qualified retirement saving accounts, when one can make penalty-free
payouts, and when one must begin taking required minimum distributions from these accounts (Horneff,
Maurer, and Mitchell, 2016). These realities become particularly challenging when cognitive ability
declines with age. Combined with potentially lower cognitive ability of older adults, the complexity of
financial products and services can be an obstacle to sound financial decision-making (Agarwal and


stock market, and include a willingness to pay for delegated portfolio management.

with aging.

Mazumder, 2013).
          These three reasons can help explain why older persons might demand more financial advice,
particularly when financial advisors can actually enhance their advisees’ financial outcomes. Few studies
focus on older individuals per se, but the literature does indicate that retail investors who suffer from
behavioral biases can be protected by good financial advisors (Shapira and Venezia 2001). 3 Kramer (2012)
found that portfolios advised by financial advisors were less prone to home bias or over-concentration in
their own country. Bhattacharya et al. (2012) reported that portfolio risk-return efficiency improved for
those who actually followed the advice. Using a Dutch household survey, von Gaudecker (2015) discovered
that households who engaged professional advisors achieved significant portfolio diversification measured
in terms of return loss. Moreover, financial advice can also help with estate planning and tax management
(Cici, Kempf, and Sorhage, 2017). By contrast, financial decisions are more difficult for those unable to
process financial information readily (Christelis, Jappelli, and Padula, 2010; Bertrand and Morse, 2011),
present-biased individuals who procrastinate making financial decisions (O’Donoghue and Rabin, 1999),
and persons who distrust or cannot evaluate advice (Gino, 2008; Inderst and Ottaviani, 2012; Agnew et al.,
2018). 4 To date, however, available research has not linked older persons’ demand for financial advice with
cognitive ability and financial literacy, as we do here.


Methodology and Data
          While relatively little is known about the links between cognitive ability, financial literacy, and the
probability of seeking financial advice at older ages as well as the type of advice sought, it is useful to
outline possible channels for possible effects. Specifically, we seek to determine whether older people
suffering from cognitive shortfalls are more or less likely to seek financial advice. The directionality could
be positive or negative, ex ante. For instance, some older investors would rationally delegate managing their
finances to others, if they recognized that their ability to manage finances had declined (Kim, Maurer, and
Mitchell, 2016). But those who mistakenly believe that their acumen remained intact would retain these
management tasks without asking for help. In other words, the direction of the link is still to be empirically
established.


3 There  is also a literature reporting negative outcomes from hiring financial advisors, though again, few have focused
on older adults. For instance, Bergstresser, Chalmers, and Tufano (2009) and Del Guercio and Reuter (2014) reported
that broker-sold mutual funds underperformed direct-sold mutual funds. Hackethal, Haliassos, and Jappelli (2012)
studied independent financial advisors and bank-affiliated advisors in Germany, finding that accounts advised by both
types of advisors did not generate higher risk-adjusted returns than those without advice. Using Swiss data, Hoechle
et al. (2017) found that trades advised by financial advisors underperformed trades initiated by account holders. One
of the very few analyses of retirement plans by Chalmers and Reuter (2015) concluded for Oregon State University
System Retirement Plan that broker-advised retirement accounts had lower risk-adjusted returns because of high-fee
investments.
4 Several studies have examined how advisors’ conflicts of interest can shape households’ advice-seeking behavior

(e.g., Inderst and Ottaviani 2012; Stoughton, Wu, and Zechner, 2011; Bolton, Freixas, and Shapiro, 2007; Piccolo,
Puopolo, and Vasconcelos, 2016); and Hackethal, Haliassos, and Jappelli, 2012).

           We also investigate whether more cognitively able individuals who do seek advice get help on
simple decisions such as bill-paying, or on more complex topics such as investments and benefit claiming.
To this end, we investigate what types of financial help people seek, and from whom.
           Finally, we seek to ascertain whether financial literacy has an independent protective effect on the
demand for financial advice, after controlling for cognitive ability. That is, we wish to test whether more
financially sophisticated persons are also more likely to self-manage their financial affairs, less likely to
request financial help, and more likely to get help from professionals when help is sought. Accordingly, we
investigate whether financial literacy is positively associated with self-management of financial affairs; also
we investigate whether the financially savvy are less likely to request financial help, and when they do seek
advice, whether they turn to professional advisors versus family and friends.
           We designed and fielded an experimental module in the 2016 HRS to explore how people age 50+
manage their financial affairs. 5 The sample consists of 1,180 age-eligible respondents responding to two
sets of questions to evaluate older people’s financial behaviors. The first set asked respondents whether they
received any type of financial advice, and if so, what types of financial advice they received. The second
set focused on persons who did not seek financial advice and asked them why they did not. For this reason,
sample sizes for each of the financial behavior questions differ depending on how respondents answered
precursor questions.
           Summary statistics and variable definitions of these financial behaviors appear in Table 1.
Responses to the first Module question shows that only one-third (34 percent) of the age 50+ respondents
said they received advice on money management (Get help w/money mgmt). Of those who did, half received
advice on investments (Get help w/invst), and a large majority (76 percent) of those sought help from a
professional outside of their family/friends network. A sizeable fraction (14 percent) said they received ‘free’
professional advice, which of course is likely to be not truly free rather to embed fees in products involvin g
potential conflicts of interest. Focusing on respondents who sought no financial advice, 4 percent said they
were confident enough to manage the money on their own (No money help: Self-confidence); 3 percent
indicated they did not trust advisors (No money help: Distrust); and 3 percent indicated they did not know
whom to ask (No money help: DK whom to ask).
Table 1 here
           To these responses we also linked participants’ answers to other core HRS queries on their
education, wealth, age, race/ethnicity, and marital status. The 2016 HRS additionally provides a widely-
used measure of cognitive ability (Cognition score), defined as the sum of the respondent’s total word recall
and mental status indices. 6 These measure performance on immediate and delayed word recall, serial 7’s
test, counting backwards, naming tasks (e.g., date-naming), and vocabulary questions. The mental status

index sums scores from counting, naming, and vocabulary tasks. Total cognition scores sum each
respondent’s total recall and mental status indices. The financial literacy (FinLit) score refers to the total
number of correct answers to the four financial literacy questions developed and used around the world
(Lusardi and Mitchell 2014).
          Table 1 also shows that the average Cognition score was 23.93 (out of a maximum of 35) with a
standard deviation of 4.23. The FinLit score averaged 2.07 (out of a maximum of 4) with a standard
deviation of 0.91. Cognition and FinLit are positively correlated, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.32 (significant at the 1% level). The other variables are as expected: respondents averaged 68.03 years of
age and 45 percent of the sample was male. Most were White (85 percent) or Hispanic (9 percent). A
majority (62 percent) of respondents were married. Education averaged 13.56 years, and the sample held an
average of net non-housing wealth of about $155,000 and housing net wealth of $139,000. 7


Multivariate Empirical Analysis
          To evaluate how financial behaviors of interest relate to respondents’ cognitive ability and financial
literacy holding other factors constant, we estimate multivariate Probit models of the following form:
                   Pr(𝑌𝑌𝑖𝑖 = 1|𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 ) = Φ(𝛽𝛽1 × 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑛𝑛𝑖𝑖 + 𝛽𝛽2 × 𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝐹𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 + 𝛿𝛿 ′ 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 ),   (1)
where the dependent variable measures the probability of respondent i indicating that he or she engaged in
this behavior. Here Φ(∙) is the standard normal cumulative distribution with respect to the control variables
of the Probit model. To mitigate potential confounding effects, the other controls besides cognition and
financial literacy noted above are contained in the vector 𝑋𝑋𝑖𝑖 . Marginal effects are reported and standard
errors are clustered at the household level.
          We are aware that estimates of equation (1) might be biased by unobservable omitted variables. For
example, Cognition and FinLit might reflect some unobservable personal trait that may also affect the
demand for financial advice. If true, this could prejudice the causal interpretation of the coefficient estimates
in equation (1). To address this potential endogeneity concern, we undertake an instrumental variable (IV)
analysis for each of our two key explanatory variables. For the Cognitive variable, we turn to medical
evidence reporting that vision dysfunction is strongly related to poor cognitive ability among older adults
(Chen, Bhattacharya, and Pershing, 2017). Moreover, Rogers and Langa (2010) also conclude that poor
vision is strongly associated with dementia and other cognitive diseases such as Alzheimer's. Accordingly,
we construct a variable called Vision problem which takes the value of one if the respondent’s eyesight was
self-reported to be fair/poor/legally blind (and zero otherwise). We use this variable as an IV for cognitive
ability. For the FinLit variable, we use as an instrument whether the respondent self-reported having taken
an economics course took an economics/finance class in school, Economics class (following van Rooij,
Lusardi, and Alessie, 2012). Table 1 shows that values of Vision problem and Economics class average 21

percent and 34 percent, respectively. We believe that these variables satisfy the conditions necessary for
instrumental variables, as it is not evident how having a vision problem in old age or taking an economics
class while in high school would affect older peoples’ demand for financial advice through channels other
than impaired cognitive ability and financial literacy.


Results: Who Seeks Financial Advice and What Type?
        Our first-stage regression confirms that Vision problem and Cognition are negatively and
statistically significantly related: that is, a one standard deviation increase in vision problems is associated
with a 1.14 percent decrease (=-0.666×0.41/23.92) in the Cognition score (see Appendix Table 2). We also
find that having taken an Economics class is positively and statistically significantly linked to financial
literacy scores: a one standard deviation increase in Economics class is associated with a 6.2 percent increase
(=0.271×0.47/2.07)in FinLit. Below we present both OLS and IV results of our two key variables on
financial behaviors of interest.
        Table 2 reports the factors associated with seeking financial advice as well as the types of advice
that respondents receive. In each case, we report marginal effects from the Probit and IV Probit regressions,
to facilitate a side-by-side comparison of the impact of addressing endogeneity concerns. Columns 1-2 of
this table indicates that Cognition and FinLit are unrelated to the take-up of financial advice in both the OLS
and IV models. Accordingly, the unconditional probability of receiving any financial advice is unaffected
by cognitive ability or financial literacy, holding other factors constant. Even for those who do receive
financial advice, Cognition scores and FinLit scores are not correlated with the probability of receiving
financial advice regarding sophisticated financial topics such as investment (Column 3). Nevertheless, the
IV analysis (Column 4) shows that, for those who do seek financial advice, the probability of receiving
more sophisticated financial advice (e.g., about investments) is positively and statistically significant ly
associated with Cognition. Thus a one standard deviation higher Cognition score is associated with a 1.7
percent greater (=0.002 × 4.23/0.51) chance of getting investment advice. Conversely, people of low
cognitive ability seek advice on less sophisticated financial tasks (e.g., bill paying). Heterogeneity in types
of financial advice that people seek, given their different cognitive abilities, thus helps explain why the
unconditional probability of receiving any financial advice is unrelated to the Cognition score.
Table 2 here
        Another interesting finding is that both cognitive ability and financial literacy influence whom
people ask when they do seek financial advice. For instance, Column 5 shows that Cognition and FinLit
scores are both positively related to receiving advice from professional financial advisors. In other words,
more cognitively able and financially literate respondents tend to seek professional financial advice, rather
than seeking casual help from family/friends. The IV analysis (Column 6) confirms that this positive
association is attributable to the causal impact of Cognition and FinLit. The economic magnitudes of these

are also sizable: a one standard deviation rise in Cognition score is associated with a 10.6 percent higher
(=0.019×4.23/0.76) chance, and a standard deviation increase in FinLit is associated with a 3.4 percent
higher (=0.028×0.91/0.76) chance of seeking professional advice. Put differently, cognitive decline induces
people age 70+ to be about 4-8 percent less likely to seek professional financial advice, compared to their
counterparts in their 60s. Lower financial literacy also plays a role, reducing the probability of seeking
professional advice by 1-2 percent for those age 70+ versus people in their 60’s. 8
           Columns 7 and 8 of Table 2 report how Cognition and FinLit influence the probability of receiving
so-called ‘free’ professional financial advice. The IV analysis (Column 8) indicates that those scoring higher
on both Cognition and FinLit are less likely to seek ‘free’ financial advice: specifically, a one standard
deviation rise in Cognition and FinLit scores leads, respectively, to 12.1 percent (=-0.004× 4.23/0.14) and
8.5 percent (=-0.013×0.91/0.14) lower chance of seeking financial advice of this type. When ‘free’ financial
advisors charge ‘shrouded’ commissions which clients may not readily perceive, this can give rise to a
conflict of interest between advisors and customers (Inderst and Ottaviani, 2012; Anagol and Kim, 2012).
It is therefore important to note that both cognitive ability and financial literacy have a protective function
in steering people away from advisors who shroud their fees.
           Other results in Table 2 are also worth noting. Better-educated respondents are more likely to
receive financial advice in the OLS equation (Column 1), but the result is attenuated in the IV analysis
(Column 2). The IV analysis shows that better-educated people also tend to seek advice on investment
(Column 4) from professional advisors (Column 6) and are less likely to get ‘free’ consulting (Column 8).
People with more housing wealth are more likely to receive financial advice on investment (Column 3) but
this tendency again becomes insignificant in the IV analysis (Column 4). Older people are less likely to
receive investment advice and professional financial advice (Columns 4–6), as well as ‘free’ help (Column
8).
           Taken as a whole, then, Table 2 suggests that more cognitively able and financially literate older
respondents seek professional advice rather resorting to informal help. Since cognitive ability and financial
literacy do not affect the likelihood of seeking financial advice based on the IV analysis, we conclude that
cognitive ability and financial literacy determine the quality rather than the quantity of financial advice
sought.


Who Does Not Seek Financial Advice?
           Two-thirds of the older HRS respondents do not seek financial advice, leading us to ask why. Table
3 presents coefficients estimates from both Probit and IV Probit regressions of reasons people give for not
receiving financial advice, where we link these to Cognition and FinLit scores as well as self-confidence,


 8    Average Cognition (Finlit) scores for persons in their 60s, 70s, and 80+ are 24.95 (2.23), 23.30 (1.96) and 21.57
     (1.84), respectively.
                                                                                                               9


distrust, and lack of knowledge as potential explanations. Column 1 reports marginal effects from Probit
models of self-confidence, where we see that people scoring well on Cognition believe they can handle their
financial management duties without others’ help. By contrast, the FinLit score is negatively correlated with
self-confidence. Interestingly, these results are again attenuated in the IV models (Column 2). In other words,
Cognition and FinLit scores may be correlated with self-confidence, but this relationship does not appear to
be causal.
Table 3 here
        Another potential reason for not receiving financial advice could be distrust of financial advisors
(Gennaioli, Shleifer, and Vishny, 2015). Columns 3-4 of Table 3 present both Probit and IV Probit marginal
effects from regressing Distrust on Cognition and FinLit as well as other controls. The IV Probit model, in
which we place more confidence, indicates that the more cognitive able tend to distrust financial advisors,
leading the respondents to avoid asking for financial advice. A one standard deviation higher Cognition
score is associated with a 28.2 percent greater (=0.002×4.23/0.03) chance of stating that distrust is the
reason for not seeking financial advice. FinLit is not statistically significantly related to this outcome. Table
3 also shows results from Probit and IV Probit regressions of “Do not know whom to ask” on Cognition
and FinLit as well as the other controls. The multivariate Probit estimates (Column 5) suggest that Cognition
and FinLit scores drive lack of knowledge, but this relationship is not robust in the IV analysis (Column 6).
In the IVProbit estimation, few of the control variables are related to self-confidence and lack of knowledge.
One that does stand out is reported in Column (4), where older non-white men with more education and
more net housing wealth are more likely to elect distrust as a reason for not receiving financial advice.
        Overall, Table 3 indicates that cognitive ability is an important factor associated with older people’s
trust in financial advisors. Specifically, the more cognitively able are likely to say that distrust is a reason
for not seeking financial advice. Combined with results in Table 2 showing that cognitive ability discourages
‘free’ financial consultation, this implies that older people who maintain high cognitive ability have a more
prudent attitude toward financial advice. Financial literacy plays less of a role.


Discussion and Conclusion
        This paper has explored the impact of two important factors driving the demand for financial advice
in an aging population: cognitive ability, and financial literacy. Given increasingly complex financial
products and the disintermediation of retirement decisions, it seems clear that many older persons with
substantial savings may not be able to manage financial tasks on their own – and at the same time, be unable
to hire quality financial advisors. Moreover, we find that cognitive ability and financial literacy both help
shape the quality, but not the quantity, of financial advice sought by older persons. While cognitive ability
and financial literacy scores are not significantly related to the probability of seeking financial advice, being
more cognitively able does enhance the chance that people seek advice for more sophisticated financial
                                                                                                             10


tasks such as investment decisions and discourages them from seeking ‘free’ financial consultations. Our
IV analysis implies that a standard deviation increase in cognitive ability and financial literacy increases the
chances of seeking financial advice from professionals, rather than family members, by 10.6 percent and
3.4 percent, respectively. We also find that more cognitively able respondents tend to distrust financial
advisors, suggesting that cognitive ability may protect them from potentially deceptive financial advice
practices.
        These findings have potential policy implications. The fact that both cognitive ability and financial
literacy help shape the quality of financial advice sought implies that the mere existence of financial advisors
will not, on its own, correct some older people’s sub-optimal financial practices. Accordingly, financial
institutions could find it useful to enhance protections for their older customers; efforts along these lines
include a program teaching bank tellers how to recognize when customers show signs of declining mental
capacity or are being financially exploited (Gunther, 2015). Several federal agencies also handle complaints
regarding financial fraud, and various states have also passed laws seeking to protect elders from financial
exploitation, for instance, allowing triple damages for victims winning legal cases against their perpetrators
(DeLiema and Deevy, 2017). Our work also shows that low cognitive ability and poor financial literacy can
be a barrier to receiving quality financial advice, suggesting that researchers and policymakers may need to
find new ways to evaluate and monitor financial behavior in an aging population.

Table 2. Determinants of Financial Advice Seeking
This table presents marginal estimates from multivariate Probit analysis (odd numbered columns) and IV Probit (even numbered columns) of key financial behaviors: Get
help w/ financial mgmt, Get help w/ invst, Get help from profl/other non fmaily advisors, and Get ‘free’ profl help, regressed on Cognition and FinLit and with other
controls. All dependent variables are binary; see Appendix 1. Coefficients on constant terms and missing data dummies suppressed. Standard errors are reported in
parentheses and clustered at the household level. *, **, and *** represents statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Table 3. Factors Associated with Not Seeking Financial Advice
This table presents marginal estimates from multivariate Probit analysis (odd numbered columns) and IV Probit (even
numbered columns) for factors explaining why people did not seek financial advice: Self-confidence, Distrust, and
DK whom to ask. These are regressed on Cognition score and FinLit score along with other controls. All dependent
variables are binary; see Appendix 1. Coefficients on constant terms and missing data dummies suppressed. Standard
errors are reported in parentheses and clustered at the household level. *, **, and *** represents statistical significance
at 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Appendix Table 2. First-Stage Regressions of Cognition and Financial Literacy on
Instrumental Variables
This table presents coefficient estimates from the first-stage OLS regressions of Cognition and FinLit scores on two
instrumental variables, respectively, Vision problem and Economics class, along with all other controls. Variables
described in Appendix 1. Coefficients on constant terms and missing data dummies suppressed. Standard errors are
reported in parentheses and clustered at the household level. *, **, and *** represents statistical significance at 10%,
5%, and 1% levels, respectively.
