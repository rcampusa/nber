Deardorff [Journal of International Economics 36 (1994) 167-175] offers an intuitively appealing

test for factor price equality (FPE). He demonstrates that FPE is impossible if the set (i.e., lens) of

points defined by regional factor abundance vectors does not lie within the set of points defined by

goods' input intensities. This note demonstrates that empirical implementation of the lens condition

is problematic if the "true" number of either goods or regions is unknown. We show that satisfaction

of the lens condition is more likely when goods are relatively disaggregate compared to regions.

I. Introduction



         Deardorff (1994) derives a condition for assessing the existence of factor price

equality (FPE) across countries. This “lens condition” requires factor endowments to

vary less across countries than factor input intensities vary across goods. Deardorff

demonstrates that if the set points (i.e., lens) defined by regional factor abundances passes

outside the set of points defined by goods’ factor intensities, FPE is impossible.

         Deardorff’s theoretical analysis has been extended by Qi (2003), Demiroglu and

Yun (1999), Xiang (2001), Yun (2003) and Wong and Yun (2003). These extensions

reveal that satisfaction of the lens condition, while necessary and sufficient for FPE in the

two-factor, many-good and many-country case, is necessary but not sufficient for FPE in

settings with more than two factors. Thus, while violation of the lens condition may be

useful for ruling out FPE, a lack of violation does not indicate support for FPE.

         The lens condition has been used empirically to test for FPE both across countries

internationally and across regions within countries. These tests suggest that FPE does not

hold across developed and developing countries but likely holds across regions within

countries.1

         In this paper we argue that, even in the two factor case, the researcher's lack of

knowledge about the “true” number of goods and regions forestalls useful empirical

application of the lens condition. This unfortunate conclusion is due to the influence of

data aggregation on lens size. Lenses created with more disaggregate data are larger than

  Debaere and Demiroglu (2003) show that lenses defined by country relative endowments pass outside
lenses defined by the industries they produce. Debaere (2004) uses the lens condition to argue that regions
within Japan, the United Kingdom and India exhibit factor price equalization.
                                                                                                          1
                           Empirical Implementation of the Lens Condition

the lenses created with more aggregate data.2                 As a result, satisfaction of the lens

condition is more likely when industries are relatively disaggregated compared to

countries or regions. Because the “true” relative level of aggregation is unknown, the

outcome achieved by any particular level of relative aggregation is difficult to interpret.

         Theory, unfortunately, offers little guidance for this problem. A lens test of FPE

should be based on regions that individually exhibit constant factor rewards, i.e., FPE is

known to hold inside each region. However, it is unclear how to identify these areas

unless the existence of FPE is already known. Empirically defining industries, or more

precisely, empirically identifying goods and their factor usages, presents similar

challenges.3

         This note proceeds as follows. In section II we show formally that industry

disaggregation increases lens area.            In section III, we demonstrate empirically the

sensitivity of the lens condition to data aggregation using data on Mexican states.

Section IV concludes.




II. Data Disaggregation Increases Lens Area



         In this section we briefly describe Deardorff’s (1994) lens condition before

formally demonstrating the influence that data aggregation has on its empirical

implementation.

A. The Lens Condition



         Deardorff’s (1994) lens condition is based on Dixit and Norman’s (1980) concept

of an integrated world economy (IWE), which has both factors and goods being perfectly

mobile across countries. An IWE equilibrium is characterized by a certain level of output

for each good and a single set of goods prices, factor rewards, and production techniques.

If it is possible to replicate an IWE equilibrium with factor immobility by assigning

factors to regions and goods, then FPE is possible. If such an allocation is not possible,

FPE is not possible.

         An IWE equilibrium can be replicated – and FPE is possible – if factor

endowments vary less across regions than factor intensities vary across goods. More

formally, this condition requires the set of points defined by regional factor abundances

to lie inside the set of points defined by goods’ factor usage.                 Figure 1 illustrates this

condition via a Lerner diagram for two goods, two countries and two factors. The axes

represent regions’ endowments and goods’ use of skilled (N) and unskilled (P) workers,

respectively. 4 The solid lenses in each panel are made up of four input vectors: the part

of the lens above the diagonal sorts the vectors for the two goods in order of decreasing

skill intensity, while the portion of the lens below the diagonal sorts them according to

increasing skill intensity. The dashed lines define the region lenses in analogous fashion.

         In the top panel of the figure, the lens condition is satisfied because the region

lens lies within the goods lens. In the bottom panel the lens condition is violated.

         We now examine how the relative size (area) of industry and region lenses

depends upon data aggregation.

B. Lens Area and Data Aggregation



         There are R regions (indexed by r = 1…R ) and G goods (indexed by i = 1…G).

If R and G are known and the appropriate data on their factor endowments and factor

usages exist, proper lenses can be constructed and a test of the lens condition empirically

implemented. More generally the true number of regions and goods, R and G, are not

known.

         Consider two factors, skilled workers and unskilled workers. All goods use, and

all regions are endowed with, nonnegative amounts of each factor. Let each region’s

share of skilled and unskilled workers be represented by the pair (nr, pr), so that 0 < nr < 1

and 0 < pr < 1. Let (Nr, Pr) represent region r’s cumulative share of skilled and unskilled

workers, i.e., the sum of the shares of regions 1 through r.

         Sort regions according to decreasing skill abundance, so that the vector of R+1

ordinate pairs



                        [(0,0), (N1,P1),…. (Nr,Pr), (NR-1,PR-1),(1,1)],                   (1)



traces out the part of the regional endowment lens that lies above the diagonal.         The

other half of the lens, i.e., the portion that lies below the diagonal, is found by re-

constructing the cumulative shares in (1) after sorting regions in terms of increasing skill

abundance.

         An analogous lens for factor use can be constructed, where



                         [(0,0), (N1,P1),…. (NiPi), (NG-1,PG-1),(1,1)]                    (2)
                                                                                            4
                       Empirical Implementation of the Lens Condition




defines the upper (lower) portion of the factor use lens when industries have been sorted

in terms of decreasing (increasing) skill intensity. Note that under the assumption of full

employment, total factor endowments equal total factor use, or (NR,PR) = (NG,PG) = (1,1).

       In practice, we observe both aggregated regions and aggregated goods. Let the

term “industry” refer to an aggregation of goods. The factor use of any particular

observed industry is the sum of the usages of its less aggregated sub-industries or goods.

Similarly, the factor endowment of any particular observed aggregate region is the sum of

the endowments of its sub-regions. The skilled-worker use (endowment) of aggregate a

is the sum of the skilled worker use (endowment) of all the sub-aggregates, b ∈ a ,



                                        na = ∑nb .                                        (3)
                                             b∈a




Proposition 1: The area in an industry or region lens increases with disaggregation if its

sub-aggregates are heterogeneous in factor intensity or factor abundance, respectively.



Proof: Our proof is for the factor use lens, but the same reasoning applies to the region

lens. The number of industry aggregates is equal to A < G. Starting with A=1, we have

one aggregate, i.e. one industry encompassing all goods. The lens is a straight line along

the diagonal of the unit factor space. Factor price equalization can occur only if region

endowments are on this line.

       If A = 2, then we have two aggregates. As long as the two aggregates differ in

factor intensity, the industry lens has positive area. Thus, disaggregating from A=1 to

A=2 increases the area of the lens from zero to some positive value.

                                                                                           5
                        Empirical Implementation of the Lens Condition

        More generally, consider disaggregation from A aggregates to B disaggregates,

where G > B > A > 1. The industry lens is a series of line segments connecting (Nb-1,Pb-1)

and (Nb,Pb). Because the point (Nb,Pb) represents cumulative factor use of industry

aggregate b, the factor use share of aggregate b is (nb, pb) = (Nb –Nb-1, Pb –Pb-1).

        Pick any particular industry aggregate a to disaggregate into b ∈ a . If (na, pa)

represents the share of skilled and unskilled labor used in aggregate a, then the resulting

distribution of skilled and unskilled workers into disaggregates can be represented with

the set {nab , pab }, where



                                n a = ∑ n ab and p a = ∑ p ab .                             (4)
                                      b∈a                  b∈a




        Order {nab , pab } according to increasing skill intensity.            Any particular

disaggregate industry b will have a slope, pba / nba , that is either greater than, equal to, or

less than the slope of the aggregate to which it belongs, pa / na. If the slope of one of the

disaggregate industries is less than that of the aggregate industry, then there must be at

least one disaggregate industry with a slope that is greater than the aggregate industry.

        Without loss of generality, if there are two disaggregates in a, b and b’, then

disaggregation increases the area of the industry lens by the triangle



                              {(Na-1,Pa-1) , (Nab,Pab) , (Nab’,Pab’)}.                      (5)



Since this area is positive, lens size increases. ■

        The top panel of Figure 2 illustrates the intuition behind Proposition 1. Assume

we begin with three industry aggregates (A=3). Aggregate 1 is represented by the

                                                                                              6
                        Empirical Implementation of the Lens Condition

segment OA, aggregate 2 by segment AB, and aggregate 3 by BC. The upper half of the

lens is represented by the polygon OABC. If we disaggregate the third aggregate into

two sub-aggregates, the sum of the two resulting vectors must be equal to that of the

original, third aggregate. As long as at least one sub-aggregate differs in skill intensity

from its aggregate, the resulting triangle BQC has positive area, and the area of the lens

increases with industry disaggregation. The bottom panel of Figure 2 illustrates how this

increase in lens area is distributed across the lens by re-ordering the sub-aggregate

industries according to their skill intensity.

        Proposition 1 and Figure 2 indicate that finding a violation of the lens condition is

sensitive to the relative aggregation of goods and regions. The likelihood of finding a

violation of the lens condition increases with industry lens size (i.e., industry

disaggregation) and decreases with region lens size (i.e., region aggregation). We now

turn to an empirical demonstration of these implications.



III. Mexico: An Empirical Example



        In this section, we show how varying the level of industry aggregation can induce

both satisfaction and violation of the lens condition in Mexico.



A. Data



        Mexico's industrial census is conducted by the Institutio Nactional de Estadística

Geografia e Informatica (INEGI), Mexico's national statistical agency. We use

manufacturing data from the 1986 and 1999 Industrial Censuses, which provide data for


                                                                                           7
                           Empirical Implementation of the Lens Condition

the year prior to the survey.5 The Census contains information on the employment of

production (unskilled) workers (obreros) and non-production (skilled) workers

(empleados), as well as aggregate payments to each type of worker (the wagebills).6 The

most disaggregate level of industry categorization in the data is the six-digit Clasificación

Mexicana de Actividades y Productos (CMAP). We construct lenses using six-, four-,

three-, and two-digit CMAP industries, which break production into 314, 54, 29 and 9

aggregates, respectively. The data cover 32 Mexican regions (31 states and the Federal

District, i.e., Mexico City).



B. Empirical Results



         Figure 3 reports separate lenses for six-, four- , three- and two-digit CMAP

industries and 32 Mexican regions for the most recent year of the sample, 1999. An

alternate view of these lenses is provided in Figure 4, which graphs the vertical distance

between region and industry lenses in the below-diagonal portion of the lenses against the

cumulative share of unskilled labor. Figure 4 makes use of a convenient algorithm for

automating the search for lens condition violations by checking numerically whether



                                        min[ N r (P ) − N i (P )] ≤ 0                                    (6)
                                          p

  Use non-production worker status as a proxy for skilled workers seems to capture much of the skill
segregation between industries in Mexico. Robertson (2004) shows that Mexican production workers have
less education in every industry than non-production workers, and that industries with a higher ratio of non-
production workers also have higher average education levels.
                                                                                                           8
                       Empirical Implementation of the Lens Condition

for 0 < P < 1.   Non-positive differences in equation (6) indicate a violation of the lens

condition because the cumulative endowment share of skilled workers is less than the

cumulative industry use share of skilled workers.

       Figures 3 and 4 summarize results for 1999. They demonstrate that the likelihood

of finding a violation of the lens condition is sensitive to the relative disaggregation of

industries and regions.    The figures show that, holding the number of regions and

therefore the region lens constant, industry disaggregation increases the relative distance

between industry and region lenses. Thus, while the lens condition is violated for 2-digit

industries, it is satisfied for 3-, 4- and 6-digit industries. The results in Figure 5 offer a

similar conclusion for 1986.

       Holding industry aggregation constant and increasing region aggregation renders

satisfaction of the lens condition more likely in analogous fashion.             We do not

demonstrate this sensitivity here because there is no natural grouping of Mexican states

into “super” states.   Disaggregating Mexican states into smaller geographic areas –

which, as noted in the introduction, may more closely resemble the labor market areas

implied by theory – on the other hand, increases region lens size and therefore increases

the likelihood of finding a violation of the lens condition. We do not perform this

exercise because confidentiality restrictions prohibit disclosure of results based on more

disaggregate regional data (e.g. municipios or cities).



VII. Conclusions



       Deardorff’s (1994) lens condition provides useful intuition about the theoretical

conditions giving rise to factor price equality. Unfortunately, empirical implementation


                                                                                            9
                      Empirical Implementation of the Lens Condition

of this condition is systematically biased by the level of aggregation of either regions or

industries. This note demonstrates this point both theoretically and empirically.

Notes: N and P represent cumulative endowments (region lens) and use (industry lens) of skilled and unskilled
workers, respectively. The four lines in this graph represent four different levels of industry aggregation that
correspond to Figure 3. The level of aggregation is denoted by the number closest to each curve. Each line
represents the difference between the lower half of the (symmetric) regional lens and the lower half of the
(symmetric) industry lens as a function of P. The lens condition fails if the difference is zero or negative, which
implies that the regional lens crosses (and therefore a part exists outside of) the industry lens. The regional lens is
comprised of the 32 states. The industry lenses are constructed from, respectively, 9 two-digit industries, 29 three-
digit industries, 54 four-digit industries, or 314 six-digit industries.
