Helping Workers Online and Offline: Innovations in Union and Worker Organization Using
the Internet

                                                  ABSTRACT

This study examines two innovative efforts to provide union services to workers with the aid of low
cost Internet communication: the AFL-CIO's Working America, a "community affiliate" that enrolled
2 million workers from 2004 to 2007 by canvassing them at their homes and over the Internet (www.workingamerica.org);
and the UK'S Trade Union Congress's www.unionreps.org.uk, a discussion board for worker representatives
to communicate about workplace issues. Working America demonstrates that workers without collective
bargaining will join a union organization that communicates on-line and off-line and campaigns for
worker interests in society. Unionreps.org shows that local worker representatives can form an on-line
community that shares information to improve the services they give workers. Combining the two
innovations could be a step toward a new "open source" union form that provides union services at
low cost outside of collective bargaining.

       Trade unions have been the major labor market intermediary for workers in market economies.

Unions provide workers with information about the workplace and job market, represent workers in

work-related grievances, and are workers’ voice in dealing with collective goods at the workplace. In

addition, unions are the key labor market intermediary that monitors business compliance with contracts,

labor laws and regulations and that lobbies on behalf of workers. Historically unions have depended on

collective bargaining with employers to improve compensation and workplace conditions and have

financed their activities with dues from members in collective bargaining sites.

       In the US the role of unions as providers of services to workers has diminished as union density

and collective bargaining coverage have shrunk. Despite survey evidence that large and increasing

proportions of non-unionized workers desire union representation (Freeman and Rogers, 2006) the

number of workers in unions has fallen relative to the number of wage and salary workers in the private

sector. Labor and community activists, non-governmental organizations, and firms’ own human resource

departments have tried to provide some of the services that unions historically delivered to workers, with

limited success (Freeman, Hersch and Mishel, 2005).

       In the UK, union density has stabilized at higher rates than in the US but the range of issues

subject to collective bargaining has narrowed and union ability to affect outcomes has weakened. With

unions helping workers only modestly through collective bargaining, an increasing proportion of

workers in organized workplaces free ride on unions while those in firms without a recognized union

show no great desire for unionization.

       Can unions in the US and UK (and in other countries where unions face problems) resurrect their

role in delivering services to workers and reestablish their bargaining power? Or, is unionism headed

for obsolescence?
                                                                                                           4


       Some analysts argue that the innovative use of the Internet and other computer-related

technologies will enable unions to resurrect their role (Shostak, 1999, Darlington, 2002, Freeman and

Rogers, 2002a, Diamond and Freeman, 2002). In these analyses, modern information-communication

technology is a tool to revolutionize the way unions provide services to workers that will allow them to

reinvent their role in market capitalism and regain lost ground. Freeman and Rogers (2002a), in

particular, argue that the Internet creates the opportunity for unions to develop a new union form,

labeled open source (OS) unionism, which operates over the Internet and in communities as well as at

work sites.

       Columns 1 and 2 of table 1 provide a capsule summary of the differences between Freeman and

Rogers’ OS form and traditional unionism. As the name suggests, the OS union enlists members and

delivers services on-line. It creates a virtual union hall through its web site. It offers expert information

on workplace issues and establishes a place for members to exchange views on work-related issues.

Rather than having a one size fits all membership structure, the OS union charges members based on

the services they obtain. Freeman and Rogers argue that because OS unions will have less power at

workplaces than traditional collective bargaining based unions , “Open source unions would not be able

to turn inward when they faced struggle, but would have to look outward. They would be pressured to

develop a more coherent and attractive public face and become a more visible source of stewardship and

moral value in the broader economy. Open source unions would gain the political clout and social

influence that would come of its playing a broader public role.” (Freeman and Rogers, 2002a, p 22-23).

       Absent bargaining clout and the potential for workplace actions such as strikes, what tools could

an OS union have to pressure an employer and intercede on the behalf of workers? It would use on-line

and area-based off-line activities to pressure employees. The experience of www.greedyassociates.com,

a website for young attorneys whose main feature is a message board about employment opportunities,
                                                                                                            5


shows how effective on-line pressures can be. In the late 1990s when major law firms paid newly hired

associates more in Silicon Valley than elsewhere, complaints from associates working outside Silicon

Valley forced the firms to raise pay in New York and other major cities, for fear that bad publicity

would reduce their chances of recruiting top law students in the future. Taras and Gesser (2003) view the

message boards as potentially “the beginning of a new area of Internet organization marked by effortless

and instant dissemination of information between similarly situated employees” – a virtual union hall.

They speculate that other nonunion workers such as bank tellers, software designers and lab technicians,

especially those who like lawyers, find themselves in high demand” could benefit from a similar site, but

argue that this “is not a union. It is something else.” (Taras and Gesser, pp 26-27).

       The 2002 success of the AFL-CIO in gaining severance pay for the non-union workers who lost

their jobs at Enron provides another example. The AFL-CIO combined a website on the plight of these

workers (http;//www.aflcio.org/enron/connections.htm) and an email campaign using its Family

Network data base to bombard creditor committees and Enron executives with faxes, telephone calls,

and emails on the workers’ behalf with off-line activity in the form of legal action and campaigns

against Enron directors. It eventually won the workers 32 million dollars.

       Whether unions can create a viable worker-based organization outside of collective bargaining

and carry out campaigns like these regularly is unclear. These nascent online efforts might develop into

a new form for mediating between workers and employers or they may turn out to be a digital form of

public relations in support of traditional collective bargaining based unions and their political goals.

Simply adopting Internet and related technologies, as many unions have done (Diamond and Freeman,

2002; Freeman, 2005; Newman, 2005; Stevens and Greer, 2005) is not sufficient. For a new union form

to succeed it has to find packages of services for workers outside of collective bargaining at costs that
                                                                                                        6


workers will pay; outperform competitor suppliers of those services; and overcome employer and anti-

union consultant use of online as well as offline access to workers.

         The history of the Knights of Labor, who organized huge numbers of workers outside of

collective bargaining in the US in the 1880s, is a warning from labor history that non-collective

bargaining organizations can prove unstable. Between 1885 and 1886, the Knights grew from about

100,000 members to 700,000 members by admitting all workers (except for lawyers, bankers, liquor

dealers, and gamblers) regardless of whether the workers were part of an organization that attained a

collective contract. Some chapters of the Knights bargained collectively but the Knights grew as a

social movement. Faced with employer pressure, however, the Knights lost membership in the late

1880s and were defunct by the end of the century (Voss, 1993; Weir, 1996). The lesson that Samuel

Gompers and other founders of the American Federation of Labor drew from the Knights’ experience

was that business unionism, in which skilled craft workers gain collective bargaining contracts with

employers, was the sole viable union form. The industrial unionism of the 1930s and 1940s seemed to

confirm the view that unionism was essentially synonymous with collective bargaining contracts with

employers.

         This study examines two union innovations in the US and UK that challenge this orthodoxy in

different ways:1 Working America (WA), the AFL-CIO’s “community affiliate” that enrolls members

by canvassing them at their homes and over the Internet (www.workingamerica.org); and

www.unionreps.org.uk, the Trade Union Congress’s discussion board for worker representatives that

enables representatives to communicate about workplace issues directly without going through union

staff or employers. It considers whether combining these and other innovations could produce an open

source union form that would prosper in the Internet era and avoid the fate of the Knights.

1. Working America

       The problem facing US unionism is that private sector density and collective bargaining

coverage have been falling steadily. In 2007 7.5% of private sector wage and salary workers and 12.1%

of all wage and salary workers were union members (http://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.nr0.htm),

which put private sector density thirteen percentage points below the density in 1980 and put overall

density 10.5 points lower than in 1980. Density did, however, roughly stabilize between 2006 and 2007,

suggesting that the greater allocation of resources to organizing that the AFL-CIO encouraged among its

affiliates and the formation of the Change-to-Win coalition (http://www.changetowin.org/) may have

helped arrest the downward trend in unionization. But perhaps this is a just a blip of stability before

union density continues on its long trend downward.

       As far as we can tell from public opinion surveys, the downward trend in density does not reflect

workers’ loss of interest in union services. To the contrary, opinion surveys show that over half of US

non managerial nonunion workers wanted trade unions to represent them in dealing with employers in

the mid-2000s – an increase over the 40 or so percent of nonunion workers who said they wanted unions

in the 1990s and the roughly 30 percent who so reported in the 1980s. An even larger proportion of

workers -- upwards of three quarters – say that they want some workplace organization exclusive of a

collective bargaining union to represent them to their employer (Freeman and Rogers, 2006, chapter 1).

       The adversarial nature of organizing contests has contributed to the erosion of US union density.

Unionization drives are typically hard-fought battles that pit workers who desire to unionize against

managements who do not want unions because union-induced increases in compensation reduce profits

and union work rules limit managers’ power at workplaces. Firms typically spend large sums of money

to counter organizing campaigns and some engage in questionable or illegal actions to deter workers

efforts to unionize.
                                                                                                             8


       For readers unfamiliar with tactics employed to counter union organizing campaigns, the 2007

independent arbitrator’s report on Yale University Hospital’s efforts to thwart an organizing drive is

illustrative. The Hospital agreed with the City of New Haven and the Service Employees International

Union to remain neutral in the campaign. However, the arbitrator found that, the agreement

notwithstanding, the Hospital and its labor relation consultant broke federal labor law, violated its own

agreement, and regularly lied to subvert the election process (Kern, 2007). Finding that the company’s

actions made it impossible for workers to choose to unionize in an election setting, the arbitrator ordered

Yale Hospital to pay 2.3 million dollars to the union for its organizing expenses and to pay 2.2 million

dollars to workers – the amount the Hospital had spent on the consultants fighting worker efforts to

organize -- on the grounds that this represented the minimal amount the employer thought workers

might have gained from unionization.2

       American unions have pursued three strategies to counter their eroding density and management

opposition to unions that engage in collective bargaining.

       First, unions have pressed Congress to enact laws to restrict management’s ability to contest

organizing efforts and avoid collective agreement when unions gain majority status. The mid-2000s

vehicle for this is the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA) (http://araw.org/takeaction/efca/index.cfm). It

requires firms to recognize a union when a majority of workers sign cards for the union. Card check

removes the option for management to campaign against the union in a National Labor Relations Board

election and lowers the length and cost of organizing campaigns. EFCA also requires firms and unions

       2
         US labor law also makes it difficult for non-collective bargaining institutions to operate at the
workplace. Section 8a2 of the Taft-Hartley Act makes it illegal for firms to set up or help workers set
up non-union groups within an enterprise to confer with management over issues relating to worker
concerns for fear that such groups would be “company unions.” In principle, labor law protects
minority unionism as much (or as little) as majority unionism but unions have generally eschewed
providing services to groups who can obtain only minority union status on the grounds that without
collective bargaining they could not raise sufficient dues to pay for the services.
                                                                                                               9


to seek first contract mediation and arbitration when employers cannot reach a contract with a newly

formed union. Finally, the proposed law raises the penalties on employers for unfair labor practices

against workers seeking to unionize.

       Second, unions have sought recognition from employers outside the framework of the National

Labor Relations Act’s electoral process. They pressure management to be neutral in organizing

campaigns. Unions with collective bargaining contracts bargain that the firm remain neutral in

organizing drives in other plants. The successes from these activities have been too limited to affect the

trend decline in union density.

       Third is the strategy that we study: organizing workers outside of collective bargaining. Some

unions -- teachers, firefighters, and police in some states in the public sector-- have organized locals for

workers even though state law does not allow for collective bargaining. These unions lobby legislatures

and other government officials on behalf of members. In the private sector, the Communication

Workers (Nack and Tarlau, 2005) has a local in IBM (www.allianceibm.org), even though it has little

chance if gaining a collective contract, and has locals for other workers in the IT sector. These unions

use the Internet to connect to members and marshal information and publicity. But the biggest and

arguably most successful effort to sign up workers outside of collective bargaining is the AFL-CIO’s

Working America.

       What is Working America?

       The AFL-CIO describes Working America (WA) as a membership-based “community affiliate”

for the millions of workers who say they want unions but cannot get union recognition at their

workplace. WA canvasses people in their homes and over the Internet to join the affiliate, so that the

employer has no power to affect their decision. In summer 2004, WA hired staff in ten cities in five

states to recruit members in urban neighborhoods with many union members on the notion that people in
                                                                                                          10


those areas would have favorable views of unions (Greenhouse, 2004). In contrast to the associate

membership schemes that AFL-CIO affiliates tried in the 1980s and 1990s to attract workers for whom

they could not gain collective contracts, WA stresses participation in a social movement as the prime

reason to join. To avoid any conflict with affiliate unions, it only enrols persons who are not otherwise

members of a union. In addition to communicating with members through telephone calls and mailings,

WA uses its website (www.workingamerica.org) to connect with workers and emails members

regularly. It conducts Internet polls of preferences to ascertain the issues on which members want it to

campaign and organizes on-line actions that ask members to email Congress or other decision-makers on

particular issues and to pass messages to others, and organizes off-line activities where it asks members

to contact decision-makers as well. It has an active get-out-the-vote drive.

       The leadership of WA are AFL-CIO staffers. In this respect WA resembles an NGO rather than a

union whose members elect their leadership. Perhaps the closest comparable organization is American

Association for Retired Persons, which has established itself as a key group in issues relating to retirees,

enlisting millions of members at low dues ($12.50 for a person and their spouse in 2007) and raising

most of its budget in other ways.

       When WA first sent canvassers to ask workers to join a non-collective bargaining union affiliate,

the organization was uncertain of the response they would get. The survey data that showed a latent

demand for unionism did not ask about a non-workplace based union affiliate with the attributes of

Working America. Perhaps workers wanted collective bargaining or nothing at all and would reject a

non-workplace based organization. Perhaps their responses to hypothetical questions on unionism

would prove to be a bad indictor of future behavior (McClennan 2007).

       The responses to the canvassing effort were striking. Two-thirds of the people WA contacted

joined the organization. By fall 2004 WA had 400,000 members. In 2007 it had 2,000,000 members,
                                                                                                         11


making it one of the fastest growing groups in US labor history. Targeting urban areas in likely swing

states in national politics, WA amassed 700,000 members in Ohio, over one quarter of a million in

Pennsylvania, and over 90,000 in Kentucky, Virginia, Minnesota and Michigan. It also obtained sizable

numbers in Florida, Missouri, Washington, Oregon, among other states. Some 89 percent of

participants give phone numbers so they could be contacted, and one-third provided e-mail addresses, an

increase over the proportion that had provided e-mails to canvassers when WA first began signing up

members. . As of mid-2007 WA had 250-300 organizers making approximately 250,000 contacts per

month. At its 2/3rds success rate, this could translate into 170,000 new members per month or about 2

million recruits per year. Additionally, the organization recruited 135,000 members through online

efforts, giving it members in New York, California, Massachusetts and other states where it did not

canvas people in their homes.

       Given the geographic mobility of Americans and changes in interest, some WA members

invariably lose their connection to the organization over time, producing a natural rate of depreciation in

the stock of members. This means that to maintain a constant stock the organization must continually

recruit new members. We do not have adequate data to estimate of the rate of depreciation, which likely

varies across areas, demographic groups, and with the method of recruitment, political events and the

business cycle. But with WA making roughly 3 million contacts at the door in 2007-2008, membership

will continue to grow at any plausible depreciation rate. The estimated cost of signing up new members

is about $8.00 per member, which compares to the $2,000 or so that it costs a union to obtain a new

member in collective bargaining (Freeman, 2004). At this writing WA does not require that its members

pay dues. Rather, it relies on outside funding, mostly from the AFL-CIO, for its budget. It also asks for

voluntary contributions of $25, which it has obtained from about 10% of new members.

       Who joins Working America?
                                                                                                            12


       Table 2 shows that the demographics of WA’s membership closely mimics the demographics of

the US population: 37% of members have at least a 2 year college degree, 41% say that they attend

church at least weekly, about one-third report themselves as “born again”, and one in three own a gun or

support the National Rifle Association. Most members describe themselves as moderate and

conservative, and about half say they are neither strong Democrats nor Republicans.

       With its limited budget, WA needs an “activist” core of members to volunteer to take action on

its behalf. As a way to identify potential activists, WA canvassers ask new members to write to their

Congressperson or some other official about an issue that matters to them and promise to pick up and

mail the letter later that day. Approximately 20-25 percent of new members undertake this action. In

2007 WA asked the members that had provided email addresses (approximately 263,000 at mid-year) to

undertake on-line activities, such as sending email protests to public officials or sending email messages

to friends or relatives about the issue. Members who joined online were more active and committed

than those who joined through the canvass and provided their email: although just 18% of WA’s email

database comes from those who joined on the Internet, those persons accounted for 60% of the online

advocacy actions. To see whether on-line activists would assist WA outside of cyberspace, four field

offices asked the on-line activists in their area to attend meetings on local issues and found that about

80% did so.

       What does Working America do?

       WA’s website offers members and others who join in its campaigns involvement in a social

movement that it markets as having “the priorities that matter most to working people… (and that can)

… make a difference for your community, for America and for your working family.” While from

Mancur Olson (1965) on, economists have stressed the need for some personal incentives to get people

involved in organizations, studies of volunteering and charitable activity suggest that by itself the “warm
                                                                                                          13


glow” of participation (Andreoni, 1990) can motivate behavior. Behavioral and neuro-economics

demonstrate that concern for fairness is deeply rooted in the human psyche (Kahneman Knetsch, and

Thaler, 1986). Experiments show that consumers are willing to pay more for goods made under good

labor practices (Hickox and Smyth, 2006). WA canvassers report that people say that they join at the

doorstep because they believe that being part of a group gives them influence in local or national

policies that they would never have as individuals.

       WA also offers considerable information to workers on its website on such issues health care

benefits, the sub-prime mortgage crisis, and rights at work. Exhibit 1 illustrates four features of the Web

site. “Ask a Lawyer” uses volunteer lawyers from unions or associated law firms to answer questions

about legal issues that arise at workplaces. In 2007 visitors to the web site asked over 200 questions per

month, with most of the questions coming from persons new to WA. The site also solicits information

from its members. WA’s most popular feature in 2007 was a contest called “My Bad Boss” where

people reported on horrid work situations. It is unclear whether reading these stories made the typical

worker feel better about their situation or added to the desire to seek some workplace organization. The

“Health Care Hustle” was a similar feature focused on problems with healthcare. “Word on the Street”

is a blog where canvassers report their experiences. Members of Working America get access to

benefits through the AFL-CIO and its Union Plus programs. The benefits include health care via Union

Plus Health Savings; a half hour of free legal advice and reduced fees from participating lawyers (Union

Plus Legal Service); and an inexpensive Mastercard (Working America credit card). But these are

treated as minor add-ons rather than selling points of membership.

       Membership gives persons the right to vote on the website for the issues of greatest importance

to them. In 2007 about 40,000 members voted that health care was the number one issue for which they

wanted the organization to campaign. Local chapters have lobbied for minimum wages in Oregon and
                                                                                                         14


Pennsylvania, funding for health care in Seattle and for school spending in other areas. The focus of WA

on societal issues rather than problems at particular firms has led WA to assess its success in part by the

extent to which its members turn out in elections and vote for candidates favored by the AFL-CIO.

WA’s internal assessments suggest that the organization succeeds in doing this to a similar extent as

collective bargaining unions do for their members.3

       While WA is the largest US union innovation that operates outside of collective bargaining, it

falls short of the Open Source model in several ways. It does not offer members assistance in dealing

with their employer. In fact, while the organization asks members about their industry and occupation,

it does not ask for their place of employment. It does not offer a forum for discussion among members

that might help create leadership and new actions from members independently of the national or local

leadership. Working America’s Washington-based leaders determine its activities, which makes it more

like a non-government organization such as AARP than a member driven union.

       Can WA maintain/increase membership and achieve financial independence if it remains focused

on broad social issues and political action?

       There is historic precedence and arguments on both sides of this question. The collapse of the

Knights of Labor shows that labor organizations that are primarily social movements can decline quickly

under pressure. The success of the AARP shows that an organization that charges minimal dues and

lobbies on behalf of retired workers is viable in the US. Models of group formation in which persons

join because their neighbors join predict that such organizations should be less stable than organizations

in which persons join solely for personal gain (Centola, 2007). To the extent that WA’s spurt in

membership benefited from two-terms of a Republican Presidential administration aligned with

       3
         These assessments fall short of an ideal methodology for testing the effects of WA on voting.
They do not, for instance, compare the voting of WA members to that of people with similar initial
views in the same area or to that of persons with similar views in areas that do not have WA chapters.

business, the election of an administration more attuned to workers interests could dampen the desire for

WA since government would be undertaking desired actions in any case. On the other hand, a

favourable national government might increase desire to participate in the organization. We suspect that

the organization will eventually have to find ways to support workers at their place of employment to

become a viable form. With a large membership in different parts of the country, WA has the potential

to experiment with alternative ways to do this and find the best mix of services and dues for its survival.

       British unions face a different problem than US unions. Union density in the UK fell in the

1980s and 1990s, then stabilized in the 2000s at about 29% of the work force. In 2006 private sector

unionism was 18% – two and half times the density in the US. UK employers do not fight vehemently

against unionism, presumably because collective bargaining does not cost firms much – the estimated

union wage premium is close to zero (Blanchflower, D.G. and Bryson, A., 2004). Government funded

national health care removes one of the major cost items associated with collective bargaining in the US.

The challenge for unions in the UK is to attract workers without a sizeable union premium rather than to

circumvent employer opposition. About 40% of workers in workplaces with collective bargaining see no

need to join the organization. Unions have modest budgets and staffs and rely on voluntary workers or

union representatives to deliver services at the workplace and to sign up new workers as well.

Voluntary union representatives at work sites are the face of unions to most workers. Representatives

work a median of 2 to5 hours per week with their employer typically paying for the time they spend as

reps at the workplace but not paying for time spent outside the workplace. Providing services through

volunteers limits the amount of direct control that the unions have over the quality and types of services

provided. Reps spend much of their time on health and safety issues and in dealing with employee

problems with the way management treats workers, and smaller amounts of time making sure workers

are paid the wages and benefits in the contract, and protecting the security of employment (see

Appendix A).

        Pondering the problem of UK unions enrolling members at organized work sites, Darlington

(2001) and Diamond and Freeman (2002) argue that unions need to improve and personalize their

services to members. One plausible way to improve services is to raise the knowledge and skills of

union reps. The greater the tenure and intensity of reps’ efforts, the less costly is the union investment in

their knowledge and skills relative to the services delivered. In the OS model, unions would use the

Internet to give greater services to dues payers in organized sites and less service to visitors at union web

sites. Our UK innovation www.unionreps.org.uk. is designed to harness the knowledge of the

voluntary reps to improve services to workers at low cost to union staff.

        What is unionreps.org?

        It is a website restricted to unique representatives who receive a unique password when they

sign up that seeks to create an online community for them to discuss issues that arise as part of their

representative duties. The Trade Unions Congress launched unionreps.org in 2003. In February 2006,

the site had 8,400 subscribers – 3.4% of the approximately 250,000 representatives in the UK – and had

16,818 hits per month. The users come from a range of unions, industries, and geographic regions that

is representative of the UK union movement.4

        The main feature of the site is a set of topical bulletin boards on which reps pose questions that

other representatives can answer. In principle, this harnesses the collective wisdom of union reps to deal

with workplace problems (Surowiecki). By enabling all representatives to benefit from questions and

 Forty-seven percent are in the public sector, 36% worked in industry, and 17% from the service sector. By
comparison 57% of union members are in the public sector, 23% in industry, and 19% in service sector jobs.
Thirty-five percent of unionreps.org users live in the Southern/Eastern region, 12% in Scotland, and 9% live in
Wales. These figures compare to 35% of union members residing in the Southern/Eastern region, 10% in
Scotland, and 6% in Wales. DTI, Employment Market Analysis and Research, April 2005, Trade Union

answers between two or more reps and providing an archive of previous questions and answers, the site

harnesses economies of scale in its provision of information. It permits asynchronous communication

since users can post questions and answers whenever they have time The site also provides resources

directly to the reps; sends a weekly newsletter to subscribers to inform them of the latest TUC news,

events and training opportunities; contains links to union related news stories and to other websites and

materials that may be of use to reps. It polls reps’ about such things as the usefulness of on-line training.

Because content on the site comes mainly from the voluntary efforts of reps, the site requires limited

maintenance by TUC staff and costs little to run.

         The TUC site resembles peer-to-peer Internet information sharing sites, such as the gnutella

network for sharing music, where 70% of members free ride and small groups provide the bulk of the

material (Adar and Huberman, 2000), usenet news groups, where anonymous users post information and

answer questions (Resnick, et al). Because such sites can be destroyed by maliciously given or

erroneous information, their success requires that the vast majority of users act in a trustworthy way.

This has produced an extensive information sciences and sociology literature on trust and online

cooperation in virtual communities (Rheingold, 1993; Kollak, 1999; Jones, Ravid, Rafaeli 2004, Bishop,

2007). Www.unionreps.org.uk has some advantages in this respect over other information-sharing web

sites. Only genuine reps using their regular union emails and full names have access to the sites.

Moreover, the union community is a connected world, so that these worker reps may encounter each

other (or common acquaintances) in the union hall or at union conferences. Individuals can build

reputations for giving accurate responses and their on-line actions can follow them into the off-line

world.

         How does www.unionreps.org.uk work?
                                                                                                                 18


         To answer this question and find out whether the site helped union reps deal with workplace

issues, raised their morale, and created an on-line community of union activists, working with the TUC

staffers who developed the site, we gathered three types of data on potential and actual users.

         First, we surveyed two types of union reps: reps undergoing TUC training between November

2003 and April 2004,5 who were introduced to the site and encouraged to use it (herein the TUC training

sample); and on-line union reps who used the website independent of TUC training. We obtained 857

usable responses from the training sample and 411 usable responses from the on-line sample, which

gave us the largest sample of union reps in the UK.

         Second, we created a data set that follows postings that reps placed on the web site from June to

December 2003. At the time of our study unionreps.org.uk had five bulletin boards: education, equality,

health and safety, law and representation, and organisation and recruitment.6 Figure 2 shows the

distribution of postings across the areas. We took all postings from the bulletin board save for the health

and safety area. We categorized the questions and responses by the individual who posted the comment,

the time it was posted, and the thread (query) to which it belonged. This meant that we coded the data

as Xfit, where X is a variable reflecting the content of the question or response, f identifies the thread to

which it belongs; i relates to the person making the posting; t is the time of the response. The X

variables included the content of the query/response, whether it gave or asked for off-site contact,

whether it referred to official data (from the union or the government), its relevance to the initial

question, and so on. We use these data to analyze the dynamics of the on-line discussion.



5
  To improve the skills of workplace representatives, the TUC runs short training sessions around the country.
Each year some 37,000 reps – or 15% of the total – are involved in a TUC training program. Our sample of
trainees comes from two sources: In Fall 2003 instructors at TUC training centers gave surveys to the worker
representatives who passed through the centers; additionally, the TUC mailed copies of the survey directly to
1,000 previous TUC worker representative training participants.
6
    In November 2004 the TUC added a pensions bulletin board to www.unionreps.org.uk.
                                                                                                            19


       Third, we conducted a longitudinal survey of persons in our initial cross-section survey. This

follow-up survey was conducted in 2005-2006. We obtained 266 responses from the group who

received TUC training and 129 responses from the group of reps who were initially users of the site.

This enable us to examine whether the trainees who were introduced to the site as part of their training

used the site in the future and whether use of the site influenced users over time.

       When we began the research, it was debatable over whether the typical union reps was “Internet

ready” to make a website part of their representative activities. As table 3 shows, we found that most

representatives were so ready: 45% of reps surveyed at TUC training centers reported using the Internet

daily; another 21% said they used it at least twice a week. Most had access to the Internet at home. The

table also shows that subscribers to unionreps.org use the Internet more frequently. There was little

difference in use of the Internet between men and women, and across age groups.7 Most important,

many union reps report that they used the Internet in the course of their representative duties for a wide

spectrum of activities.

       The sample of subscribers made greater use of the Internet for representative duties than did the

TUC trainees others, but even the trainees (who had not yet been introduced to the site) used the Internet

regularly for their representative duties – indeed, more so than for other union activity or on their jobs.

Both groups used the Internet to learn about employment regulations and training opportunities, to

communicate with the workers they represent, with other worker representatives, and with union

officials. Given these rates of Internet access and usage it is clear that a web-based resource can reach

most union representatives.8 Indicative of how users view the site, over three quarters of those in our

   Those aged 60 and older are slightly less likely to use the Internet daily, but even 75% of those aged
60 and older report using the Internet more than once a week.

  In the US this could be more complicated. The NLRB’s December 2007 ruling that firms in the United
States may prohibit workers from using their work email systems to send union-related emails could
complicate efforts to use email to reach those who mainly use the Internet at work.
                                                                                                         20


online survey report that they recommended the site to a friend. This plus the growing number of

subscribers to the site suggest that many users find the site valuable.

       What does analysis of threads tell us?

       The bulletin board at unionreps.org depends on questions posed by union reps, who post their

question because they expect someone else on the site can help answer it in a reasonable time period.

Whether this in fact occurs should depend on the number of persons on the site who could answer the

question relative to the number of other questions on the site. The more persons on the site, the greater

will be the chance of getting a useful response and the higher the value of posting a question.

Contrarily, if the site is loaded with questions and few people to provide answers, the chance of getting

an answer is likely to be small, which should discourage reps from posting their problem. A simple

difference equation captures this relation. Let Qt = the number of new questions on the site in time t; Rt-1

be the number of responses to questions in the previous period; and Qt-1 be the number of questions in

the previous period, Qt-1. Then we have a supply of questions equation:

       (1) Qt = f (Rt-1, Qt-1) with partial derivatives f1>0, f2<0, f11<0, f22>0.

       From the threads on the site for 2004, we calculated the number of new questions in our sample

per month – the arrival rate of questions -- at approximately 100 per month.

       Replies to question are the other side of the market for threads. Assuming that subscribers

arrive and check questions on the site randomly, we hypothesize that the decision to answer a question

depends on the number of questions on the site, the individuals’ expertise, and their assessment of

whether someone else might answer the question, which depends on the number of replies on the site.

While it is possible that subscribers could compete over replies, which would generate lots of replies, we

expect that free riding behavior will create a negative feedback so that persons are less likely to answer

if they believe many other reps will do so (letting Nigel answer the posts). Formally, we write the
                                                                                                          21


number of replies to questions in period t, Rt, depends positively on the number of questions in the

previous period and negatively on the number responses in the previous period, Rt-1:

       (2) Rt = g (Qt-1, Rt-1) with partial derivatives g1>0, g2<0, g11<0, g22>0.

       In this equation replies fall when there are many replies, consistent with the finding by Jones,

Ravid, and Rafaeli (2004) that persons on usenet sites tend to end active participation when mass

interaction increases.

       To examine the supply of replies in our sample, we tabulated the distribution of responses to

threads. Column 1 of Table 4 shows that just 11% of the questions received no answers. On average a

question obtained 3.1 responses though the average masks the fact that there is considerable dispersion

in the number of responses per answer. Over 12% of threads received more than five responses and one

obtained 36 replies. This distribution differs greatly from what one would expect if responses were

randomly assigned to questions. Column 2 gives the distribution of all threads on the site in 2004. In

the population, 12% of threads received no answers, essentially the same rate as in our sample. The

general shape of the distribution of responses per thread is similar. The average number of responses

per question was 3.5 and 15% of threads generated more than 5 responses.

       The timing of replies to questions is important. If a posted question does not get a reply quickly,

representatives are likely to be discouraged from posting questions. Fast responses should increase the

number of questions. In our data the median number of days before a first response was one day: 35%

of questions received a response the same day it was posted, and 22% received a response by the next

day. Nearly 2/3rds of all questions received a response within two days, and over 80% within a week.

       To see if the responses helped resolve the issue that the question raised, we read all of the

responses and coded them as to whether they “moved the thread toward answering the initial post”.

Table 5 shows that three quarters of the responses did that. One-quarter did not. The one-quarter of
                                                                                                            22


responses that did not move toward answering the initial post were often at the end of a thread,

suggesting that the thread drifted off target as persons responded to previous responses as opposed to the

initial inquiry. Such patterns have been found in the “telephone” game, where people repeat a message

along a line, inadvertently altering it (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_(game)). To verify this

interpretation, we regressed the percentage of responses that help move the question along on the

position of the response in the thread (#2 being the first response to the question, #3 for the next

response, and so on). The regression gave a statistically significant coefficient of –0.0289 on the number

of the response, indicating that the proportion of responses that helped to answer the initial post fell by

0.28 points as the number on a response increased by ten.

       We also examined whether responses that gave factual answers referenced a source of

information for their response. One third of responses gave a source. In an additional thirty percent

personal experience was the source. When there was more than one response to a question, a large

proportion concurred or expanded on the previous thread while just 4% of replies disagreed with an

earlier posing, suggesting a general concordance in views about particular situations. In short, the site

succeeds through most questions obtaining responses quickly in ways that resolve the issue.

       Bulletin boards do not rely on prices to equilibrate supply and demand. Absent a price

mechanism, the model of equations (1) and (2) makes the number of questions and replies themselves

the mechanism that brings the market into equilibrium. By relating the supply of questions positively to

responses and negatively to past questions and relating responses positively to questions and negatively

to past responses, the model essentially makes replies per question operate as a pseudo-price.

Examining the likely shapes of the supply of questions and responses in Figure 4, we see that the


9
  The equation regresses the dependent variable, percent of responses that help move the question
along, P, on the number of responses in the thread (N). The resultant estimated equation is P = 0.82-
.028 (.006) N, with n=14 and an R2 of 0.62.
                                                                                                           23


equations can produce a stable equilibrium with a fixed ratio of replies to questions. Starting the process

with a given number of questions (Q*), the negative second partial derivative of the supply of questions

to the number of responses implies that increases in responses have an increasingly small effect on the

supply of questions. Similarly, the second derivative of the supply of responses to the number of

questions is also negative, so that increases in questions have an increasingly small effect on the supply

of responses. This generates a fixed ratio of replies to questions in equilibrium.

          Do users of the site divide between those who pose questions and those who answer them or do

users work “both sides of the market” depending on the situation?

          To answer this question we divided our sample into three groups: those who only posted

questions; those who only posted answers; and those who did both. The largest group only post answers

(48%), while the smallest group only posts questions (22%), while the remaining 30% operated on both

sides of the market. This means that of those who give answers 38 % (= 30/78) also ask questions while

of those who ask questions 58% (=30/52) also give answers, so that among both posers of questions and

responders to queries a substantial number of persons work both sides of the market.

          Figure 3 displays the frequency of posting (questions and responses) by individuals. The data

follow a power law with many people posting a small number of times and a few persons posting many

times. Regressing the natural log of the number of individuals posting a given number of posts (ln freq)

on the natural log of the number of posts (ln number) gives the following relation:

          (3) ln (freq) = 5.27 - 1.58* (0.08) ln(number),

where the number in parenthesis is the standard error of the estimate.10

          Dividing postings between questions posed and replies, the data (not given in the figure) show

that the questions are less concentrated among a small number of persons than are replies. The top 5%


10
     The sample size is 22 and the R2 is 0.95 in this regression
                                                                                                           24


of persons in terms of the number of questions posed asked 29% of all the questions whereas the top 5 %

of persons who answered questions gave 35% of the total number of answers. But both distributions

diverge from the distributions that would arise if the number of postings were determined “randomly”,

in the sense that each representative had a similar probability of making a posting per time unit in a

period of n independent time units. In that case, the distribution of postings would be binomial and the

variance of the number of postings would be smaller than the mean number of postings.11 The data

show the opposite: higher variances than means. Put differently, the actual distribution of questions per

person (responses per person) is less concentrated around the mean number of questions per person

(responses per person) than under the random model. This implies considerable heterogeneity in posing

and answering questions. Some representatives are more willing to pose questions or have more

problems at their workplace than others while some other representatives are either more willing to

answer questions or have greater experience and knowledge to share than other representatives.

       Finally, we examined the extent to which on-line interactions led to off-line linkages. Seven

percent of responses, covering 17% of threads, advised the person who posed the question to contact a

union or TUC official, which would take them off the site. Although less than 3% of questions included

off-site contact info and only 7% of responses did, even modest listing of contact information could

produce a substantial off-site contacts since many persons are on the site often and may only list their

contact information once. On some of the boards, moreover, there was more direction to off-site

contacts. Roughly a third of the threads on the “Education, learning and skills” bulletin board contain

such off-site contact information, for example. Over time, the percent of threads with off-site

information rose from 25% in 2003 to 40% in 2004


11
  If X is the number of postings and X is generated by a binomial process where in each of n periods a
person has the probability p of making a posting, then the expected value of X is np and the variance of
X is np (1-p) so that the variance is smaller than the mean.
                                                                                                            25


         That some discussions go off-site suggests that analyses of the threads on the board understate

the impact of the site in developing communication among representatives. Even though contact

information per question or response is modest, it is sufficient to generate the considerable off-site links

per site user found in our survey. Consistent with this in our longitudinal follow-up survey, a sizable

number of respondents (40%) reported meeting people as a result of on-line contact. Moving discussions

off-line could also signify that members view the site as too public a forum for discussion of detailed,

incident-specific or sensitive topics as the membership and volume grow. As responses move off-site

they lose their public good nature and the answers cease to be part of the archive.

Longitudinal analysis

       Workers in the training sample were introduced to unionreps.org.uk as part of their TUC training

program. We model the effect of the introduction and/or ensuing use of the site on their behavior and

attitudes as representatives using a before-after treatment-control design. While some TUC trainees had

seen or visited the unionreps site before training, the vast majority had not done so. Their responses on

our cross section survey thus reflect a “before treatment” measure. Using the lingo of analyses of job

training/other interventions, trainees who use the site are a “treatment” group while the entire group of

trainees are “the intention to treat” group. We then examine whether introduction to the site during

training affected ensuing use of the site and whether that was associated with changes in attitudes or

behavior as a rep. Whether or not persons in the training sample use the site (ie “take-up”) is of course

not random. As we lack a traditional control group that is not exposed to treatment, we will instead use

the persons surveyed through the site and already using it in the first period as the control group. The

key assumption here is that there are no pre-existing differences in trend between them and the trainees.

       Table 6 shows that introduction to the site during training increased ensuing use of it by trainees.

The table records the percentage of persons reporting for whom we have responses on both the initial
                                                                                                           26


and follow-up surveys. At the time of the cross section survey 68% of trainees had never used the site.

Afterwards that proportion was 32%. At the other end of the spectrum, just 18% used the site weekly

before training while 29% used it weekly afterwards. By contrast, among the respondents from the

sample of users on the site, there is a drop in those who use it weekly or more from 72% to 47%,

possibly reflecting a decline in their need to use the site regularly.

       Respondents from the on-line sample of users of the site answered some questions about their

representative work and attitudes toward unionism differently than did those in the TUC training

sample. Table 7 gives the key questions that our cross-section survey sought to assess how worker reps

viewed their activity as reps and union activity in general. The on-line sample is more likely to report

that their work is taxing and stressful (24% agree with the statement fully by giving a 1 score and while

29% give it a 2 score compared to 14% and 22% for persons in the TUC training sample); that they are

well-prepared and trained to be a union representative (22% with complete agreement and 43% with

agreement compared to 15% and 26% in the training sample); and that workers at their workplace

benefit from the union (58% and 25% compared to 46% and 27% for the training sample). By contrast

there is little difference between the samples in views of the extent to which workers or their unions

appreciate what they are doing.

       To assess whether trainees who began to use the site changed their relative responses to

questions about attitudes or behavior relative to previous users, we estimated the following equation:

       (4) Yit = a + b TREATi + c TREATi*AFTERt ,

where TREAT measures whether the respondent were a part of the group introduced to the unionreps

site through the TUC’s training program and AFTER is a dummy variable that takes the value 1 for the

follow-up survey. The coefficient c measures the change in the dependent variable between those who
                                                                                                            27


began to use the site after training compared to the “control” group of those who were already using the

site when the first survey was conducted.

       Table 8 shows the results of this analysis for three variables for which there was a significant

difference in the first round of the survey between the training sample and the on-line sample. Column a

under each statement record estimated differences in responses in the first round of the survey between

persons introduced to the site in the training center and the on-line sample and in parenthesis a t-statistic

for the differences between the two samples. Recalling that higher responses mean greater disagreement

with the statement, the coefficient 0.49, for example, shows that the trainees were less likely to say that

they were well prepared and trained to be a representative than persons who always used the site.

Column a also gives an estimate of the difference between the two samples in the rate of completing the

second survey. The differences are modest. If they were large, we would have a serious sample attrition

and selectivity problem.

       The estimated coefficients and t-statistics for the coefficents of the variables in Equation 4 are

given under each statement in column b of the table. The coefficients on the dummy for being in the

training sample are of similar magnitude to the comparable statistics in column a. The estimates differ

between the samples because the sample in column b is limited to persons who completed both surveys.

The new information in column b is in the estimates of the effect of introducing the site to trainees. For

each statement these estimates are significantly negative, indicating that the trainees introduced to the

site became more like persons already using the site.12 The implication is that use of the site influenced

trainees: they regard themselves as better prepared and trained to be a union rep and believe more

12
  Those who ultimately participated in both rounds of the survey do not appear to significantly differ, at
least initially, on any measure except preparedness. Those who chose to participate in both rounds of
the survey initially felt more prepared for their representative duties than those who only participated in
the first round. While there may be some selective attrition between the rounds it does not appear to be
substantial, at least with respect to the initial values of the variables of interest.
                                                                                                                          28


strongly that workers at their workplace benefit from unions. All of these effects are presumably due to

their being involved with the unionreps.org.uk site and community. At the same time, they also found

their work as a representative more taxing and stressful, which is surprising. We imagined that the

additional support network of the online community and the resources it provides would diminish the

perceived burden of being a union representative. One potential explanation for the result is that it

reflects a natural decline in the enthusiasm of new recruits over time. To test this explanation, we

reproduced the estimates in Table 8 with the sample broken out by the tenure of the representatives, and

found that the coefficients of interest are virtually unchanged, which rejects this explanation.13

However, with only two time periods, it is still possible that there are differential trends across the

groups that we cannot identify.. Another possible explanation is that the exposure to the reps on the site

increases the perceived burden by emphasizing the importance of the role and raising expectations about

their duties, say through peer pressure or broader exposure to what is possible. But we have no evidence

on this point.

3. Conclusion: where will these innovations lead?

        Given the difficulties that U.S. unions have with organizing workers for traditional collective

bargaining, unions must find ways to gain new members if they are to survive. The rapid expansion of

Working America shows that a movement-based organization that campaigns for worker interests in

society on-line and off-line can attract large numbers at low cost. The greater activism of members who

join on-line suggests further that the Internet may be a particularly good way to find highly committed

persons. What we do not know is whether Working America’s long run stability will necessitate that it

finds ways to deliver union services to workplaces in addition to campaigning and lobbying for workers


13
  The sample was divided into those with 6 or more years of tenure and those with less experience (this demarcation was
chosen to create roughly equal sample sizes). For those with 6 or more years of experience the estimates of Btreat and
BtreatXafter of 0.49 and -0.52 respectively compared with estimates of 0.53 and -0.49 for those with less experience.
                                                                                                            29


in society and, if so, whether it will find the right mix of services at the dues members will be willing to

pay.

       Given the difficulties that British unions have in organizing workers in workplaces with

traditional collective bargaining, it is critical for them to improve and personalize services to members

The success of www.unionreps.org.uk in building a community of voluntary worker representatives who

exchange information suggests that unions can tap the wisdom of their members to advance this goal at

low cost. The greater activism of reps that join the site suggests that it offers a way increase the

commitment and effort by reps. Whether the transmission of knowledge among reps improves services

to workers by enough to attract more members or whether the TUC or constituent unions must go

further and use their computer data base on members to personalize services remain to be seen.

       A service provision model that relies on the Internet may alleviate concerns of employer

opposition, but it has challenges of its own. In collective bargaining, unions are essentially awarded a

monopoly after winning recognition. On the Internet and outside the workplace nonunion groups offer

information and services to workers that compete with union services.14 Unions will therefore have to

compete not only to attract new members, but to keep the members they enroll through this venue.

Unions have, however, some advantages in providing services over the Internet to workers. As member-

based organizations that are democratically accountable to workers, they should be more responsive and

trustworthy agents than other organizations. And unions can mobilize many more members and activists


       14
          Internet recruitment sites such as Monster.com or Careerbuilder.com give information and
advice to workers to attract more job applicants. Labor law firms advertise assistance to workers.
Human resource divisions of major firms use the company’s internal e-mail system and computer
records to connect with workers. Internet aside, public interest legal organizations defend the interests
of particular types of workers (Jolls, 2005); community groups have formed to help immigrants and
various ethnic groups (Osterman, Fine, Lynch), often led by persons with union experience; NGOs have
sought to provide portable benefits to workers outside of collective bargaining (Hersch, 2005). The
UK’s Citizens Advice Bureau offers government protections and assistance to workers more broadly.
                                                                                                            30


on a volunteer basis to provide services to fellow workers than can smaller non-member based

organizations.

       We suspect that Working America and the US unions broadly will have to undertake other

innovations to create a viable organization for workers outside of collective bargaining. Studies of high

performance workplaces find that single policies rarely transform a workplace. What is needed are

complementary policies that make the sum of the package exceed the sum of its parts introduced singly.

Given its mass membership and activists, Working America could potentially benefit from developing

Internet bulletin boards of the www.unionreps.org type to stimulate local members and activists to find

new directions for the organization. British unions are also likely to need innovations beyond

union.reps.org.uk to improve services and attract free riders at organized workplaces and to expand to

other workplaces. What our analysis has shown is that the US and UK central union federations have

begun the difficult process of changing how they conduct business and have some successes on which to

build further.

       Assuming that the on-line and non-collective bargaining based activities become a permanent

part of the labor scene, will they substitute for traditional unions modes of intermediation or will they

complement and strengthen collective bargaining representation at workplaces? If on-line union

activities come to resemble those of other service providers or websites,that give no collective back-up

for workers, unions would be unions in name only. They would have lost the fundamental features of

traditional unions as democratic workplace organizations that provided collective voice to workers.

Similarly, if the non-collective bargaining based activities of Working America or related organizatins

come to resemble those that representing other groups in the political scene, such as the American

Association of Retired People, they would also be unions in name only. They might help their

constituents, but they would have lost the fundamental features of traditional unions.
                                                                                                        31


       The unionreps.org case demonstrates a way these sites can complement unions’ traditional role.

It strengthens the ability of unions to meet their traditional role as representing workers at their

workplace. By pooling the information of representatives across areas, the unionreps.org site recognizes

that the problems faced by workers extend beyond any one location in the modern labor market, and that

information is an important tool in local representation and bargaining.

       The Working America experiment has more of the flavor of an AARP-style substitute, but it is

too early to know whether the organization will try to go beyond representing and organizing people for

broad social purposes. To the extent that it helps collective bargaining unions augment their power with

firms or in the political sphere by providing a larger base of support and information broking on

particular measures, it may shore up unions’ traditional intermediary role in the labor market. It is

possible that WA will be able to maintain loyalty and support over a long period of time without giving

members concrete support at their workplaces. But it is also possible that WA or some other union

group will learn how to build on its non-collective bargaining members to develop an “open source”

model that provides value at workplaces beyond collective bargaining.

       What makes these union activities exciting is that they are not grandma’s or grandpa’s unions

doing the same old thing in the same old way. They represent unionism in an innovative mode, trying to

shore up its traditional roles and trying to find new ways to provide intermediary services in the modern

labor market.
