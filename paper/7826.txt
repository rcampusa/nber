1       Introduction
Ever since the pathbreaking work of Pareto more than a century ago, economists have
known that wealth is extremely unevenly distributed. More recently, survey data have
revealed that portfolio structures are also very diÔ¨Äerent for households with diÔ¨Äerent
levels of wealth. While the portfolios of the rich are complex, the portfolio of Ô¨Ånancial
and real assets of the median household (at least in the U.S.) is rather simple: a check-
ing/savings account plus a home and mortgage, and not much else.1 Overwhelmingly,
the data tell us that if we wish to understand aggregate portfolio behavior, it is critical
to understand the behavior of the richest few percent of households, both because they
control the bulk of aggregate wealth and because their portfolio behavior is much more
complex than that of the typical household.
    Though the foregoing arguments may seem to provide a compelling rationale for
studying the portfolios of the rich, there has been little recent academic work in this
area. The goal of this paper is to provide a summary of the basic facts about portfolios
of wealthy households in the U.S. (and how the facts have changed over time) in a form
which allows comparison of their behavior both with the rest of the population in the
U.S. and with portfolio behavior among other groups and other countriessurveyed in
the recent volume Household Portfolios edited by Guiso, Haliassos, and Jappelli (2001
(Projected)), and to make a preliminary attempt to understand the characteristics that
will be required of any model which hopes to be consistent with the observed behavior.
    The principal conclusion will be that the most important way in which the portfolios
of the rich diÔ¨Äer from those of the rest is that the rich hold a much higher proportion
of their portfolios in risky investments, with a particularly large concentration of net
worth in their own entrepreneurial ventures.
    After the empirical conclusions are presented, the paper informally considers how
these results relate to theoretical models of portfolio behavior. The starting point
will be a standard stochastic version of the Life Cycle/Permanent Income Hypothesis
model. That model will prove inadequate, however, because it implies that the rich
should look like scaled-up versions of everybody else. They should have neither the
extreme wealth-to-income ratios observed in the data, nor the unusual portfolio struc-
tures. The goal of the theoretical discussion will be to consider whether any of three
potential modiÔ¨Åcations to the standard model might explain the observed combination
of facts.
    The Ô¨Årst idea is that perhaps there is exogenous, immutable ex ante variation in
risk aversion across households.2 In that case more risk-tolerant households would
    1
     Bertaut and Starr-McCluer (2001) Ô¨Ånd that the only kind of Ô¨Ånancial asset held by more than
half of US households is a checking/transactions account.
   2
     By ex ante we mean a preference diÔ¨Äerence which exists prior to any saving or portfolio choice
decision the household makes, and which is unaÔ¨Äected by the outcomes of such choices.



                                                2
take greater risks and on average would earn higher returns. If owning a private busi-
ness is the form of economic activity that oÔ¨Äers the highest risk and highest return,
one might expect that the most risk tolerant households would gravitate toward en-
trepreneurship, and on average would end up richer (though the failures might end
up poorer).3 The paper will argue that this story has several defects, ranging from
the fact that the empirical evidence fails to Ô¨Ånd a correlation between wealth growth
and initial (expressed) risk aversion to the fact that, taken alone, the story provides
neither an explanation for the lack of diversiÔ¨Åcation of entrepreneurial investments nor
for the tendency of wealthy households to hold much of their net worth in their own
entrepreneurial ventures.
    These points lead to the second possibility: that the observed patterns are entirely
a consequence of capital market imperfections, as suggested recently by Gentry and
Hubbard (1998) and Quadrini (1999). Those authors argue that adverse selection and
moral hazard problems require entrepreneurial enterprises to be largely self-Ô¨Ånanced.
They further assume that there is a minimum eÔ¨Écient scale for private enterprises
and that this minimum scale is large relative to the wealth of the typical household.
The combination of these two assumptions can explain why households with low or
moderate wealth or income are less likely to become entrepreneurs. Furthermore,
this story requires no diÔ¨Äerences in tastes among members of the population, and in
principle can explain both the high saving rates of the rich and the high portfolio shares
in their own entrepreneurial ventures. However, this story too has problems. The Ô¨Årst
is that, in the absence of diÔ¨Äerences in preferences between the rich and the rest,
the standard model implies that those households who have invested heavily in their
own entrepreneurial ventures should try to balance the riskiness of these investments by
holding all other assets in very safe forms. Instead, the non-entrepreneurial investments
of rich entrepreneurs are much riskier than the portfolios of nonrich nonentrepreneurs.
A second problem with this story is that even the model with imperfect capital markets
implies that as the rich get old, they eventually begin running down their wealth. In
contrast, empirical data reveal no evidence that wealthy elderly households ever begin
to run down their wealth.
    The Ô¨Ånal possibility is that the model‚Äôs assumption about the household utility
function needs to be changed in a manner similar to that proposed by Carroll (2000),
who simply assumes that wealth enters the utility function as a luxury good in a mod-
iÔ¨Åed Stone-Geary form. Because Max Weber (1958) argued that a love of wealth for
its own sake is the spirit of capitalism, Bakshi and Chen (1996) and Zou (1994) have
   3
    Surprisingly, it is not clear that classical theory supports the proposition that less risk averse
individuals will invest a higher proportion of their risky investments in the most-risky activities.
See Gollier (2001) for a discussion of the ‚Äòmutual fund separation theorem‚Äô which implies that the
composition of risky assets should be similar whatever the level of risky asset holdings. We will assume
that this reÔ¨Çects a limitation of classical theory, rather than a plausible description of behavior.



                                                   3
dubbed such models ‚Äòcapitalist spirit‚Äô models. Carroll (2000) proposed this modiÔ¨Åca-
tion to the standard model as a way to explain the high lifetime saving rates of the rich,
and argued that many diÔ¨Äerent kinds of behavior, ranging from philanthropic bequest
motives to pure greed, would result in a formulation of saving behavior that would be
well captured by the modiÔ¨Åed model. An unanticipated consequence of the model is
that it implies that rich households have lower relative risk aversion than the nonrich,
which in turn could explain why the rich hold riskier portfolios than the rest, and why
high-wealth or high-income young households are more likely to begin entrepreneurial
ventures.
    The one feature of the data that the ‚Äòcapitalist spirit‚Äô model taken alone cannot
explain is the tendency of entrepreneurs to invest largely in their own entrepeneurial
ventures, which appears to require some form of capital market imperfection. The
paper thus concludes that the main features of the data can probably be explained in a
model which combines capital market imperfections of the kind emphasized by Gentry
and Hubbard (1998) and Quadrini (1999) with a utility function like that postulated
in Carroll (2000).


2       The Data
2.1     Portfolios of the Rich
U.S. survey data on the portfolios of the rich are the best in the world. The 1962-
63 Survey of Financial Characteristics of Consumers (henceforth SFCC) was the Ô¨Årst
wealth survey to heavily oversample the richest households. The next comprehensive
wealth survey was the 1983 Survey of Consumer Finances, which was followed by a
1989 SCF which consisted of a subsample of reinterviewed households from the 1983
survey along with a fresh batch of new households. Since 1989 the SCF has been
performed triennially (though with no further panel elements), with the latest survey
having been completed in 1998.
    The availability of data spanning such a long time period opens up the possibility
of studying how portfolios change in response to changes in the economic enviornment.
Before examining the data on portfolio structure, therefore, we Ô¨Årst present a summary
of the taxation and legal changes that we might expect to have had a substantial impact
on portfolio structure of wealthy households.

2.1.1    The Tax Environment
Table 1 summarizes the changes over time in the three aspects of US taxes that are
particularly important for the rich. (For information on broader changes in the US tax
code see the paper by Poterba (2001)). The Ô¨Årst two columns show the statutory top


                                            4
marginal federal tax rate, which declined from 91 percent in 1963 to 39.6 percent in
1993 and thereafter. The second column shows the actual taxes paid as a proportion of
their incomes by the richest one percent of households. In spite of the dramatic decline
in top marginal rates, the proportion of income paid in taxes has been fairly steady,
varying between around 20 and 25 percent over the entire period. This reÔ¨Çects the
fact that during the era of high top marginal rates, the tax code was riddled with tax
shelters and loopholes that made it possible for almost all rich people to avoid paying
the conÔ¨Åscatory top marginal rates on the statute books.
    The estate tax is also highly relevant for the rich. The structure of the estate tax
is rather complex, but that structure remained largely the same over the period in
question. The Ô¨Årst $x of an estate is free from estate taxation altogether, where $x is
indicated by the column of the table labelled ‚Äòexemption.‚Äô Above $x, taxes begin at a
marginal rate of y percent and peak at a top marginal rate of z percent, where y and
z are the Ô¨Årst and second numbers in the column labelled ‚Äòtax range.‚Äô
    The exclusion for closely held businesses is a mechanism that reduces the reported
amount of the value of a closely-held business that is taxable, under the condition
that the heir plans to ‚Äòactively manage‚Äô the business rather than sell it. The marital
deduction indicates how much of the estate is taxed when one spouse dies and the
estate falls into the hands of the widow or widower. The 100 percent deduction since
1985 means that estates are taxed only when both members of a married couple have
died.
    The Ô¨Ånal kind of tax that is relevant to the rich is the gift tax exclusion amount
$g, whose value is reported in the last column of the table. This is the amount that
each member of the household (husband and wife) can give to any individual (son,
daughter, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, grandchildren, etc.) annually without incurring
any additional taxes for the recipient or donor.
    The table shows that there have been two big changes in the taxes speciÔ¨Åcally
relevant for the rich over the period in question: the large increase in exemption levels
for the estate tax in the early 1980s, and the more gradual, but cumulatively very large,
decline in top marginal rates. The most important change not captured in the table is
probably the abrupt termination of a variety of tax shelters in the 1986 tax reform.
    A Ô¨Ånal feature of the tax code that is relevant for the rich is the ‚Äòstep-up in basis
at death.‚Äô The capital gains tax ‚Äòbasis‚Äô for an asset is normally deÔ¨Åned as the nominal
price at which the asset was bought. However, if the asset has been inherited, then the
basis is the nominal valuation of the asset at the time it was inherited. The step up in
basis at death provides an incentive for individuals who anticipate leaving a bequest
whose value is less than the exemption amount to hold their assets in forms which yield
returns disproportionately in the form of capital gains, since capital gains that happen
before death are untaxed. (Incentives for the very rich to hold their assets in forms
which yield mainly capital gains are smaller because the capital gains do contribute


                                           5
to the valuation of the estate for tax purposes and thus are marginally taxed at the
marginal estate tax rate for those who will leave bequests in excess of the exemption
amount).
    Implications of the tax system for the portfolio structure of the rich are not al-
ways easy to determine by examining statutory provisions. For example, the incentive
provided by the ‚Äòstep up in basis at death‚Äô to hold assets in forms that yield capital
gains depends importantly on the eÔ¨Äective marginal rate of taxation on other forms of
capital income, which (as discussed above) is not very well proxied by the statutory
top marginal rate. The exclusion for closely held businesses does provide an incentive
to hold at least a limited absolute amount of the portfolio in the form of closely-held
businesses if the individual expects his or her heirs to continue to run the business.
However, no marginal incentive to further business ownership is provided once the
total amount of wealth held in this form exceeds the exclusion amount. For a more
detailed historical analysis of tax policies relevant for the rich in the postwar period,
see Brownlee (2000).

2.1.2   Detailed Portfolio Structure
Our statistical summary of the portfolio structure of the rich begins with Table 2,
which provides data on the proportion of the rich (deÔ¨Åned here and henceforth as the
top one percent of households by net worth) who own any amount of various kinds of
assets.
    Perhaps the most dramatic change over time in the table is the sharp increase in
the proportion of households with deÔ¨Åned contribution pension plans. In the 1962-63
SFCC, only 10.1 percent of the rich had any such account, but by 1983 the fraction had
already jumped to 65.6, while by 1995 the fraction had reached 78.6 percent. The low
percentage in 1962-63 reÔ¨Çects the fact that there was little tax advantage to such plans
until the early 1980s, when Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs) suddenly became
available in principle to the whole population, and eligibility for company-based 401(k)
pension plans was greatly expanded. What is interesting is the speed with which rich
households availed themselves of these new options. In contrast, Bertaut and Starr-
McCluer (2001) show (Table 3) that only 31 percent of all households had acquired
such accounts by the time of the 1983 survey.
    Another notable change is that the proportion holding individual stock shares di-
rectly has fallen from 84.0 percent in 1962 to 65.0 percent in 1995, while the proportion
holding mutual funds has risen from about 24 percent to about 45 percent. This re-
Ô¨Çects a broad pattern in which households have increasingly decided to hold shares in
the form of mutual funds rather than individual stocks. This pattern has not been
much studied by economists, although it is interesting because it reÔ¨Çects a convergence
of actual behavior toward portfolio theory‚Äôs recommendation for diversiÔ¨Åcation.



                                           6
    Among the other categories of assets, the largest changes are seen in the holdings of
‚Äòother bonds‚Äô (primarily corporate bonds), which declined very sharply between 1962
and 1983 and Ô¨Çuctuated substantially between 1983 and 1995. Because nominal interest
income is taxable annually while capital gains are taxable only upon realization, the
sharp increase in nominal interest rates caused by the acceleration of inÔ¨Çation in the
1960s and 1970s could explain a shift out of interest-bearing assets between the 1963
and 1983. However, there is no obvious tax reason for the Ô¨Çuctuations between 1983
and 1995.
    The proportion of the richest households who have equity in a privately held busi-
ness has Ô¨Çuctuated substantially over the years, from a low of 69.0 percent in 1962-63
to a high of 88.0 percent in 1983. To some extent, Ô¨Çuctuations in this variable may
reÔ¨Çect stock market valuations, because after a large increase in stock prices a higher
proportion of the wealthy will be rich because of their stock holdings compared with
the proportion who are rich because of their holdings of other kinds of assets. (The
1983 SCF was conducted before the bull markets of the 80s and 90s had boosted stock
valuations.)
    With respect to debt holdings, the proportion of rich households with any debt
jumped sharply between the 1962-63 SFCC, when it was 50.2 percent, and the 1983
SCF, when it was 77.9 percent, but exhibited no clear trend thereafter. Among debt
categories, the most striking change is the increase in the proportion of households with
mortgage debt, from 30.7 percent in 1962 to 52.5 percent in 1995. This likely reÔ¨Çects
the fact that mortgage interest remained tax deductible after the 1986 tax reform while
other forms of debt lost their deductible status.
    On the whole, the striking feature of this table is that the proportion of rich house-
holds owning various categories of assets has not changed greatly for most categories of
assets - particularly considering that small sample sizes mean that there is inevitably
some measurement error in the statistics for any particular year.4
    Another useful comparison is of the rich to the rest of the population. Average
values of ownership shares for the nonrich over the Ô¨Åve survey years are presented
in the last column of the table. The broadest observation to make here is that rich
households are more likely to own virtually every kind of asset. Particularly striking
is the discrepancy in the proportion owning equity in a privately held business, which
averages about 75 percent for the rich but only 13 percent for the rest of the population.
The contrast in ownership of shares in publicly traded companies is only slightly less
dramatic: 74 percent versus 16 percent.
    Table 3 examines the relative weight of various kinds of assets in the net worth of
   4
    One exception is ‚Äòother Ô¨Ånancial assets,‚Äô which had an 89.3 percent owernship rate in the 1962-63
SFCC but much lower rates in the later surveys. This is almost certainly because holdings of cash
were included in this grab-bag category in the SFCC but not in the SCF‚Äôs. In any case, the next table
shows that ‚Äòother Ô¨Ånanical assets‚Äô constitute a trivial proportion of net worth in all surveys.



                                                 7
the richest households. The table shows that the shift in value from stocks to mutual
funds was substantial, but even at the end of the sample in 1995, total net worth in
individual shares still remained substantially greater than that in mutual funds. One
of the largest shifts over time is in the role of investment real estate, which jumps from
7.4 percent of net worth in 1962-63 to over 20 percent in 1983. Investment real estate
continues to constitute more than 20 percent of the portfolio until 1995, when its share
drops to 13.1 percent. The jump in investment real estate between the early 1960s and
the early 1980s may reÔ¨Çect the prominent role of real estate in tax shelters until the
tax reform act of 1986. One would have expected a decline in the value of investment
real estate following the repeal of many of these tax shelters in the 1986 tax act, so it
is surprising that no decline is manifest until 1995.
    Another interesting observation from the table is the small amount of mortgage
debt (only 1.1 percent of net worth on average) despite the fact that more than half of
the rich have positive amounts of such debt.
    Comparing the rich to the rest of the population, again perhaps the most important
diÔ¨Äerence is the importance of business equity for the rich. Such wealth accounts for
about 40 percent of total net worth of the rich in 1983 and thereafter, vastly more than
its share in the net worth of the typical household. Other diÔ¨Äerences include the lower
total indebtedness of the rich and the much smaller proportion of total wealth tied up
in home equity.

2.1.3   Portfolio Structure And Portfolio Theory
The usual theoretical analysis of portfolio allocation considers the optimal proportion
of net worth to invest in ‚Äòrisky‚Äô versus ‚Äòsafe‚Äô assets. This stylized theoretical treatment
is conceptually useful but diÔ¨Écult to bring to data, because it is hard to allocate every
asset to one of these two categories. Table 4 reÔ¨Çects an eÔ¨Äort to Ô¨Ånd a compromise
between the complexity of actual portfolios and the simplicity of theory.
    Among Ô¨Ånancial assets, there are some that are clearly safe (like checking, saving,
and money-market accounts) and some that are clearly risky (like stock shares). But
other assets are harder to allocate, either because the item itself has an ambiguous
status (like long-term government bonds, which are subject to inÔ¨Çation risk but not
repayment risk (we hope!)) or because the asset is a composite with unknown propor-
tions of risky and safe assets (like mutual funds which hold both stocks and government
bonds). We have allocated all Ô¨Ånancial assets to one of three categories: Clearly safe,
fairly safe, and risky, which can of course be further aggregated into broad measures of
safe and risky assets. We have divided nonÔ¨Ånancial assets into the primary residence,
investment real estate, business equity, vehicles, and ‚Äòother.‚Äô
    With these deÔ¨Ånitions, we can construct three deÔ¨Ånitions of risky assets: A ‚Äònarrow‚Äô
deÔ¨Ånition, which includes only risky Ô¨Ånancial assets; a ‚Äòbroad‚Äô deÔ¨Ånition, which includes



                                            8
clearly and fairly risky Ô¨Ånancial assets, business equity, and investment real estate; and
a ‚Äòbroadest‚Äô deÔ¨Ånition which adds even the ‚Äòfairly safe‚Äô assets.
    It is apparent from the table that the portfolios of the rich are dramatically more
risky than those of the rest of the population.5 Across the Ô¨Åve surveys the proportion of
their portfolios that consisted of broadly risky assets was about 80 percent, compared
with an average percentage of only 40 percent for the nonrich households. Examining
the data in more detail reveals two key diÔ¨Äerences between the rich and the rest:
the rich hold a much smaller proportion of their wealth in home equity6 (7.4 percent
versus 49.6 percent) and a much larger proportion in business equity and investment
real estate (the sum of these two categories is 52.1 percent for the rich versus 26.2
percent for the rest).

2.1.4    Portfolio DiversiÔ¨Åcation and Age Structure
Another perspective on the portfolios of the rich is presented in Table 5, which provides
a census of the portfolio structure of the rich along the three dimensions corresponding
to ownership or non-ownership of clearly safe, fairly safe, and risky assets, a total of
23 = 8 diÔ¨Äerent possibilities. In all Ô¨Åve survey years, a majority or nearly a majority of
the rich held some assets in each of these three categories. This is a sharp contrast to
the behavior of the rest of the population, which is much more evenly distributed among
the 8 categories but is most heavily concentrated in the region with only safe assets.
(See Bertaut and Starr-McCluer (2001) for the data on the rest of the population.)
    Finally, Table 6 presents data on ownership rates for risky assets by age of the
household head for each of the survey years.7 Interestingly, the patterns for ownership
rates and for portfolio shares are diÔ¨Äerent: The probability of owning at least some
amount of risky assets is monotonically increasing in age, but the proportion of the
portfolio composed of ‚Äòbroad risky‚Äô assets rises through the Ô¨Årst three age categories
(up to age 49) but exhibits no clear pattern across the older age groups.8 Ownership
rates of ‚Äòrisky‚Äô assets show a similar monotonic increase (at least until age 70+), while
the portfolio share shows some tendency to decline with age. As King and Leape (1984)
argue, the monotonic increase in ownership rates may reÔ¨Çect the accumulation of ex-
perience with diÔ¨Äerent assets as the household ages. The reduction in the ‚Äòrisky‚Äô share
   5
      One might wonder whether the diÔ¨Äerences in risky shares partly reÔ¨Çect age diÔ¨Äerences between
the rich and the rest. However, when the age range for the rich and the rest is restricted to households
aged 35-54, the divergence between the rich and the rest is, if anything, even greater. For example, the
portfolio share of private business for the age 35-54 rich is 47.6 versus 17.9 for the age 35-54 nonrich
- a greater discrepancy than the 37.7 versus 14.8 Ô¨Ågures in Table 4.
    6
      Home equity is calculated as the value of primary residence minus mortgage debt.
    7
      Portfolio shares are for the whole population of the rich, not just for those who own risky assets,
i.e. the numbers are not conditional on participation.
    8
      It is important to recall that these Ô¨Ågures may reÔ¨Çect the eÔ¨Äects of both cohort and time eÔ¨Äects
as well as age eÔ¨Äects, so the true age eÔ¨Äects may diÔ¨Äer from the reported numbers.


                                                   9
of the portfolio for the 50+ age groups is interesting because it corresponds roughly
to the common Ô¨Ånancial advice to shift assets away from risky forms as retirement ap-
proaches (though admittedly no such pattern is evident for the ‚Äòbroad risky‚Äô portfolio
share). Note, however, that there is some debate about whether this advice is theoret-
ically sound; furthermore, as shown by the comparative analysis of age proÔ¨Åles of risky
investment in several countries in Guiso, Haliassos, and Jappelli (2001 (Projected)),
there does not seem to be a consistent pattern to age proÔ¨Åles of the risky portfolio
share across countries.

2.1.5   International Evidence on Portfolios of the Rich
Evidence about portfolios of the rich in other countries is presented in Table 7.The data
in this table were provided by the respective country experts who contributed country
chapters to the Household Portfolios conference volume referenced in the bibliography.
Before describing the results, it is important to emphasize the problems associated
with such international comparisons. Probably the greatest problem is that surveys in
other countries generally have not made such an intense eÔ¨Äort as the SCF does to get
a large and representative sample of the very richest households; furthermore, little is
known about exactly how participation rates for the wealthy vary across countries. As
a result, a table merely presenting data from the top 1 percent of surveyed households
across countries might well reÔ¨Çect diÔ¨Äerences in survey success and methodology more
than actual diÔ¨Äerences in behavior across countries. Our response to this problem is
twofold. First, rather than focusing on the top 1 percent, where the variation in par-
ticipation rates is likely to be very large across countries, we report information about
the top 5 percent of households. Second, we strongly discourage direct comparison of
portfolio statistics for the ‚Äòrich‚Äô across countries. Instead, it seems likely to be more
reliable simply to examine how the diÔ¨Äerences between the rich and the rest vary across
countries.
    Other survey diÔ¨Äerences also hamper international comparisons. From the stand-
point of comparing the results to the predictions of portfolio theory, we would like to be
able to divide all assets between safe and risky categories. Unfortunately, the problems
in making such allocations are even greater in most other surveys than they are in the
SCF. In particular, most surveys collect little or no information about the investment
strategies of mutual funds or deÔ¨Åned contribution pensions, or about the risk charac-
teristics of other Ô¨Ånancial assets. Given these problems, we concluded that the most
informative feasible exercise was to allow individual country experts to determine, for
each asset category, whether there was suÔ¨Écient information about that category to
allocate the asset unambiguously to one of the four levels of riskiness. If not, the ana-
lyst was asked to include the asset in the category ‚Äòrisk characteristics unknown.‚Äô An
example in the SCF would be a mutual fund which the respondent indicated invested



                                           10
in both stocks and bonds. Because the SCF does not collect any information about
the proportion of the fund‚Äôs value invested in each of these two categories, we included
all such mutual fund assets in the ‚Äòrisk characteristics unknown‚Äô category.9 Under
this strategy, at least the reader can be conÔ¨Ådent that the assets included in, say, the
‚Äòclearly risky‚Äô category are indeed all risky.
    A Ô¨Ånal problem is in normalization. Portfolio theory yields predictions about the
proportion of the portfolio that should be held in various kinds of assets. Accordingly,
table 7 reports the ratio of various kinds of nonÔ¨Ånancial assets and debts to total
net worth. It is very important to remember, however, that all of the measurement
problems that aÔ¨Äect the components of net worth also aÔ¨Äect the total. For example,
the net value of private business is not measured in the German survey data, and
consequently is not included in net worth. Furthermore, the German survey does not
provide separate data for the value of the respondent‚Äôs home and the value of all other
real estate owned by that respondent, so the number reported in the table for ‚Äòprivate
residence‚Äô actually reÔ¨Çects all real estate. Since private business wealth constitutes at
least 30 percent of total net worth of the rich in the three countries for which survey data
on these components of wealth do exist, and investment real estate is around another 15
percent of net worth, the apparently surprising Ô¨Ånding that the gross value of ‚Äòprivate
residence‚Äô constitutes 88 percent of net worth for the ‚Äòrich‚Äô German households should
not be taken at face value.
    Keeping all of these problems in mind, a few conclusions still seem warranted.
    The most important is probably that in every country the top 5 percent hold a
substantially larger proportion of their Ô¨Ånancial assets in risky forms than do the rest.
The diÔ¨Äerence is smallest in the UK, which may reÔ¨Çect the residual eÔ¨Äects of the large-
scale privatization of the Thatcher years and more recently the demutualization of
many formerly cooperative Ô¨Ånancial enterprises. 10
    Another result common to all countries is that the ratio of debt to net worth is
substantially smaller for the rich than for the rest, although the disparity is enormous
in some countries (the US) and rather small in others (Italy).
    A striking diÔ¨Äerence across countries is in the breakdown of wealth between Ô¨Ånancial
and nonÔ¨Ånancial forms. The two extremes are the US and Italy. The ratio of nonÔ¨Ånan-
cial to Ô¨Ånancial wealth for the top 5 percent in the US is about 1.5, while that ratio in
Italy is approximately 7. Similar, though less extreme, results hold for the bottom 95
percent of households (where measurement problems are probably somewhat smaller).
The Italian country authors indicate that part of the discrepancy probably reÔ¨Çects
  9
     This contrasts with our strategy in Table 4, where we divided such investments 50-50 between
the ‚Äòfairly safe‚Äô and ‚Äòfairly risky‚Äô categories.
  10
     Shares were distributed to depositors, and thus many lower-income households who otherwise
owned no shares became shareowners. Research has shown that many lower-wealth households have
simply held onto the shares they obtained through demutualizations.



                                               11
systematic severe underestimation of Ô¨Ånancial assets in Italy. Nonetheless, while the
maginitude of the diÔ¨Äerence may be mismeasured, qualitatively the observation that
nonÔ¨Ånancial assets are much more important in Italy than the US is probably true.
    A Ô¨Ånal observation is that there are large diÔ¨Äerences in the levels of debt held by
the bottom 95 percent across countries, ranging from a high of $36,000 in the US to
a low of only 4290 euro in Italy. This observation reinforces existing research which
has found that more highly developed Ô¨Ånancial markets in the US have allowed much
higher levels of borrowing.11


3      Analysis
It is now time to begin trying to understand the underlying behavioral patterns which
give rise to the data reported above. We start by presenting a baseline formal model
of saving over the life cycle, to which we will add a portfolio choice decision.

3.1     The Basic Stochastic Life Cycle Model
The following model is what I will henceforth characterize as the basic stochastic life
cycle model. The consumer‚Äôs goal is to

                                             
                                             T
                                   max              Œ≤ s‚àít Dt,s u(Ct )                             (1)
                                              s=t


                                                         s‚àí1 u(C) = c /(1 ‚àí œÅ), Œ≤
                                                                          1‚àíœÅ
where u(C) is a constant relative risk aversion utility function
is the (constant) geometric discount factor, and Dt,s = h=t (1 ‚àí dh ) is the probability
that the consumer will not die between periods t and s (Dt,t is deÔ¨Åned to be 1; dt is
the probability of death between period t and t + 1).
    The maximization is of course subject to constraints. In particular, if, following
Deaton (1991), we deÔ¨Åne Xt as ‚Äòcash-on-hand‚Äô at time t, the sum of wealth and current
income, then the consumer faces a budget constraint of the form

                                    Xt+1 = Rt+1 St + Yt+1
  11
    Italy is a particularly interesting case. Until recently, the minimum down payment on a home
mortgage in Italy was on the order of 50 percent, while 5 percent down payment mortgages have been
common in the U.S. for at least a decade. Furthermore, the legal system in Italy makes reposession of
property extremely diÔ¨Écult and time consuming. Thus, many Italians cannot aÔ¨Äord to buy a house,
and those who do buy end up borrowing much less. The high value of nonÔ¨Ånancial assets (mainly
housing wealth) relative to Ô¨Ånancial is probably largely attributable to these features of the Italian
Ô¨Ånancial system.




                                                    12
where St = Xt ‚àíCt is the portion of last period‚Äôs resources the consumer did not spend,
Rt+1 is the gross rate of return earned between t and t + 1, and Yt+1 is the noncapital
income the consumer earns in period t + 1.
    Assume that the consumer‚Äôs noncapital income in each period is given by their
permanent income Pt multiplied by a mean-one transitory shock, Et [Àú       t+1 ] = 1, and
assume that permanent income grows at rate Gt between periods, but is also buÔ¨Äeted
by a mean-one shock, Pt+1 = Gt+1 Pt Œ∑t+1 such that Et [Œ∑ÃÉt+1 ] = 1, where our notational
convention is that a variable inside an expectations operator whose value is unknown
as of the time at which the expectation is taken has a ‚àº over it.
    Given these assumptions, the consumer‚Äôs choices are inÔ¨Çuenced by only two state
variables at a given point in time: the level of the consumer‚Äôs assets Xt and the level of
permanent income, Pt . As usual, the problem can be rewritten in recursive form with
a value function Vt (Xt , Pt ). Written out fully in this form, the consumer‚Äôs problem is

                                                                                    
           Vt (Xt , Pt )      =        max u(Ct ) + Œ≤Dt,t+1 Et Vt+1 (XÃÉt+1 , PÃÉt+1 )
                                       {Ct }

                           such that                                                     (2)
                     St        =       Xt ‚àí C t
                 Xt+1          =       Rt+1 St + Yt+1
                 Yt+1          =       Pt+1 t+1
                 Pt+1          =       Gt Pt Œ∑t+1

3.2    The Saving Behavior of the Rich
Within the last decade, advances in computer speed and numerical methods have Ô¨Ånally
allowed economists to solve life cycle consumption/saving problems like that presented
above with serious uncertainty and realistic utility (see, in particular, Hubbard, Skin-
ner, and Zeldes (1994); Huggett (1996); Carroll (1997); and the references therein). I
have argued elsewhere (Carroll (1997)) that the implications of these models Ô¨Åt the
available evidence on the consumption/saving behavior of the typical household rea-
sonably well, certainly much better than the old Certainty Equivalent (CEQ) models
did.
    However, another Ô¨Ånding from this line of research has been that the model is unable
to account for the very high concentrations of wealth at the top of the distribution.




                                                13
3.2.1    How Rich Are They?
Figure 1 shows the ratio of wealth to permanent income12 by age for the population as
a whole and for the households in the richest one percent by age category from the 1992
and 1995 SCFs. Also plotted for comparison is the level of the wealth to income ratio
at the top 1 percent implied by a standard life cycle model of saving similar to that in
Carroll (1997) or Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes (1994). (SpeciÔ¨Åcally, it is the Carroll
model with HSZ ‚Äòbaseline‚Äô parameter values). The richest one percent are much richer
than implied by the life cycle model. In addition, the Ô¨Ågure plots the age proÔ¨Åle of
the 99th percentile that would be implied by the HSZ model if it were assumed that
households do not discount future utility at all. The Ô¨Ågure shows that even with such
patient households, the model remains far short of predicting the observed wealth to
income ratios at the 99th percentile.13
     This Ô¨Ånding is reconÔ¨Årmed in a recent paper by Engen, Gale, and Uccello (1999),
who do a very careful job of modelling pension arrangements, tax issues, and other
institutional details neglected in Carroll (2000) and also Ô¨Ånd that the wealth-to-income
ratios at the top part of the income distribution are much greater than predicted by a
life cycle dynamic stochastic optimization model, even with a time preference rate of
zero.

3.2.2    How Do They Spend It All?
They don‚Äôt.
    In the 1989, 1992, and 1995 SCFs, households were asked whether their spending
usually exceeds their income, and whether their spending exceeded their income in the
previous year. In order to run down their wealth, households obviously must eventually
spend more than their income. Yet only Ô¨Åve percent of the rich elderly households in
the SCF answered that their spending usually exceeded their income.
    More evidence is presented in Figure 2, which shows the levels of wealth by age
for the elderly in the 1992 and 1995 SCFs. There is no evidence in this Ô¨Ågure that
wealth is declining for this population; indeed, if anything it seems to be increasing,14
consistent with the answers that the rich elderly give to the questions about whether
they are spending more than their incomes. The implication is that most of the wealth
which we observe them holding will still be around at death. This is clearly a problem
for any model in which the only purpose in saving is to provide for one‚Äôs own future
  12
     SCF respondents are asked whether their total income this year was above normal, about normal,
or below normal. Following Friedman (1957), I deÔ¨Åne permanent income as the level of income the
household would normally receive.
  13
     This Ô¨Ågure is reproduced from Carroll (2000).
  14
     This is in eÔ¨Äect a smoothed proÔ¨Åle of wealth by age adjusted for cohort eÔ¨Äects; see Carroll (2000)
for methodological details.



                                                  14
consumption.
   This crude evidence is backed up by a study by Auten and Joulfaian (1996) which
Ô¨Ånds that the elasticity of bequests with respect to lifetime resources is well in excess of
one (their point estimate is 1.3). See Carroll (2000) for a summary of further evidence
that, far from spending their wealth down, the rich elderly continue to save.

3.3     Adding Portfolio Choice
Recently, a wave of papers (Bertaut and Halaissos (1997); Fratantoni (1998);Gakidis (1998);
Cocco, Gomes, and Maenhout (1998); and Hochgurtel (1998)) has examined the pre-
dictions of stochastic life cycle models of the kind considered above when households
facing labor income risk are allowed to choose freely between investing in a low-return
safe asset and investing in risky assets parameterized to resemble the returns yielded
by equity investments in the past.
    The only modiÔ¨Åcation to the formal optimization problem presented above nec-
essary to allow portfolio choice is to designate Rt+1 as the portfolio-weighted return,
which will depend on the proportion of the portfolio that is allocated to the safe and
the risky assets, and on the rate of return on the risky asset between t and t + 1. Call
the proportion of the portfolio invested in the risky asset (‚Äòstocks‚Äô) ws,t (where w is
mnemonic for the portfolio ‚Äòweight‚Äô), and (1 ‚àí ws,t) is the portion invested in the safe
asset. If the return on stocks between t and t+1 is Rs,t+1 , the portfolio-weighted return
on the consumer‚Äôs savings will be R(1 ‚àí ws,t) + Rs,t ws,t.
    However, even without solving a model of this type formally, it is clear that such
models will not be able to explain the empirical diÔ¨Äerences between the portfolio be-
havior of the rich and the behavior of the rest of the population, because when the
utility function is in the CRRA class, problems of this type are homothetic. That
is, there is no systematic diÔ¨Äerence in the behavior of households at diÔ¨Äerent levels
of lifetime permanent income. Hence, such models provide no means to explain the
very large diÔ¨Äerences between the rich and the rest in saving and portfolio behavior
documented above.

3.4     Three Possible ModiÔ¨Åcations
There are at least three ways one might consider modifying the model in hopes of
explaining the apparent nonhomotheticity of saving and portfolio behavior.

3.4.1   Heterogeneity in Risk Tolerance
The Ô¨Årst is simply to allow for exogenous, immutable ex ante heterogeneity in risk
tolerance across members of the population. Formally, rather than assuming that



                                            15
all households have the same value of œÅ, we can assume that each household has an
idiosyncratic, speciÔ¨Åc œÅi .
    The eÔ¨Äect of this would be to allow households with low values of œÅ (high risk
tolerance) to choose highly risky but high-expected-return portfolios. On average, the
risk-tolerant households would be rewarded with higher returns and would therefore end
up richer than the rest of the population. Thus, the rich would be disproportionately
risk-lovers, and would therefore have riskier portfolios than the rest. As shorthand, I
will call this the ‚Äòpreference heterogeneity‚Äô story henceforth.

3.4.2    Capital Market Imperfections
A second possibility is to follow Gentry and Hubbard (1998) and Quadrini (1999) in
assuming that there are important imperfections in capital markets which 1) require
entrepreneurial investment to be largely self-Ô¨Ånanced; 2) imply that entrepreneurial
investment has a higher return than investments made on open capital markets; and 3)
require a large minimum scale of investment. As those authors show, the combination
of these three assumptions can yield an implication that portfolios of higher wealth or
higher income households will be much more heavily weighted toward entrepreneurial
investments, and that rich households with business equity have higher than average
saving rates (under the further assumption that the intertemporal elasticity of sub-
stitution is high which means that they take advantage of the high returns that are
available to them by saving more). I will refer to this theory as the ‚Äòcapital market
imperfections‚Äô story.

3.4.3    Bequests as a Luxury Good
A Ô¨Ånal possibility is to change the assumption about the lifetime utility function.
Carroll (2000) proposes adding a ‚Äòjoy of giving‚Äô bequest motive of the form B(S) in a
modiÔ¨Åed Stone-Geary form,15

                                                   (S + Œ≥)1‚àíŒ±
                                     B(S) =                   .
                                                      1‚àíŒ±
    Carroll (2000) shows that if one assumes that Œ± < œÅ then wealth will be a ‚Äòluxury

    It might seem that a ‚Äòjoy of giving‚Äô bequest motive and a ‚Äòdynastic bequest motive‚Äô of the type
considered by Barro (1974) would be virtually indistinguishable, but it turns out that there are
several important diÔ¨Äerences. For example, the dynastic bequest model collapses to a standard life
cycle model for households with no oÔ¨Äspring, yet empirical evidence suggests that the rich childless
elderly continue to save. See Carroll (2000) for more arguments that the ‚Äòjoy of giving‚Äô bequest motive
Ô¨Åts the data better.


                                                  16
resources devoted to the bequest approaches 1. The other salient feature of the model
is that if Œ≥ > 0 there will be a ‚ÄòcutoÔ¨Ä‚Äô level of lifetime resources such that households
poorer than the cutoÔ¨Ä will leave no bequest at all. Thus the model is capable of
matching the crude stylized fact that low-income people tend to leave no bequests, and
also captures the fact (from Auten and Joulfaian (1996)) that among those who leave
bequests, the elasticity of lifetime bequests with respect to lifetime income is greater
than one.
    In this paper the assumption is that one receives utility from the contemplation of
the potential bequest in proportion to the probability that death (and the bequest)
will occur. Thus Bellman‚Äôs equation is modiÔ¨Åed to
                                                                      
        Vt (Xt , Pt ) = max u(Ct ) + Œ≤(1 ‚àí dt )Et Vt+1 (XÃÉt+1 , PÃÉt+1 ) + dt B(St ),
                          {Ct ,ws,t }

and the transition equations for the state variables are unchanged.
    While it is obvious how this model might help to explain the high saving rates of
the rich, it is not so obvious why it might help explain the high degree of riskiniess
of their portfolios. It turns out, however, that precisely the same assumption which
implies that bequests are a luxury good also implies that households are less risk-averse
with respect to gambles over bequests than with respect to gambles over consumption.16
That assumption is that the exponent on the utility-from-bequests function Œ± must
be less than the exponent on the utility from consumption œÅ. This implies that the
marginal utility from bequests declines more slowly than the marginal utility from
consumption and thus as wealth rises more and more of it is devoted to bequests
rather than consumption. However, the traditional interpretation of exponents like œÅ
and Œ± in utility functions of this class is as coeÔ¨Écients of relative risk aversion, so the
assumption that bequests are a luxury good has the immediate implication of less risk
aversion with respect to bequest gambles than consumption gambles!
    Following Max Weber as recently interpreted by Zou (1994) and Bakshi and Chen (1996),
I will henceforth call this the ‚ÄúCapitalist Spirit‚Äù model.

3.5     Distinguishing the Three Models
All of these theories can in principle explain the basic facts that the portfolios of the
rich are disproportionately risky and that investments in closely-held businesses are a
disproportionate share of the portfolios of the rich. This section attempts to distinguish
between the three theories on the basis of other kinds of evidence.
    We begin with some direct evidence that there are substantial diÔ¨Äerences in the
risk preferences of the rich compared with the rest of the population. Table 8 reports
  16
     The presence of the Œ≥ term in B(S) implies increasing relative risk aversion as bequest gambles get
larger. However, this does not alter the fact that risk aversion with respect to gambles over bequests
is always less than risk aversion with respect to gambles over consumption.

the results of a direct question SCF respondents are asked about their risk tolerance.
SpeciÔ¨Åcally, the respondents are asked
      Which of the statements on this page comes closest to the amount of Ô¨Ånancial
      risk that you (and your [husband/wife/partner]) are willing to take when you
      save or make investments?

         1. TAKE SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL RISKS EXPECTING TO EARN SUB-
            STANTIAL RETURNS.
         2. TAKE ABOVE AVERAGE FINANCIAL RISKS EXPECTING TO EARN
            ABOVE AVERAGE RETURNS.
         3. TAKE AVERAGE FINANCIAL RISKS EXPECTING TO EARN AVER-
            AGE RETURNS.
         4. NOT WILLING TO TAKE ANY FINANCIAL RISKS.

    For 1992 and 1995, the table reports the mean values of the response and the
percent of households reporting that they are not willing to take any Ô¨Ånancial risks, by
permanent income and net worth percentile.17 The table shows that occupants of the
highest permanent income and net worth brackets are notably more likely to express a
willingness to accept above-average risk in exchange for above-average returns. Even
more dramatic is the diÔ¨Äerence between the proportion of the rich and of the rest who
express themselves as ‚Äònot willing to take any Ô¨Ånancial risks.‚Äô Among the richest 1
percent by wealth, less than ten percent express such extreme risk aversion; among the
bottom 80 percent, nearly half express this sentiment.
    Although economists have traditionally dismissed answers to survey questions of
this type as meaningless, a recent literature (with contributions by Kahneman, Wakker
and Sarin (1997), Oswald (1997), Barsky, Juster, Kimball, and Shapiro (1997), and
Ng (1997)) has argued forcefully that answers to questions about preferences can pro-
vide reliable and useful information. Thus, these answers should be taken as serious
evidence that the rich are more risk tolerant than the rest.
    However, the table does not answer the question of the direction of causality between
risk preference and wealth. It is possible, as the preference heterogeneity story would
have it, that high risk tolerance leads to wealth, but it is equally possible that there is
causality from wealth to risk tolerance.
    One piece of existing evidence that is suggestive of causality from wealth to risk
tolerance is the Ô¨Ånding by Holtz-Eakin, Rosen, and Joulfaian (1994) that the receipt
of an inheritance substantially increases the probability that the recipient will start an
  17
     Our method of identifying permanent income is simple: we restrict the sample to households who
reported that their income in the survey year was ‚Äòabout normal.‚Äô Thus we are employing Friedman‚Äôs
original deÔ¨Ånition of permanent income, rather than modern deÔ¨Ånitions as the annuity value of human
and nonhuman wealth.


                                                18
entrepreneurial venture. Their interpretation is that because the inheritors presumably
knew that they would eventually inherit, their failure to start the entrepreneurial ven-
ture in advance of the receipt of the inheritance demonstrates the presence of liquidity
constraints. An alternative interpretation is that the increase in disposable wealth in-
creases the household‚Äôs risk tolerance enough for them to become willing to take the
risk of starting an entrepreneurial venture.18
    The ideal experiment to answer the causality question would be to exogenously
dump a large amount of wealth on a random sample of households and examine the
eÔ¨Äect both on their expressed risk preferences and on their risk-taking behavior. The
closest approximation to this ideal experiment in an available dataset is the receipt of
unexpected inheritances between the 1983 and 1989 panels of the SCF.
    Table 9 presents the results of a simple regression analysis of the change in risk
aversion between 1983 and 1989 on the size of inheritances received between the two
surveys, using the numerical answer to the survey question about risk attitudes as
the measure of risk aversion. That is, deÔ¨Åning RISKAV83 as the 1983 answer to the
risk aversion question and RISKAV89 as the 1989 answer, we deÔ¨Åne DRISKAV =
RISKAV89-RISKAV83 and regress DRISKAV on a measure of the size of inheritances
received and a set of control variables.19 SpeciÔ¨Åcally, LINH is the log of the value
of inheritances, and the control variables in the weighted regression are the same as
the variables used by Gentry and Hubbard (1998) in their extensive investigation of
entrepreneurship using these data.
     The coeÔ¨Écient on LINH is overwhelmingly statistically signÔ¨Åcant and negative,
indicating that larger inheritances produce a greater decline in risk aversion. Recall
that the simple preference heterogeneity story was one in which individuals enter the
workforce with a built-in level of risk aversion which was unchanging through the
lifetime. If we interpret the RISKAV83 and RISKAV89 variables as measures of this
risk aversion, the results in Table 9 constitute a direct rejection of this story. Indeed,
almost half of households whose composition is unchanged report a diÔ¨Äerent value of
RISKAV89 than RISKAV83, and given that a large proportion of the change can be
explained ex post via regressions like that reported in Table 9, it is clear that these
changes do not merely reÔ¨Çect measurement error.
     One potential problem with this experiment is that inheritances may be anticipated.
If so, the recipient might take the prospective inheritance into account in formulating
risk attitudes even before actual receipt. However, if this were true, a regression of the
  18
     Note that capital market imperfections or uncertainty about the timing and/or size of the bequest
are still required; without either uncertainty or imperfections the household‚Äôs eÔ¨Äective wealth would
not change when a perfectly anticipated bequest was received.
  19
     The sample is restricted to households whose composition did not change between the two survey
years, in order to ensure that changes in risk aversion really reÔ¨Çect changes in the attitudes of the
same individual(s).




                                                 19
change in risk preferences on the size of inheritances received would Ô¨Ånd a coeÔ¨Écient
of zero, and so the fact that we found a highly signiÔ¨Åcantly negative coeÔ¨Écient despite
this bias only strengthens the case that changes in wealth aÔ¨Äect risk aversion. Indeed,
when we restrict the sample (in column 2) to those households who said in 1983 that
they did not expect ever to receive a substantial inheritance (and who presumably were
surprised when they did), the coeÔ¨Écient estimate is a bit larger (though the diÔ¨Äerence
is not statistically signiÔ¨Åcant).
    Unfortunately, there is a more serious problem with the experiment: The survey
question cannot necessarily be interpreted as revealing the respondent‚Äôs underlying
coeÔ¨Écient of relative risk aversion. Instead, the question is about the respondent‚Äôs
willingness to bear Ô¨Ånancial risk, and economic theory informs us that willingness
to bear Ô¨Ånancial risk should depend upon a great many factors in addition to an
agent‚Äôs raw coeÔ¨Écient of relative risk aversion. In particular, what should matter is
the expected coeÔ¨Écient of relative risk aversion for the future period‚Äôs value function,
which may depend, for example, on whether the consumer anticipates possibly being
liquidity constrained in that future period. However, one conclusion from the recent
work on portfolio theory cited above is that the proportion of the portfolio invested in
the risky asset should decline in the level of current-period cash-on-hand. The reason
for this counterintuitive result is that when there is little Ô¨Ånancial wealth, virtually all
of future consumption will be Ô¨Ånanced by labor income, and so adding a small Ô¨Ånancial
risk has very little eÔ¨Äect on overall consumption risk, so the agent is willing to invest
a large proportion of her modest portfolio in the risky Ô¨Ånancial asset (this argument
relies on an implicit assumption that the correlation between Ô¨Ånancial risk and labor
income risk is low, as Cocco et. al. (1998) show it is). As wealth grows large, however,
the proportion of future consumption to be Ô¨Ånanced out of that wealth also grows large,
and thus willingness to bear additional Ô¨Ånancial risk declines (see Cocco, Gomes, and
Maenhout (1998) for a fuller discussion of these issues). Thus, appropriately calibrated
portfolio theory implies that we would expect to see a declining willingness to bear
Ô¨Ånancial risk as wealth increased, rather than the reverse as indicated in the table.
    Many economists remain uncomfortable with using survey measures like the SCF
risk attitudes question. However, even if the results of Table 9 are set aside, there are
several other problems with the preference heterogeneity story as a complete explana-
tion for the observed pattern of facts.
    In principle, the preference heterogeneity story can indeed explain the large share
of business equity in the portfolios of the richest households, under the assumption
that private business investments bear the highest risk and the highest return among
the categories of assets available. This assumption is plausible and therefore not prob-
lematic. However, several other features of the entrepreneurial investments of the rich
are problematic for this theory.
    First, entrepreneurial investments of the rich are highly undiversiÔ¨Åed. If the rich


                                            20
are even slightly risk-averse, elementary portfolio theory under perfect capital markets
implies that the optimal strategy is to invest a tiny amount in each of a large number of
entrepreneurial ventures in order to diversify the idiosyncratic risk. Table 10 shows that
instead, among the rich households with any private business equity, over 80 percent of
that equity is in a single entreprenurial venture, while the three largest entreprenurial
investments account for 94 percent of entrepreneurial wealth (a similar pattern holds
for nonrich entrepreneurs). Furthermore, for rich entrepreneurial households, almost
half of all income comes directly from business enterprises in which the household has
an ownership stake. Failure of the business would wipe out not only the asset value
of the business, but also the business-derived income, and thus the total riskiniess of
business ownership is even greater than appears from the share of business equity in
total net worth. This means the incentive for diversiÔ¨Åcation is even stronger.
    The next problem for the preference heterogeneity theory is that it provides no
explanation for the fact that the great majority of entrepreneurial wealth is in enter-
prises in which a member of the household has an active management role. Table 10
shows that 85 percent of all entrepreneurial wealth is held in such ‚Äòactively managed‚Äô
businesses. Again, with perfect capital markets, management should be completely
detached from ownership to diversify idiosyncratic risk.
    A Ô¨Ånal problem is that the preference heterogeneity story provides no explanation
for the failure of the elderly rich to spend down their assets. Indeed, because risk toler-
ance is positively correlated with the intertemporal elasticity of substitution in models
with time-separable preferences, we should actually expect the rich to be running down
their wealth faster than the non-rich if the only diÔ¨Äerence in preferences between the
rich and non-rich is in their degree of risk tolerance.
    Given that several of the preceding arguments imply that the preference heterogene-
ity story also requires some form of capital market imperfections in order to explain the
data, it is interesting to examine whether capital market imperfections by themselves
might do the trick.
    The central requirement of any story based purely on capital market imperfections is
that business ownership must yield higher-than-market rates of return. Unfortunately,
the economics and business literatures do not appear to contain credible estimates
of the average rate of return on closely-held business ventures. Suppose for the mo-
ment that we accept on faith the proposition that closely-held business ventures earn
a higher rate of return (in exchange for higher risk) than is available on open capital
markets, and that such ventures must be substantially self-Ô¨Ånanced for moral hazard
or adverse selection reasons. By themselves, and in the absence of preference hetero-
geneity, these assumptions cannot explain the positive correlation between the level of
initial labor income or initial wealth and the propensity to start businesses documented
by Quadrini (1999) and Gentry and Hubbard (1998). The problem is that these ar-
guments should apply with just as much force to very small business ventures (which


                                            21
can be Ô¨Ånanced without large initial wealth or income) as to larger ones: As anyone
who has read the novel A Confederacy of Dunces knows, there are principal/agent and
moral hazard problems even for a hot dog vendor.
    Gentry and Hubbard (1998) address this problem by simply assuming that there is a
minimum eÔ¨Écient scale for business enterprises which is large relative to the resources of
the median household, but this approach is insuÔ¨Écient to explain the data because the
richest households would have wealth vastly greater than any Ô¨Åxed minimum eÔ¨Écient
scale and therefore would have no need to tie up more than a trivial fraction of their
total net worth in any single business enterprise. Quadrini (1999) deals with this
problem by postulating a ‚Äòladder‚Äô of business opportunities at ever-rising minimum
eÔ¨Écient scales, so that no matter how rich the household becomes there is always an
opportunity to jump up to an even-higher rung on the ladder.
    Even if we were to accept the story that there is a complicated ladder of minimum
eÔ¨Écient scales of business operation a la Quadrini, the capital market imperfections
story still faces three problems. First, it provides no explanation for the failure of
the rich elderly eventually to begin running down their wealth. Second, if the risk
preferences of the rich were similar to those of the rest, the extra risk associated with
their entrepreneurial wealth should induce them to try to minimize the riskiness of
the remainder of their portfolio. However, Table 11 shows that the Ô¨Ånancial asset
holdings of rich households who have a substantial fraction of their net worth tied up
in business equity are actually considerably riskier than the Ô¨Ånancial asset holdings of
the rest of the population (although less risky than the Ô¨Ånancial investments of the
rich nonentrepreneurs). Finally, the results in Table 8 strongly suggest that the rich,
whether entrepreneurs or nonentrepreneurs, are much more risk tolerant than the rest
of the population, and capital market imperfections alone can explain neither this nor
the Ô¨Ånding in Table 9 that increases in wealth produce reductions in reported risk
aversion.
    It is now time to consider whether the ‚Äòcapitalist spirit‚Äô model can explain the
overall pattern of facts. Recall that this model assumed that bequests are a luxury
good, with the corollary implication that households are less risk averse with respect to
risks to their bequests than with respect to risks to their consumption. Since the luxury
good aspect of bequests implies that as a household becomes richer, it plans to devote
more and more of its resources to the bequest, the model also implies that risk aversion
declines in the level of wealth. Thus the capitalist spirit model is consistent with the
results on self-reported risk attitudes, as well as with the risky portfolio structure for
the rich, and with the evidence that receipt of inheritances reduces risk aversion (at
least if we assume that those inheritances were not perfectly anticipated). It also can
explain why higher income or higher net worth households are more likely to invest in
risky entrepreneurial ventures. Finally, it can explain the failure of the elderly rich to
run down their assets before death (indeed, this is the empirical fact that the model was


                                           22
developed to explain; its ability to explain the other empirical patterns documented
here was not anticipated in the original statement of the model).
    However, if capital markets were perfect, rich households would still have every
incentive to diversify the idiosyncratic component of their entrepreneurial investments
by holding small shares of many entrepreneurial ventures. Their failure to do so is
presumably explained by capital market imperfections.20 Note, however, that one
attractive feature of a model which combines capital market imperfections with the
‚Äòcapitalist spirit‚Äô utility function is that it is possible to dispense with the awkward
assumption of a ‚Äòladder‚Äô of minimum eÔ¨Écient scales which was necessary in the basic
model of capital market imperfections in order to explain the data. This makes the
analysis of such models considerably more tractable, transparent, and plausible.


4      Conclusions
The standard model of household behavior implies that the rich are just like scaled-up
versions of everybody else, including in their portfolio allocation patterns. The data
summarized in this paper contradict that assertion both for the US since 1963 and for
the other countries included in this survey.
    The most important diÔ¨Äerences between the portfolios of the rich and the rest are
the much higher proportion of their assets that the rich hold in risky forms, and their
much higher propensity to be involved in entrepreneurial activities and to hold much
of their net worth in the form of their own entrepreneurial ventures. Several diÔ¨Äerent
features of the data point to a conclusion that relative risk aversion is a decreasing
function of wealth. Other features, particularly the concentration of the wealth of the
rich in their own entrepreneurial ventures, suggest that capital market imperfections are
also important. But it appears that most of the features of the data can be explained by
assuming both that bequests are a luxury good and that capital market imperfections
require entrepreneurial enterprises to be largely self-Ô¨Ånanced and self-managed.
    This is not to say that there could not also be exogenous diÔ¨Äerences in risk aversion
across households; just that the case does not appear to be strong that such diÔ¨Äerences
are necessary to explain the diÔ¨Äerences between the portfolios of the rich and the rest.

  20
    In discussing this paper, Marco Pagano suggested that entrepreneurs may obtain utility directly
from the ownership and consequent control over their entrepreneurial ventures. This would lead to
a preferences-based theory of the nondiversiÔ¨Åcation of entrepreneurial investment. However, in order
to explain the overall pattern of facts, it would still be necessary to modify the utility function to
put wealth in the utility function in some form, since not all of the rich are entrepreneurs. Because
there is substantial independent evidence of capital market imperfections, it seems preferable to stick
with a story which explains the facts via an assumption of capital market imperfections plus a single
change in the utility function rather than with perfect capital markets plus two changes in the utility
function.

Definitions of asset and debt classifications:
 Clearly safe includes transaction accounts (checking, saving, money market, and call accounts), certificates of deposit, and US
 Savings bonds
 Fairly safe includes state/local bonds, the fairly safe component of mutual funds‚Ä†, the fairly safe component of defined contribution
 pensions‚Ä†, and the cash value of life insurance policies.
 Risky includes stocks, bonds (all types but state/local and US Savings), other managed assets, other financial assets, and the risky
 component of mutual funds and defined contribution pension accounts.

 Risky assets - narrow consists of direct stock holdings
 Risky assets - broad consists of risky financial assets, plus the net value of businesses and investment real estate
 Risky assets - broadest consists of all assets in the broad definition and probably safe assets

   Secured debt includes vehicle loans, loans against pensions and life insurance policies, investment real estate debt, and call account debt.
   Unsecured debt includes credit card balances, installment loans, other lines of credit, and other debt.

             Calculations of fairly risky and fairly safe mutual funds and deÔ¨Åned contribution
          pensions in Table 4 are as follows.

   1962 SFCC Due to the lack of information on mutual fund investment strategies, all mutual
             funds are classiÔ¨Åed as risky and all deÔ¨Åned contribution pensions are classiÔ¨Åed as
             safe.
     1983 SCF The 1983 SCF did not ask about the investment strategy or risk characteristics
              of mutual funds or retirement accounts, so we had to make educated guesses
              based on other information. Tax-free mutual funds were allotted to the ‚Äôfairly
              safe‚Äô category because such funds consist almost exclusively of state and local
              government bonds, direct holdings of which we put in this category. Taxable
              mutual funds were allotted to the ‚Äôrisky‚Äô category, because in the early 1980s these
              funds typically contained a mix of stocks and bonds. The calculation of risky and
              fairly safe, and clearly safe deÔ¨Åned contribution pensions uses the institution that
              held the IRA/Keogh accounts as a proxy for investment direction. If a real estate
              investment company held the accounts, then those deÔ¨Åned contribution pensions
              were considered risky. If a commercial bank, savings and loan, or credit union
              held the accounts, then those assets were considered fairly safe. If a brokerage,
              insurance company, employer, school/college/university, investment management
              company, or the AARP held the accounts, the deÔ¨Åned contribution pensions were
              split 50/50 between the fairly safe and risky. In the case that the household
              had no IRA/Keogh accounts, but had a thrift pension account, the assets were
              considered fairly safe.
1989-1995 SCF These surveys asked about the investment strategy for mutual funds and retire-
              ment accounts. Funds and accounts that consisted exclusively of one category of
              asset (such as stock or bond mutual funds) we allocated in the same way that we
              allocated direct holdings of that asset type. Mutual funds and accounts that con-
              tained a mix of stocks and bonds were allocated half-and-half to the ‚Äôfairly safe‚Äô
              and ‚Äôrisky‚Äô categories. Accounts invested in real estate, commodities or limited
              partnerships were put in the ‚Äòrisky‚Äô category.

Notes:
Definitions Common to All Countries
  Households are sorted once, by the broadest measure of net worth available, to determine their classification into top 5 or bottom 95 percent. Asset shares are computed as ratio of
  averages. All statistics use sample weights.
Definitions for United States
  Data are drawn from the 1995 Survey of Consumer Finances. Figures are reported in 1999 dollars, converted from 1995 numbers using the CPI-U-RS.
  Definitions of financial asset classifications:
     Clearly safe includes transaction accounts (checking, saving, money market), certificates of deposit, US Savings bonds, and mutual funds invested exclusively in these assets
     Fairly safe includes state/local bonds, mutual funds, and other managed assets invested in state/local bonds, and the cash value of life insurance policies.
     Fairly risky includes bonds (all types except state/local and US Savings) and mutual funds invested in bonds (all types except state/local and US Savings)
     Clearly risky includes stocks and financial assets invested in real estate, commodities, and private partnerships
     Risk characteristics unknown. The three largest components of this category are mutual funds whose investment direction is unknown, retirement accounts whose investment
     direction is unknown, and other managed assets whose investment direction is unknown. 'Other financial assets' are also included in this category.
     Mutual funds and retirement accounts which are invested in a single category of assets (for example, 100 percent stock mutual funds) are included in the corresponding category
  Other secured debt includes call account debt, vehicle loans, loans against pensions and life insurance policies and loans for investment real estate
  Unsecured debt includes credit card balances, installment loans, other lines of credit, and other misc. debts
  Broad Risky Assets - consists of clearly risky and fairly risky financial assets, plus businesses and investment real estate
  Very Broad Risky Assets - consists of broad risky assets plus fairly safe assets
  Total Household Income includes all income to the household from any source.
  Total Noncapital Income subtracts all capital income (dividends, interest, capital gains, etc.) from Total Household Income

Definitions for the Netherlands
  Data are drawn from the 1995 CentER Savings Survey. For further information see the Netherlands country chapter.
  1998 guilder are converted to Euros using the rate 1 Euro = 2.203 guilders.
  Clearly safe - transactions and savings accounts and certificates of deposit.
  Clearly risky - Stocks, bonds, mutual funds
  Risk characteristics unknown - The largest items are defined contribution pension plans, cash value of life insurance, and employer-sponsored pension plans.
Definitions for Italy
  All values are expressed in Euro, obtained by converting 1995 Lire to 1999 Lire using the increase in the CPI from 1995 to 1999 (10.8 percent) and converting to Euros using the 1999
  fixed exchange rate between Euros and Lire, 1 Euro= 1.936 Lire.
  Data are drawn from the 1995 Survey of Household Income and Wealth, described in the Italy country chapter.
  Clearly safe includes currency, transaction accounts (checking, saving, and postal accounts), certificates of deposit and short-term Treasury Bills.
  Fairly safe includes the cash value of life insurance policies.
  Fairly risky includes bonds (all types except short-term government bills), mutual funds and managed investment accounts.
  Clearly risky includes only stocks.
  Risk characteristics unknown: mutual funds and defined contribution pension funds.
  Mortgage debt includes all mortgage debt, not just the primary residence.
  Durables do not include art objects, jewelry, etc.
  Broad Risky Assets - consists of clearly risky and fairly risky financial assets, plus businesses and investment real estate
  Very Broad Risky Assets - consists of broad risky assets plus fairly safe assets

Definitions for Germany
  Data are drawn from the Income and Expenditure Survey wave 1993 covering 31,774 West German households and 8456 East German households, 80% subsample, excluding
  households with total net monthly income of 35,000DM(1993) or more. The data set is described in detail in the appendix to the German country study.
  1993 DM are converted to 1999 DM using the CPI index 1 DM (December 1999) = 1.054878 DM (1993), and then to Euros by the fixed rate of 1.95583 DM = 1 Euro.
  Fairly safe includes the cash value of endowment life insurance, assets accumulated in building society savings contracts (Bausparvertr√§ge), municipal bonds, savings certificates, and
  government bonds
  Fairly risky includes other bonds and mutual funds invested in stocks or bonds
  Clearly risky includes stocks and mutual funds invested in real estate
  Risk characteristics unknown - "Other" financial assets.
  Non-financial assets - no data are available separating real estate into personal residence and other, so the number for personal residence reflects all real estate

Definitions for UK
  Data are drawn from the 1997-98 Financial Research Survey - see UK country chapter for details.
  Figures were calculated in 1997 pounds, converted to 1999 pounds using the CPI inflation factor of 1.0726, then converted to Euros using the 1999 Euro/pound exchange rate of 1.7.
  Clearly safe includes transaction accounts (checking, saving, money market), certificates of deposit, National Savings current accounts, Premium bonds
  and TESSAs.
  Fairly safe includes government and local bonds, plus National Savings Bonds.

  Secured and unsecured debt includes installment loans, other lines of credit, and other misc. debts, agreed overdrafts and vehicle or other secured loans
  Value of pension and life insurance assets not known in survey and hence not included in definition of gross financial assets, or in any
  subcomponent.

Notes: The table summarizes answers to the following question: ‚ÄúWhich of the statements on this page
comes closest to the amount of Ô¨Ånancial risk that you (and your spouse/partner) are willing to take
when you save or make investments? 1. Take sustantial Ô¨Ånancial risks expecting to earn substantial
returns; 2. Take above average Ô¨Ånancial risks expecting to earn above average returns; 3. Take average
Ô¨Ånancial risks expecting to earn average returns; 4. Not willing to take any Ô¨Ånancial risks. To tabulate
results by ‚Äòpermanent income‚Äô percentile, the sample was restricted to those households who said that
their income in the survey year was ‚Äòabout normal,‚Äô and permanent income was deÔ¨Åned as observed
income for such households.

     Notes: Dependent variable DRISKAV is the change in attitude toward Ô¨Ånancial risk for the
household between 1983 and 1989, as described in the text. A negative change implies a reduction in
risk aversion. Standard errors in parentheses. ‚àó denotes signiÔ¨Åcance at the 90 percent level; ‚àó‚àó denotes
signiÔ¨Åcance at the 95 percent level; ‚àó‚àó‚àó denotes signiÔ¨Åcance at the 99 percent level. The Ô¨Årst column
(‚ÄùAll Recipients‚Äù) reports results including all households who received an inheritance between 1983
and 1989. The second column (‚ÄùSurprised‚Äù) includes all households who received an inheritance
between 1983 and 1989 but reported in 1983 that they did not expect ever to receive a substantial
inheritance. The regression speciÔ¨Åcation follows Gentry and Hubbard‚Äôs baseline speciÔ¨Åcation. Variable

Value in cells in the first four rows is the mean ratio of the value of the business(es) to
total business equity.
Business income is the income the household reported receiving
from all the businesses the household owns, regardless of whether
anyone in the household works in any of the businesses.
Business derived income consists of wages and salaries paid by the business to the
household head or spouse plus retained earnings reported by the head or spouse from
a business the household owns.
