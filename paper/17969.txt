Ricardo's Theory of Comparative Advantage: Old Idea, New Evidence

                                              ABSTRACT

When asked to name one proposition in the social sciences that is both true and non-trivial, Paul Samuelson
famously replied: 'Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage'. Truth, however, in Samuelson's reply
refers to the fact that Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage is mathematically correct, not that
it is empirically valid. The goal of this paper is to assess the empirical performance of Ricardo's ideas.
We use novel agricultural data that describe the productivity in 17 crops of 1.6 million parcels of land
in 55 countries around the world. Crucially, this dataset contains information about the productivity
of each parcel of land in all crops, not just those that are currently being grown. This direct information
about relative productivity differences across economic activities allows us to compute, for the first
time, the output predicted by Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage. Despite all of the real-world
considerations from which this theory abstracts, we find that Ricardo's theory of comparative advantage
has significant explanatory power in the data, at least within the scope of our analysis.

1    Introduction
The anecdote is famous. A mathematician, Stan Ulam, once challenged Paul Samuelson to name one
proposition in the social sciences that is both true and non-trivial. His reply was: ‘Ricardo’s theory
of comparative advantage’; see Paul Samuelson (1995, p. 22). Truth, however, in Samuelson’s
reply refers to the fact that Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage is mathematically correct,
not that it is empirically valid. The goal of this paper is to assess the empirical performance of
Ricardo’s ideas.
    To bring Ricardo’s ideas to the data, one must overcome a key empirical challenge. Suppose, as
Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage predicts, that di¤erent factors of production specialize
in di¤erent economic activities based on their relative productivity di¤erences. Then, following
Ricardo’s famous example, if English workers are relatively better at producing cloth than wine
compared to Portuguese workers, England will produce cloth, Portugal will produce wine, and
at least one of these two countries will be completely specialized in one of these two sectors.
Accordingly, the key explanatory variable in Ricardo’s theory, relative productivity, cannot be
directly observed.
    This identi…cation problem is emphasized by Alan Deardor¤ (1984) in his review of empirical
work on the Ricardian model of trade (p. 476): “Problems arise, however, most having to do
with the observability of [productivity by industry and country]. The...problem is implicit in the
Ricardian model itself...[because] the model implies complete specialization in equilibrium... This
in turn means that the di¤erences in labor requirements cannot be observed, since imported goods
will almost never be produced in the importing country.” A similar identi…cation problem arises
in the labor literature in which the self-selection of individuals based on comparative advantage
is often referred to as the Roy model. As James Heckman and Bo Honore (1990) have shown, if
general distributions of worker skills are allowed, the Roy model— and hence Ricardo’s theory of
comparative advantage— has no empirical content. Econometrically speaking, the Ricardian model
is not nonparametrically identi…ed.
    How can one solve this identi…cation problem? One possibility consists in making untestable
functional form assumptions about the distribution of productivity across di¤erent factors of pro-
ductions and economic activities. These assumptions can then be used to relate productivity levels
that are observable to those that are not. In a labor context, a common strategy is to assume that
workers’skills are log-normally distributed. In a trade context, building on the work of Jonathan
Eaton and Samuel Kortum (2002), Arnaud Costinot, Dave Donaldson, and Ivana Komunjer (2011)
have shown how the predictions of the Ricardian model can be tested by assuming that productivity
levels are independently drawn from Fréchet distributions across countries and industries.
    This paper proposes an alternative empirical strategy that does not rely on identi…cation by
functional form. Our basic idea, as in Arnaud Costinot and Dave Donaldson (2011), is to focus on
agriculture, a sector of the economy in which scienti…c knowledge of how essential inputs such as
water, soil and climatic conditions map into outputs is uniquely well understood. As a consequence
of this knowledge, agronomists are able to predict how productive a given parcel of land, which

                                                  1
will we refer to as a ‘…eld’, would be were it to be used to grow any one of a set of crops. In this
particular context, the econometrician therefore knows the productivity of a …eld in all economic
activities, not just those in which it is currently employed.
        Our strategy can be described as follows. We …rst establish how, according to Ricardo’s theory
of comparative advantage, total output of various crops should vary across countries as a function
of: () the vector of productivity of the …elds that countries are endowed with and () the producer
prices that determine the allocation of …elds across crops.1 We then combine these theoretical
predictions with productivity and price data from the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO).
Our dataset consists of 17 major agricultural crops and 55 major agricultural countries. Using this
information, we can compute predicted output levels for all crops and countries in our sample and
ask: How do predicted output levels compare with those that are observed in the data?
        Our empirical results show that the output levels predicted by Ricardo’s theory of comparative
advantage agree reasonably well with actual data on worldwide agricultural production. Despite all
of the real-world considerations from which Ricardo’s theory abstracts, a regression of log output
on log predicted output has a (precisely estimated) slope of 0.21. This result is robust to a series
of alternative samples and speci…cations.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section I derives predicted output levels in an
economy where factor allocation is determined by Ricardian comparative advantage. Section II
describes the data that we use to construct measures of both predicted and actual output. Section
III compares predicted and observed output levels and Section IV o¤ers some concluding remarks.


2        Ricardian Predictions
The basic environment is the same as in Costinot (2009). We consider a world economy comprising
 = 1   countries,  = 1   goods, and  = 1   factors of production. In our empirical
analysis, a good will be a crop and a factor of production will be a parcel of land or ‘…eld’. Factors
of production are immobile across countries and perfectly mobile across sectors.                          0 denotes
the inelastic supply of factor  in country . Factors of production are perfect substitutes within
each country and sector, but vary in their productivity                 0. Total output of good  in country
 is given by
                                                        P         
                                                 =      =1   ,

where  is the quantity of factor  allocated to good  in country . The variation in  is the
source of Ricardian comparative advantage. If two factors 1 and 2 located in country  are such
that 22 12  21 11 for two goods 1 and 2 , then …eld 2 has a comparative advantage in
good 2 .2
    1
     In line with Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage, the focus of our paper is on the supply-side of the
economy, not the demand-side considerations that would ultimately pin down prices around the world.
   2
     The present model, like the Roy model in the labor literature, features multiple factors of production. In
international trade textbooks, by contrast, Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage is associated with models that
feature only one factor of production, labor. In our view, this particular formalization of Ricardo’s ideas is too narrow



                                                           2
      Throughout this paper, we focus on the supply-side of this economy by taking producer prices
     0 as given. We assume that the allocation of factors of production to each sector in each
country is e¢ cient and solves
                                        nP                                            o
                                               P                  P      
                                 max
                                             =1 =1                =1     .
                                  


Since there are constant returns to scale, a competitive equilibrium with a large number of pro…t-
maximizing …rms would lead to an e¢ cient allocation. Because of the linearity of aggregate output,
the solution of the previous maximization problem is easy to characterize. As in a simple Ricardian
model of trade with two goods and two countries, each factor should be employed in the sector that
maximizes   , independently of where other factors are being employed.
      Assuming that the e¢ cient allocation is unique,3 we can express total output of good  in
country  at the e¢ cient allocation as
                                                        P
                                                 =      2F        ,                                     (1)

where F is the set of factors allocated to good  in country :
                                          (                                           )
                                                              
                                                                            0
                                                                       
                                  F =        = 1  j       0     if ’6=        .                          (2)
                                                                    

Equations (1) and (2) capture Ricardo’s idea that relative rather than absolute productivity di¤er-
ences determines factor allocation, and in turn, the pattern of international specialization.


3      Data
To assess the empirical performance of Ricardo’s ideas we need data on actual output levels, which
we denote by e  , as well as data to compute predicted output levels, which we denote by  in line
with Section I. According to equations (1) and (2),  can be computed using data on productivity,
 , for all factors of production  ; endowments of di¤erent factors,  ; and producer prices,  .
We describe our construction of such measures here. Since the predictions of Ricardo’s theory of
comparative advantage are fundamentally cross-sectional in nature, we work with the data from
1989 only; this is the year in which the greatest overlap in the required measures is available.
   We use data on both agricultural output ( e  ) and producer prices ( ) by country and crop from
FAOSTAT. Output is equal to quantity harvested and is reported in tonnes. Producer prices are
for empirical purposes. The core message of Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage is not that labor is the only
factor of production in the world, but rather that relative productivity di¤erences, and not absolute productivity
di¤erences, are the key determinant of factor allocation. As argued below, the present model captures exactly that
idea.
   3
     In our empirical analysis, 2 out of the 101,757 grid cells in Brazil— the empirical counterparts of factors  in the
model— are such that the value of their marginal products   is maximized in more than one crop. Thus the
e¢ cient allocation is only unique up to the allocation of these two Brazilian grid cells. Dropping these two grid cells
has no e¤ect on the coe¢ cient estimates presented in Table 1.


                                                              3
equal to prices received by farmers net of taxes and subsidies and are reported in local currency units
per tonne. Imperfect data reporting to the FAO means that some output and price observations
are missing. We …rst work with a sample of 17 crops and 55 countries that is designed to minimize
the number of missing observations.4 In the remaining sample, whenever output data is missing we
assume that there is no production of that crop in that country. Similarly, whenever price data is
unreported for a given observation, both quantity produced and area harvested are also reported
as zero in the FAO data. In these instances, we therefore replace the missing price entry with a
zero.5
    Our data on productivity ( ) come from version 3.0 of the Global Agro-Ecological Zones
(GAEZ) project run by IIASA and the FAO (IIASA/FAO, 2012). We describe this data in detail
in Costinot and Donaldson (2011) but provide a brief description here; see also Nathan Nunn and
Nancy Qian (2009). The GAEZ project aims to make agronomic predictions about the yield that
would obtain for a given crop at a given location for all of the world’s major crops and all locations
on Earth. Data on natural inputs (such as soil characteristics, water availability, topography
and climate) for each location are fed into an agronomic model of crop production with distinct
parameters for each variety of each crop. These models condition on a level of variable inputs and
GAEZ makes available the output from various scenarios in which di¤erent levels of variable inputs
are applied. We use the scenario that corresponds to a ‘mixed’ level of inputs, where the farmer
is assumed to be able to apply inputs di¤erentially across sub-plots within his or her location, and
in which irrigation is available. It is important to stress that the thousands of parameters that
enter the GAEZ model are estimated from countless …eld and lab experiments, not from statistical
relationships between observed country-level output data (such as that from FAOSTAT which we
                      e  ) and natural inputs.
use here to construct 
    The spatial resolution of the GAEZ data is governed by the resolution of the natural input
whose resolution is most coarse, the climate data. As a result the GAEZ productivity predictions
are available for each 5 arc-minute grid cell on Earth. The land area of such a cell varies by latitude
but is 9.2 by 8.5 km at the Tropics. The median country in our dataset contains 4,817 grid cells
but a large country such as the U.S. comprises 157,797 cells. Since the grid cell is the …nest unit
of spatial heterogeneity in our dataset we take each grid cell to be a distinct factor of production
 and the land area of each grid cell to be the associated endowment,  . Hence our measure
of the productivity of factor  if it were to produce crop  in country ,  , corresponds to the
GAEZ project’s predicted ‘total production capacity (tones/ha)’. We match countries (at their

     We have also experimented with replacing missing prices by their world averages across producing countries
adjusted for currency di¤erences. The empirical results in Table 1 are insensitive to this alternative.

database.
    A sample of the GAEZ predictions can be seen in Figure 1. Here we plot, for each grid cell on
Earth, the predicted relative productivity in wheat compared to sugarcane (the two most important
crops by weight in our sample). As can be seen, there exists a great deal of heterogeneity in relative
productivity throughout the world, even among just two of our 17 crops. In the next section we
explore the implications of this heterogeneity— heterogeneity that is at the core of Ricardo’s theory
of comparative advantage— for determining the pattern of international specialization across crops.


4    Empirical Results
We are now ready to bring Ricardo’s ideas to the data. To overcome the identi…cation problem
highlighted by Deardor¤ (1984) and Heckman and Honore (1990), we take advantage of the GAEZ
data, together with the other data described in Section II, to predict the amount of output ( )
that country  should produce in crop  according to Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage,
i.e. according to equations (1) and (2). We then compare these predicted output levels to those
                               e  ).
that are observed in the data (
    In the spirit of the ‘slope tests’ in the Heckscher-Ohlin-Vanek literature, see Donald Davis
and David Weinstein (2001), we implement this comparison by simply regressing, across countries
and crops, data on actual output on measures of predicted output. Like Davis and Weinstein
(2001), we will assess the empirical performance of Ricardo’s ideas by studying whether () the
slope coe¢ cient in this regression is close to unity and () the coe¢ cient is precisely estimated.
Compared to these authors, however, we have little con…dence in our model’s ability to predict
absolute levels of output. The reason is simple: the model presented in Section II assumes that the

                                                                5
only goods produced (using land) in each country are the 17 crops for which GAEZ productivity
data are available. In reality there are many other uses of land, so the aggregate amount of land
used to grow the 17 crops in our study is considerably lower than that assumed in our analysis.
To circumvent this problem, we simply estimate our regressions in logs.6 Since the core aspect of
Ricardian comparative advantage lies in how relative productivity levels predict relative quantities,
we believe that a comparison of logarithmic slopes captures the essence of what the model described
in Section I can hope to predict in this context.
       Our empirical results are presented in Table 1. All regressions include a constant and use
standard errors that are adjusted for clustering by country to account for potential within-country
(across crop) correlation in data reporting and model misspeci…cation. Column (1) contains our
baseline regression. The estimated slope coe¢ cient is 0.212 and the standard error is small (0.057).7
While the slope coe¢ cient falls short of its theoretical value (one), it remains positive and statisti-
cally signi…cant.
       The fact that Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage does not …t the data perfectly should
not be surprising. First, our empirical exercise focuses on land productivity and abstracts from all
other determinants of comparative costs (such as factor prices that di¤er across countries and factor
intensities that di¤er across crops) that are likely to drive agricultural specialization throughout
the world. Second, the …t of our regressions does not only depend on the ability of Ricardo’s
theory to predict relative output levels conditional on relative productivity levels, but also on the
ability of agronomists at the GAEZ project to predict productivity levels in each of 17 crops at
5 arc-minute grid cells throughout the world conditional on the (counterfactual) assumption that
all countries share a common agricultural technology.8 Third, while the spatial resolution of the
GAEZ predictions is considerably …ner than the typical approach to cross-country data in the
trade literature (in which countries are homogeneous points), 5 arc-minute grid cells are still very
coarse in an absolute sense. This means that there is likely to be a great deal of potential within-
country heterogeneity that is being smoothed over by the GAEZ agronomic modeling. Yet despite
these limitations of our analysis, Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage still has signi…cant
explanatory power in the data, as column (1) illustrates.
   6
     In order to measure the gains from the economic integration of U.S. agricultural markets between 1880 and 2000,
Costinot and Donaldson (2011) have developed a methodology that uses additional data on aggregate land use to
correct for this problem. Applying that correction is computationally challenging here, due to the large number of
…elds in most countries, and is beyond the scope of the present paper.
   7
     In our logarithmic speci…cation all observations in which either output or predicted output are zero must be
omitted. Out of the total of 935 potential observations (55 countries and 17 crops), 296 have zero output and 581
have zero predicted output— that is our Ricardian model predicts more complete specialization that there is in the
data. This should not be surprising given the potential for more spatial heterogeneity to exist in agricultural reality
than can be modeled (due to data limitations) by GAEZ. In all, 349 observations have both non-zero output and
non-zero predicted output and are hence included in the regression in column (1). We have explored a number of
potential adjustments to correct the results in column (1) for these missing observations, including a Tobit regression
(where the coe¢ cient is 0.213 and the s.e. is 0.057) and adding one to all observations prior to taking logs (coe¢ cient
0.440; s.e. 0.031).
   8
     The methodology developed in Costinot and Donaldson (2011) uses data on harvested area to allow for and
estimate unrestricted crop-and-region productivity shocks. Again, because of the high number of …elds per country
applying this correction to the current paper is computationally challenging.

    Columns (2) and (3) explore the robustness of our baseline estimate in column (1) to the inclu-
sion of crop and country …xed e¤ects, respectively. The rationale for these alternative speci…cations
is that there may be crop- or country-speci…c tendencies for misreporting or model error. Such er-
rors may be economic in nature if, say, some countries had higher intra-national price distortions,
or agronomic in nature if, say, the GAEZ model predictions were relatively more accurate for some
crops than others. Including such …xed e¤ects can reduce the slope coe¢ cient (to as low as 0.096,
in column (3)) but these estimates are still statistically signi…cantly di¤erent from zero. Thus the
results in columns (2) and (3) show that Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage continues to
have explanatory power whether focusing on the across-country variation, as in column (2), or the
across-crop variation, as in column (3).
    Finally, columns (4) and (5) investigate the extent to which our estimates are driven by particu-
lar components of the sample. Column (4) estimates the slope only among the 28 countries that are
at or above the median in terms of agricultural production (by weight). And column (5) estimates
the slope only on the 9 crops that are the most important (by weight) in global production. In both
cases the estimated slope coe¢ cient is similar (within one standard error) to our baseline estimate
in column (1).


5    Concluding Remarks
Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage is one of the oldest and most distinguished theories in
economics. But it is a di¢ cult theory to bring to the the data. To do so using conventional data
sources, one needs to make untestable functional form assumptions about how productive a given
factor of production would be at the activities it is currently, and deliberately, not doing. In this
paper we have argued that the predictions of agronomists— i.e., the scientists who specialize in
modeling how agricultural crops would fare under a wide range of possible growing conditions— can
be used to provide the missing data that make Ricardo’s ideas untestable in conventional settings.

   We have combined the data from a particular group of agronomists, those working on the GAEZ
project as part of the FAO, along with producer price data from the FAO, to assess the empirical
performance of Ricardo’s ideas across 17 agricultural crops and 55 major agriculture-producing
countries in 1989. We have asked a simple question: How do output levels predicted by Ricardo’s
theory compare to those that are observed in the data? Despite all of the real-world considerations
from which Ricardo’s theory abstracts, we …nd that a regression of log output on log predicted
output has a (precisely estimated) slope of 0.21. Ricardo’s theory of comparative advantage is not
just mathematically correct and non-trivial; it also has signi…cant explanatory power in the data,
at least within the scope of our analysis.
