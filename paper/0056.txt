Four estimators of econometric models are compared for predictive
accuracy. Two estimators assume that the parameters of the equations
re subject to variation over time. The first of these, the adaptive
regression technique (ADR), assumes that the intercept varies over
time, while the other, a varying—parameter regression technique (VPR),
assumes that all parameters may be subject to variation. The other
two estimators are ordinary least squares (OLS) and a robust estimator
that gives less weight to large residuals. The vehicle for these
experiments is the econometric model developed by Ray Fair.
      The main conclusion is that varying parameter techniques appear
promising for the estimation of econometric models. They are clearly
superior in the present context for short term forecasts, Of the two
varying parameter techniques considered, ADR is superior over longer
prediction intervals.

I. Introduction


             Two recent studies of the performance of alternative estimation

techniques indicate that considerable gains in forecasting accuracy may

be achieved by using more advanced and difficult techniques. These

studies by Fair [7,8] apply a variety of estimation techniques to the

stochastic equations of the model described in Fair [ 6 ]. The pvrpose

of this paper is to extend this comparison of estimators by examining

the performance of two varying parameter estimation techniques in the

context of the same model. The two estimation techniques arc compared,

in terms of the accuracy of ex ante predictions,with OLS and the most

successful robust estimator obtained in Fair [ 8 ]. Some within—sample

prediction results are also examined.

             It is a well known fact that many of the macro—econometric

models which are used for forecasting are incapable of producing accurate

forecasts without the regular and extensive use of constant adjustments.1

Fair [ 6 ] has argued that part of the need for constant adjustments in

many models appears to be due to serial correlation in the error terms.

Thus, the formal treatment of the serial correlation problem is one of

the features of the estftiation techniques he considers. The assumption

of serial correlation in the error terms does not,   however,   completely

resolve   the apparent dichotomy between standard estimation theory and
common forecasting practice. An examination    of the constant adjustments
often   reveals what appear to be permanent structural shifts In the equaUons.

                                       2




One of the estimators considered in this study, the Adaptive Regression

technique, resolves this dichotomy by assuming that the constant is

subject to both permanent and transitory changes over the sample period.

               The other estimator considered in this study is a logical

extension of the first. Once one admits to the possibility of permanent

structural shifts in the intercept it is reasonable to look into the

structural stability of the relationship as a whole. In recent years

there has been increasing recognition of the fact that the aggregative

relationships we deal with in econometrics represent such complex

interactions of behavioral and technical phenomena that it is not feasible

to assume that relationships are stable over long periods of time. This

feature of econometric relationships has been well explored in 1 3              ],


[4   ]   and   [   9 ],   and Fair 1   6 ] in   his original development of the model

considered herein acknowledges that the objective is to develop a

reasonably stable forecasting model rather than a "structural model".

The problem of estimating relationships with time varying parameters his

been approached imaginatively by several authors. Works by Rosenberg

[10,11] and Sarris [ 12 1 has greatly Increased the feasibility of

estimating relationships with time varying parameter structures. This

study considers only the estimator developed in Cooley and Prescott [3,4]

because of fts computational ease given the limited sample size and

because it is a natural extension of the adaptive regression model.

               It is worth noting at this juncture that this study is not

intended to be a formal comparison of estimation techniques. The only
                             3




criterion of comparison is the predictive accuracy of the estimators In

the context of a model which has many unique features. Nevertheless,

the Fair model provides a convenient vehicle for the comparison of

estimation techniques because It has been used extensively for this

purpose in other studies. Whether or not the results obtained in this

study are likely to hold elsewhere is an open question but they at least

Indicate that varying parameter estimation methods are worthy of further

investigation.


II. The Fair Model


          The equations of the Fair model are presented in Table 1.

The model is described completely in [6] and will not be elaborated

upon here. There are few differences between the original Fair model

and the version used in this study. These differences are discussed

briefly in [8] and enumerated at the end of Table 1. The version of

the model used in this study was kept identical to that reported

in [8] to maintain the comparability of results. There are, however,

some features of the model specification which should be commented on

at this point.

         Dummy variables D644, D65l, D704 and D71l have been added to

the CD, V and M equations and dummy variables D704 and D711 were added to

the IP equation. The purpose of these variables is to account for the

effect of two major auto strikes. The question that arises is whether

these variables should be included when varying parameter estimation

methods are applied. In this study it was decided to retain them because
                             4




the comparison being made is a modest one and to the extent that these

represent discrete disruptions and not part of the continuous pattern of

variation it is reasonable to treat them as such.

           The sample period used for estimation and prediction was 1960—Il

through 1973—I, the same as that used in Fair [8]. The choice of this

sample period reflects the fact that this model is designed to be a fore-

casting rather than a long term structural model. This shorter sample

period at least insures that the relationships are likely to be more stable

than they would if data extending further into the past were used. This

is not really at variance with common practice in macro—econometric

modelling which rarely employs data from before the early to mid fifties

even though such data is generally available. It is at variance with the

statistical theory which underlies econometric method, however, in that

it neglects sample information which could improve our knowledge of the

parameters in these models. The fact that it is not feasible to use the

information because of structural change simply highlights the fact that

either the models need to be more carefully formulated or estimation

techniques which assume structural change should be used or, preferably

both.

III.    Estimation Methods


            The estimation methods chosen for comparison in this study are

ordinary    least squares (OLS)     and the most promising of the robust estimators

investigated      in    [ 8 1. This robust estimator is an approximate least—

absolute—residual (LAR) estimator. If we write the typical structural

equation of the model as


(1)        F(Y,Xt,8i) = u                                 i=l      C
                                                          t=l      T

where         is a row vector of endogenous variables, X is a row vector

of exogenous variables, .           is   a vector of parameters and u1 is an

error term, the LAR estimates are obtained by minimizing

                  T
(2)        Q =     Z
                  t=l

with respect to the unknown parameters.. Typically, this is solved by

linear programming, but, because the Fair model assumes serial correlation.

         is a non—linear function of the unknown parameters. Consequently,

LAR is approximated by a weighted least squares (WLS)        estimator   in which

the minimand is redefined as

                  T (u. )
(3)       Q =
                  t=l it
and is minimized iteratively.

            The    adaptive regression estimators (ADR)   are   discussed thoroughly
in    [1,2] and the varying parameter estimators (VPR) are developed in [3,4].
                                  10




Briefly, these estimators assume that the                  of equation (1) can be
represented by the following process1


(4)
        it    =
                   t+vit                                                            -

where             represents the permanent component of the parameter process.
The errors v.it and wit are independent random variables with mean                      zero

and covariance matrices


       Cov(v) = (l—r)a2
(5)
       Cov(w) =

If    y is significantly different from      zero the implication is that: the
parameters     are subject to permanent change. Specification of the           elements
of          and        represent our prior beliefs about the parameters

which are changing. In the ADR technique the covariances reduce to

scalars and the appropriate elements of E          and             (a o) are unity
which makes estimation more efficient. The VPR estimates require

specific prior assumptions about            and        .    In   this study alternative

plausible assumptions wcr tried and the final set used were chosen on the

basis of the computed Bayesian posterior odds.

              Computation of both ADR and VPR estimates requires that the

parameter process be normalized on some specific realization. For the

was normalized on the value of the parameters one period beyond the

sample.

IV.    Results

4.1    Coefficient Estimates


            Four sets of coefficient estimates were generated for the r1odel

by both the ADR and VPR techniques. These are available from the author

upon   request.1 The ADR technique was not applied to either the CN or CS
equations since these did not have intercepts in the original version of
the   model. Equations were estimated with intercepts hut these appeared

to be less plausible than the original equations. The only relations

which did not have any significant intercept variation were the PD and LF1

equations. Neither of these had any significant slope variation either.

Estimation of the CN and CS equations by the VPR technique did not reveal

any    significant   slope variation. All of the remaining equations had

significant slope and intercept variation although the extent to which

they vary is different for different equations. Of those subject to

variation the most stable equation is the employment equation (N) while

the least stable is the inventory equation (V). The investment equations

(IP    and Iii) and the labor force equations (LF1 and LF2)     were also subject

to substantial variation.


4.2 Within Sample Results


             Because the varying parameter estimation technique assumes

that    the parameters   are subject to permanent changes over time,       within

                                   13




 sample comparisons of these estimators with others is rather difficult.

 It is possible, once we have estimated y for each equation, to trace

 out implied parameter values historically but this is time consuming

 and expensive. Consequently, within sample comparisons were made only

 for the ADR estimates which were traced out over the entire sample period

 and compared with the results for TLS—I and OLS over that period.

Table 2 presents the results of this comparison.

           It should be noted that the predictions are dynamic in the

sense that lagged endogenous variables assume their predicted values.

For the ADR predictions, the constant term Is different i every period.

As the results in Table 2 reveal ADR iS          the   best at predicting GNP (in
                                  14




current   dollars) followed by WIS     and   OLS in terms of both the root mean
squared error (R}ISE) and the mean absolute error (MAE).1 For the output
deflator PD the ranking is just the same even though the PD equation
displayed   no significant variation in the intercept. This is explained

by the fact that PD depends in large part on the accuracy with which

GNP is prcdicted over the sample period and ADR and WLS are better at

that. The variable GNPR (GNP in constant dollars) simply depends on GNP,

PD and exogenous var:iables representing the government sector so it is

natural that its ranking is the came as the first two.

            For the employment variables N and D, OLS is again the worst,

while WLS is slightly better than ADR, but not remarkably so. For the

labor   force variable LF2, ADR   is clearly the best followed by OLS and

%TLS.



4.3 Outside Sample Results


            The main focus of this study is on the ex—ante prediction

properties of the ADR and VPR estimates. To examine those properties the

model was estimated by OLS, WLS, ADR and VPR over three different sample

periods. The first of these extends through l968—IV and predictions are

made for the 1969—I — 1973—I period. The second sample period extends

through 1970—Il with predictions from 1970—Ill — 1973—I while the final

sample extends through 197l—IV with predictions over the period 1972—I —

1973—I.   It is of interest to know how each of the estimators being



1. The variables chosen for analysis here are the same as those presented
    in [ 8 ] and are the most important variables in the model. GNP is
    determined simultaneously while the other five are determined recursively.
                              15




compared performs over different prediction intervals so the errors are

examined for 1 period, 4 period, 8 period and longer predictions.

           Table 3 presents the simple static 1 period prediction errors

for each of the three sample periods and each of the four estimation

methods. For the estimates through 1968—IV VPR has the smallest one

period prediction error for GNP and four of the six components of GNP.

ADR ranks a very close second followed by OLS and WLS. All estimators

perform equally well for PD and hence the same ranking holds for the

prediction of real GNP (GNPR). Both ADR and VPR do significantly worse

at predicting employment (M) and significantly better at predicting the

unemployment rate (UR) with the other results being mixed. The results

based on the estimates through 1970—Il are quite similar with some

exceptions. Although ADR and VPR are better at predicting GNP and no

worse at predicting PD, OLS does better at predicting GNPR because the

errors are of fsettlng (errors reported in Table 3 are absolute values).

The   other notable change is that ADR and VPR are here dramatically more
successful at predicting the recursive employment and labor force variables.
The estimates through 1971—IV again show ADR and VPR to be more successful

than either OLS or WLS in general, but the differences are much less

pronounced than in the previous sample periods.

            Table 4 presents the results of estimating the model through

1968—IV and simulating through 1973—I. The VPR estimates do best at

predicting both current and   real   GNP as veil as three of the six GNP

components over four periods. The ADR estimates do nearly as well, while

OLS is generally superior to WLS at predicting GNP and Its components.

The predictions of the recursive labor force and employment variables

are again somewhat mixed although ADR and/or VPR are generally superior

for three out of the five and inferior for the other two. WLS seems

to dominate OLS for these variables. These rankings of estimators

generally remain the same for the eight period predictions although VPR

does the worst at predicting current dollar GNP and the dIfferences

among the estimators are less pronounced. Over the longer prediction

interval of 17 quarters the ranking of the estimators changes sot:ewhat

with respect to GIP and its components. The estimates generated by

ADR are   clearly superior to WLS,    OLS   and VPR in that order. The change
of the VPR   estImates   appears to be due to the large errors in predicting
CN and CS because it     is clearly superior to WLS   and   OLS at prcdicting
the   other four GNP components. The rankings of the estimators with

respect to the recursive variables remains the same over this period.

            Table 5 presents the results of estimating the model through

1970—11 and predicting through       1973—I. Here the pattern is changed
somewhat.    The varying parameter techniques are again better at forecasting

real and current GNP as well as three of the six GNP components over four

periods. These techniques also yield better forecasts for all of the

five labor force and employment variables. When the prediction interval

is extended to eight periods the superiority of ADR and VPR over WLS

disappears where real and money GNP are concerned although they still do

best at predicting three of the GNP components and all of the labor force

    and employment variables. When        the   prediction interval is extended to

    1973—I    (11 quarters) the ranking changes again with WLS being superior
    followed by ADR, OLS and VPR in that order where GNP and its components
    are concerned. For the remaining variables ADR and VPR do the best with
    the exception of M for which OLS dominates.
                Finally,   Table 6 presents the results of     estimation   through

    1971—IV   and prediction through 1973—I. Here again ADR dominctes the
    other estimation techniques for all but 'a few of the variables. The
    TR estimates are slightly better than OLS and significantly better than
    WLS. It is worth noting that all of the estimation techniques do
    noticeably   worse over this later period, mainly underpredicting the

    large increases in money GNP and its components.

V. Conclusions


           From the results presented in the previous section we can

draw some cautious conclusions. First, it seems that varying parameter

techniques yield, in the present context, more accurate short term

forecasts than either competitor. This is true of both the static

one period predictions and the dynamic four period predictions. In

general the ADR technique performed as wall or better than the VPR

technique which assumes all of the slope coefficients are varying,

especIally over longer predicticn intervals. 'hile the varying parameter

estimation   techniques also performed well over longer prediction intervals
their relative performance seemed to decline with the length of the
prediction interval. The superiority of the ADR      and VPR estimates

appeal-s to hold up better cver longer intervals for the recursive
equations than it does for the simultaneous equations.
           These    conclusions must be interpreted with caution since it is

clear   that they are drawn from a limited experiment arid that further

experimentation     is needed. The relative performance of the varying
parameter estimators might well be improved by using the longer sample
period to gain     precision in the estimation of the parameter proc:ss.

The application of the estimation techniques suggested by Rosenberg [      11]
would also enable us to differentiate parameter processes. Further work
is also warranted in the consideraticn of simultaneous versions of adaptive

regressions. The results of this study indicate that varying parameter

estimation techniques appear promising enough for the estimation of

econometric models to warrant further investigation.
