                 MODELING STRUCTURAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATION
                  IN THE MARKET'S VALUATION OF BANKING FIRMS


                                  ABSTRACT



    This paper decomposes both the market sensitivity and the interest-rate

sensitivity of bank stock into on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet

components. It derives these constituent and often-offsetting sensitivities

from a nonstationary three-equation model that employs accounting and

capital-market information to explain cross-sectional and temporal variation

in the value of stockholder equity.

     To control statistically for heteroskedasticity       and     intrasample

differences in unbooked capital positions, the model is estimated separately

for three size classes of large U.S. banks. Parameter estimates confirm the

importance of "hidden" or unbooked capital at these banks. For the nation's

very largest banks, shifts in the value of these parameters are consistent

with the view that the capitalized value of federal deposit-insurance

guarantees burgeoned in the l980s with interest volatility, demonstrations

of regulatory forbearance, and relaxation of deposit-rate ceilings.

                      IN THE MARKET'S VALUATION OF BANKING FIRMS


I.   Introduction

      This paper seeks to enrich the profession's interpretation of the

market    and       interest-rate    sensitivity   of deposit-institution stock.

Economists conventionally assess these sensitivities as the regression

coefficients fitted to market returns and interest rates in an expanded

market model. A market model uses capital-market data to estimate a usually

stationary stochastic process presumed to generate periodic returns to
stockholders. A stationary and nonstructural model seems poorly suited to

analyzing a period when macroeconomic conditions, policy rules, financial

technology, and regulatory freedoms change rapidly. We derive market and

interest-rate sensitivities from a nonstacionary model that uses accounting

and capital-market information to explain the value of stockholder equity.

      Our analysis develops two distinctions that partition the market value

of a firm's stock (i.e. ,           its   market capitalization, MV) into three

components. The first distinction decomposes MV into hidden and recorded

capital reserves. The second distinction decomposes hidden capital reserves

into values that are "unbooked but bookable" on a historical-cost basis

under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and those which are

currently treated as unbookable off-balance-sheet items under GAAP.

      Our statistical model develops explicit estimates of both components of

hidden capital. We estimate the net unbooked value of bookable (or on-

balance-sheet) positions by estimating an intermediate valuation ratio, k.

This variable expresses the ratio of the market to book value of the

collected components of a firm's bookable equity, Be• Applying the valuation
                                                                                 2




 ratio to By, the value of accounting or book net worth, assigns a market

 value to bookable assets and liabilities. Subtracting this estimate of

 from market capitalization values off-balance-sheet items. This appraised

value of unbookable equity, tJe captures the net value of unbookable     assets

and liabilities.

     We develop estimates of k and     for 43 quarters of 1975-85. We do this

by regressing cross-sectionally the market value of banks' equity shares on

the book value of their accounting net worth. We call this          regression

equation, the Statistical Market Value Accounting Model, SMVAM. We link this

model to the market model by endogenizing changes in k and       as functions

of cx post returns on stocks and bonds.

     We envisage the parameters of these second-stage models    as undergoing
evolutionary change during 1975-85. Goldfeld and Quandt's [(1972), (1973),

(1976)] switching regression method, GQSRN, is used to study the temporal

variability of model parameters. CQSRM estimates three attributes of regime

variation: specific shift dates, the gradualness of each       shift, and the
parameters of the stochastic process governing each regime.

     Expanded market models make no direct use of accounting information    on
the bookable positions of a firm and make no effort to separate bookable and

unbookable items. Rapid expansion in banks' fee-based service    activity and
in the policy problems that off-balance-sheet activities pose for deposit

insurers (Kane, 1985) should create a demand for market-based     measures of
off-balance-sheet activities.

    We interpret our model as a flexible functional form that     incorporates
structural detail aggregated away in a market model. It uses accounting data

to focus structurally on market participants' ex ante and nonstationary
valuation dectsions rather than forcing ex post returns to fit a stationary

process. Our analysis endogenizes temporal movements in the degree of market

and interest sensitivity of capital positions that develop on and off a

bank's conventional balance sheet. Specifying and estimating this additional

structure    generates      evidence of disaggregated market and interest
sensitivity that cannot be observed by directly fitting a two-index model of

ex post equity returns. This additional evidence reconciles some conflicting

findings in market-model studies of market and interest sensitivity.

II. The Statistical Market-Value Accounting Model

     If markets are efficient, financial analysts see through smoke and

mirrors raised by contemporary accounting rules. Our analysis develops
separate estimates for bookable and unbookable elements of the market and

interest sensitivity of a depository firm's generalized balance sheet.

     At any time, a firm's market capitalization, MV, is the product of its

share price and number of shares outstanding. Invoking the principle of

value additivity, MV may also be expressed as the market value of bookable

and unbookable assets, (A +A'), minus the market value of bookable and
                                     mm
unbookable nonequity liabilities,                         because   deposit- insurance
                                                (Lm+L)•

subsidies are widely believed to have surged during the 1980s and to vary

with bank size, it is instructive to isolate from other unbookable assets

the value of a deposit institution's explicit and conjectural federal

guarantees net of discounted future costs, FCG (cf. Benston               .,    1986;

Brickley and James, 1986; and Thomson, 1987). In symbols,



            MV — (F

                                            + (A —L ).
                                                in in
                                                                    (1)
                                                                                        4




Since recorded assets and liabilities are carried at historical cost, even

(Am_Lm) cannot be observed directly. A parsimonious way to proceed is to

assume that market participants estimate the market value of elements of

bookable equity by applying appropriate mark-up or mark-down ratios, ka and

     to the accounting values reported by the institution. Adopting this

approximationtransforms equation (1) to:
     MV —          + (A' —   L')]   +         —
            [Fcc                        kAb       klLb,                   (2)


where subscripts a, 1, and b represent assets, liabilities, and booked

values, respectively.

     In principle, A.0 and L.0 are jointly determined variables, affected by

many of the same unknown exogenous variables. Treating A.0 and Lb as separate


and exogenous regressors could introduce interpretive problems. Fortunately,

our data give no evidence of these problems. At every date for every bank

class, the coefficient constraint that ka —
                                                          k1 proves impossible to reject.
This justifies our applying a single valuation ratio k to the value of an

institution's book equity, By —               —
                                         Ab       Lb.
     Expressing the market value of unbookable equity ((Fcc+A_L)] as Ue

and allowing for approximation error introduced in the model, we obtain

equation (3):

            MV—U +k3V+e .                                                  (3)

We term this equation, which can be estimated from time-series or cross-

sectional data sets, the Statistical Market-Value Accounting Model, SMVAM.

     As with many statistical models employed in finance, equation (3) can

be justified most satisfactorily as a "flexible functional form." The
specifications's          virtues            lie   in having a small number of readily

interpretable parameters and in incorporating several testable restrictions.

Our specification treats e as an approximation error. Our goal is to show

that (3) can be imbedded into a specification that uses more information

than a market model, not that (3) completely represents the process

determining MV.

Parameter Restrictions

     In applying the model cross-sectionally, we restrict the valuation

ratio ki applicable to bank i at time t to have the same value k across

each bank class. To lessen damage from this restriction, it is necessary to

focus on relatively homogeneous subsamples of banks.

     A set of what should be seen as identifying restrictions follow from

reformulating (3) as a two-equation model of Ueand Be:

          Ue —au +bU BV+e 1                                            (4)


          Be —    a
                      e
                          + b
                                e
                                    BV + e
                                             2

With only one instrumental variable, four coefficients cannot be identified.

Equation (3) overcomes this problem by restricting b and ae each to zero.

To the extent that either U is not uncorrelated with book value or ae               is
                          e

nonzero, the neglected coefficients bleed into our estimates of k and

Although such bleeding limits our capacity to separate the components of

hidden reserves, it does not invalidate (3) considered as a reduced form.

     A third restriction is that (3) and (4) are linear. However, using a

linear approximation to what is presumed to be a monotonically increasing

function is less damaging when the range of upside and downside variation is

controlled by outside forces. On the upside, takeover discipline limits
                                                                               6




large holdings of capital because high levels of capital reduce deposit-
insurance subsidies. On the downside, the FDIC introduces increasing

regulatory penalties whenever a bank's BV heads toward zero (Buser, Chen,

and Kane, 1981). (Because the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation

has in recent years virtually abandoned capital discipline, the model might

work less well for S&Ls.)

     A fourth restriction lies in treating BVi as exogenous. Because GAAP

gives bank managers options to realize unbooked gains and losses on bookable

and unbookable positions and authorities penalize low BV, ki and         and

tradable elements of Ue and BVi may be negatively correlated. Our estimated

rank orderings of k against bank size class vary over time.

Inter'retabi1ity Issues

     The model's coefficients describe the    facto deceptiveness of GAAP.

Unless both U—O and k—l, the accounting or book value of a bank's capital

represents a biased estimate of the market value of stockholder equity. If

the estimated intercept is significantly positive (negative),unbookable
assets and liabilities serve as a net source of (drain on) institutional

capital. Financial analysts know that problems exist in both directions. On

the drain side, U.S. institutions habitually overstate         the   capital

contribution derived from their loan-loss reserves by not deducting an

allowance for anticipated loses that they have not yet formally realized. On

the sources side, institutions do not book the value of the deposit-

insurance guarantees they receive.

     If only intercept bias were to exist, changes in accounting values
                                                                           7




would be unbiased estimates of changes in the market value of on-balance-

sheet assets and liabilities. However, a slope bias may also exist. We

interpret (1-k) as a premium when k>l and as a discount factor when k<l.

Sampling Issues

     It is difficult to develop a representative sample of data from which

to estimate SMVAM. Stock in few U.S. deposit institutions trades directly or

regularly in the market. Many thrift institutions are still           mutual

organizations, while small stockholder institutions are often privately

held. For large institutions, to exploit regulatory and tax benefits, stock

is typically owned indirectly through a holding company, HC. A bank (or a

saving and loan) MC may own more than one depository and may own
nondepository assets as well.

     This leads us to reinterpret Ue For an HC, Ue may capture activity

that is on the HG's balance sheet but not on the balance sheet of the HC's

principal bank. We view estimates of SMVAM parameters as if equity in a

bank's affiliates were an off-balance-sheet position of the bank. We do this

because data on subsidiaries are not available quarterly and to link the

model with regulatory conceptions of affiliate activity.

     Even if the market value of other HG subsidiaries and the unbookable

equity of the bank were uncorrelated with the bank's book equity, the mean

value of equity in HG affiliates would bleed into the measure of the bank's

unbookable equity provided by the intercept term. The size of this intercept

reflects the mean importance of all unbooked sources of value not correlated

with By.   Similarly, (l-R2) tells us how much variation in these items is

orthogonal to variation in BV.
                                                                                        a




     If    subsidiary values and unbookable equity correlate with book equity,

regression estimates of the valuation ratio would be biased. Under these as-

yet unknowable circumstances, deviations of k from unity could signal either

the existence of capital gains and losses on bookable positions or size-

based variation in the value of affiliate equity and unbookable positions.

III. Buildjn Market and Interest-Rate Sensitivity into the SMVAM

     The   parameters of the SMVAN are Ue and k. When stock and bond returns

change, these parameters must respond. To express the market and interest-

rate sensitivity of a deposit institution's bookable and unbookable equity,

we imbed this response in a triangular three-equation model.

     This model portrays quarterly adjustments in each SMVAM parameter as a

linear function of market returns and interest rates:


           Uet_ Ue,tl_ U + mt + Rt + Vt,                            (5)




           kr— k1 —      k + mt + pkR + w .                         (6)

    and R represent a market return and an interest-rate proxy and the

stochastic terms in each equation are conceived as approximation errors. The

slope coefficients         and       in (6) and    and    in (7) measure the market

sensitivity and interest-rate sensitivity of SMVAM's parameters.

     As is equation (3), equations (5) and (6) are offered as flexible

functional forms. This two-equation submodel              is   intended        only   to

parameterize in an interpretable and parsimonious way revaluation decisions

that take place continually. The true models that (5) and (6)             -   - and   the

two-index model     -   - merely   approximate may be nonlinear in Rm and R and may
                                                                               9




include unspecified other variables as well. Because our equations are

conceived as approximations, we subject parameter estimates to Goldfeld-

Quandt tests for regime shifts. Especially in an era of rapid financial

change, we think it important to allow the parameters of such approximations

to be recalibrated whenever statistical evidence indicates that movements in

omitted variables (such as authorities' closure rules) or nonlinearities

might have degraded a previously relevant model's explanatory power.

     Equations (5) and (6) have the same logical standing as the following

two-index market model, which expresses the return on asset p as:


      p
          ..p0   mm   +p+ . r       p
                                                                  (7)

In (7), the betas measure the asset's systematic market and interest-rate

sensitivity and         is a stochastic disturbance. Except that          may be

interpreted as an "industry factor" (Lee and Brewer, 1985; Sweeney and

Warga, 1987), the market model ignores the structural characteristics of

individual institutions and the markets in which they operate. One source

opines that "studies of bank stocks describe the pricing of steel industry

stocks as well as they do the pricing of bank stocks" (Federal Reserve Bank

of New York, 1986, p. 58).

     Our equations condition market participants' revaluation decisions on

the same variables that are taken as exogenous in the two-index model. In a

reduced-form sense, then, (5) and (6) must explain the overall market

sensitivity, ,        and       the interest sensitivity, r' of equity returns in

model (7). These market-model betas may be deemed to be monotonically

increasing in the respective slopes of (5) and (6):
                                                                          10

            rt t             '
Linking    the SMVAM   to the two-index model in this way takes all partial
derivatives as positive and allows the righthand-side betas and the
weighting functions f(...) and g(...) to vary over time with market a'd

interest     volatility      and with the balance-sheet structure of sample
institutions.

IV. Data Set Used

     End-of-quarter share prices, number of shares, and book values for a

set of large commercial banks are obtained from BANK COMPUSTAT, 1986. This

data set includes about 150 NYSE. AMEX and over-the-counter issues. Market

values are determined as the product of end-of-quarter share price and

number of shares outstanding. BANK COMPUSTAT provides data on the book

values of the principal bank subsidiary, defined as the total equity of the

common stockholders in the capital of the bank which includes the par value

of common stock, surplus, undivided profits, reserves for contingencies and

other capital reserves.

     Our market proxy is the CRSP equal-weighted NYSE and AMEX monthly stock

index adjusted for dividends. Because empirical research shows no reliable

role for short-term rates in the two-index model (Kane and Unal, 1987), the

interest-rate index used is the monthly holding-period return on long-term

government bonds constructed by Ibbotson Associates, 1986. Monthly returns

are compounded to produce quarterly returns.

     We interpret movements in holding-period yields as dominated by what

rational-expectations models term "interest-rate surprises." Although the
                                                                           11




construction of holding-period returns parallels the CRSP proxy, such
returns reverse the economic interpretation of the sign of an interest-rate

coefficient.    Bond-price reductions induced by interest-rate increases

decrease holding-period returns. Hence, a rise in. holding-period returns

corresponds to a fall in interest rates, an event widely believed to benefit

the stock of a typical bank.

V. Parameter Estimates for SMVAM

     Estimation proceeds stepwise. From a time series of cross-sectional

values for the MV and BV of individual banks, Ue and k are estimated by

ordinary least squares for each of 43 1975-1985 quarters. Then, to estimate

(5) and (6),     the quarterly changes in k and Ue are regressed on stock and

bond returns.

     To   control      statistically for heteroskedasticity and intrasample
differences in k and       we classify sample banks into three asset-size

classes. For each class, the SMVA1( is estimated separately. The three size

groups consist of the largest 25 banks, the smallest 25 sample banks, and 54

to 97 other banks that we term medium-size banks. Banks of similar size may

be presumed to operate in broadly similar ways and to be disciplined or

assisted by deposit-insurance authorities in similar fashion.

     For SMVAM, Table 1 reports quarterly cross-sectional regressions for

each size class. For the largest banks, t-tests reject (albeit with low

power) the combined U—O and k—i condition necessary for recorded equity to

be an unbiased estimate of market value except in nine quarters (for medium-

size banks, eighteen quarters). Accounting representations of the economic

performance of major banks are deceptive. Moreover, our data indicate that
                                                                           12




the larger a bank becomes, the less reliably book values track the market

value of underlying stockholder claims.

        It is also useful to examine the two prongs of the unbiasedness

condition separately. Deviations of         from zero show a definite time

pattern. Before 1980, the market value of unbookable equity is negative for

every bank group in every quarter. This means that off-balance-sheet items

serve as a drain on capital values before 1980. At the largest banks, this

drain     remains   statistically significant until mid-1979, but becomes

insignificant thereafter. A broadly similar pattern holds for the other two

bank groups: Uc remains negative throughout 1975-79, while its sign becomes

less regular during 1980-85.

     The ratio of mean 13e to mean MV varies sharply between the 1975-79 and

1980-85 subperiods. During the first subperiod, this ratio is -31 percent

for the largest banks, -15 percent for medium banks and -25 percent for

small banks. During the 1980-85 period, the ratio shrinks dramatically,

becoming -l percent for the largest and smallest banks, and -9 percent for

medium-size banks. After 1980, unbookable equity seldom acts as significant

reservoir of hidden losses. This observation is consistent with the

hypothesis that after 1980, the value of         federal   deposit-insurance

guarantees increased with: interest volatility; demonstrations of regulatory

forbearance for large banks; and the relaxation of deposit-rate ceilings

(Kane, 1985). Of course, the precise effect of these forces at an individual

bank should vary with the bank's leverage and other portfolio riskiness.

Largest banks' dramatic improvement in the U./MV ratio may reflect different

economic forces from those operative at other banks. The upward surge of Ue
                                                                                    13




at very large institutions may be driven by administrative and political

difficulties that persuade regulatory authorities to overlook a capital

deficiency (caused, for example, by unrealized losses on LDC loans) and to

regard these institutions as "too big to fail" (Seidman, 1986).              For other
banks, the major influences may be the opening up of extralocal sources of

retail deposits and a broader range of potential acquirers, acquisitions,

and future activities.

     Turning to k, the largest banks usually show a significant premium

(k>l) for recorded equity before 1980. However, k drops significantly below

unity in 1980 and in most quarters thereafter. For other size classes,

patterns   differ.     At   medium-size   banks,       except for two scattered
observations, k stays below one until 1983. From then on, k lies above unity

most of the time. The smallest banks' pattern resembles that of medium-size

banks, but the turn comes later, in 84/4 when the departure from unity

becomes significant.

VI. Digression on Switching Regression

     We investigate the temporal variability of the parameters of the

second-stage equations (5) and (6) by Goldfeld and Quandt's switching
regression method (CQSRN). This section illustrates the method for an n-

regime specification of equation (5):


     et + jint           jt + vj        j —   1,... ,n;t—   1,... ,T. (10)


In (10), 0et is Uet —       t-l'     indexes the n regimes and                   is a

disturbance term assumed to be distributed N(0, ak).                   The likelihood

function that applies when the data set is conceived as a combination of n

regimes would employ more parameters than we have observations. To develop
                                                                                          14




positive    degrees of freedom, GQSRM          uses        transition-smoothing        dummy

variables, Dj. If the observations come from n regimes, (n-I) switch dates


Z and (n-I) gradualness parameters           exist. The n-i sets of variables Dj

are approximated as:


      Dj -   f        [(2,r)2 g*]l exp {- 1/2 [(      -   Z)/a12 d ,            (11)

where j now runs from 1 to n—I and the endpoint values are                  0 and          1


by definition. In (U) the valtie of                       gives information about the


smoothness of the structural change. The smaller or               is, the more sudden the


transition between the regimes. If          is significantly different from zero,


the hypothesis that the structural change is abrupt in the vicinity of Z

should be rejected in favor of a hypothesis of gradual change.

      In (10) the equation representing the s-th regime is then multiplied by

Maximizing (13) with respect to the unknown parameters generates maximum-

likelihood estimates of: the parameters of equation (10), the mean switch

dates Z, and the gradualness parameters                  which characterize the

nonabruptness of the associated structural change.

    Maximizing the likelihood functions developed in this paper requires

numerical optimization. GRADX (an algorithm using the quadratic hill-

climbing method) in Princeton University's CQOPT package is used.

VII. Changes in the Market and Interest-Rate Sensitivity of k and Ue


     Substantive interest focuses on the market sensitivity           and


interest-rate sensitivity (fl and              and residual variance (a and c7)

of unbookable equity and the valuation ratio. Tables 2 to 5 summarize CQSRM

results. Table 6 sorts out the individual significance of the many
individual coefficient shifts allowed.

     Table 2 reports two regimes for the market and interest sensitivity of

unbookable equity for the largest and the smallest 25 banks. Medium-size

banks experience three regimes. In all three size classes, the market and

interest sensitivities of the valuation ratio show the same number of

regimes (although not always the same shift dates) as unbookable equity.

     Table 3 reports the dates and gradualness of the shifts. Panel A

focuses on the market and interest sensitivity of unbookable equity. For the

largest banks, the only switch occurs at 78/3. This switch point estimate

has a standard error of 2.07 quarters. This means that the two-standard-

error confidence interval for this switch date runs from roughly 77/3 to
                                                                           16




79/3. The estimated associated gradualness parameter is 4.33 quarters

meaning the switch is gradual. Approximating the length of the transition by

twice the gradualness parameter implies this gradual switch (given an

estimated starting point) completes itself in nine quarters.

     Medium and small banks' first switch is estimated at 77/2; medium

banks' second switch at 81/1. CQRSM cannot reject the hypotheses that these

switches are abrupt.

     Panel     of Table 3 develops parallel results for the valuation ratio.

Large and small banks show one switch, while medium banks experience two.

The largest banks experience a gradual shift: the mean date is 77/3 and the

associated gradualness parameter is 3.47 quarters. The drift in the market

and interest sensitivity of the largest banks' valuation ratio takes 7

quarters. Medium banks' first and second switches occur abruptly at 77/2 and

80/4. Small banks' second regime starts at 77/1.

     For all banks, GQRSM labels mid-1977 as a time of sea change. Around

this date, sample banks experience structural changes in their sensitivities

to stock returns and bond yields. This dating pattern supports the
political-economy view that the Fed's October 1979 change in operating

procedures is better conceived as an endogenous response to changes in the

economic and political environment affecting the stock of its client firms

rather than as an exogenous event. For the largest banks, the structural

drift tails off precisely when the Federal Reserve's regime change was

announced. Medium-size banks differ in experiencing a second structural

change at the end of 1980.

     Table 4 reports sensitivities for unbookable equity in each regime. For

the largest banks, the market sensitivity of unbookable equity (fl) proves
                                                                          17




negative and significant early in its 75/2-78/3 drift. But over time this

sensitivity becomes positive and loses its significance by 78/4. This

indicates that largest banks' off-balance-sheet positions hedge market

variation only during the 1975-78 period. After 1978, off-balance-sheet
positions lose their relation to market returns on stock. Table 6 confirms

that the shift in market beta is significant.

     In both regimes largest banks' unbookable equity proves negatively
correlated with bond returns. This implies that the value of unbookable

equity at large banks increases when ex post bond returns fall (I.e., when

interest rates rise). This is consistent with Kane's (1985) hypothesis that

increases in FDIC guarantees offset much of interest-induced losses on net

bookable assets at banks the FDIC deems infeasible to liquidate. Although we

observe no significant shift between regimes, fl remains negative taken by

itself but loses significance during the second regime.

     For medium banks, the market sensitivity of unbookable equity is

negative and significant in all three regimes. Compared to large banks,

medium-size banks' off-balance-sheet     positions   better   hedge   market

variations   after 77/3. Medium banks parallel large banks in having

unbookable equity relate negatively to holding-period yields prior to 1977.

However, the relation becomes insignificantly positive in the two regimes

operative after 77/3.

     The specification for unbookable equity works poorly for the smallest

banks. R2 values prove much lower and slope coefficients are insignificant

in both regimes. This may trace to greater diversity in the way members of

this class operate or to the FDIC's willingness to enforce capital

requirements closely enough to keep the capitalized value of FDIC guarantees
                                                                          18




close to zero for this size class. Table 6 clarifies that the 77/2 shift is

best viewed as a significant increase in residual variance.

    Market and interest sensitivites for the valuation ratio are found in

Table 5.     For the largest banks,      is positive and significant in both

regimes. This positive sign indicates that when stock returns increase, so

does the valuation ratio for book equity. For fixed interest rates, this

means that in a bull market book values increasingly underestimate the

market     value of net bookable assets. The market and interest-rate
sensitivities of the valuation ratio for the largest banks decline after the

77/3 shift, but only the decline in market beta proves significant. During

both regimes, the relation between k and holding-period returns on bonds is

positive. This indicates that the institution's bookable assets are more

interest-sensitive than its bookable liabilities. This is not evidence that

the Macauley duration (as opposed to the "effective duration") of its

bookable assets exceeds the duration of its bookable liabilities. Such an

implication would hold only for infinitesimal movements in r (Kaufman,

1984). The robustness of the coefficient restraint kakl_k suggests instead

that interest-rate variation affects the repayment capacities of banks and

borrowers.

     For medium banks, the valuation ratio also shows a consistently

positive market-sensitivity. During the first two regimes,    is unchanged,

while the increase observed after 1981 is insignificant. The valuation ratio

correlates positively with holding-period yields during each regime, but

after the first switch on 77/2, the coefficient shifts significantly
                                                                          19




downward. In the last 7.5 years of the sample, the effective durations of

bookable assets and liabilities appear to be nearly matched.

     For the smallest banks, the valuation-ratio model works only a little

better than the unbookable-equity model. Prior to the 76/4 switch, market

sensitivity is significant and positive. Once the switch occurs, the model

deteriorates, with no beta remaining significant. Once again, Table 6
portrays the shift as an increase in residual variance.

CpmDprison with Related Studies

    Our   results   help to explain the diversity of interest-sensitivity
estimates reported in previous studies (Lloyd and Shick, 1977; Lynge and

Zuxnwalt, 1980; Chance and Lane, 1980; Flannery and James, 1984; Kane and

Unal, 1988). Market models estimated from CRSP and DRI data show bank equity

returns becoming interest-rate sensitive only after 1979. Prior to 1979,

market-model evidence indicates insensitivity to interest rates. Tables 4

and 5 show that, for all but the smallest banks in our sample, Ue is

negatively and k is positively correlated with cx post bond returns

prior to the first switch and that both coefficients ( and               are


significant. During the 1975-79 period, the impact of the separately

significant fl and      are therefore offsetting. The resulting "tendency to

cancel out" clarifies how researchers could estimate an insignificant

interest-rate beta        for the two-index model with data drawn from this

interval. For the largest and medium-size banks that the cited authors

studied, Uc loses its significant link to bond returns during 1979-85.

Deleting this offsetting force permits movements in r to be dominated by
                                                                            20




movements in $.   Eliminating   this category of revaluation ought to increase

the significance of er'S in a two-index market model.

     Even though both interest-sensitivity terms decline in magnitude during

the late 1970s, the overall interest sensitivity of bank stock need not

decline. A stock's overall interest         sensitivity   reflects   the   net

contribution of both interest-rate betas. For the largest and medium-size

banks, the interest-sensitivity of off-balance-sheet items not only declines

in magnitude but begins a drift to insignificance in 1977. Hence, one cannot

reject the hypothesis that once the shifts complete themselves, the interest

sensitivity of bank stock in these size classes depended entirely on the

interest sensitivity of the valuation ratio.

VIII. Diagnostic Regression Experiments

     Table 7 reports a series of regressions that investigate for the SMVAM

how well our three-way size partition controls for heteroskedasticity and

intrasample differences in k and U. The first panel estimates k and Ue for

the country's nine largest banks. These money-center banks consist of

Citibank and the eight banks that Sinkey (1986, p. 249) reports that its

staff labels as close competitors. Without exception, estimates of k lie

above and estimates of U lie below parallel estimates for the 25 largest

banks reported in Table 1 (often substantially so). The magnitude of these

differences suggests that these giant banks deserve a class of their own and

leads us to ask whether the 16 other large banks might be reclassified into

the medium group. Moreover, the very high k values assigned money-center
banks in the early quarters of our sample are inconsistent with a zero
correlation at these dates between book value and unbookable equity (which

for these giant banks includes the value of numerous affiliates).

    As an alternative to reclassification, the second panel of the table

examines what happens when for the largest 25 banks the flexible form (3) is

respecified as a quadratic equation:

     MV—U +(k+k1BV)BV+eQ.                                (14)

(14) models the valuation ratio k as a function of By. Table 7 tells us that

for large banks k generally increases with bank size; but after 1980 never

significantly so. Substantial bleeding of unbookable equity into k seems to

be limited primarily to money-center banks during 1975-79. Parallel but

unreported runs for medium and small banks reveal different patterns. Medium

banks generally show a negative k1; this coefficient proves significant two-

thirds of the time before 1980 but only one-third of the time thereafter. At

small banks, k1 varies in sign and is almost never significant.

     The third panel of Table 7 estimates the SMVAI4 for the 25 largest banks

after deflating all variables in equation (3) by By. This deflation would

correct exactly for heterosked.asticity if e in (3) were to equal the product

of a random error eD and BV. In any case, the indicated transformation

reweights individual observations, raising the weight of observations drawn

from smaller members of the large-bank sample relative to money-center

banks. Before 1980, deflated estimates of      and k for large banks lie

closer to the undeflated estimates for medium than for large banks. From

1981 on, the deflated estimates for large banks look much like the
undeflated ones. This supports the view that before 1980 the SMVAM should be

estimated separately for money-center banks. Results from fitting the
                                                                           22




deflated    model to money-center banks (not presented here) confirm this. In

the money-center subsample, pre-1980 estimates of k and Ue are broadly

similar to those of the undeflated model. The main difference is that three-

fourths of the Uc estimates become significant at 5 percent. Using this

information to interpret the third panel of Table 7 assures us that deflated

pre-1980 estimates of unbookable equity at the next 16-largest banks would

be positive, with valuation ratios much more like those shown for medium-

size banks in Table 1. Taken together, these sensitivity tests underscore

the value of undertaking pooling tests to partition sample banks optimally.

      We also tested the unit constraint on the lagged coefficients for Ue

and k built into the first-difference specifications (5) and (6). To do

this, we ran unconstrained regressions of Uet and k on their respective

(t-l)—values,            and R over the time span of each regime identified in

Table 2. Only one of the 14 lagged coefficients differs significantly from

unity at 5 percent.

IX.   Directions   for Further Research

      The    reconceptualization     established   in this paper offers four
directions      for    future    research:   sequential   estimation,   model

respecification, sample selection, and data partition. Under the identifying

restrictions and recursive structure employed here, sequential estimators of

U, k and the various betas can be regarded as consistent instrumental-

variable or method-of-moment estimators (Kmenta, 1971, pp. 559-567; Newey,

1984). To the extent that the recursive model is only an approximation or Ue

and k are improperly identified, the estimates of k and Ue employed as input
                                                                          23




into second-round regressions add a measurement error to the model-

approximation errors envisaged in (5) and (6). Although this complication

could be addressed by estimating k, 1e' and the betas simultaneously, this

would greatly expand the parameter space over which costly Goldfeld-Quandt

search routines would have to operate. In our judgment,a more promising

approach is to await the development of    attractive instrumental-variable

equations for the bookable and unbookable components of MV. Given a

specification with less-oppressive identifying restrictions than our own,

the GQRSM procedure could be adapted to explaining time-series observations

for individual banks.

    Model respecifications ought to focus on the possibility of finding

omitted variables and the desirability of disaggregating accounting net

worth into detailed asset and liability components. In principle, one could

expand either stage of the model. Following the lead of arbitrage-pricing

theory, one could expand the set of macroeconomic risk factors employed as

regressors in the second-stage equations. In (3), one might also estimate

distinctive   valuation   ratios   for    different classes of assets and

liabilities. Our own preliminary attempts to make these extensions failed to

improve upon the specifications reported here. It is difficult to expand the

specification without developing a simultaneous-equations model of a bank's

asset and liability decisions. Because existing bank portfolio models treat

banks as enjoying monopoly power in at least some deposit and loan markets,

they are ill-suited to representing the operations of large banks in 1975-

1985. However, one might adapt Goldfeld's (1966) empirical model of bank

behavior to serve this end.
                                                                             24




     At least three sample-selection issues merit attention. First, this

study includes no observations on either mutual institutions or stock

savings-and-loan associations and savings banks. Second, introducing data on

the value of individual HCs' nonbank subsidiaries would sharpen the

interpretation of Ue Third, survivorship bias could be studied by applying

the model to a set of institutions that went out of business between 1975

and 1985.

     Finally, repartitioning our data would let us reinterpret our quarter-

by-quarter models in at least two ways. One     is   to test and correct our
regressions for richer forms of heteroskedasticity. A second is to use

pooling tests for parameter variation to isolate the nature of meaningful

differences in bank behavior. The size breakdown we employ represents a

preliminary attempt at developing interpretable patterns of parameter
similarities and differences, in which the partition itself is not tested

for significance. Investigations aimed at finding optimal pooling procedures

would also track changes over time in the composition of relevant classes.

X. Summary

     This paper combines accounting estimates of a bank's net worth with

capital-market information to estimate a well-interpreted flexible-form

model of the values of the firm's net bookable and unbookable assets. By

permitting regime changes in the valuation models that reset market values

each quarter, our methods provide new insight into changes in: (1) the

market and interest sensitivity of a bank's stock and (2) the impact of off-

balance-sheet positions on bank stock prices.

     Our results show that the interest and market sensitivities of bookable

and unbookable values often prove offsetting in sign. In particular, the
                                                                          25




evolution of the value and sensitivity of hidden capital at the nation's

very largest banks after 1978 is consistent with the hypothesis (Kane, 1985)

that during this period increases in the unbookable value of FDIC guarantees

offset the bulk of market-induced and interest-induced losses on net

bookable assets.
