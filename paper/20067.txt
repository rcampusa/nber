This is the first paper to study the economic effects of drug-trafficking organization violence. We exploit
the manyfold increase in homicides in 2008-2011 in Mexico resulting from its war on organized drug
traffickers to estimate the effect of drug-related homicides on house prices. We use an unusually rich
dataset that provides national coverage on house prices and homicides and exploit within-municipality
variations. We find that the impact of violence on housing prices is borne entirely by the poor sectors
of the population. An increase in homicides equivalent to one standard deviation leads to a 3% decrease
in the price of low-income housing. In spite of this large burden on the poor, the willingness to pay
in order to reverse the increase in drug-related crime is not high. We estimate it to be approximately
0.1%of Mexico’s GDP.

1.   Introduction

Drug production and trafficking are a major problem in many countries. These activities are often
associated with violence, a lack of security and corruption in the police force and in the legal system. In
some countries, the sheer number of killings that take place may have a negative impact on economic
outcomes. In Mexico, there have been more than 50,000 drug-related homicides (DRHs) since 2006,
when President Calderon took office and declared a war on drugs.1 Compared with the deaths occurring
in other recent conflicts, such as the campaigns waged by the Irish National Liberation Army (3,500)2 or
ETA (1,000) in Spain,3 the number of homicides in Mexico is more than an order of magnitude higher. As
a result of this violence, five Mexican cities are among the ten most violent cities in the world,4 and
Mexican citizens consider drug-related violence to be their most important concern.5 Many analysts and
prominent policymakers have estimated that this situation translates into a reduction in GDP of as much
as 1 to 2 percentage points.6Nevertheless, these estimates are more in the nature of guesses rather
than being the result of any rigorous attempt to measure the economic causal effect of drug-related
violence.


To our knowledge, this is the first paper that explores the effect of drug-trafficking organization (DTO)
violence. This is surprising, given that drug policy and its costs and benefits are an issue of concern to
many countries and that DTOs are leading to more killings than many recent wars have. We estimate
the causal effect of violence on house prices by drawing on a unique dataset of house prices compiled
using information on all the houses and apartments that were appraised in connection with applications
for mortgages between 2008 and 2011. House prices are not only important in and of themselves; they
also reflect the (dis)amenities of living in given locations. To measure the causal impact of homicides on
house prices, we take advantage of a rich dataset that contains more than 1.3 million appraisals. These
appraisals are distributed among more than a thousand of the country’s municipalities (out of a total of
2,445) and take various dwelling characteristics into account. For statistics on homicides, we use a
national dataset of deaths (in this case, we focus on murders) collected by the Mexican Federal
Secretariat of Health. The sharp increase in DRHs allows us to identify the causal effects that are of

 Measured as homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, the rates for these five Mexican cities are: Ciudad Juárez: 148, Acapulco: 128,
Torreón: 88, Chihuahua: 83, and Durango: 80. According to the ConsejoCiudadano para la SeguridadPública y la Justicia Penal
(Citizens’ Council for Public Security and Criminal Justice) this put these cities in the top 10 worldwide in 2011.

interest to us here. We contend that the nature of local DRHs is unrelated to local economic conditions,
since they are mainly associated with retaliation killings, battles among drug organizations and clashes
with the Army. We provide some evidence of this in the paper as well.


Our findings indicate that increases in DRHs have a negative effect on house prices, but only in the case
of low-quality housing. In other words, this negative impact on house price is borne entirely by the
poorer segments of the population. Using a partially identified hedonic price equation while
conditioning on municipality fixed effects, period effects, secular trends by type of house and specific
state trends, as well as controlling for a large set of dwelling characteristics, we estimate that one
standard deviation of increase in homicides lowers the price of poor-quality houses by more than 3%. In
light of the Rosen (1974) hedonic prices model, where the price of a differentiated good can be
described by a vector of characteristics, our parameters of interest could be interpreted as the average
marginal willingness to pay for security amenities. Given that many municipalities registered DRH
increases of much more than 100% and that housing wealth is typically the largest source of wealth for
Mexican families and especially for low-income households, the economic costs of this type of violence
could be substantial. In spite of this large burden on the poor, the willingness to pay to reverse the
increase in drug-related crime is not high. We estimate it to be approximately 0.1% of Mexico’s GDP. We
also find that, when the increase in violence is a long-term phenomenon, the negative effects on
housing prices for the poor are about 40% larger. Our results are robust across different sources of data
on homicides.


Our paper is related to that of Linden and Rockoff (2008), Besley and Mueller (2012) and Di Tella et al.
(2010). Exploiting panel data, Linden and Rockoff (2008) find that prices of homes near sex offenders
decline considerably (approximately 4% on average) following an offender’s arrival in the neighborhood.
Besley and Mueller (2012), for their part, examine the effect of violence in Northern Ireland on house
prices. They exploit the spatial and temporal variation in violence and model the transition from
violence to peace with a Markov switching model. They find that peace leads to an increase in house
prices of between 1.3% and 3.5%, with the effect being stronger in the regions where the violence was
greatest.


The findings described in this paper are also in line with those of Di Tella et al. (2010), who, while
studying another environment and type of conflict, also find that violence places a heavy burden on the
poor. These authors exploit the sharp increase in crime seen during the second half of the 1990s and, in
particular, during the year 2001 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Their main research question is whether the
rich or the poor have been the main victims of this rise in crime. In the case of home robberies, they find

                                                                                                         2
that the poor have been the main victims of increases in such crimes but, in that case, the channel for
this effect is the fact that the rich, unlike the poor, are able to protect their homes by hiring security
services and/or installing security devices (see also Levitt, 1999).


The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the political context in which
Mexico has experienced this DRH increase. The datasets employed for crime and housing variables are
presented in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the related literature. Section 5 covers the identification
strategy used in the analysis and the main results. Section 6 presents a battery of robustness checks for
the results discussed in the preceding section. Section 7 explores what happens when violence is
persistent, and Section 8 concludes.


2. Recent Increases in Drug-Related Homicides in Mexico

Drug-related homicides (DRHs) in Mexico started to rise in 2006, and this increase began to grow
steeper in 2008, with the cumulative total climbing to almost 50,000 cases by the end of 2011; by
contrast, during the preceding presidential term (2000-2006), the number of DRHs was below 10,000
(Rios, 2012). Some analysts believe that this sharp upswing is attributable to President's Calderon frontal
attack on drug-trafficking organizations (DTOs), which he launched almost as soon as he took office in
December 2006.7 The hypothesis is that the killings and apprehension of DTO leaders fragmented these
organizations, which split into many different units and began to fight each other to gain control of their
areas of operation (see, among others, Rios (2012) and Guerrero (2011)). Some other analysts claim
that, when the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI, in Spanish) lost the presidency after holding sway
for almost 70 years, there was no longer a single political power to keep the DTOs in check and to strike
deals with them (Astoga and Shirk (2011), Bailey and Godson (2000), and Snyder and Duran-Martinez
(2009)). In addition, some authors contend that the successful fight against drug organizations in
Colombia displaced operations to Mexico and led to increasing violence there as DTOs strove to gain the
upper hand in their new areas of operation (Castillo et al. (2012)).


All these hypotheses are based on reasonable arguments, although it is difficult to disentangle their
effects. In any case, it is well-documented that the increase in violence coincided with the start of the
Army's operations throughout the country (Escalante 2011). Dell (2012), exploiting a regression
discontinuity design applied to close elections, shows that municipalities in which the mayor belonged
to the same party as the President witnessed more DRHs just after the crackdowns in Mexico began. Her
empirical evidence suggests that the violence reflects rival traffickers' attempts to usurp territories after

a crackdown has weakened the position of the incumbent DTO.8 Dell’s (2012) results support qualitative
and descriptive studies which advance the argument that the Mexican government’s anti-drug policies
have been the primary cause of the sharp increase in violence seen in recent years.


Dell (2012) also states that the number of major DTOs had increased from 6 in 2007 to 16 by 2011, with
groups splitting into factions as a result of leadership disputes. The fragmentation of these organizations
and the ensuing struggle for preeminence and territory are, according to this view, the most likely
causes of the increase in violence. According to Molzahn, Ríos and Shirk (2012), of the 50,000 DRHs in
2006-2011, about 35,000 were due to conflicts among DTOs. Castillo et al. (2012) draw attention to the
fact that the violence has been concentrated in municipalities where two or more cartels operate, with
the presence of each additional cartel in a particular location bringing an increase in the homicide rate
of about 100%.


A second probable exogenous shock to the crime rate is related to Colombia´s crackdown on DTOs.
Castillo et al. (2012) exploit drug seizures in Colombia to account for the DRH rate in Mexico, arguing
that these seizures could account for 17% of the increase in DRHs in Mexico.


Regardless of whether the spike in DRHs is attributable to political factors or to the consequences of an
exogenous shock to the crime rate generated by Colombia’s successful war on drugs, it is unlikely that it
was the result of changes on the demand side of the drug market, since most drug demand is external,9
Mexico is the main supplier of illicit drugs to the US, and demand there has not undergone any major or
sudden change during the period in question (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, World Drug
Report, 2011).

One interesting aspect of the situation in Mexico is that the violence tends to be geographically
concentrated (see Figure 1). This may have to do with the localized nature of drug production. Indeed,
Dell (2012) reports that illicit drugs are cultivated in 14% of the country’s municipalities. It may also have
something to do with proximity to transportation routes to the US border and along the Pacific Coast
(Castillo et al. (2012)).

 According to Dell (2012): "Over 85 percent of the drug violence consisted of people involved in the drug trade killing each
other" either as a way of extracting revenge or as a way of expanding their territories. She also notes that the killings are
especially frequent after one side is weakened by government intervention.

 Whereas 14% of Americans have used illicit drugs during the past year (U.S. National Survey on Drug Use and Health), only
1.4% of Mexicans have done so (EncuestaNacional de Adicciones, 2008).

Nevertheless, at the municipality level, we find that the increase in violence was sudden and
discontinuous and that it occurred in different municipalities at different times, independently of the
economic or social characteristics of any particular municipality. Figure 2 shows examples of the spikes
seen in DRHs in two of the most affected municipalities, but these patterns are present in dozens of
others as well.

Given that property crime has not been found to be strongly correlated with economic variables such as
unemployment,10 and in view of the patterns that we have described, it comes as no surprise that DRHs


10
  A typical estimate would be that a one-percentage-point increase in the unemployment rate is associated with a one- percent
increase in property crime (Levitt 2004).
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 5
are not correlated with employment either. This finding will be discussed in Section 5.


Finally, another important fact to note here about DRHs is that they are generally more common in poor
sectors of the population. In their study on a gang of drug dealersin the US, Levitt and Venkatesh
(2000) find that such gangs hire low-income people, almost all of whom earn very low wages. In Mexico,
too, drug dealers are recruited from low-income segments of the population. Proceso, a popular
Mexican news magazine, calls the poor the “stockfeed of the illicit drug industry”.11 Crime gangs have
terrorized the poorest sectors of the population, who live in what has turned into lawless “no man’s
land”. One such example is the town of El Alamillo, Chihuahua.12If drug-related crime is poverty-biased
and occurs primarily in poor areas, then we can expect it to have different impacts on poor and not-poor
populations.This is an important point, since we are interested in the distributional impact of crime.

As one example, in April 2009, there were 13 casualties as a consequence of a confrontation between
army forces and a clandestine armed group in San Nicolás del Oro, a little community in the mountains
of Guerrero that has no telephone service.13 The capacity of security forces to pursue and capture gang
members and to undertake investigations in these cases is significantly limited in situations such as this.
It is also important to note that many drug plantations are located in remote agricultural regions where
crime groups may have the local authorities on their side, as has occurred in the poor region of Tierra
Caliente in Guerrero, where a number of mayors have been arrested on suspicion of cooperating with
organized crime.14



3. Data and Descriptive Statistics

One of the strengths of this paper is the quality of the data on both of the main factors involved:
homicides and house prices. To measure homicides, we use two data sources: one is the data on DRHs
reported by the Office of the President, which are compiled from the registries of several government
ministries in Mexico. The other is the data collected from hospitalization records, which register all
homicide deaths (whether drug-related or not). For house pricing data, we use a house appraisal
database that covers 25 house appraisal characteristics and 1,370,676 valuations. The period for which
pricing data is available runs from January 2008 through December 2011, and our final data therefore
cover exactly that period. A more detailed explanation of our sources is provided later on in this section.

3.1 Crime Data

Our main source of data on homicides is the death certificates prepared by civil servants and doctors.
This dataset contains variables that identify the cause of death, the date of death and the place where it
occurred. The information is centralized by the National Health Information System ("Sistema Nacional
de Información en Salud" (SINAIS) in Spanish). The SINAIS database contains a registry of deaths in
Mexico but does not provide a clear indication of whether or not homicide deaths were related to
drugdealing.


The other source of crime data in Mexico is the Office of the President. In this case, the data is mainly
collected by the police and armed forces. One advantage of this dataset is that it is specifically focused
on drug-related crime. However, mainly because of the time span of data coverage, we prefer the
SINAIS database to the Office of the President's database, since the latter dataset covers a shorter
period: from December 2006 to September 2011. As our estimations run from January 2008 to
December 2011,15 we would be losing the data for just one quarter (from September 2011 to December
2011). However, in this paper we use cumulative homicide rates (for the preceding 6-, 12- and 24-month
periods) as the causal variable of interest, and we cannot obtain the cumulative 24-month rate using the
Office of the President's database for the entire period for which we have data on house prices.
Nevertheless, as can be seen in Figure 3, the correlation between the two sources is almost perfect.
Thus, estimating the effect of total crime or drug-related crime can be expected to generate similar
results. In Section 5.2 we show that the estimates and levels of statistical significance derived from the
two databases are indeed very similar.

  The SINAIS database covers the period from 2002 onward, but we are limited by the housing valuation database, whose
coverage starts in 2008.

3.2 Housing Price Data


By law ("Ley de Transparencia y Fomento a la Competencia en el CréditoGarantizado", 2005), an official
appraisal must be made of property put up as collateral for all collateral-backed mortgages that are
granted by financial intermediaries, and all of those appraisals must be reported to the Federal
Mortgage Society ("SociedadHipotecaria Federal" (SHF) in Spanish), which is a government development
bank. The appraisal has to be performed by an authorized appraiser (designated by the SHF) on the basis
of a very specific, explicit and detailed SHF procedure. According to the applicable rules, the appraisal
must be based on sufficient information concerning at least six transactions involving similar houses on
the local market. Violations of this rule can result in the revocation of the appraiser’s license. Our data
covers all the houses, apartments and other real estate assets that were appraised in connection with a
loan application.

Our data on housing unit appraisals covers the four years between January 2008 and December 2011. In
addition to the price variable - which is our main outcome - the dataset covers a number of dwelling
characteristics, such as: size of the plot, built-up area, accessory areas, remaining life of the dwelling,
age of the dwelling, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, number of parking places, whether
the dwelling is an apartment or a house, its proximity to the city center and a classification of services,
as well as codes for the bank, valuator and municipality. In our main analysis, we retained only those
observations that provided GPS information at the locality level (that is, appraisals in localities identified
                                                                                                                                                     8
by GPS coordinates). The reason for this is that we need to control for the size of the locality, which is
not possible to determine without knowing the exact location of the house. Although we losta
significant number of observations as a result (about 40%), it turns out, as we show in the robustness
checks section, that the results obtained using the entire database and those obtained using the
trimmed database are very similar. Even with the loss of those observations, we were able to draw upon
1,370,676 observations of housing prices and 25 variables for each dwelling.

At this point, it is important to clarify the fact that the house prices in our dataset are not final price
transactions but rather appraisals which are supposed to be based on going market prices in the
relevant neighborhood. A skeptic reader could claim that the appraisal values might not be closely
correlated with market prices. However, we have evidence that shows that appraisal prices are strongly
correlated with market prices. Although we donot have data on market prices for multiple years, we do
have data for the year 2006.16 In Figure 4, we show the distribution of percentage differences between
market and appraisal values (as a percentage of the market price) for the data that we have for the year
2006. The median difference is about 3.5%. We also find that, controlling for city fixed effects, the mean
differenceof appraisal and market prices is close to 0 and that the variability in actual prices explain
about 93% of the variability in appraisal prices. Thisshows that the appraisal valuations are indeed very
close to market prices.




16
 Systematic data on appraisals is available from 2008 on. However, for 2006, we obtained a dataset with a sample of
appraisals (and market prices) of one of the major mortgage lenders (Infonavit), which has a coverage of 50 municipalities (our
dataset covers more than 1,100 municipalities). The dataset does not contain as many housing characteristics as our dataset
does, but the valuation methods are very similar.

3.1 Final Dataset


We merged the two datasets (homicides and appraisals) using municipality and year-month as the
matching variables. The merged dataset comprises 1,370,367 dwellings in 1,165 municipalities (out of a
total of 2,445 in Mexico) on a monthly basis from January 2008 to December 2011.

Dwellings are the main unit of analysis, and we have 25 variables for each of them. Each house can be
associated with the cumulative crime rate for the municipality in which the house is located. On
average, there are 1,176 appraisals per municipality (adding up the 4 years of the sample), 28,549
appraisals for each of the 48 months included in the period of analysis, and 24.5 appraisals for each
municipality-month.17 Table 1 provides descriptive statistics.




17
 We have 48 months and 1,165 municipalities. Thus, we have 55,920 different municipality-months. Each of those
municipality-months corresponds, on average, to 24.5 home appraisals (the observation unit).

Having a dataset that includes a considerable number of dwelling characteristics allowed us not only
to include a large number of relevant controls in our regression, but also to analyze the differential
impacts on house prices for poor and non-poor segments of the population.

Figure 5 sets out the categories of dwellings (low-income, middle-income, high-income, etc.) based
on the quality of their infrastructure. In our sample, 3% of the dwellings are classified as high-
income, 22% as middle-income, 64% as low income and 10% as economical, or poor.1819

In our estimations, we define poor dwellings as those that fall into the "minimum" or
"economical"categories of the appraisal methodology. Poor dwellings, which comprises about 10%
of the sample, has substandard infrastructureand was not built to conform to demanded
architectural plans (these dwellings are usually "informal" constructions). As shown in Table 2, poor
dwellings have fewer bedrooms and bathrooms, are older, smaller, have less useful life remaining,
afford access to fewer services and have general infrastructure of a poorer quality.



18
  This classification is the one used by the Federal Mortgage Society (SociedadHipotecaria Federal) (SHF). Its Intermediate
Category, for instance, corresponds to housing that has rooms that are differentiated by use, such as living rooms,
bedrooms and kitchens. According to this classification, low-income housing is built in groups, with identical prototypes,
but has adequate infrastructure.
19
  There is no straightforward way to compare these housing characteristics to those used in the national census because
the definition of "poor or economical housing" that we use is based entirely on the SHF classification. However, it is
possible to compare a few of the housing characteristics recorded in our database with the census averages. More
specifically, in our data, dwellings with telephones represent 53% of the total vs. 43% in the census results. The distribution
for the number of bedrooms is the following (our data, census data): 1 BR (20%, 35%), 2 BR (53%, 40%), 3 BR (23%, 20%),
4BR (2%, 4%), 5 BR (0.4%, 0.8%) and 6 or more BR (0.2%, 0.3%).

4. Literature Review

There is a quite extensive body of economic literature about crime and its determinants (see Becker
1968 for a seminal paper), much of which has probably been developed in response to the increase
in crime in the US in the 1970s and its precipitous decrease in the 1990s (see, among others, Glaeser
and Sacerdote, 1999, and Levitt, 2004). Empirically, it is fair to say that a large percentage of these
studies have focused on property crime. Levitt (2004) provides a review of the causes of the decline
in crime in the 1990s in the US and documents the fact that, as demonstrated in the literature,
economic conditions --as measured by unemployment or wages-- have little impact on property
crime and virtually none on violent crime. He finds that better policing and higher incarceration rates
are a large part of the explanation for the 1990s crime decline. Corman and Mocan (2000) use a long
time series to study the relationship between homicides and drug use and conclude that they are
unrelated. None of the studies mentioned by Levitt relates to DRHs committed by DTOs.


To our knowledge, Dell (2012) is the first to look at the causal determinants of DTO killings. Her


                                                                                                    13
analysis is relevant here because it shows that, in Mexico in the time period under study,
government-driven policy causally explains the DRH rate without reference to economic causes. She
exploits a regression discontinuity design in mayoral elections and shows that, when a mayor from
the PAN party (the party of President Calderón) wins in a close election, the average probability that
a drug-related homicide will occur increases by 9 percentage points in any given month during the 5
months following the time that the person takes office. Starting from a baseline rate of 5% per
month, this is a huge effect.


The literature regarding the effects of crime on economic activity is much less ample, although
growing. Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) show that, relative to a synthetic control group in the
absence of terrorism in the 1980s and 1990s, per capita GDP in the Basque country declined by
about 10 percentage points. Their study is likely the first to document large macroeconomic effects
of violence.


At a more micro level, we review three widely important papers that are relevant to our study, since
they look at the effect of crime on house prices. The main focus of these papers is the identification
of causal effects of violence, since crime may not be exogenous in an equation of the determinants
of housing prices. One of the first papers to address this issue isthat of Gibbons (2004), who uses
data from London and looks at "criminal damage to dwellings" and its effect on residential property
values. To overcome the potential endogeneityof crime, he uses the spatial lags of crime and the
number of offenses reported in respect of non-residential properties as instruments. He concludes
that an increase of one standard deviation in property damage decreases property values by 10%.


Another paper related to ours is that of Linden and Rockoff (2008), who study the effect of the
arrival of a sex offender in a US neighborhood. They exploit a credible identification strategy by using
panel data on housing prices and comparing them before and after a registered sex offender arrives
at a specific residence. By using detailed location data, they can measure how the effect varies with
distance from the house and find that, although prices of adjacent houses decline by 12%, there is
no change for houses located outside of a 0.1-mile radius of a sexoffender’s residence.


As mentioned above, another related paper has been authored by Besley and Mueller (2012). They
study the effect of peace on housing prices in Northern Ireland in the 1990s after the truce between
the Irish Republican Army and the Loyalists was called. They use within-region variations over time in
conflict-related homicides and a housing price index for 11 regions in Northern Ireland, with
quarterly data from 1984 to 2009. Their study uses murders to estimate a latent Markov process of


                                                                                                     14
peace/violence in which states are defined endogenously, which they then use to construct an
estimate of the present value of deaths as a function of murders for each region. This estimate is
then used in a structural model of the peace process. The structural model has the advantage of
incorporating the persistence of violence into the estimation of its cost. They find that peace leads to
an increase in housing prices of between 1.3% and 3.5%, on average, although the effect is many
times larger in more violent regions. Using a benchmark OLS regression, with region and time fixed
effects (an approach more akin to ours, since, in our case, there are not defined war and peace
states), they find that a one standard deviation decrease in assassinations is associated with an
increase in housing prices of from 0.8% to 1.4%.


Our paper contributes to the literature in several respects. First, to our knowledge, this is the first
paper that explores the effect of DTO violence. This is surprising, given that drug policy and its costs
and benefits are an issue of concern to many countries and that DTOs are leading to more killings
than many recent wars have. DRHs may have a different pattern of effects from those of terrorism,
since they are not committed in pursuit of the political objective of overthrowing a government. One
advantage that we share with Besley and Mueller (2012) is that, in the case of homicides,
measurement error is less likely to be a serious problem than it may be in the case of other types of
crime. Second, our source of variation in violence is disaggregated at the municipality level (we use
1,165 municipalities), allowing us to have better controls for the determinants of crime by using
municipality fixed effects, while at the same time controlling for a large set of characteristics of
individual dwellings. This limits the attribution of changing prices to changes in the pool of dwellings
on sale. Third, and quite importantly, there is substantial variation across time and municipalities in
the timing and the intensity of violence. Spikes in violence are probably uncorrelated with trends in
economic variables, which typically move more smoothly. We identify the effects of violence as
municipality-specific deviations from trends. Furthermore, variation in DRHs is likely driven by
government attacks on DTOs, and we believe this is unlikely to be correlated with changes in house
prices that are not due to the incidence of DRHs. Finally, the data’s geographical coverage gives us
confidence that it has substantial external validity and that it is representative at the municipality
level.


We are able to look not only at the effect of killings, but also at the effect of persistent violence on
housing prices. This is in line with what Besley and Mueller (2012) have done by modeling the peace
process using the history of killings in the region in a Markov switching model. We complement their
findings in the sense that we can also look at the distribution of the effects according to
socioeconomic status, which is a very important policy issue.


                                                                                                     15
It is believed that, as people who are well-off are more mobile and have more resources at their
command that they can use to protect their property, it may be expected that the impact of violence
will primarily be borne by the poor. There is some evidence to support this conjecture: using survey
data from Mexico to assess the level of coercion exerted by DTOs on different groups, Cayeros et al.
(2011) show that the extent of extortion by DTOs is greater among recipients of the Oportunidades
Program’s conditional cash transfers (which are given to the poor). We also find that the impact of
violence on poor people is greater (the decrease in house prices is concentrated among low-quality
dwellings). This is in line with the results of Di Tella et al. (2010), who find that burglaries of poor
people’s dwellings increased by about 50% more than those of affluent people’s dwellings during the
crime wave that hit Argentina in the 1990s and early 2000s. However, the channel through which
this differential effect operates appears to be different. In our case, the greater presence of violence
in poor neighborhoods is what represents a dis-amenity that leads to a sharper reduction in the
price of housing in those locations. In Di Tella et al. (2010), the rich are better prepared to cope with
an increase in crime because they can protect themselves (by, for example, hiring private security)
and, as a consequence, crime is displaced to poorer areas. This is because burglary, ceteris paribus, is
directed towards the rich, while drug traffic activities are conducted by poor people and drug wars
occur in poor neighborhoods. Di Tella et al. (2010) find that burglary rates are much higher among
low-income families but that there is no significant difference in the number of street robberies, an
offense which affects the poor and the rich more or less alike.



5. Econometric Models and Identification Strategy

Our goal is to measure the causal effect of DRHs on housing prices. Simply regressing housing prices
on DRHs is likely to be problematic, since crime is likely to be endogenous. Our identification
strategy exploits the panel structure of our data by conditioning on municipality fixed effects, period
effects and municipality-specific linear time trends. Our basic empirical model is as follows:20


                       (    )                                       (                )                                      (1)




where             is the logarithm of the price of dwelling i in municipality j in month t.                     are the


20
  If we were to use per capita homicides instead of total homicides, we would have to use a linear approximation of the
population based on 2005 and 2010 census data (at the municipality level). This does not make any difference to our
specification, in which we include municipality and period fixed effects, as well as municipality-specific linear trends.

                                                                                                                      16
fixed effects which control for time trends and those differences across municipalities that are fixed
over time. We include a set of 25 dwelling and locality characteristics (                       including indicator
variables for the appraiser and for the banks to which the loan application was submitted.
Additionally, we control for municipality-specific monthly linear time trends (            ).


The causal variable is the cumulative number of homicides in municipality j at time t. The cumulative
number of homicides is the sum of those incidents over the previous 6, 12 and 24 months; these
figures provide a more stable measurement that can then be used to characterize dangerous places
and to take into account potential lags in the effect of crime on housing prices. We do not expect a
short-lived jump in crime (i.e., an increase lasting for just a month or two), even if very large, to
affect housing prices. Longer-lasting changes in housing amenities, on the other hand, are the kinds
of factors that we would expect to be reflected in their prices. Standard errors are clustered at the
level of the municipality.


Equation (1) is a partially identified hedonic price equation that conditions identification on
municipality fixed effects, period effects and specific municipality trends. In light of the Rosen (1974)
hedonic prices model, where the price of a differentiated good can be described by a vector of
characteristics, our parameters of interest could also be interpreted as the average marginal
willingness to pay for security amenities.21


The causal effect of homicides on housing prices is derived from within-municipality variations in
cumulative homicides and housing prices after controlling for a large number of housing
characteristics and other determinants of house price appraisals. In other words, to identify the
effect of interest to us here, we assume that changes in cumulative homicide rates are strictly
exogenous in equation (1).


Equation (1) controls for municipality characteristics fixed over time. For example, local amenities
(such as good schools) may influence housing prices and are captured by the municipality fixed
effects. Secular trends in housing prices associated with changes in macroeconomic or seasonal
conditions are controlled for by the period fixed effects. We also include municipality linear trends in
the model. This allows us to take into account the presence of differential trends in prices across
municipalities due to unobserved local time-varying effects. Finally, we also control for a large set of
observable housing characteristics (as well as characteristics of the bank and individual appraiser


21
 However, see Ekeland et al. (2004) for a very general examination of identification and estimation of hedonic price
models.

                                                                                                                 17
that appraise the house).


The validity of our identification strategy could be undermined if changes in homicide rates are also
driven by economic factors that influence housing prices. This does not seem to be the case,
however. There is evidence that DTOs operate at a regional level (i.e., their area of operations thus
encompasses many different municipalities) and that their behavior is not driven by the economic
situation of the municipality (Dell, 201222), which reinforces our identification strategy.


To provide further evidence that the timing and intensity of violence do not seem to be driven by
the economic situation in a given municipality, we investigate the link between formal employment
and crime at the municipality level. We use a dataset containing a municipality-monthly measure of
all formal employment in Mexico prepared by the Mexican Social Security Institute
("InstitutoMexicanodelSeguro Social" (IMSS) in Spanish) and the SINAIS database on crime.23 Table 3
reports the estimates ofthe following equation for all municipalities for which we have homicide and
employment data:


                       (                 )                                                                                      (2)


The correlation between homicides and employment is not statistically different from zero, which is
consistent with our identifying assumption that the type of crime being analyzed is not related to the
labor market or, more broadly, to economic variables.24




22
  According to Dell (2012): "Over 85 percent of the drug violence consisted of people involved in the drug trade killing each
other" either as a way of extracting revenge or as a way of expanding their territories. She also notes that the killings are
especially frequent after one side is weakened by government intervention.
23
  We would like to thank Judith Frias for providing this data, which is even more reliable than survey data because, since it
comes from a census of the formal employment sector, it is representative at the level of the municipality and has no
measurement error associated with the definition of formal employment.

Another potential concern with regard to our identification strategy, which is common to all studies
that use home sale prices, is that we are only considering houses that have been appraised for sale.
If, for example, richer people who own better houses were to decide to sell their homes so that they
could move away from a high-crime area, and the regression model does not control for that, we
would underestimate the negative impact of violence on housing prices. In order to deal with this
statistical nuisance, we control for an unusually large set of housing characteristics. These
characteristics alone can account for up to 92% of the variation in prices (Table 4) when period effect
and fixed effects by municipality, bank and appraiser are included. This considerably mitigates
concerns about a selection bias being generated by the types of houses that enter the market in
each municipality over time.

Moreover, our sample covers all the appraisals –homes belonging to low-income and high-income
persons – that were done as part of the home mortgage application process. In Mexico, even the
poorer segments of the population apply for and obtain mortgage loans: about 65% of our sample is
made up of loans furnished by Infonavit, Fovisste or Cofinavit, which are government institutions
that subsidize loans for the poorer segments of the population.25 This unique feature of our dataset
allows us to investigate the distributional effect of DRH.


Finally, since we are interested in the differential impact that crime may have on different
socioeconomic groups, we also estimate an econometric specification which identifies the
differential effect of crime on low-quality housing by interacting homicides with a dummy for low-
quality housing. However, there may be factors other than a sudden increase in crime that affect the
poor by driving down low-quality housing values. Therefore, in order not to confuse this differential
effect with a differential secular trend in the price of houses by socioeconomic status, we also
include a differential secular trend for low-quality houses in the model and estimate the following
empirical model:


             (     )                                                                                 +                  (3)

  The Infonavit loan is designed for members of the population who earn less than 6,000 Mexican pesos per month (less
than USD 500).

We find a zero average effect on housing prices (Table 5). However, we do find a negative impact on
the prices of low-quality housing. A 100% increase in homicides is associated with a decrease in
housing prices of between -0.9% and -1.2%, depending on the specification adopted. While Besley
and Mueller (2012) find that a decrease of one standard deviation in homicides leads to an increase
of between 0.8% and 1.4% in prices (when using an OLS benchmark with region and time fixed



                                                                                                                 21
effects), we find a price reduction of between 3% and 4% as a result of DRHs in Mexico, butthis
applies onlyto poor-quality housing.


Our results indicate that violence, as reflected in homicides, has a regressivedistributive effect, since
it affects poorer individuals more than richer ones. These results are consistent with a quite limited
body of existing literature that contends that the effects of crime are different for the rich and poor
and that wealthier people can either flee from violent places or invest in technologies that will
reduce the chances that they will fall victim to crime (see Di Tella et al. (2010) and Levitt (1999)).


The size of the effect that we find is quite large, considering that some municipalities experienced
sharp increases in crime. The reader will recall that the increase in crime that occurred between
2006 and 2011 amounted to a rise of more than 200% nationally. Table 6 shows that the cumulative
increase in crime was above 100% for 48 municipalities and, in some, it was much higher. In
Monterrey, for instance, homicides increased by more than 2,500%, and several municipalities
experienced 10-fold increases. Taken at face value and extrapolating at the national level, our results
would indicate that from 2006 to 2011 housing prices for the dwellings of poor people decreased by
2.5%, while municipalities such as Monterrey had a price decrease several orders of magnitude
larger. Given that their houses are one of the most valuable assets that families possess, especially in
the case of the poor, this decline represents a substantial loss of wealth, and it is a loss that is
concentrated among the poorer segments of the population.


One important welfare calculation that needs to be performed is the computation of the relevant
households’ willingness to pay (WTP) to eliminate the increase in DRHs during the period studied.
Under certain assumptions, the estimate gradient of the hedonic price function provides the average
marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for a change in DRHs. A standard, although ad-hoc, assumption
that is widely used in the literature is to assume that the MWTP function is constant.

The effect of the DRHs on the value of low-quality houses, based on our main specification (6
months cumulative, Table 5), is -0.0121% for each 1% of increase in total crime. Considering that,
according to our data, the average price of a poor-quality house in Mexico is approximately MX$
320,000 (USD 24,000) and crime increased by about 83% between 2008 and 2011, the monetary
impact of crime on an average low-quality house was MX$ 2,700 during the period under study.
According to the last census (2010), Mexico has 28,607,568 houses (with 10% of them being poor-
quality dwellings in our sample). This means that the total monetary effect of crime, measured as its
total impact on houses prices, is MX$ 7,600,000,000(USD600,000,000) in 2008-2011. Therefore, our
calculation of the WTP to revert the increase in violence associated with drug trafficking in Mexico is
quite low, since the households that are most affected by this type of violence are the very poor
households and represent less than 0.1% of Mexico’s GDP. The fact remains that the cost to those
households is relatively large.

This having been said, according to the canonical Roback (1982) model, the full implicit price of an
amenity is the sum of the land or real estate price differential plus the negative of the wage
differential. Appendix Table 15 reports the results of fitting the following wage equation:




            (      )                                                          (            )                 (4)



where           is the monthly wage (or hourly wage, in Table 15) of person i in municipality j during the
period t;        includes controls at the individual level (years of education, age, squared age, gender
and a dummy for low skill levels) and                                 represents the accumulated crime rate in
municipality jfor 2008-2010. The latest available census data for the last two rounds (2000 and 2010)
have been used.26 The model includes year and municipality fixed effects and linear trends at the
state level (          . Tables A and B show the results of our estimations using total monthly wages
(Table A) and hourly wages (Table B). Models 1 and 2 differ in terms of how "low-skilled" is defined:
model 1 uses "secondary incomplete", whereas model 2 uses "high-school incomplete". None of the
models show significant effects of crime for the sample as a whole or specifically for low-skilled
workers.27 Consequently, the above welfare calculations are unchanged when changes in wages are
accounted for.




26
 The results of the 2005 census are available but do not include wage data.
27
 Results are similar if cumulative homicides are not expressed in per capita terms.

                                                                                                           24
6.1 Ancillary Results

We will now present some ancillary evidence to support both our empirical findings and our
interpretation of those results. First of all, we investigate whether the increase in DRH induces
population changes at the municipality level. This is important for the interpretation of the results in
the previous section, and the associated welfare analysis performed. In order to establish whether
or not people move across municipalities as a response to the increase in DRH, in Table 7,we report
the estimates of the following equation for all municipalities for which we have homicide data:


                                                                                                      (5)


where                     is the difference in population between 2010 and 2005 (census data) in
municipality j, whereas                           is the difference in the per capita crime rate in
municipality j for the same period. We tried out different definitions for                     absolute
difference in total population, rate of population growth, rate of growth of total population with no
health-care coverage and rate of growth of total population without sanitation facilities in the
house. Notice that the last twovariables are indicators of poverty. The results support the idea that
crime did not prompt members of either the poor or non-poor populations to migrate from
dangerous municipalities to safer ones.

Second, we show that poor segments of the population have witnessed a stronger increase incrime
in response to the municipality-level incidence of DRHs in the recent past. The evidence that we
provide should, nevertheless, be considered as indicative rather than as proof of a causal
relationship because it is based only on cross-section variability.


To compile evidence relating to the first hypothesis, we draw on data gathered from the 2012
National Victimization and Public Security Survey28 and combine it with the crime data used in our
main econometric analysis. We estimate the following regression model:



                                                                   (                        )                  (6)
                                                        (                         )

parameters of interest are          (association of DRHswith the incidence of victimization) and (                       )
(association of DRHswith the incidence of victimization in the case of poor households).


The victimization survey does not provide information about income. However, it does include a few
questions regarding the employment status and education of the head of household. Using that
information, we constructed the variable                     using the following criteria: a household is poor if
the head is: (i) unemployed and has not completedhis or her high school education (i.e., 6 years of
primary school plus 3 years of high school); (ii)"employed" but with no salary; or (iii) self-employed
and has not completedhis or her high school education.29


Table 8 shows the results for 4 variables related to the level of victimization, by household. These
variables are labeled“insecurity index”, “feel safe at home”,“awareness of drug-dealing”, and
“worried about drug-dealing or insecurity”.30




29
  Although we report the use of one particular criterion to determine poverty status, we tried 5 different combinations of
employment-status and maximum-education of the head of household as criteria for classifying households as poor or
non-poor. The results of the analysis were almost identical, irrespective of the criteria adopted. According to our
classification, about 23% of the households in the survey were categorized as poor.
30
  The "Insecurity index" (from 0 (minimum) to 1 (maximum))measures the proportion of respondents who answered "yes"
to 17 questions concerning the household members’ knowledge about illegal activities in the neighborhood (e.g., "Have
you heard shots near your house?"). "Feel safe at home" measures the proportion who answered “yes” to the question
"Do you feel safe at home?"."Awareness of drug-dealing" measures the proportion who answered "yes" to the question
"Do you know if drug-dealing is going on near your home?". "Worried about drug-dealing or insecurity"(from 0 (minimum)
to 1 (maximum)) measures the proportion of respondents who listed drug-dealing or insecurity as one of their three main
concerns (1 if they did so, and otherwise 0).

                                                                                                                      27

The results are conclusive: for all the considered variables, poor households report a considerably
higher association with DRHs. The association on the insecurity index is about two times greater for
the poor, while the corresponding figure is 65% greater on the "Feel safe at home" and "Awareness
of drug-dealing in the neighborhood" criteria. Moreover, poorhouseholds rank insecurity and drug-
dealing among their main concerns more frequently than non-poor households do; by contrast,
crime does not seem to significantly alter non-poor households’rankings of their main concerns.This
suggests that crime has a large differential effect on poor members of the population in terms of
their perception of the security situation.


Taken all together, this empirical evidence is consistent with our interpretation of our main results,
namely, that DHRshave a disproportionate impact on the amenities available to poor households in
municipalities that are subject to violence-related shocks, and that this tends to depress the prices of
the houses of the poor in those municipalities as a function of the intensity of the crime shock.




31
  The original victimization survey (2012) was based on 83,483 observations. About 12,600 of those observations have not
been included in our analysis because we restrict the sample to the municipalities that have data on crime and on
appraisals. In other words, we restrict the analysis to our main sample. Unfortunately, not all the municipalities included in
our main database are included in the victimization survey. Therefore, the victimization analysis covers approximately 70%
of the municipalities in our main database.

                                                                                                                          28
Finally, additional anecdotal evidence appears to show that the poorest localities tend to have
higher crime rates. Newspaper reports are one indication that DRHs are common in relatively poor
areas of the country. Cities such as Ciudad Mier in Tamaulipas,32Apatzingan33 and other localities in
Coahuila34 are just a few examples. There are at least two forces that further this process. One is
that, as mentioned earlier, crime gangs often recruit their members from the low-income segment
of the population. A second one is that many drug-related plantations are located near poor
localities.


Our data is consistent with the conclusion that, on a per-capita basis, crime rates are higher in
poorer localities. To further prove this, we use data on the socioeconomic status of 4,525
localities.35The MexicanMarketing Association (AMAI)has constructed a socioeconomic classification
for these localities, which have more than 50,000 inhabitants per locality and contain more than
80% of the population of Mexico.36We have calculated the share of the population in eachlocality
that falls into categories AB, C+, C, C-, D+, D and E. Table 9 showsthe estimates derived from the
following regression:


                                                                    ∑
                                                                                                                           (7)


where         represents the proportion of the population corresponding to each of the categories for locality j,

excluding the AB category.                               are the cumulative number of homicides per 100,000
inhabitants in locality jin 2006-2011. We use the localities for which we have data on homicides and
socioeconomic classifications and then cluster errors at the municipality level.


The results are striking: as Table 9 shows, poorer localities do have more per capita homicides than
AB localities. The C- and D+ categories had 436 and 248 more homicides per 100,000 inhabitants

   Localities are subdivisions of municipalities. There are almost 200,000 localities in Mexico, but most are tiny.
36
  Although we have wages data for the years 2000 and 2010 (that we use in a previous section), we cannot use it here
because it is not representative at the locality level. Instead, we use the socio-economic index constructed by AMAI. The
methodology uses variables from the population census to assign a score to households. The variables used are the
following: the number of rooms and toilets, types of floors, if the house has a shower, if the household has a gas stove, the
number of light bulbs, the number of cars, phones and computers, the presence of paid TV, and the level of schooling of
the head of household. The level of crime or homicides is not used in this classification, which dates back to 2008. The
score is then split into the various categories (AB, C+, C, C-, D+, D and E), and each household is assigned to one of these
categories. The percentages of the Mexican population that fall into these AMAI categoriesare 6.8, 14.2, 17, 17.1, 18.5,
21.4 and 5, respectively.

                                                                                                                         29

areas.

In line with this evidence, Figure 6 relates cumulative homicides and the share of the population in
categories C- and D+ non-parametrically. It shows that the relationship is strong and monotonous
even when using the raw data.

6.2 Robustness Checks

In the interest of robustness, we have re-done our main estimations using different data and
specifications, since our main database includes only those houses that can be geo-localized. We
have done this because we think it is important to control for the size of the locality, which cannot
otherwise be determined. To establish that our results are notheavily dependent on the size of the
locality concerned,in table 10 we display the results of our main regressions -equations (1) and (3)-
using the full database (and, thus, not controlling for the size of the locality). The general results are
very similar: the effect is zero for the non-poor dwellings and is negative and significant for the
poordwellings in the specification for 6 and 24 months. The 12-month specification was the only one
in which the total effect for the poor-housing group is not significant at conventional levels of
statistical significance, with a p-value of 0.14.37




37
  Apart from the observations that are not based on geo-localization data, we include about 2,000 observations (0.08% of
the sample)in this specification that identify a given locality but that were excluded from the main dataset because they
seemed to be repeated observations.

    We have also recalculated these estimations using DRHs as the causalvariable.To this end, we have
    drawn on the database of the Office of the President, which as noted above, represents an
    independent source of information. Since DRHs have been the main driver of changes in homicide
    patterns during the period under study, it is to be expected that the use of this variable will yield the
    same correlation pattern as the one derived from the SINAIS database. Since in this case we have a
    shorter time series, we report results only for the cumulative 6- and 12-month DRH rates.

As was to be expected, the results, as shownin Table 11,are almost unchanged. The effect of DRHs is
concentrated among low-income housing, and the reduction in price is about 3% for a one standard
deviation increase in DRHs.


Finally, we estimate our main regression, but without controlling for linear trends at the municipality
level. In our principal specification, we preferred to include those trends to take into account the
presence of differential trends in prices across municipalities due to unobserved local time-varying
effects. In any case, Table 12 shows that the results remain almost unchanged: excluding the linear
trends does not modify the sign or significance of the effects. Therefore, the distributive effects of
DRHsthat we found in our main specification are robust to the removal of the linear trends by
municipality as control variables.

7. The Effect of Persistent Violence

Besley and Mueller (2012) argue that violence affects housing prices and that homicides are an
observable proxy for violence. The distinction turns out to be important: patterns of homicide that
lead to more violence in the future affect housing prices more than short-lived increases in violence.
We now test this prediction using a reduced form model, taking advantage of the fact that the
duration of the violence varied widely across municipalities.


We use four different definitions of persistent violence that reflect the magnitude of the increase
seen in 2008-2011, as well as the changes in the level of violence witnessed in the interim years. To
be considered "persistent", the pattern of homicides must fulfill two conditions: (i) The increase in
crime must have been at least 150% (or 200%) from 2008 to 2011, and (ii) each year, the crime rate
must have been higher than it was the previous year or, at the least, there must have been more


                                                                                                                      34
homicides than there were during the base year (2008). Depending on the definition, there are
about 270 municipalities that are classified as experiencing a "persistent" increase in violence.


We modify the specification for equation (3) to include interactions with a "persistent" increase in
DRHs. Thus, we estimate the following empirical models (7) and (8):


 (    )                                                                                             (7)

                            (               )                                                       (8)




                                                                                                    35
Table 13 shows the effect of persistent violence on housing prices. Columns (1) and (3) indicate the
presence of persistent violence if the homicide rate rose by at least 150% (200% for the other
columns) between 2008 and 2011 and if the homicide count climbed every year or, at the least,
relative to its 2008 level. Our main results hold true: there is no average effect of either short-lived
or persistent increases in crime, on average. These effects appear only in relation to the dwellings of
the poorer segments of the population. As conjectured, the negative effects on prices for lower-
income housing are about 28%-45% larger in situations where the increase in DRHs is persistent than
they are in cases where the increase is short-lived.

  As in the previous section, to show that our results are not heavily dependent on the fact that we exclude the houses for
which there is no geo-localization data from our original database, we ran the regression for equations (5) and (6) with the
entire database (and, thus, without controlling for locality size). AppendixTable 13 shows the effect of persistent violence
on housing prices. Columns (1) and (3) indicate the presence of persistent violence if the homicide rate rose by at least
150% (200% for the other columns) between 2008 and 2011 and if the homicide count climbed every year or, at the least,
relative to its 2008 level. Our main results remain unchanged: there is no average effect of either short-lived or persistent
increases in crime. These effects appear only in relation to the dwellings of the poorer segments of the population. When
using the whole database, the effect of temporal crime has no effect on the value of either the lower-income or higher-
income houses. However, the impact of a long-term increase in crime has 0 effect on the higher-income houses but a
negative and highly significant effect on the lower-income ones. As conjectured, the negative effects on prices for lower-
income housing are about 100%-150% larger in situations where the increase in DRHs is persistent than they are in cases
where the increase is short-lived. This, again, suggests that crime significantly affects the prices of the lower-income
houses when it is long-standing, whereas the higher-income houses donot seem to be affected by long- or short-lived
increases in crime. Definitions of "persistent Increases": Model (1) and (3): (Increase in homicides > 150% between 2011
and 2008) AND (homicides in every year >= homicides in the previous year OR homicides in every year > homicides in
2008).

                                                                                                                         37
8. Conclusion

Crime is a serious social phenomenon that affects the population’s welfare in many ways. Although
it is much more prevalent in less developed countries than in developed ones, the literature on this
phenomenon in the latter is woefully limited. In Mexico, crime has increased sharply in recent years.
In fact, since 2008, more than 50,000 Mexicans have been killed, which is a shockingly high
numbercompared with the deaths occurring in other recent conflicts, such as the campaigns waged
by the Irish National Liberation Army (3,500) or ETA(1,000) in Spain. Although the government and
the private sector are both claiming that this violence is hurting the Mexican economy badly, no
rigorous study has been undertaken in order to support this claim.


We focus on the effect of crime on home prices, which reflect people’s willingness to live in a
certain area, by computing the (negative) value of the dis-amenities of a location. Taking
advantage of the unpredictable nature of drug-related homicides in Mexico, we exploit within-
municipality variation over time and an extensive database on housing prices and
characteristics at the national level. We first show that crime has tended to appear as "shocks"
(or deviations from trend) and, thus, have not been related to economic variables. Second, we
show that crime has in fact triggered a substantial reduction in housing prices, but only in poor
areas: one standard deviation in crime corresponds to a change of about 3%-4% in the price of
poor people’s houses, but does not lead to any change in the prices of houses owned by people
who are not poor. Given that houses are one of the most valuable assets that families usually
have, especially in the case of the poor, a decline of this magnitude represents a substantial loss
of wealth.Crime thus has a regressive redistributive effect. In spite of the heavy burden on the
poor that this represents, the willingness to pay to revertthe increase in drug-related crime is
not high. We estimate it to be equivalent to approximately 0.1% of Mexico’s GDP.



Finally, we also find that, where violence has been persistent (i.e., where there has been a large,
sustained increase in homicides), the negative effects on housing prices in poor areas are 40%
greater than they have been in areas experiencing short-lived spikes in DRHs.Our findings, as
described in this paper, are in line with those of Di Tella et al. (2010), who, in studying another
environment and type of conflict, also find that violence places a heavy burden on the poor and with



                                                                                                      38
those of Besley and Mueller (2012), who find that the advent of peace leads to a significant increase
in house prices and that this effect is stronger in the regions where the violence was greatest.


A plausible interpretation of our results is that DHRsnegatively affect the housing amenities of poor
segments of the population to a disproportionate extent in municipalities that are subject to
violence-related shocks. In keeping with this conclusion, poor households tend to move more often
than non-poor households, and the prices of low-income houses tend to decrease in those
municipalities as a function of the intensity of the crime-related shock. We present evidence that
indicates that crime does in fact have a big differential effect on the poor in terms of their
perception of the security situation. We also show that, although poor and non-poor households
both tend to move more in the municipalities where the increase in crime is the greatest, the effect
is more than 50% greater in the case of poor households. Taken together, the various pieces of
empirical evidence are consistent with our interpretation.
