From Infant to Mother: Early Disease Environment and Future Maternal Health
Douglas Almond, Janet Currie, and Mariesa Herrmann
NBER Working Paper No. 17676
December 2011
JEL No. I12,I14

                                             ABSTRACT

This paper examines the links between the disease environment around the time of a woman's birth,
and her health at the time she delivers her own infant. Our results suggest that exposure to disease
in early childhood significantly increases the incidence of diabetes in the population of future mothers.
The exposed mothers are less likely to be married, have fewer years of education, are more likely
to gain over 60 pounds while pregnant, and are more likely to smoke while pregnant. Not surprisingly
then, exposure increases the probability of low birth weight in the next generation, at least among
whites. Among whites, this effect remains when we control for maternal behaviors as well as disease
exposure. Among blacks, we find that maternal exposure reduces the incidence of low birth weight.
The difference between whites and blacks may reflect a “scarring” vs. selection story; whites who
go on to have children are negatively impacted, while blacks who go on to have children are positively
selected having survived a higher early childhood mortality rate.

       Economists are increasingly interested in understanding the way that early life affects the

future accumulation of human capital. This work has been spurred by research demonstrating

that conditions in early life can have persistent and profound impacts. For example, Currie and

Thomas (1999) use data from the 1958 British Birth Cohort study and find that 4 to 5% of the

variation in employment at age 33, and as much as 20% of the variation in wages can be

predicted using test scores at age 7. Cunha, Heckman, and Schennach (2010) estimate structural

models in which initial endowments and investments feed through to later outcomes; they arrive

at estimates that are of a similar order of magnitude to those of Currie and Thomas. To put these

results in context, labor economists generally feel that they are doing well if they can explain

30% of the variation in wages in a human capital earnings function.

       The literature on early life influences can be broken into several strands. One strand

examines prenatal, or “fetal origins.” This research has recently been surveyed by Almond and

Currie (2011b), and Currie, (2011). A second strand focuses on health conditions in childhood.

This literature is surveyed in Elo and Preston (1992), and more recently, in Almond and Currie

(2011a). Both strands suggest that health in early life has long term consequences on education,

earnings, and on future health. An interesting issue highlighted by Smith (2009) is whether the

effects on employment and earnings work mainly through effects on health, or whether there

might be direct effects on, for example, education. A third strand of the literature asks whether

poor health in the mother can be “transmitted” intergenerationally to the child (c.f. Currie and

Moretti, 2007).

       All of this research has been limited by the lack of comprehensive data that links the

early environment of the mother to her future outcomes and those of her child. This paper

exploits a previously little tapped source of such information: U.S. vital statistics natality and
mortality records. In addition to providing information on infant health, U.S. birth records have

information on a number of outcomes for mothers, such as the presence of health conditions like

diabetes and hypertension, educational attainment and marital status, and behaviors such as

smoking and weight gain during pregnancy. The birth records also contain mothers’ state of

birth and age, so women can be linked back to measures of the disease environment in their state

and year of birth in order to explore the impact of the early life disease environment on future

outcomes.

       We use these data to compare the effects of the disease environment at three different

points in time: the year before the mother’s birth, the mother’s birth year, and the year after the

mother’s birth. Our data allow us to focus on a particularly important population—future

mothers—and to examine the impact of maternal exposure on maternal health, maternal

education and behaviors, and on child outcomes.

       Our results suggest that exposure to disease in early childhood significantly increases the

incidence of diabetes in the population of future mothers. The exposed mothers are less likely to

be married, have fewer years of education, are more likely to gain over 60 pounds while

pregnant, and are more likely to smoke while pregnant. Not surprisingly then, exposure

increases the probability of low birth weight in the next generation, at least among whites.

Among whites, this effect remains when we control for maternal behaviors as well as disease

exposure. Among blacks, we find that maternal exposure reduces the incidence of low birth

weight. The difference between whites and blacks may reflect a “scarring” vs. selection story

similar to Bozzoli et al. (2009); whites who go on to have children are negatively impacted,

while blacks who go on to have children are positively selected having survived a higher early

childhood mortality rate. The rest of the paper is laid out as follows. Section II provides a brief
overview of some relevant background. Section III discusses our data and Section IV provides

an overview of our methods. Section V presents the results, and Section VI concludes.



II: Background

       In this section, we provide a brief overview of some of the literature on fetal origins, the

effects of the disease environment in early childhood, and evidence regarding intergenerational

transmission of maternal health shocks.

    a) Fetal Origins

       The fetal origins hypothesis holds that conditions in utero “program” the developing fetus

in ways that can be manifested in future disease. For example, Barker (1988) argues that

inadequate nutrition in utero leads to metabolic changes that in turn are associated with future

heart disease. From the point of view of economists, an important implication of this literature is

that even conditions that are present at birth reflect “nurture” and its interactions, rather than

“nature” alone.1

       Other research focuses on the possible effects of in utero exposure to diseases such as

influenza. Almond (2006), Nelson (2010), Neelson and Stratmann (2010), and Lin (2011) study

the 1918 flu epidemic and identify the effects using breaks from trend in the affected cohorts

relative to cohorts born just before and after the outbreak. Almond (2006), Neelson and

Stratmann (2010) and Lin (2011) further incorporate geographic variation in the intensity of

prenatal influenza exposure. They use acute respiratory disease mortality (ARD) or maternal

mortality in the location of birth as proxies for the intensity of infection. Identification is aided

by the fact that the flu epidemic was an intense shock of relatively short duration.

1
 For a recent, engaging account of the limitation of the nature versus nurture distinction and in
particular its limited policy relevance, see Manski 2011.
       Almond (2006) and Nelson (2010) show that in utero exposure to influenza has long-

term implications for education and labor market outcomes. The 1918 US cohort had 0.125

fewer years of schooling, earned 5% lower wages, and were 20% more likely to be disabled.

The 1918 Brazilian cohort that was most exposed to the pandemic in utero finished 0.2 fewer

years of schooling, had 20% lower wages, and were 20% less likely to be employed.

       Comparing Almond (2006), Neelson and Stratmann (2010), and Lin (2011) shows that, at

least for years of schooling, the effects of the 1918 influenza epidemic were larger in Taiwan and

the US compared with Switzerland. The US influenza infection rate experienced in the state and

year prior to birth, lead to 0.25 fewer years of schooling and were 0.03 percentage points

decrease in the likelihood of completing high school. On a base high school completion rate of

50.9%, influenza-exposed individuals were 5.89% less likely to complete high school (with

larger estimated effects when national time-series variation is used).

       Kelly (2011) investigates the effects of the 1957 Asian flu pandemic on British children’s

test scores at ages 7 and 11. Using regional variation in the number of pneumonia cases, she

finds that for each 1/1,000 increase in epidemic notifications, test scores decreased 0.15 and 0.10

standard deviations for children ages 7 and 11, respectively. While this paper shows that

influenza exposure in utero affected children’s test scores, it is less clear how these effects map

into adult outcomes Moreover 0.10 of a standard deviation, while comparable in magnitude to

many conventional educational interventions (Dobbie and Fryer, 2011), is quite a small change.

It is possible that the effects of the 1957 flu were smaller than those of the earlier flu pandemic

because of differences across flu strains, improvements in medical care, or changes in the

underlying health of those affected.
       Other work by economists focuses on measures of health at birth, typically birth weight,

and examines implications for future outcomes. For example, Black, Devereux, and Salvanes

(2007) use administrative data from Norway, where it is possible to link birth data to information

about adult education, earnings, IQ, and height (the latter two outcomes being available only for

men). They find that a 10% increase in birth weight would increase future earnings, probability

of finishing secondary school, and IQ by approximately 1%, with smaller effects on height.2

       Health at birth appears to be quite malleable. For example. economists have also been

active in quantifying the negative effects of maternal smoking and drinking on the fetus (Currie

and Gruber, 1996; Evans and Ringel, 1999; Noonan et al., 2007; Currie and Neidell, 2005;

Currie, Neidell, and Schmeider, 2009; Fertig and Watson, 2009; Ludwig and Currie, 2010). For

example, Currie, Neidell, and Schmeider (2009) use confidential data from birth certificates on

1.5 million births in New Jersey between 1989 and 2003 in which births to the same mother can

be linked. They compare births to the same mother in pairs in which the mother smoked during

one pregnancy but not during the other. These sibling fixed effects estimates of negative effects

of smoking on birth weight are smaller than ordinary least squares estimates, but are still

substantial: At the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day (ten), they estimate that smoking

increases the probability of low birth weight (defined as birth weight less than 2,500 grams) by

.018 percentage points on a baseline of .089 (compared to an Ordinary Least Squares estimate of

.067 percentage point increase in low birth weight).

    The introduction of social programs such as the Supplemental Feeding Program for Women,

Infants, and Children (WIC) and Food Stamps in the 1970s (Hoynes, Page, and Stevens, 2009;



2
 Behrman and Rosenzweig (2004) estimate that a 1 lb increase in birth weight leads to 7% higher wages
and 0.66 additional years of schooling. These estimates are based on the within-twin fixed effect
estimator using a sample of twins from the Minnesota Twin Registry from 1983-1990.
Almond, Hoynes, and Whitmore Schanzenbach, 2011) have also been shown to affect birth

weight presumably by improving nutrition, but perhaps also by reducing susceptibility to

disease.3

    b) Childhood Health and Future Outcomes

    One measure of child health that is consistently recorded around the world is infant

mortality.4 While infant mortality is obviously important in its own right, it is also important to

consider because it affects selection into the sample of surviving infants (Almond, 2006;

Bozzoli, Deaton, and Quintana-Domeque, 2009). Selection of survivors affects the estimated

return to health at birth because children in poor health at birth are both more likely to die in

early childhood and to be in poorer health and earn lower wages as adults. Since children who

die are excluded from the sample, the estimated effect of health at birth on earnings is likely to

be biased downward, with the magnitude of the bias increasing in the baseline infant mortality

rate.5 As infant mortality decreases, the estimated return to health at birth increases, and average

outcomes in the population may actually decline as more unhealthy children live to adulthood.

    Infant mortality, and specifically post-neonatal mortality is also used as a marker for the

early disease environment of survivors. The idea is that cohorts that had a lot of infant deaths

from disease, also presumably had a lot of survivors who were exposed to disease. The reason

for focusing on post-neonatal mortality, which is mortality between one month and twelve

3
  Additionally, Currie and Moretti (2003) show that increases in the availability of college education
improved birth weight. Subsequent studies using laws affecting the compulsory schooling of high school
educated mothers have not shown positive impacts on birth weight (Maarten Lindeboom, Ana Llena-
Nozal, and Bas van der Klaauw, 2009; Justin McCrary and Heather Royer, forthcoming). Gabriella Conti,
James J. Heckman, Hedibert Lopes, and Remi Piatek (forthcoming) reconcile these findings using data from
the 1970 British Cohort Study and showing that the women most likely to select into higher education have
higher returns to education in terms of both wages and smoking behavior.
4
  It will, however, be sensitive to the designation of live birth versus stillbirth, see Almond and Currie,
2011a.
5
  This is true when the focus is on mean shifts in the unobserved distribution of health, but not when
mortality changes are due to movements in the infant survival threshold (Almond, 2006).
months of age, is that a large share of mortality among infants under one month is due to causes

which are present at birth and thus reflect many aspects of the prenatal environment (UNICEF:

Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group). In contrast, infectious diseases have historically

accounted for a large proportion of infant deaths after the first month (as they continue to do in

developing countries today). For example, in 1970, 63% of U.S. infant deaths were accounted

for by causes that would have been present at or around the time of birth such as prematurity,

congenital anomalies, birth asphyxiation, and other causes. Of the remaining 37%, 22% of

deaths were due to pneumonia and influenza (Singh and Dyck, 2010). Pneumonia in turn is a

common side effect of diseases such as measles. By 2007, only 1% of a much smaller number of

deaths were due to either pneumonia or influenza.

        Crimmons and Finch (2006) show that childhood mortality is positively (negatively)

associated with adult mortality (adult height) in four European countries for cohorts born in the

19th Century. They posit that the relationship is driven by the prevalence of infections and

inflammations in childhood. Bozzoli, Deaton and Quintana-Domeque (2009) find that post-

neonatal mortality in the year of birth accounts for 30 to 60% of the cross-cohort and cross-

country variation in adult height over the period 1950-1980 in 11 European countries and the

U.S. Height, like birth weight, is strongly associated with adult outcomes (Case and Paxson

2008, 2010; Schick and Steckel 2010; Strauss and Thomas 1998).

       Case and Paxson (2009) consider improvements in infant mortality rates from 1900 to

1950 by U.S. state and find that higher infant mortality rates experienced in early childhood were

associated with cognitive decline among the elderly. This was especially true of early childhood

mortality from typhoid, influenza and diarrhea. Chay, Guryan, and Mazumder (2009) consider
declines in the black-white test score gap, which they link to improvements in black access to

hospitals and reductions in black post-neonatal mortality during late 1960s and early 1970s.

   c) Intergenerational Transmission of Maternal Health Shocks

   While the papers discussed above emphasize the importance of early life health for future

adult outcomes, health shocks in the early life of women may also affect the health of their future

children. For example, Costa (1998) argues that much of the inequality in birth weight observed

over the course of the 20th Century may have been due to differences in mothers’ early health

endowments.

   It has been known for some time from animal studies that environmentally induced changes

in the epigenome can be transmitted from parents to offspring. For example, Stewart, et al.

(1980) starved pregnant rats and found that it took several generations for the descendants of the

starved rats to return to the size of the control, non-starved rats even when all descendants shared

the same diet. Still, people are not rats, so it is necessary to investigate possible intergenerational

linkages using data on human populations.

   Currie and Moretti (2007) look for interactions between maternal conditions and infant health

at birth using a large sample of sisters drawn from California birth certificates from the 1960s to

the 1990s. Birth certificates record the mother’s state of birth. For mothers who were born in

California during that interval, it was possible to go back and find their birth certificates, and to

use information on it to identify mothers who were sisters. Thus, there is some information

about both an infant’s birth weight and the mother’s birth weight, as well as information about

maternal circumstances at the time of her infant’s birth, and at the time of her own birth.

   Sister comparisons using this data set show that a sister born in poor circumstances (proxied

by being born in a poor zip code) was more likely than a sister born in a higher income zip code
to be low birth weight. They also show that women who were low birth weight were more likely

than their sisters to have low birth weight babies and that a woman who was low birth weight

was more likely to “transmit” low birth weight to her own child if she was residing in a high

poverty zip code at the time of the child’s birth. What these results indicate is that like height,

low birth weight is transmissible for reasons that are not purely genetic, since low adult

socioeconomic status appears to compound the negative impact of maternal low birth weight,

and makes it more likely that the child will also be low birth weight.

   Almond and Chay (2006) build on previous work showing that the Civil Rights movement

had a large effect on the health of black infants in some southern states, especially Mississippi,

due to the desegregation of hospitals and increased access to medical care (Almond, Chay, and

Greenstone, 2006). For example, there was a large decline in deaths due to infectious disease

and diarrhea in these cohorts. Because birth records include the mother’s state of birth, it is

possible to identify black women who benefited from these changes (the 1967 to 1969 cohorts)

regardless of their state of residence as adults, and to compare the outcomes of their infants to the

outcomes of infants born to black women in the 1961 to 1963 birth cohorts. The birth outcomes

of white women in the same cohorts are examined as a control. Almond and Chay (2006)

conclude that the infants of black women who had healthier infancies as a result of the Civil

Rights movement and War on Poverty show large gains in birth weight relative to the infants of

black women born just a few years earlier, and that these gains are largest for women from

Mississippi – the most affected state.

       Our study builds on the preceding literature by examining a national sample of women

born between 1961 and 1990; by examining the impact of early disease environment on the

mother’s adult health, socioeconomic status, and behaviors, at the time they give birth
themselves; and by examining the effects of early maternal disease environment on the health of

the infants born to affected women.



III. Data

        Our primary data on outcomes come from the 1989-2006 Vital Statistics natality

microdata, which are derived from the birth certificates collected by the states and filed with the

National Center for Health Statistics. These data provide detailed information on maternal health,

demographics, and birth outcomes for the universe of births occurring each year in the United

States, approximately 3.5 to 4 million births per year.

        Beginning in 1989, the standard birth certificate collected information on whether the

mother had any medical risk factors for the pregnancy, a number of which can be interpreted as

indicators of maternal health. The 1989 revision asked whether the mother suffered from any of

17 different conditions, including anemia, cardiac disease, lung disease, diabetes, genital herpes,

amniotic fluid problems, blood disorders, chronic or pregnancy-associated hypertension,

eclampsia, incompetent cervix, previous large or preterm deliveries, renal disease, Rh

sensitization, uterine bleeding, or other medical risk factors. In 2003, the standard birth

certificate was revised again, and the set of medical risk factors collected was reduced from 17 to

10 and changed; while the 2003 revision continued to ask about diabetes, chronic or pregnancy-

associated hypertension, eclampsia, and previous preterm deliveries, it replaced the remainder of

the conditions on the list with items on other previous poor pregnancy outcomes, previous C-

sections, and infertility treatment.6 Because the timing of the adoption of both the 1989 and


6
  Infertility treatment was counted as two separate risk factors, since it is composed of one indicator for
use of fertility-enhancing drugs, artificial insemination, or intrauterine insemination, and one indicator for
the use of assisted reproductive technology (e.g., in vitro fertilization (IVF), gamete intrafallopian transfer
(GIFT)).
2003 revised birth certificates varied by state, information on medical risk factors are unavailable

for some states during some years of our sample, although reporting of the medical risk factors

we study generally improves over time. Our specifications include fixed effects for the state and

year of the child’s birth in order to capture these differences in reporting over time.7

        We focus on diabetes and hypertension, which previous research suggests may be caused

by health insults experienced in utero or in early childhood. Since chronic hypertension,

pregnancy-associated hypertension, and eclampsia are all characterized by high blood pressure,

we combine them into a single outcome for “hypertension,” which we set equal to 1 if the mother

suffers from any of these conditions; these conditions are all listed under the heading

“Hypertension” on the 2003 revised birth certificate and are primarily distinguished by when

they develop (i.e., before or after 20 weeks gestation) and the presence of other symptoms (i.e.,

protein in the urine and seizures).

        We also analyze infant’s birth weight as an outcome, since it is highly influenced by

maternal health, and has been shown to be a significant predictor of the child’s long-term

outcomes. The child’s birth weight is our primary measure of the extent to which health insults

suffered by the mother are transmitted to the child.

        Along with the medical risk factors for the pregnancy, the natality data also provide

information on the infant’s month and year of birth, parity (birth order), and plurality, as well as

the mother’s race and ethnicity, age (in years), educational attainment, marital status, smoking

behavior, weight gain during pregnancy, and place of birth. For mothers who were born in the

U.S., the data report the U.S. state or territory of birth. Since the data do not include the

mother’s year of birth, we construct this variable using the mother’s age and the month and year

7
  These fixed effects are for the state of occurrence of the child’s birth, as opposed to the state of
residence of the child, since the state of occurrence determines which version of the birth certificate is
used.
the child was born; the mother’s year of birth is constructed as the child’s year of birth minus the

mother’s age minus one if the child was born between January and June, and as the child’s year

of birth minus the mother’s age if the child was born between July and December. This

construction is more likely to match the mother’s actual year of birth than simply using the

difference between the child’s year of birth and the mother’s age, because on average, mothers

are their reported ages plus one-half, and over the calendar year, births occur on average at the

beginning of July.8

        We use mothers’ place and year of birth and race to link them to our measures of the in

utero and early childhood disease environment: the postneonatal mortality rates (number of

deaths between 28 days and 1 year of age per 1,000 live births) in their race and state and year of

birth. These measures of infant mortality also come from National Center for Health Statistics

(NCHS) data. We calculate the number of deaths between 28 days and 1 year for each state, year,

and race using the 1960-1991 mortality microdata, and we obtain the number of live births for

each state, year, and race from NCHS publications for years between 1960 and 1968, and from

the natality microdata afterwards. We focus on death rates for African Americans and whites,

since the “others” have not been consistently identified historically.

        Figures 1 to 5 plot the post-neonatal mortality rates for all, whites, and blacks from 1960

to 1990 for five large states. These figures show that there is considerable variation in both the


8
  To see this, consider the following example of three women born on three dates in 1960: January 1, July
1, and December 31. If they give birth between January and June 1990, when they are the ages of 30, 29,
and 29, our mechanism assigns them the birth years 1959, 1960, and 1960, respectively. Using the
difference between the child’s birth year and maternal age assigns 1960, 1961, and 1961. If they give
birth between July and December 1990, when they are 30, 30, and 29, both mechanisms assign them the
birth years 1960, 1960, and 1961. This suggests that our mechanism is more likely to match the mother’s
birth year. For verification, we conducted simulations using all pair-wise combinations of three years of
birthdays for mothers and three years of birthdays for children. The simulations suggest that our
assignment mechanism matches the mother’s actual year of birth 75% of the time, compared to 50% of
the time for the difference between the child’s birth year and maternal age.
levels, and more importantly for our identification strategy, in the timing of changes in the rates

across states. It is also interesting to note that the peaks (deviations from trend) in the graphs

correspond well to known epidemics, especially of measles. While the trend in measles cases

was sharply downwards after a vaccine was introduced in 1963, there were peaks in the number

of cases nationally in 1962, 1965, 1971, 1977, and 1989-1990 (Wood and Brunell, 1995). There

were also local measles epidemics, for example, in Chicago in 1983 (Bennish et al, 2011).

Epidemics of flu likely also played a role in generating the variation in our data. The tail end of

the “Asian flu” pandemic played itself out in 1963, while there were national outbreaks of

“Singapore flu” and “Bangkok flu” in 1979-80 and 1980-81 respectively (Glezen et al. 1987).

       Since our measures of the disease environment begin in 1960, we restrict our analysis to

white and black women born in the U.S. between 1961 and 1990. We restrict our analysis to first

births since the number of births may be affected by the woman’s health and circumstances (and

we are unable to identify repeated observations of same woman across sibling births). We also

exclude from our analysis women who gave birth before the age of 16 or after the age of 40, and

women who had multiple births, which result in higher rates of health complications.

       After making these sample selections, we aggregate the data into cells based on the

mother’s state and year of birth, age, and race, and the child’s state and year of birth. We

aggregate the data both to reduce the size of the dataset, which is very large, and because

variation in infant mortality rates occurs at the level of the mother’s race, state and year of birth.

Since the availability of our health outcomes varies, we conduct this aggregation separately for

each outcome, and during estimation, weight our models by the number of births in each cell.

       Table 1 provides an overview of our data. Overall, 2.2% of women have diabetes, and

6.5% have hypertension, making these fairly common risk factors for pregnant women. In terms
of behaviors, 7.8% of women gained too little weight (less than 16 pounds), while 2.9% gained

too much weight (more than 60 pounds). A little over 12% of women smoked during the

pregnancy, and 58.6% were married at the time of the birth. The post-neonatal mortality rate

was 4.8 per 1,000 and the incidence of low birth weight in the infants of the sample mothers was

6.8%.

        The next two columns of Table 1 show means separately for women with above the

median post neo-natal mortality rates, and for cells with below the median post neo-natal

mortality rates at the time of their own birth. Women born into areas with below the median post

neo-natal mortality rates have a lower incidence of diabetes and hypertension, and their infants

have better birth outcomes. The women are also less likely to gain less than 16 pounds during

the pregnancy, but more likely to gain over 60 pounds. Given the construction of our sample,

these mothers are younger on average, and are less educated, more likely to smoke, and less

likely to be married at the time of the birth. Thus, they achieve better health outcomes despite

these health behaviors.

        Table 1 shows that there are surprisingly small differences in the incidence of diabetes

and hypertension by race; this may be accounted for by the fact that black mothers are almost

three years younger on average and much less likely to smoke. However, black mothers are

more than twice as likely as white mothers to gain too little weight during the pregnancy, and

their infants are twice as likely to be low birth weight. Black mothers were also exposed to

consistently worse post-neonatal environments: The mean post-neonatal mortality rate for black

mothers was 8.7 per 1000.

        While provocative, these means suggest that it is important to control adequately for the

strong trends in the data that are related to maternal age.
IV: Methods

         To examine the relationship between the fetal and early childhood disease environment

and adult health, we estimate the following linear probability model:

   Yrstcba   PNMRrst   Xrstcba  s   cb   a  rs  t   a * t  rstcba
where Yrstcba is the average outcome for mothers of race r who were born in state s in year t and

who gave birth in year c in state b at age a; PNMRrst is a vector of the post neonatal mortality

rates for infants of race r in the mother’s state and year of birth, and Xrstcba is a vector of control

variables (i.e., fraction Hispanic, fraction Hispanic missing, an indicator for black). The model

also includes mother’s state of birth fixed effects (s), child’s year of birth by child’s state fixed

effects (cb), maternal single year age fixed effects (a), mother’s state of birth linear time trends

(rs*t), linear time trends in the maternal age fixed effects (a*t), and a random error term

(rstcba).

         While there are many possible ways one could specify the vector of post neonatal

mortality rates, we specify it as the race-specific post-neonatal mortality rate for the state in the

year before, year of, and year after the mother’s birth to capture the disease environment in

utero, during the birth year, and in the following year. We estimate models with all three of

these variables, as well as models with one post-neonatal mortality rate at a time.

         The inclusion of mother’s state of birth fixed effects helps to account for any persistent

differences in outcomes between mothers born in different states, and the child’s state by year of

birth fixed effects control for contemporaneous factors in the state that affect all births (such as

the quality of medical care), as well as for reporting differences caused by the staggered adoption

of the revised birth certificates. We include maternal age fixed effects to control for the well-
known relationship between maternal age and health, and include maternal age linear time trends

to allow for this relationship to change over time. We also include mother’s state of birth linear

time trends, so that all effects of the post neo-natal mortality rates, which are falling over time,

are identified from departures from trend, which we think of as corresponding to disease

outbreaks. We cluster standard errors by mother’s state of birth.9

        We also estimate similar models with child outcomes rather than maternal outcomes.

These models are estimated with and without controls for maternal characteristics and behaviors

including smoking, educational attainment, marital status, and weight gain during pregnancy.

These characteristics and behaviors may themselves have been impacted by the mother’s early

life circumstances. When we include them in the model, we are asking whether the mother’s

early life circumstances seem to affect the child through these pathways.10



IV: Results

        Table 2 shows estimates of the effects of the PNMR on the incidence of diabetes and

hypertension among women with first births. In panel 1, the variables for PNMRt-1, PNMRt,

and PNMRt+1 are entered together; panel 2 shows estimates from three separate models, each of

which controlled for one of the three PNMR variables, in each column. Table 1 suggests that a

higher PNMR in the year after birth is associated with a significantly elevated risk of diabetes

overall, and in both white and black women. The estimated coefficient is more than twice as


9
  For computational ease, we estimate this model in two stages: First, we obtain residuals from the
regressions of the outcome or the post neonatal mortality rates on all other control variables except for the
mother’s state of birth fixed effects. Second, we regress the residuals for the outcome on the residuals for
the post neonatal mortality rate and include mother’s state of birth fixed effects and cluster the standard
errors at the level of the mother’s state of birth. We have verified that this approach obtains the same
result as estimating these regressions in one stage.
10
   However, we recognize that we may also have introduced some bias due to endogenous controls, see
Angrist and Pischke, 2009.
large for blacks as for whites. When the three PNMR variables are entered separately, panel 2

shows that the estimated effects are still largest for PNMR in the year after birth, suggesting that

despite the fetal origins literature, the fetal environment offers some protection against the effects

of disease relative to the post-birth environment.

       Relative to the mean prevalence of the incidence of diabetes, these estimates suggest that

an additional post-neonatal death per 1,000 in the year after the mother’s birth is associated with

a 1.8% higher probability of having diabetes during her own first pregnancy at the mean age of

23.7. The elevation in risk is actually much greater for black mothers, who experience a 3.5%

increase in the probability of diabetes during pregnancy for a one unit increase in the PNMRt+1,

compared to white mothers who experience an increase of 1.4% for a one unit increase.

Moreover, Table 1 shows that there is a large difference between the mean PNMRt+1 for whites

(4.0) and the mean PNMRt+1 for blacks (8.4) which suggests that the early life disease

environment increased the probability of diabetes during pregnancy by almost 30% for blacks

compared to 5.6% for whites (to the extent that overall PNMR rate captures a similar

pathophysiology as deviations from state-specific linear trends).

       Table 3 examines the effects of the early disease environment on measures of the

mother’s socioeconomic status and behaviors. This table is striking in that a worse disease

environment in early childhood predicts uniformly worse outcomes. Moreover, unlike Table 2 in

which only exposure in the year after birth seemed to matter, Table 3 suggests that exposure in

the year before birth and the year of the birth also matter, at least for some outcomes.

       On average, an increase of one death per 1,000 in the year of birth or the year after

reduces educational attainment by about 0.1%; reduces the probability that the mother is married

at the time of the birth by 0.6% and increases the probability that the mother smoked during
pregnancy by 2%. We interpret the lower education, lower probability of marriage, and the

higher probability of smoking as indicators of lower socioeconomic status, suggesting that

exposure to disease in infancy reduces adult socioeconomic status.

       An extra death per 1,000 in the year after birth is also associated with a 1.7% higher

probability of weight gain over 60 pounds during the pregnancy. It is possible that this reflects a

biological mechanism of the sort that Barker discusses though it may also reflect behavior. Note

that weight gain during pregnancy tends to be negatively correlated with pre-pregnancy weight,

so that women who are overweight to begin with often put on less weight (Lin, 2009). Since

women of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to be overweight, the increased probability

of high weight gain does not suggest a simple relationship between early disease environment

and lower future socioeconomic status. Weight gain over 60 pounds is associated with a higher

risk of diabetes and hypertension during pregnancy, as well as with a higher probability of

complications of labor and delivery.

       As in Table 2, the percentage changes implied by the Table 3 coefficients are larger for

blacks than for whites: An extra post-neonatal death in the year after birth reduces education by

0.1% for whites compared to 0.2% for blacks. Comparable figures for other outcomes are: 0.9%

for whites compared to 1.3% for blacks for marriage; 1.7% for whites compared to 2.2% for

blacks for weight gain over 60 pounds; and 1.3% for whites compared to 3.4% for blacks for

smoking during pregnancy.

       Table 4 shows the estimated effects of the mother’s early life environment on the

probability that her child is low birth weight. In these regressions, the coefficients on PNMRt-1,

PNMRt, and PNMRt+1 are seldom individually statistically significant. However, F-statistics

indicate that the three variables are jointly significant. Moreover, the coefficients on the three
variables are similar to each other, suggesting that exposure to disease at any point in the

mother’s early life is equally likely to lead to negative consequences for her child.11

        Overall, an extra post-neonatal death in the year after birth (for example) is estimated to

increase the probability that the offspring is low birth weight by 0.6%. For whites, the

corresponding estimate is 0.5% while for blacks it is actually -0.1%. Viewed on its own, this

pattern of positive effects on low birth weight for whites and negative effects on low birth weight

for blacks might suggest that whites were “scarred” by exposure, but that the most impacted

blacks were selected out of the sample of future mothers altogether. This story would be similar

to the Bozzoli et al. scenario in which adults from developed countries who were exposed to high

post neo-natal mortality rates as children are short because they are scarred by the experience,

while adults from less developed countries who were exposed to disease are tall because they are

the survivors. This could be true even though, as we have seen, those black women who do go

on to give birth appear to be more negatively impacted than white women, as scarring and

selection effects need not be uniform across different dimensions of health.

        Panel B of Table 4 show the same models controlling for the maternal characteristics and

behaviors examined in Table 3. The estimated coefficients on the PNMR variables remain

jointly significant and positive for whites, though the magnitude is slightly reduced. For blacks,

the estimated effect is still negative, and is larger in absolute value. What this suggests is that

even within groups defined by education, marital status, and so on, exposure to high post-

neonatal mortality rates in early life reduces the probability that those black women who would

be most at risk of having low birth weight babies go on to have (live-borne) children.


11
  For a child who was born in January of year t, the disease environment in t is likely to be a better
measure of the disease environment in early life than the disease environment in year t+1, whereas the
opposite is true for a baby born in Dec. Hence, the results regarding the timing of the health insults are
subject to error and must be interpreted with caution.
VI. Discussion and Conclusions

           We investigate the connection between early life health, future socioeconomic status,

future health, and the health of future offspring. Although post-neonatal mortality rates around

the time of the birth are crude measures of early life health, our estimates tell a consistent story.

We find that women who were exposed to higher post-neonatal mortality rates in early life are

more likely to have diabetes when they give birth to their own children. They are also less

educated, less likely to be married, more likely to smoke while pregnant, and more likely to gain

over 60 pounds during the pregnancy. These effects are present for both white and black

women, but are larger for black women. To the extent that some women are sufficiently

negatively impacted that they never give birth, these estimates are likely to be underestimates of

the true negative impacts.

           We also find some evidence consistent with intergenerational transmission of the health

shocks. Among whites, mothers who were exposed to high post-neonatal mortality rates in early

life have infants of lower birth weight. Among blacks, women from cohorts with higher

exposure are less slightly likely to have low birth weight infants, which might reflect selection

effects.

           Overall, our estimates suggest that the disease environment in early life, as proxied by

departures from state- and race-specific post-neonatal mortality rate trends, has long lasting

impacts which are felt in multiple aspects of a woman’s life. This suggests that life trajectories

are malleable but in perhaps subtle ways: There can be lag of 20 years or more between

improvement in the early childhood health environment and its manifestation in maternal health,

and indeed on the initial health of the next generation.

Notes: All coefficients and standard errors are multiplied by 1000. These regressions were estimated using
race-age-child birth year-child state of birth-mother state of birth-mother year of birth cells and are weighted
by the number of births in each cell. Specifications include controls for black, Hispanic, missing Hispanic,
child state of birth by child's year of birth fe, mother state of birth fe, mother's age fe, mother's age by
mother's birth year linear time trends, and mother's state of birth linear time trends. Regressions in the
second panel control for mother's education, marital status, smoking behavior, excessive or inadequate
weight gain during pregnancy, and whether any of these maternal behaviors are missing. Standard errors (in
parentheses) are clustered by mother's state of birth. The significance level is * p<0.05.
