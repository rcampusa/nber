                                           ABSTRACT

        What accounts for the diversity and limited concentration that has long characterized the
organization of the advertising agency industry? This question is addressed by treating an
advertising agency as a multiproduct firm. The firm's product line or service mix is defined in
terms of the set of different media categories where an agency places the advertising messages
which it creates on behalf of its clients. Evidence is presented indicating that the structure of
demand and costs in the advertising agency industry conforms to the conditions that MacDonald
and Slivinski (1987) showed were required for an industry to sustain an equilibrium with
diversified firms.
        Building on this framework, we formulate a set of three hypotheses relating to the
realization of product-specific scale and scope economies. The first two hypotheses posit that
given low fixed costs and minimal entry barriers, both media-specific scale and scope economies
are available and can be exploited by relatively small-size agencies. The third hypothesis
suggests that large agencies may experience diseconomies of scope as a consequence of excessive
diversification induced by two pervasive industry institutional phenomena: (i) "bundling" of
agency services to match client demand for a mix of media advertising; and (ii) "conflict policy
which prohibits an agency from serving competing accounts and operates as a mobility constraint.
        Utilizing a multiproduct cost function, we estimate media-specific scale and scope
economies for a cross-section of 401 U.S. agencies in 1987. The results obtained support the set
of three hypotheses outlined above.
        The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of these findings for the
restructuring currently underway in the industry wherein strategies favored by major agencies a
decade ago are now being reversed or drastically revised. In particular, theresurgence of interest
in small agencies and the trend away from the longstanding reliance on fixed commission rates
as the preferred method of agency compensation are in line with our findings on the presence of
size-related cost economies. Furthermore, the abandonment of "one stop shopping' and the
"unbundling" of the traditional mix of services are interpreted in light of institutional practices
which may influence decisions relating to agency efficiency and diversification.

                      by Alvin J. Silk and Ernst R. Berndt

                            I. INTRODUCTION

      Host of the large body of theoretical and empirical studies of advertising

has tended to focus on issues relating to the amount firms expend for

advertising, and the effects those outlays have on the behavior of consumers and

competitors.1 As Caves [1986] has discussed, sellers' decisions about the

information they supply are influenced not only by the demands of buyers, but

also by the costs and technological capabilities of alternative channels and

media available for transmitting messages. However, economic analysis of the

costs and organization of the production of advertising has been meager at best.

      Sellers typically "buy" rather than "make" the services required to

produce and disseminate their advertising messages; the principal suppliers of

those services are independent advertising agencies. An advertising agency

generally serves a number of clients for whom it creates and places advertising

messages in various communication media. In terms of the basic functions

performed, the nature of the services agencies supply has undergone little

change since early in the century. Pope 11983, p. 143] has shown that "the

evolution from space broker to advertising creator to marketing advisor was

quite swift" and that by the early 1920's, the modern "full service agency" had

become the predominant organizational form within the industry. However, over

time as new communications technologies were introduced, agencies broadened the

composition of their output to encompass an ever-expanding array of print and

broadcast media alternatives (Beniger [1986]).

      In this paper we seek to address a recurring, yet largely neglected

question concerning the advertising agency industry, namely, what accounts for

the diversity and limited concentration that has long characterized the

organization of this industry?
 ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                      -
                                                                     Page 2 -
       Our approach here is to treat an advertising agency as a multiproduct
                                                                             firm
 where its "product line" or service mix is defined in terms of the set of

 different media categories where an agency places the advertising messages which

 it creates on behalf of its clients. We
                                            present evidence indicating that the

 advertising agency industry possesses a number of the characteristics that

 MacDonald and Slivinski [19811 have identified in their model of multiproduct

 firms as those which give rise to a competitive equilibrium with diversified

 firms --   namely, free entry, low fixed costs, and demand unevenly distributed

 across products. Moreover, we identify two additional phenomena that

 significantly impact market structure. The first is an industry norm know-n as

 "conflict policy" which bars an agency from serving competing accounts. We

 argue that this policy functions as a mobility constraint (Caves and Porter

 [1977]) that induces growing agencies to diversify into new types of products,

rather than to expand in existing ones. The second noteworthy attribute of this

industry is that clients generally advertise simultaneously in several media;

accordingly, advertising agencies typically "bundle" their services.      Together,
the joint presence of media bundling on the demand side and conflict policy on

the supply side constitute institutional constraints than induce firms to

diversify more extensively than might otherwise be cost-justified. These

considerations naturally lead to a set of hypotheses relating the realization of

scope and scale economies to the size and product mix characteristics of

advertising agencies.

      Utilizing the multiproduct agency cost function developed by Silk and

Berndt [1993], we obtain estimates of product-specific scale and scope economies

for a cross-section of 401 US agencies. Our results indicate the presence of

substantial scale and scope economies for all categories of media output

investigated, and wide variability among agencies in terms of realizing these

economies. Consistent with our hypotheses, we show that this   cross-sectional
  ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                        -
                                                                        Page 3 -
  heterogeneity   in product-specific scale and scope economies is related to

  overall agency size and product-line diversification.
                                                             Moreover, we report
  evidence of excess diversification consistent with the
                                                             existence of conflict
  policy operating as an institutional mobility barrier.

       Our paper proceeds as follows. In Section II we summarize and analyze

 evidence bearing on the salient features of the
                                                     advertising agency industry,
 including possible sources of economies of scale and
                                                          scope. In Section III we
 review MacDonald and Slivinskj's [1987]
                                             theory of the equilibrium structure of a

 competitive industry with Inultiproduct firms, and relate    it to the advertising

 Industry. Following that, we review theoretical foundations      for the measurement
 of various size-related scale and scope economies in the context of multiproduct

 cost functions     This theoretical basis enables us to formulate a set of

 hypotheses which can be investigated
                                         empirically. In Section IV we discuss data

 sources and measurement issues, and then in Section V we present empirical

 findings. The implications of our findings for
                                                    understanding market structure
 in the advertising agency industry are the focus of Section VI, Concluding

remarks, Caveats and suggestions for further research are given in Section VII.

                       II. THE ADVERTISING AGENCY BUSINESS

      2.1 Industry Market Structure

      The structure of the advertising
                                          agency business has long been

characterized by two significant features:     (a) a relatively low level of

concentration and (b) marked diversity among firms with respect to both the

size and composition of their outputs.

      In 1977, the share of total U.S.
                                         receipts (gross income) earned by all

agencies which were captured by the largest 25, 100 and 500 firms were 34 91,
 ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                                 -           1   -
                                                                                Page
 49.6% and 62.0%, respectively. The comparable figures for 1987 were 33.8%,

 49.1% and 60.9%. respectively.2 Thus, the same low level of concentration was

 maintained over the decade 1977-87. This stability is noteworthy inasmuch as

 the mid-1980's was a period when takeover activity within the
                                                                           advertising

 industry aroused considerable concern and controversy, especially a wave of

 mergers and acquisitions involving some of the largest US agencies (Miliman

 [1988)).

       According to the definitions and counts found in the 1987 Census of

 Service Industries (US Bureau of the Census [1989], Table la), there                  were 11,606

 advertising agencies (firms) operating in that year. As indicated by the

 concentration levels noted above, the vast majority of these             agencies were very
small operations -- 52.3%
                          of the agencies operating the entire year in 1987 had

gross incomes of less than $250,000 (roughly equivalent to billings of $1.67

million for ad production and media time and space charges) and 77.3% had fewer

than ten employees (U.S. Bureau of the Census [1989], Tables 4a and Sa, pp. 1-

154 and 1-155, respectively).

      The U.S. advertising market consists of two segments of almost equal size,

differentiated by the geographical scope of the advertisers'             operations:
"national" vs. "local" (Owen and Weldrjian [1992],         pp. 11-14). Approximately 55%

of total U.S. advertising outlays is accounted for by national advertisers who

spend large budgets in media reaching for a broad, national audience                   (e.g.,

network television and magazines). The other 45% is accounted for by local

advertisers, primarily retailers, who serve geographically limited markets and

utilize media with suitably targeted audiences (e.g.,           newspapers, and spot radio
and television)     The presence of numerous local advertisers located throughout

the economy supports a diverse array of small, independent and geographically

dispersed agencies. This condition also allows new firms to enter the field on
 ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS HIJLTIPRODUCT FIRMS                    -
                                                                    Page 5 -
 a limited scale and to shift their clientele base over time from local
                                                                        to

 national advertisers (Rothenberg (1991]).

       The principal services that agencies supply to their clients are those

 associated with the planning of campaigns and the creation, production and

placement of advertising messages in different communications media.      As show-n

by Schmalensee, Silk and BoJanek (1983] and as will be demonstrated further

below (Appendix B, Table Bl), agencies differ considerably in regards to the

size and composition of their product lines. The latter is manifested in how

the volume of advertising an agency produces is distributed across various

communications media. Overall, then, the supply of agencies available      to serve

U.S. advertisers is not only abundant in terms of numbers, but also

heterogeneous in terms of the scale and scope of their operations.

      in line with this market structure, competition
                                                        among agoncios for clients
is intense (Goldman (1992]). The uncertainty surrounding agency-client

relations is a pervasive feature of the advertising industry. A study conducted

by the American Association of Advertising Agencies [1985) among 335 of its

member agencies found that new clients acquired in 1984 represented the

equivalent of 17.6% of all clients served in the previous year, while client

losses during 1984 accounted for 13% of those served in the prior year. The

median length of all the agency-client relationships in which this sample of

agencies was involved was 3-4 years.

      In selecting a new agency, clients often invite a numer of agencies to

compete for the assignment and then employ a multi-stage screening process to

arrive at a final choice. Advertising performance is difficult to evaluate and

agencies have traditionally competed for accounts on the basis of reputation for

creativity, service capabilities, and location.

      There has been a longstanding debate within the industry as to whether the

creative quality of the advertising produced by an agency is related to the
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                      -
                                                                    Page 6 -

agency's size, with many believing the relationship is an inverse one
 (Micklethwait [1990], p. 4; Sloan [1992]). As discussed further below, agency

operations involve few fixed or sunk Costs and in general, the absence of entry

 (or exit) barriers facilitiates the birth of new firms and serves to enhance

competition among agencies (Marshall [1988]). Data reported in the 1977 and

1987 Census of Services indicates that over this period, the number of agencies

(firms) operating in the US rose from 7,633 (U.S. Bureau of Census [1977], Table

4, p. 1-99) to 11,606 in 1987, an increase of 52.1%. Thus, over the 1977-87

decade, the supply of agencies available to serve advertisers appears to have

grown faster than the level of national advertising expenditures in real terms

(42.1%) .

      Finally,   for decades, it was standard practice for clients to compensate

their agencies via a flat 15% commission tied to the amount the client expended

on media time and space. While studies conducted by the Association of National

Advertisers among large national advertisers in 1986 and 1989 indicate that

reliance on the 15% rate has diminished somewhat over time (Association of

National Advertisers (1986]; Weilbacher [19891), the commission system continues

to be the dominant mode of agency compensation and the larger the advertiser,

the greater the utilization of commissions rather than fees.

      2.2 Demand for Asency Services

      Campaigns undertaken by advertisers typically call for the development and

placement of advertising messages in a number of different types of media.

Given differences in advertisers' target markets and the composition of

audiences for various media, the mix of media selected to deliver advertising

messages will tend to vary across industry sectors or product categories. To

show the extent of this variability, we examined the 1987 media allocations made

by the 200 leading US national advertisers operating in 31 different product

categories. The data covered seven major classes of media (newspapers,
 ADVERTISING ACENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRES                     -
                                                                    Page 7 -
 magazines, outdoor, network television, spot television, network radio, and
                                                                             spot
 radio). As a measure of the extent to which a given advertising
                                                                    expenditure is

 unevenly allocated across the set of media classes, we computed the value of the

 Herfindahl Index, H (H —      S where Sj is medium j's share of total

 expenditures) for each of the 31 product categories. Note that if some

advertising outlay were spread equally across all seven media classes, the value

of H would be 0.143. In fact, we observe that the median value of H for        the 31

categories is 0.317, with the range being from 0.209 to 0.724, indicating

considerable inequality in advertising outlays across media. The     significance
of this phenomenon becomes apparent when examined in light of a special type of

mobility constraint placed on agencies concerning which clients they may serve.

      Specifically, an important influence on Competition among agencies for

clients is the industry's norm on "conflict policy" which
                                                            essentially prohibits
an agency from serving competing accounts (American Association of Advertising

Agencies [1979]). Although agencies create and produce advertising, the

standard contractual arrangements stipulate that the property rights to this

advertising belong to the advertiser (Weilbacher [1991), chapter 13). In

addition to controlling the advertising itself, advertisers also seek to

maintain the confidentiality of strategic information which its agency obtains

in the course of working together. Hence, the purpose of the conflict policy

norm is to prevent the unauthorized leakage of propriety information. While       the
definition and interpretation of competition is often a matter of dispute

between agencies and clients, adherence to the conflict norm is the general

practice of the industry4 (Sinian [1989]). Therefore, in order to add non-

competing accounts, an agency must expand the range of product categories or

industries it serves, and so the larger the agency, the more diverse its product

account portfolio.5 Moreover, as discussed further below given product category
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRNS                         -
                                                                       Page 8 -

differences   in the mix of media demanded, growth in agency size will typically

also entail greater diversity of media outputs.

      2.3 Agency Cost and Organization Structure

      The sources of potential economies of scale and scope in advertising

agency operations may be traced to features of their cost and organizational

structures. As suggested by the oft-repeated saw that "an advertising agency is

nothing but people" (Mayer [1959], p. 74), the fixed component of agency costs

is relatively small as the principal expenses associated with agency operations

are labor-related charges. Studies show payroll, bonuses, profit-sharing, and

employee benefits average about 60-65X of an agency's gross income (American

Association of Advertising Agencies [1987], p. 13 and McDonald [1989]). Agency

employment levels are notoriously sensitive to changes in economic conditions

and client turnover.

      Agencies typically employ some form of matrix organization (Comanor, Mover

and Smiley (1981]; McNainara [1990]). Such a structure reflects the division of

labor occurring within an agency involving specialization along two dimensions:

(a) function or task, e.g. ,   creative,   production, media, research and/or client

contact; and (b) type of output, differentiated on the basis of communication

medium, e.g., broadcast, print, direct response, promotion, public relations.

These patterns are displayed in Figure 1.



                       INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE




      While structured into departments corresponding to the basic functions an
agency performs for its clients, an agency deploys its professional personnel in
account teams, each of which is staffed by a group of functional specialists and

assigned to serve a specific client.
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                          -
                                                                        Page 9 -
      These basic features of agency operations -    - labor   intensiveness and

matrix organization -- embody various aspects of shared costs, specialization

and imperfect divisibility of inputs that are phenomena generally identified       as

the antecedents of scale and scope economies. To illustrate, experienced

industry practitioners have observed that the size and composition of an account

team required to serve a client tends to remain relatively fixed over a

considerable range of variations in the size of accounts, as measured by the

amount a client expends for media time and space (Weilbacher [1991)). In a

similar vein, an agency's costs of performing certain functions may vary by

medium because media differ with respect to their divisibility and minimum

transaction size (Poltrack [1983], Porter [1976]).

      While these phenomena bear directly on a number of controversial industry

issues such as the economic rationales for merger and acquisitions, and agency

compensation methods, they have not been subjected to a great deal of systematic

empirical study. Recently, however, Silk and Berndt [1993] reported results of

an econometric study which showed that Llobal scale and scope economies play a

major role in determining agency costs. As elaborated below, hero we extend

that work to investigate product-specific scale and scope economies.

      Clearly, clients' demands for agency services reflects the mix of media

employed to satisfy their campaign goals. The presence of economies of scale

and scope in jointly producing and placing advertising for that mix of media

suggests a plausible rationale for advertising agencies operating as

aultiproduct firms who are capable of efficiently supplying the set of media-

related services demanded by clients. We now briefly review some relevant

economic theory and relate it to advertising agency operations.

               III.   THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC ThEORY OF MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS

3.1   Market Equilibrium with Multioroduct Firms

      The nature of competitive equilibrium and market structure in the context

of multiproduct firms has received relatively little theoretical attention and,

to the best of our knowledge, hardly any empirical examination. Here we wish to

focus on how the (apparently stable) structure of the advertising agency

industry is affected by technology, demand, and institutional mobility

constraints. As we shall now see, it is useful to begin by summarizing the

theoretical results reported by MacDonald and Slivinski [1987] --      hereafter,   MS.

      MS consider a two-product market model in which firms can either

specialize (produce only one good) or diversify (produce both goods). The

structure of the industry in competitive equilibrium is shown to take one of

three forms:     (i) all firms diversified, none specialized; (ii) all firms

specialized, none diversified; (iii) diversified firms and only one type of

specialized firm operate contiguously. Which of these three equilibria occurs

depends on costs and demands.

      Specifically, when the fixed costs of diversified firms are sufficiently

low, a diversified equilibrium will obtain. Moreover, in a diversification

equilibrium, all firms will be identical in their output mix ("politically

correct diversification"). For intermediate values of the fixed cost, the mixed

outcome with only one type of specialized firm (producing, say, good j) is more

likely when demand is skewed toward good j, and is more likely to be a

diversified equilibrium when demand is symmetric. The extent of demand skewing

required to generate the mixed eqilibrium is smaller, the larger is the

diversified firm's fixed costs. Finally, in the mixed equilibrium with

diversified and only one type of specialized firms, the specialized firms play

an "industry fringe" or buffer role, absorbing all variations in demand for the

good they produce.

                                                                       Page 11 -

      It   is useful to relate the MS results to the structure of the advertising

agency industry, as described in Section II, and to the empirical estimates of

global scale and scope economies reported in Silk and Berndt [1993].

Specifically, the fact that concentration is relatively low and that there are

thousands of fins in this industry in the US is consistent with the evidence

cited earlier indicating that fixed costs do not constitute an effective barrier

to entry. The implication of this set of conditions is that scale economies can

be realized at relatively small levels of output. Furthermore, the fact that

almost all fins in this industry are multiproduct rather than single-product

firms (86% of the sample of agencies discussed below produce six or more

outputs) suggests that the incremental fixed costs of being diversified rather

than specialized are not substantial, and that economies of scope can also be

realized and exploited by relatively small-sized firms. Finally, since the

pattern of diversification is non-uniform across firms (about 19% of the

agencies in our sample produce six outputs, 23% produce seven outputs, 26% eight

outputs, and 18% nine outputs), the existence of a diversified equilibrium

suggests that demand skewness may have a significant impact on industry

structure. In particular, as noted in Section 11.1, small advertising agencies

tend to play a fringe role in the national advertising market by serving

geographically-specific niches.

      In addition to these traditional cost and demand factors facing the

advertising agency industry, the existence of an institutional norm constraining

mobility behavior - -   namely,   the aforementioned "conflict policy" may generate

further incentives to diversify. To see this, recall that as discussed in

Section 2.2, within any product category or industry, empirically it is the case

that advertising expenditures tend to be unevenly distributed across media

categories. Moreover, and very important in our context, this media skewness

varies markedly across industries and their products. If an advertising agency
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODIJCT FIRMS                   -
                                                                  Page 12 -

wishes to expand, it is therefore much more likely to find a conflicting client
within its existing set of media than it is by expanding into other media.

Hence, by adding another media to its service mix rather than expanding within

current media, an advertising agency is more likely to find a client in an

industry different from those industries already being served, i.e., to find a

non-conflicting client. This suggests, therefore, that in order to mitigate the

adverse effects of client conflict conventions, the larger the size of an

advertising agency, the more likely it is to expand its mix of media beyond that

which is strictly cost-justified.

      In this paper we will analyze empirically the relationships among scale

economies, scope economies, and firm size in the advertising agency industry.

We will also examine whether measures of scope economies suggest that these

conflict conventions have impacted costs in a negative manner. To undertake

such an analysis, it is first necessary to formulate a model in which these

concepts are clearly defined. To that we now turn our attention.

3.2   Models of Scale and Scope Economies

      In order to understand better the implications of scope and scale

economies for industry structure, it is necessary to define more rigorously the

notions of global economies of scope and scale, and in particular, to

distinguish these notions from product-specific economies of scope and scale.

We begin with the overly simplified single-product of conventional economics

textbooks, in which the average cost function is approximately L-shaped, with

average cost approaching an asymptotic lower bound as a scale-related Z variable

approaches infinity. A reasonable specification for a cost function having such

a shape is:

          u — a +   flea,                                                       (1)

where U is a measure of average cost, Z is a scale-related variable, and a,

and y are (assumed positive) parameters. This function is illustrated in Figure
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                                  -
                                                                                  Page 13 -

scale in many industries (Johnston [1960, Ch. 4)),6

        Given positive values of the parameters, Eq. (1) postulates that U is an

everywhere-decreasing function of Z, implying there is no finite Z at which

scale economies are entirely exhausted. Note that as Z -.              ,U       -.   a.   One can say

that scale economies are essentially exhausted for a firm of size Z if U(Z*) —

(l+E)a,   where      is a small number. Solving for Z, we obtain an indicator of

minimum efficient scale as:

             Z — -(l/'y) ln(a€/fi),                                                               (2)
where   we might set —         .01, so   that a scale of Z   corresponds to Costs one

percent   above the asymptotic minimum.
        Instead of assuming that firms produce but one product, we now become more

realistic and consider a firm producing N different outputs or services. In

this case Eq. (1), with j subscripts everywhere, refers to the unit Cost of the

    th service product where the unit cost term U is re-defined as total costs

divided by gross income (Y). Multiplying by the revenue share Si and su1ming,

we can obtain the basic equation for long-run costs as:

      Depending on the specification, Z can take on alternative functions of all

the output levels. In Silk and Berndt [1993], a variety of formulations of the

Z scale variable were considered, both theoretically and empirically. In the

most general version of their preferred cost specification, the scale variable

for each service product is simply the overall size of the th agency, measured

by gross income Yj, where i —                       and Yjj is the ith firm's gross income from

medium j:

                       _l.J

where the Uj are assumed to be normal disturbance terms with all the usual

desirable properties. Silk and flerndt reported that in the preferred empirical

model, the parameter restrictions                   — -3r and   —   fi, j — 1       N, were imposed.7

Hereafter we incorporate those parameter constraints.

      The above formulation of a multiproduct cost function accommodates global

economies of scope. To see this, recall that what global scope economies refer

to is the cost savings to a firm from producing N multiple services, rather than

splitting the firm up into N smaller firms, each specializing in producing one

and only one service output.8 More specifically, let C be total (not average)

costs, and define total costs CSplit for the notional split-up multiservice firm

as the sum of costs from producing each of the N services at N distinct single-

service subsidiaries (where subscripts now refer to products or services, not

firms):


                         —                     +                    +'''+ C(O

Total    costs for the multiproduct firm        jointly   producing all N outputs are

— C(Y1,Y2,... •N• Global returns to scope (RSP) are then simply computed as

the percent cost savings due to producing outputs jointly rather than

separately, i.e.,


                                  - CJoint
                RSP —                                                                       (6)
                              joint


Hence, when global RSP     are positive, Cjj1 <                   and there are cost

advantanges to being a multiproduct firm,          deriving   perhaps from specialization

and the joint utilization of shared inputs. When RSP are zero, no such cost

advantages emerge, and if RSP were negative, the firm could reduce its costs by

splitting up. The fact that it is rare for an agency to create and place

advertising in a single medium suggests that RSP are available.9

         The scale and scope cost function presented in Eq. (4) allows for non-zero

global scope economies. Noting that Sjj —            1   for the firm producing only the

output, that for such firms

On the other hand, since Sij —
                                      Yjj/Yj     YS1i —    Yjj   it follows that for the

specification in Eq. (4), Cjoit equals:

        Before distinguishing global from product-specific economies of scope, we

briefly consider measures of scale economies. In a model with multiple service

outputs, the traditional measure of returns to scale is ambiguous. To see this,

recall that in the case of a single product firm, the traditional measure of

returns to scale is •the ratio of average cost (C/Y) to marginal cost (BC/BY).

In the multi-service case, however, the notion of average cost is not well-

defined (by which output does one divide total costs?), and product mix could

change with overall size (by how much does one change the various outputs?).

There are several ways to overcome this problem.

        First, one can define a returns to scale notion as that based on the

effects on total costs when all services are increased proportionately, i.e.

holding service output mix constant. This concept is called global or ray-

returns to scale (overall size expands on a linear ray in output space; see

Bailey and Friedlaender 11982]). In our context, define global or ray returns

to scale          as the ratio of average to marginal cost for            where       —

jYjj,    holding service output mix fixed:



                           RRS —    C/Yi                    —                             (10)
                                    ac/BY           5ij —   5ij

For the cost function in Eq. (4), ray returns to scale turn out to be:

         An alternative measure of scale economies that is very useful in the

context of multiproduct firms is that of medium-specific scale economies; it is

due to Bailey-Friedlaender (1982, p. 1030J. For output j, medium-specific

returns to scale, SCL1j1 is defined as the ratio of average incremental cost,

AICij. to marginal cost, MCij:

                 SCLij —   AICij/MCij.                                                                (12)

where average incremental cost is defined as the incremental average cost of

adding a new product j to a firm previously having only N-i product lines,

                 AICij —   (C(YiN)    -
                                            C(YiNj)]/Yij                                              (13)

where C(YiN) is the total cost to firm i of producing all N outputs and

C(YjNJ) is the total cost of producing all N outputs except output j, and

where MCij is defined as the traditional MC1j —                                           For the

quantifies global scale economies as all N outputs are increased by the same

proportion, product-specific scale economies, SCL1 based on Eq. 14 computes

scale economies assuming that the amount of output j is increased from zero to

some finite number, while all other outputs are held fixed. Hence, while RRSi

is computed as ACj/MCj. SCLjj —   AICjj/MCjj.
      For our purposes, it will be informative to calculate product-specific

scope economies for firm i, which we denote as SCPjj. The intuition behind this

calculation is to quantify cost savings for producing output j        jointly       but

incrementally (given production of the N-j other outputs) compared to producing

output j separately. Note in particular that the cost comparison here is not as

dramatic as that for global scope economies (unless there are only two outputs,

in which case global and product-specific scope economy measures are identical);

here we examine a more "marginal" situation in which a firm considers adding one

more product to its existing set of products, and determines whether it is more

cost effective to produce it within the firm or to produce it via a subsidiary.

In particular, the firm is not considering the possibility of producing all its

products in separate subsidiaries.

      Following Wang and Friedlaender [1985, p. 253] , one can therefore define

product-specific scope economies as:




      SCP —
               C(Y1) -   [C(Y N - C(Y '     1
                                                                                            (15)
         ij              C(YjN)



where C(Yjj) is the total cost of producing Yjj separately, and C(YjN) and

C(Yi,Nj) are, respectively, total costs when all N, and all N except j,               outputs
are produced jointly by firm i. Thus Eq. 15 represents the percent Cost               savings
(dissavings)   realized by producing output j jointly, rather than separately.

For the inultiproduct cost function of Eq. (4), product-specific scope economies

turn out to be (see Appendix A for a more complete derivation) ,       where    j         k and

      Although Silk and Berndt [1993) did not consider of Iroduct-specjflc scale

and scope economies, they did report estimates of 1oba1 scale and scope

economies. In terms of scale, Silk-Berndt reported that the minimum efficient

size agency had gross income of $3.-4 million (equivalently, billings of $20-27

million). Thus of the almost 12,0000 firms comprising the industry in 1987,

approximately 200-250 had operating levels sufficiently large to take full

advantage of all available size-related efficiencies; these 200-250 firms

accounted for about 57% of total industry output (gross income). For firms

operating at only 50% of minimum efficient scale, however, the cost penalty was

substantial --   varying   from 8 to 15%, depending on the medium. Thus, while

potential global scale economies are important, they have been exploited by a

large number of firms. With respect to estimated global economies of scope,

Silk-Berndt reported that the sample median cost savings attributable to joint

production were about 26%. Further, although global scope economies were

exhausted for the very largest firms, scope economies were of considerable

consequence for smaller agencies in that their Costs were highly sensitive to

the mix of media services provided.

      With this as background, we now ask: What should one expect in a

competitive equilibrium in terms of product-specific economies of scope and

scale? First, it bears noting that the existence of a diversified equilibrium

in the advertising agency industry is not necessarily inconsistent with the

presence or absence of global economies of scope, since that concepr refers to

an "all or nothing" total cost comparison involving totally integrated vs.

totally atomistic product line production.
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                     -
                                                                   Page 20 -

     However, we would expect that at the margin, any multiproduct firm would

not expand products into the region of negative product-specific scope

economies, for another firm could enter without producing that product line and

would therefore not experience that cost disadvantage. Hence, in a competitive

equilibrium, we would not expect product-specific scope economies to differ

substantially from zero. A similar line of reasoning suggests that we should

also expect that in a competitive equilibrium, product-specific scale economies

would be exhausted as well.

      Recall from our earlier discussion that there are two reasons we might

expect to find product-specific diseconomies of scope. First, as discussed in

Section 2.2, the typical advertiser usually places advertising in a Set of

media, and hence an agency must supply a bundle or mix of media services

simultaneously. lJnbundllng would impose transactions costs on the advertiser

(see Teece [1982)). Second, as also discussed in Section 2.2, in this industry

we observe the presence of a very special institutional mobility constraint in

the form of conflict policy, which essentially prohibits an agency from serving

competing accounts. With conflict policy, firms face incentives to expand by

diversifying into other product lines.

      In suaary, together the joint presence of media bundling on the demand

side and conflict policy on the supply side constitute institutional constraints

which may give rise to cost inefficiencies such as diseconomies of scope.1°

Having discussed and rigorously defined the concepts of product-specific

economies of scale and scope, we can now formulate three hypotheses about the

nature of size-related economies in the advertising agency industry:

(1) Product-specific scale economies can be realized at relatively low levels of

output. The argument underlying this prediction is that fixed costs are low and

do not constitute an effective barrier to entry.   (ii) Product-specific

economies of scope can be realized and exploited by relatively small-sized
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                           - Page 21 -

firms.     This proposition follows from our conjecture that the incremental fixed

costs of being diversified vs. specialized are not substantial.         (iii) The

larger the size of an agency, ceteris paribus, the more likely it is to expand

its media mix beyond that which is strictly cost-justified (into the region of

negative product-specific economies of scope), in order to mitigate the adverse

effects of client conflict strictures. As argued above we expect this to

occur, since given product category differences in media mix, the existence of a

conflict policy induces agencies that seek to grow to diversify their product

mix rather than to expand existing product lines.

         We now describe our data base, and then present empirical evidence on

product-specific economies of scale and scope.



                 IV. DATA BASE DESCRIPTION AND VARIABLE DEFINITIONS

         The data base we utilize in our empirical study consists of a set of 1987

operating results for a cross section of 401 agencies compiled by Advertisint

    [1988). The sample contains a broad distribution of agencies of different

sizes serving a diverse body of clients by producing advertising for

dissemination through a wide variety of media)-1 A noteworthy feature of the

data collection procedure was that participating agencies were asked to submit a

statement signed by an independent accountant verifying the data report.

         The definitions of the variables and measures employed in our analysis are

as follows:

                      Y — agency   gross income for U.S. operations (10
                            millions of 1987 dollars).

                       E — agency  employment in U.S.   operations   (nwnber
                            of employees in 1987).

                      U — E/Yl03    or number of employees per $100,000
                            of 1987 gross income.

                       Sj — share of an agency's billings volume derived
                            from output j, where j — 1     8 represent
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                     -
                                                                   Page 22 -

                         alternative media categories and j—9 denotes
                         billings and/or capitalized fees derived from
                         all non-media specific services.

                    Yj — Sj "1 — estimated gross income from output j

      An agency's gross income is best interpreted as the equivalent of the

usual accounting definition of "gross margin" or the difference betweeen sales

receipts and cost of goods sold. Cross income Y for US operations of firm i

(in tens of millions of 1987 dollars) is computed as the sum of revenues it

receives from (i) commissions earned from purchases of media time and space made

on behalf of clients; (ii) markups on materials and services purchased from

other suppliers and then charged to clients; and (iii) fees paid by clients for

agency services in addition to or in lieu of the aforementioned commissions and

markups. Within the industry, gross income is often used in analyses of agency

"productivity" and is regarded as the preferred measure of agency size or output

because it is more meaningful for comparative or cross sectional analysis than

other indicators such as billings volume or capitalized billings, the latter of

which may give a misleading picture of output or scale due to variations across

agencies in media and service mixes and compensation methods (Gardner [1976] and

Paster t1980]).

      As a proxy for an agency's average cost Uj, we employ "number of employees

per hundred thousand dollars of gross income," and thereby implicitly assume the

absence of systematic cross-sectional wage differentials. As noted earlier,

studies indicate that labor costs (payroll, bonuses, profit-sharing, and related

employee benefits such as insurance and retirement), typically acount for about

two-thirds of an agency's total expenses. Given the reasons discussed above for

preferring gross income over billings as a measure of agency output, it is also

advantageous to measure unit cost by the ratio of employees to gross income

rather than "employees per million dollars of billings".
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIL'RODUCT FIRMS                        -
                                                                       Page 23

           The data reported in Advertising Age [1988] encompassed billings in

fifteen distinct media categories. We have combined some of the minor media to

arrive at a set of nine separate categories: network television (TVL),
                                                                                 spot

television (TVH), general magazines (MOL), specialty print (PTH), newspapers

(NPH), direct response (DRH), radio (RDH), display (DSP) and non-media services

(XM). "Display" is an aggregation of four small media types: outdoor, point of

sale, transit, and special events. The "non-media" share of billings

encompasses a broad spectrum of services, the composition of which may vary

across agencies. Included here are ad production and specialized services or

projects such as marketing research, public relations, and sales promotion.

Further discussion of the measurement issues posed by the heterogeneity of this

category is given in Silk and Berndt [1993].

       The share of an agency's billings volume in each media/service category,

S ,   is   assumed to be an unbiased estimate of the share of its gross income

attributable to that category of output. It is worth noting that this

assumption is strictly valid only if the ratio of gross income to billings is a

constant for all categories of output within each agency (but not necessarily

fixed across agencies). As discussed by McNamara ([1990], pp. 140-141), while

margins may vary among accounts served within a particular agency (according to

client size and method of compensation), in general clients tend to favor

constant margins across media in order to remove any incentive for the agency to

favor one medium over another. Unfortunately, the information required to check

this condition directly is not available.'2 Given data on Y and S for firm 1,

we therefore compute estimated gross income from output i,     Yj as Yjj     —    Sij.Yj.
       The data utilized here do not include results for international

activities. Subsidiaries and conglomerate agencies were treated as distinct

firms. In the case of ten "mega-agencies," the results for their subsidiaries

were excluded from the parent firm data in line with the information on these

Appendix A).



                               V. EMPIRICAL FINDINGS

        In this section we present estimates of medium-specific scale and scope

economies for our sample of 401 agencies, calculated using the parameter

estimates from our preferred unit cost model Eq. (4). For each agency, we

computed the values of SCLij and SCPij. the indices of product-specific scale

and scope economies defined above in Eqs. (14) and (16), respectively, for all

of the media categories (j —     1,.. .9)   where the agency's output was nonzero.

These two equations are highly nonlinear functions of agency-specific variables

(media shares and gross income) and the estimated parameters. Note that one

parameter, a
                -- the   asymptotic unit cost of the jL1    media (employees per

$100,000 of gross income) -    - plays   a critical role in these scale and scope

calculations. In Silk and Berndt [1993] a variety of test results were reported

involving the aj parameters; the preferred specification restricted several of

these aj'S to be equal across subsets of the nine media. In particular, for

network television, spot television, general magazines, and specialty print, a —

0.74; for newspapers and direct response, a — 1.32; for non-media services, a —
1.57;   and for radio and display, a —      2.17.13
Civen these differences in the a's, we therefore expect associated variability

in the mean levels of scale and scope economies across media.

        5.1 flediuzu-SDecific Scale Economies

        In Table 1 we present summary statistics for the set of medium-specific

scale estimates. In line with the nature of our model specification which

posits unit cost to be an everywhere decreasing function of output, we find

empirically that the values of virtually all of the scale economy indices exceed

                                                                      Page 25 -

unity,    signifying that to varying degrees, the costs of agency operations in

different media categories are subject to increasing returns to scale.



                           INSERT TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE



      Within   each   media category, the distribution of scale economies is fairly

symmetric,   as evidenced by the fact that differences between the means and
medians   are quite small. Thus, the agencies active within any particular media

cateogry tend be highly diverse with respect to operating efficiency as judged

by the extent to which they are able to realize potential scale economies. This

confirms the diversity we expectedJ4

      Comparing the values of the medians (or means) in Table 1 across media

categories, we observe that scale economies tend to be least exploited for the

set of four media categories consisting of network television, spot television.

general magazines and speciality print; here the median values of the index of

scale economies are quite high, ranging from about 2.6 to 2.8. Realization of

scale economies is somewhat greater for newspapers and direct response (SCL = 2)

and is most prevalent for radio and the two hetereogeneous categories, "display0

and non-media services; here the median SCL's are in the vicinity of 1.4 to 1.6.

      In order to examine whether this marked variability is consistent with our

hypothesis that product-specific scale economies can be realized at relatively

low levels of output, we examined the relationship between scale economies and

agency size by regressing our measure of scale economies, SCLij on the

logarithm of agency gross income and a set of additional descriptor variables

that capture the basic features of an agency's outputs. Note that the intlusion

of these other variables in addition to size enables us to control for the

impacts of the covariates also affecting measures of scale and scope in Eqs.

(14) and (16). Results from these regressions are presented in Appendix C.
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MIJLTIPRODUCT FIRMS
                                                              -
                                                                  Page 26 -

      Based on the parameter estimates of these regressions, we calculated the

predicted economies of scale as a function of agency size and the other

variables, where all other variables were evaluated at the sample median. Next

we compared the measure of predicted scale economies for two different agency

sizes: an agency whose size equalled the sample median ($3.2 million of gross

income), and a smaller agency only one-half that size. We then computed the

percent difference in the predicted scale economy index, which may be

interpreted as the percent loss in efficiency by being 50% smaller than the

median-sized agency. If this percent difference is very small, then that would

suggest that product-specific scale economies could be attained by very small

agencies, and that even if one were only half the industry norm, most scale

economies could be exploited. We find that these percentage efficiency losses

are indeed very small. In particular, they range from 1.35% for display

advertising to 4.77% for magazine advertising.

      We conclude, therefore, that our first hypothesis is supported by the

empirical evidence, i.e., product-specific scale economies can be realized at

relatively low levels of output.

       5.2 Medium-Specific Scope Economies

       Summary statistics for our measures of product-specific scope economies

are given in Table 2. The first noteworthy feature of these results is that the

median value of the scope economies index for each of the nine media categories

is approximately zero, signifying that the typical agency active in any of these

domains is operating in a manner such that it has essentially already exhausted

the available economies of scope. An implication of these results is that, for

the typical agency active in any media category, there does not appear to be a

discernible cost advantage associated with producing one mote category of media

advertising, given the joint production of the remainder of the typical agency's

media mix.
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MIJLTIPRODUCT FIRMS                      -
                                                                     Page 27 -

      However, as was the case with scale economies, within each of the media

categories, the importance of scope economies appears to vary substantially

across agencies. The range of estimated scope economies coefficients is quite

broad (especially for network and spot television and non-media services) and

encompasses both positive and negative values in all nine media categories.

Furthermore, the distributions of the scope indices tend to be noticeably skewed

in the direction of negative values. Thus, we find that although some agencies

realize a substantial cost advantage through the joint production of the mix of

media advertising they supply (SCPj > 0, economies of scope) for many other

agencies there appears to be a pronounced cost disadvantage associated with

producing their mixes of media advertising jointly, rather than dropping one

media (SCPj C 0, diseconomies of scope).



                           INSERT TABLE 2 HERE




      A clearer picture of the cross-category variability with respect to scope

economies may be obtained by examining the percentages of agencies operating in

each media category for whom joint production of that output is more efficient

than producing it separately from the other components of the media mix--i.e.,

the percent of agencies for whom SCPij >   0.    As can be seen from Table 3, those

percentages range from a low of approximately 50% (network and spot television)

to highs of 78% and 85% for the direct response and display categories,

respectively. These results are clearly consistent with our second hypothesis,

that scope economies were available and could be exploited by relatively small-

sized firms.

       Concerning our third hypothesis and possible evidence for excess

diversification, note that within each of these media categories there are, in

varying numbers, agencies whose operations are subject to some measure of
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS HULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                          -
                                                                        Page 28 -

diseconomies of scope and who, as a consequence, might achieve Cost savings by
reducing output and consolidating their media mixes. Recall from our earlier

discussion that the existence of product bundling on the demand side and

conflict policy on the supply side could lead firms to undertake excessive

diversification.

      To Investigate this hypothesis, we regressed the measure of scope

economies on the logarithm of agency size and the saaie set of agency descriptor

variables used In the above scale economy analyses. The results of these

regressions are presented in Appendix C.     Consistent with our hypothesis, scope

economies were found to be negatively related to agency size, ceteris paribus.

Hence, together the result in Table 2 that anywhere from only 15% to as much as

52% of agencies were operating in regions with product-specific diseconomies of

scope, and the finding that scope economies and size are negatively related,

provide clear support for our third hypothesis: the larger the size of the

agency, ceteris paribus, the more likely an agency is to expand its media mix

beyond that which is strictly cost-justified.



                                VI. DISCUSSION

      The advertising agency business is presently in an unsettled state as the

advertising industry as a whole struggles to adapt itself to changing economic

conditions and the onslaught of new communications technology (Mayer [19911:

Sellers [1993)). As a senior executive of one major agency put it, "The

traditional agency as we have known it will not exist in the next five years.

We're going to see an Incredible amount of change. .   . for   the first time in five

decades there is a reinvention of the industry as we know it" (Wells and Sloan

[1993b, p.   28]).
      The fundamental strategic issues facing agencies are essentially the twin

questions of scope and scale: (i) What mix of services should be offered
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS MULTIPRODUCT FIRMS                          -
                                                                        Page 29 -

clients?   and (ii) How large should an agency be? Our   analysis       of agency cost

economics bears on several contemporary developments relating to these

questions, and below we consider the implications of our findings for the

direction restructuring may follow.

      Significantly, the dominant strategies favored by major agencies a decade

ago are now being abandoned or drastically revised. In the 1980's, a decline

occured in the share of marketing budgets allocated to traditional mass media

advertising by many large firms. At the same time, spending for consumer and

trade promotions rose and the utilization of other modes of marketing

communications such as direct response grew with the diffusion and application

of information technology (Business Week [1991]; Jones [1993]).           In response,

numerous agencies expanded the range of services they offered, often through

mergers and acquisitions, increasing both the scale and the scope of their

operations (Miliman [1988]; Vinski [1991]).

      However, beginning in the late 1980's and continuing to the present,

aggregate spending on media advertising declined in real terms, driven In part

by the prolonged recession in the U.S. economy [Jones [1993]). Faced with a

mixture of adverse cyclical and secular conditions, the agency business has now

entered into a period of experimentation. A variety of alternative strategies

and structures have been proposed and introduced. These involve basic shifts in

agency scale and scope, and represent a reversal of developments in the prior

decade.

      First, there is a resurgence of interest in sma1l" agencies (Sloan

[1992]). In the past few years, a substantial number of cases have been

reported wherein major advertisers have switched from very large to small or

medium sized independent agencies -   -a   noticeable departure from the traditional

pattern of large clients preferring to work with large agencies (Goldman 11991)

Sloan [1992]). Furthermore, some of the largest conglomerate agencies have
ADVERTISING AGENCIES AS ?{ULTIPRODUCT FIRMS
                                                                  -
                                                                      Page 30 -

themselves established small "spinoff" or satellite agencies, intended to match
the service offered by small independents where clients perceive they can obtain

superior creative work and more attention from senior agency personnel (Landler

[1993]; Wells and Sloan [1993b].

      Our   findings   provide underpinnings to help understand these developments.

We find that both the scale and scope economies available in producing various

categories of media-related services can be largely realized at modest levels            of

agency size as measured by gross income. In particular, our results provide a

basis for answering the question of how small can an agency be without suffering

a serious loss in efficiency?

      In our earlier work (Silk and flerndt [1993]), we found that to operate at

minimum efficient size required gross income of $3-4 million (1987 $),15 The

results reported here indicate that the loss of efficiency incurred through

operating at half that scale is minor --     less than 5%. Furthermore, relatively

small-sized agencies are able to exploit available scope economies as evidenced

by our estimates that, depending on the media category, as few as 50% and as

many as 85% of agencies in our sample were able to realize a cost advantage

through the joint production of the mix of media-related services they supplied.

      Data reported in the 1987 Census of Services show that there were 493

agencies with gross incomes of $2.5 million or more operating in that year, and

 1,512 agencies with gross incomes of $1 million or more. Thus, it appears that

agencies of widely varying sizes are economically viable.

       The second area of policy undergoing change is the traditional concept of

 a "full service" agency where there is a movement toward the abandonment of

 "one-stop shopping" and the "unbundling" of services (Wells (1993]). The

 abandonment of "one stop shopping" reflects a failure of agencies to realize the

 scope economies which earlier were expected to accompany diversification         into


 such areas as direct marketing, sales promotion, and publication (Sellers

[1993); Wells [1993]). This    diversification   apparently occurred without

effective integration of the various specialized groups. Efforts to cross-sell

a broad range of services were resisted by clients who questioned the uniformity

of the quality of diversified services available from a single agency and who

doubted that one-stop shopping would produce significant savings in transactions

costs.

         Agencies that once aspired to be suppliers of a broad range of marketing

communications services are now willing to offer clients creative and/or media

services separately (Mandes [1994a]). Another related development is that some

agencies have adopted a general contractor" model whereby they offer a broad

range of services but outsource certain of them to specialized suppliers

(Mandese [l994b); Wells and Sloan [l993a]). Interestingly, this unbundling and

the attention to small "boutique agencies emphasizing creative services are

consistent with policies advocated two decades ago by Cross [1972) as a means

for developing more effective advertising.

         Interpreted in light of our finding that substantial numbers of large

agencies were operating with diseconomies of scope, this downsizing may reflect

actions taken to correct excessive prior diversification. Bundling and conflict

policy make for a "lumpy" product line adjustment process. Given that demand

for agencies' services is cyclical and client turnover commonplace, product line

shifts are frequent occurrences, but the task of maintaining efficiency in

agency operations and avoiding diseconomies of scope is made difficult by         the

complexities which bundling and conflict policy impose.

         The third area of agency policy undergoing change is compensation.

Studies of compensation levels and methods Indicate that over time, agencies'

control over the pricing of their services has deteriorated as clients have

become increasingly cost-conscious (Achenbaum [1990]; Lauterborn [1992);

Weilbacher [1990]). The evidence reporttd here indicating the presence of size-

related   economies is consistent with the trend away from the longstanding

reliance on fixed commission rates, and the increased utilization of sliding

scales of commissions and fees based on labor costs (Association of National

Advertisers (l992).



                           VII. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

      This paper began by arguing that the basic structure of demand and Costs

in the advertising agency industry closely resembles those conditions which

MacDonald and Slivinski (1987] showed were essential for an industry to sustain

a competitive equilibrium consisting of diversified firms. Building on the

evidence that the agency business is characterized by low fixed costs and

minimal entry barriers, we hypothesized that both media-specific scale and scope

economies could be exploited by relatively small-sized agencies. Our cross-

sectional study produced support for both these hypotheses.

      Two   additional   features of this industry were identified as exerting an

important influence on market structure: (i)) client use of a mix of advertising

media and the concomitant practice of agencies bundling their services; and

(ii) the prohibition against an agency serving competing accounts which operates

as a mobility barrier. We hypothesized that the combined presence of these two

phenomena could lead to excessive diversification, which would manifest itself

in large agencies experiencing diseconomies of scope. Our empirical results

also confirmed this relationship.

      The results reported here serve to demonstrate the value of viewing

advertising agencies as multiproduct firms, and offer a foundation for

understanding the highly competitive and fragmented structure that has

historically characterized the advertising industry. Further changes in agency

scale and scope can be expected as agencies seek to position themselves for a

wave of major innovations in communications technology and the possibilities of

a new era of interactive marketing (Blattberg and Deighton [1991)); Schrage

[1994)). The treatment of suppliers of communications services as multiproduct

firms should prove useful as a theoretical framework for analyzing the future

evolution of the organization of this industry.

FOOTNOTES




1See, for example, Berndt [1991), Canton and Penloff [1990], Comanor and
Wilson [1979], Hanssens, Parsons and Schultz [1990], Scherer and Ross [1990)
and Schmalensee [1989].

2The shares reported here were calculated by dividing the U.S. gross incones
for the largest 25, 100 and 500 agencies reported in Advertising Age
[1986,1988] by the total gross income (receipts) reported in the U.S. Census
of Services for 1977 and 1987.

3Galculated from expenditures and price indices for national advertising in
eight major media compiled by Robert Coen, Senior Vice President and Director
of Forecasting, Mccann-Erickson Worldwide, New York.

4conflict policy is a neglected area of study within the advertising field,
with two exceptions. Sirnan [1989] examined a large number of cases where
conflicts arose as a result of agency or client mergers in the mid-1980's.
Villas-Boas [19911 analyzed the conditions under which conflict policy may be
justified in the case where competing advertisers are oligopolistic rivals.

5mere is also evidence that the durability of agency-client relationships
varies systematically across product categories (Buchanan and Michel [1987]).
Hence, conflict policy not only affects the composition of an agency's
service/media market, but it also affects the riskiness of its client/account
portfolio and therefore its expected profitability.

6We contemplated using "flexible" functional forms such as the well-known
translog function (see Berndt [1991), Chapter 9), but found them to be
impractical since in our sample, for many agencies a number of outputs take on
zero values. With zero values, one cannot employ logarithmic forms such as
the translog, and use of other polynomial transformations is also
problematical.

7Parameter estimates and other econometric details relating to the estimation
of this model are shown in Appendix B, Table El. Further discussion is given
in Silk and Berndt [1993].

   useful discussion of global scope economies and references to literature is
given in Bailey and Friedlaender [1982J.

9For a discussion of the nature of market equilibrium when economies of scope
are present, see Eaton and Lemche (1991].

10This provides an interesting illustration of the point emphasized by Teece
[1982), namely, that economies of scope by themselves are not sufficient to
explain the existence and boundaries of multiproduct firms in a competitive
industry, for transactions costs are necessary.

11Table B2 in Appendix B presents sample summary statistics for the agency
output variables discussed later in Section V.

    discussion of some indirect evidence is provided in Silk and Berndt (1992,
Appendix A].

14The variability across the media reflects of course the underlying
differences in the j parameter estimates described above.

15Those calculations employed Eq. (2) of this paper and therefore were based
on the assumption that the firm was producing but one output. Thus those
calculations ignored the multiproduct nature of firms in this industry, and
the associated scope economies. Accordingly, our results here demonstrate
that size-related cost penalties incurred by small agencies are very modest,
due to available economies of scope.

Medium-Specific Scale Economies




        Following Bailey and Friedlander (1982, p. 1030). we may            define   product-

specific returns to scale for output ):

                                                          a;


where


        AIC               Average incremental cost of producing output j. j          = 1,
                              n.
        MC            =   Marginal    cost of producing output j.

        C(Yn)         =   Total    Cost of   producing     all n outputs.

        C(Y0 -   j)       Total    Cost of producing all n outputs except j.

                      =   Quantity    of output j       produced.


                                             =      +          =


        To   simplify the   notation, we surpress the individual agency subscript,

i,   throughout.
                                                                                               A- 2

        Now for our preferred "Scale Plus Scope" model the average cost is:



                                                 =          + f3exp(yf)            (4)




        To get total cost1 we multiply both sides of (4) by total output. y,

and obtain:

                                      C(Y) =    •     =
                                                          YZaS     + Y,jexp(yf)    (5)




        Noting that              = 5jn' where Si is share of total output represented by

output j. we may re-write (5) as:



                                           C)Y) =            + Y3exp(yY)           (6)




        An expression for the total cost of producing all n outputs exçeot i may

be obtained in a similar manner. Total output excluding j is Y -                  = n(1    -


      and thus from (4), unit cost becomes:


                                                n—i
                                               = u1S1     + exp(y(l —    j)Yn)     (7)
                                                i—i




To obtain total cost for total output excluding j. we multiply both sides of

(7)   by 1n1     —




        C(Y)         = (1— s))Yfl{akSk + exp(y(l —
                                                               Si)Yn)}
                                                                                   (8)
                             —
                     = {(l       S1   )Y EakSk} + (1— Sj)YnexP(r)e(—jYn).

         Substituting          (6) and (8) for C(Y0) and C(Ynj). respectively, in (2) and

simplifying,         we obtain:



                    MC =       a3
                                    —             + _Eexp(yY)[l —(1 —                         (9)

         To obtain an expression for the marginal cost of j,                        MC, we
differentiate (6) with respect to YJ. To do so. it is convenient to

substitute n =              "j + 1n-j in       (6):




C(Y) =       aY. + XakYk + (Y + Y)exp(y(Y                           +

Let   the second term in the above equations be:

Substituting (13), (14). (16) and (17) in (15) and simplifying:


                                    =

Substituting (18) and (19) in (11). we get:

obtain an expression for the index of product—specific scale economies in

           CROSS-SECTIONAL PRODUCT-SPECIFIC SCALE AND SCOPE REGRESSIONS

Product-Specific Scale Results

      Recall from Eq. (14) in the text that our measure of product-specific scale

economies, SCLjk, indicates the extent to which an agency i exploits the

potential scale economies available as it adds a medium k to its product line and

thereby increases the volume of output it produces in that category from zero to

some particular level, ik• Consistent with this definition, it is of interest

to examine how an agency's realization of the available scale economies for that

media category k varies with the scale and composition of its output exoludina

chat category k - -   the   particular medium or product under consideration.

Accordingly, we employ the following Set of agency descriptor variables:

        To facilitate comparisons of regression results across media categories, we

computed standardized regression coefficients that are similar to conventional

partial regression coefficients except that each variable is scaled in units of

the   sample value of its standard deviation (Ezekiel and Fox [1959))..2 To
illustrate, in this application a standardized regression coefficient measures

the magnitude of change in a medium-specific scale economy index (SCL),

expressed as a proportion of the sample value of Its standard deviation

associated with a change in one standard deviation in some explanatory variable.

       In Table C-i we display the values of these standardized coefficients

obtained by regressing each of the nine medium-specific scale economy indexes

separately on the set of four agency output variables. These regressions are

intended to serve only as a means of describing how scale economies covary with

agency characteristics; it would, of course, be inappropriate to draw any deep

structural or statistical inferences from these results.



                           INSERT TABLE   C-i   HERE



       Examining Table C-i, we see that realization of scale economies is related

to the size and composition of an agency's output in essentially the same

systematic manner in each of the media categories- -as indicated by the

consistency of the signs and relative magnitudes       of   the standardized regression

coefficients for three of the four descriptor variables: category share of total

output, log gross income, and the product line specialization index. No

consistent pattern of effects emerged for the product line breadth measure (the

number of different media categories encompassed by an agency's output), as

evidenced by instability in the signs of the relevant standardized regression

coefficients and generally small magnitudes relative to their standard errors.
      APPENDIX C                                                   -
                                                                       Page C-3 -

       The adjusted R2 statistics reveal that the set of four agency output

variables account for half or more of the cross sectional variability in each of

the medium-specific scale economy indices, except for the specialty print

category where the fit is somewhat lower (Rj —       0.453).
       These results imply that when an agency expands its output by adding a

category to its media mix, the greater its prior size and the more diversified

its existing media mix, the   greater will be the extent to which it captures the

available scale economies.3
Product-Specific Scope Results

       In Table C-2 we present the results obtained when each medium-specific

scope economy index was regressed on a set of four agency output descriptor

variables similar to those investigated in the preceding analysis of scale

economies. y definition, product-specific scope economies are zero when a



                           INSERT TAgLE   C-2 HERE


product's share of total output is either zero or unity (see Eqs. (15) and (16))

and hence, the relationship between scope economy and output share is non-

monotonic. Accordingly, we employed a quadratic specification for the cateogry

share variable. tn Table C-2 standardized regression coefficients are given for

the linear and squared share terms. As in the analysis of scala economies,

measures of agency size and product line specialization and breadth were also

included in the regression. The values of the measures of these variables used

in the medium-speccific scope regressions reported in Table C-2 reflect each

agency's entire product line.4

       Inspecting Table C-2, we find that the signs of the standardized regression

coefficients for each of the explanatory variables are almost perfectly

consistent across the entire set of nine media-related output categories. As
    APPENDIX C                                                     -
                                                                       Page C-4 -

indicated   by the values of the adjusted R2, together the four variables accounted

for roughly 50-aOl of the variance in seven of the nine scope economy indices.

The exceptions are the direct response and display categories where the cross-

sectional variation is comparatively limited, as may be seen from Table 2 in the

text which indicates that 78 and 85X of the agencies operating in these

respective categories realize a cost advantage through joint production.

      The signs and magnitudes of the estimated coefficients for the quadratic

relation between scope economies and media share indicate that throughout most of

the relevant operating range, the relationship is a negative one.5 That is to

say, the cost advantage from joint production tends to decline as an agency's

output becomes increasingly concentrated in any single media category. The

exception is again the display category where the within-sample variability in

scope economies is smallest and no systematic pattern of relationship between

scope economies and share is discernible.

      Turning to the results for the agency size and product line specialization

relationship, we see from Table C-2 that, with a single exception, the

standardized regression coefficients all have negative signs and appear otherwise

stable in the sense that the magnitudes of the coefficients are at least twice

(and most often more thart three times) the size of their standard errors. The

discrepant case is non-media services where the sign of the standardized

regression coefficient for the product line specialization index is reversed

(positive), but the size of the coefficient is less than twice its estimated

standard error.

     An examination of the results for product line breadth, measured by the

nunber of different media output produced, indicates that the sign of the

standardized regression coefficient is negative for eight of the nine media

categories. However, the effect appears small and/or imprecisely estimated, as
    APPENDIX C                                                         -
                                                                           Page C-S -

indicated   by the tact that in   only   two cases (general magazines and specialty

print) is the size of the coefficient more than twice its standard error.

      Overall then, our results indicate that the cost advantage associated with

the joint as opposed to the separate production of a particular category of media

advertising tends to decline with increases in: (I) the share of total agency

output concentrated in that media category; (ii) agency size; and (iii)

specialization of the agency's media mix. While most agencies produce service

mixes that enable them to realize the benefits of joint production, we also find

instances where agencies appear to have become too large and/or overly

specialized in the sense that their operations are characterized by diseconomies

of scope, and cost savings could be realized by realigning their media mixes

and/or separating operations.

      Note that media-specific scale and scope economies are related to agency

size and media share in   the   same manner: the greater the share a particular

category of media advertising represents in the agencoy's total output and the

larger the agency, the more likely it is that an agency will have exhausted k.th

the scale and scope economies available for any of the categories of media
advertising that it produces. However product line diversification (or

specialization) is related to scale and scope economies in oosite Ways.

Whereas it is the agencies with more diversified (less specialized) media mixes

that are more likely to have exploited scale economies, it is the more

specialized (less diversified) agencies who operate with the smallest scooe

economies or perhaps who may even experience diseconomies of scope.

APPENDIX C FOOTNOTES:




1This    index of output specialization is a normalized version of the familar
1-lerfindahi Index   (H) often used as a measure of output concentration across
firms within an industry. Here we apply it to measure concentration of a
single firm's output across its product line. Since the lower bound of H
varies with n, it is not well suited for use in cross sectional comparisons
like the present situation where the agencies differ in the number of media
categories (n) in which they produce output. To circumvent this problem, we
adopted the normalization shown below which rescales H for any particular n
relative to its lower bound, thereby yielding a diversification measure whose
range is independent of n.

21n Appendix ?, Table gi, we present summary sample statistics for the set of
four variables employed here to characterize the size and composition of an
agency's output.

3mere is one exception to this pattern and that occurs for the non-media
services category where the sign of the standardized regression coeffIcient
reported in Table 2 indicates that the capturing scale economies increases
with greater specialization of an agency's media mix. This is the reverse of
the relationship found for the other eight categories, where the
specialized (or the more diversified) an agency's existing. media mix, the more
of the available scale economies it captures when expanding its media
offerings. We suspect that this apparent anomoly may be attributable to the
heterogeneous nature of this composite output category which includes a broad
array of services. Our suspicion of aggregation issues here is reenforced by
the    fact that the mean and variance of this category's share of agency's
output   is larger than those of any of the other eight categories.

4Recall that for the product-specific scale economy regressions, the size,
product line specialization and breadth variables were defined so as to
exclude the particular product (medium) under consideration. This
modification in the definitions of these three variables when used as
regressors in scope rather than scale regressions is necessary in order to be
consistent with the nature of the cost comparisons underlying the concepts of
product-specific scale and scope economies. Product-specific scale economies
describe the behavior of costs when total output is increased by adding
another product to the existing line. In contrast, product-specific scope
economies reflect the comparative costs of producing the same product line and
total output in two different ways.

5The proportion of agencies with media share which exceeded the values of the
inflexion point implied by the estimated coefficients from the quadratic
scope-share regressions varied from zero for network television to seven
percent for radio and 30 percent for non-media services.
