This paper examines the shift in childbirth from home to hospital that occurred in the United States

in the early twentieth century. Using a panel of city-level data over the period 1927-1940, we

examine the shift of childbirth from home to hospital and analyze the impact of medical care on

maternal mortality. Results suggest that increased operative intervention on the part of physicians

and a resultant greater risk of infection increased maternal mortality prior to the introduction of sulfa

drugs in 1937. However, the introduction of sulfa enabled doctors to reduce maternal mortality by

enabling them to do potentially life-saving procedures (such as cesareans) without the risk of

subsequent infection. Regressions estimated separately by race suggest that the impact of medical

care on maternal mortality differed for blacks and whites. Relative to whites, hospitals posed a

greater risk for black mothers prior to the availability of sulfa drugs in 1937, and were less beneficial

for them afterwards, suggesting that blacks may have received lower quality medical care.

1.      Introduction

        The early twentieth-century transformation of the hospital from almshouse to center of medical

science is remarkable both in its physical scope and in its social importance. In the late nineteenth

century, hospitals were noisy, dirty places that cared for indigents and were operated by charities,

religious organizations and government. Respectable persons were cared for at home by their families.

As noted by Rosenberg, “No one wanted to enter a hospital in the mid-1870s, except for the small

minority of the least enterprising and lacking in self-respect.” (Rosenberg 1987, p.116).1 The relatively

primitive state of medical technology meant that there were virtually no reasons for families to seek care

in hospitals rather than be attended by physicians in their homes. Medical care consisted primarily of the

administering of drugs, a task that could be easily accomplished at home (Temin 1988, p. 79).

        As medical technology advanced, the gradual transformation of the hospital from an almshouse to

a modern, scientific institution occurred. Hospitals became natural arenas for medical care and science

because technological advances necessitated centralization. Rapid advances in bacteriology led to a

greater understanding and implementation of complex aseptic surgical techniques that could more easily

be performed in specially designed hospital surgical suites than in living rooms. Advances in pathology

led to the formation of clinical laboratories in hospitals, and the X-ray became an important, non-portable

diagnostic tool.

        The centralization of medical technologies in hospitals coincided with the increasing

standardization and professionalization of medical education that began in the late nineteenth century.

From 1880 to 1904, the number of medical schools in the U.S. increased from 90 to 154, leading some

physicians to argue for education reforms to stem the tide of poor-quality doctors that contributed to

“dwindling” medical incomes in an “overcrowded” profession (Stevens 1971, p. 60). Neither medical

school entrance requirements nor medical school coursework was rigorous. Medical schools did not

require a bachelor’s degree for would-be medical students, and medical education often consisted of no

1
 A common perception of the day was poor health was often the result of poor moral character. Therefore,
hospitals concerned themselves more with curing a person’s moral flaws than becoming a steward of medical
advances. (Temin 1988, p. 79).


                                                                                                             2
more than two or three years in a training program that was frequently devoid of hospital clinical

experience, despite the fact that as early as the 1840s the American Medical Association had indicated the

hospital was indispensable in providing training for physicians (Rosenberg 1987, p. 202; Starr 1982, pp.

114-116).

        While some universities opened small hospitals of their own to provide clinical teaching for at

least some of their students, it was not until the 1890s that significant reforms linking medical education

to hospitals occurred. In 1893, Johns Hopkins became the first medical school to treat medicine as a field

of graduate study, emphasizing science and clinical experience in their training of medical students. The

first two years of the four-year program were dedicated to studying science, while the last two were spent

in hospital wards. This reform cemented the marriage of physician education to hospital clinical

experience, whereas previous medical school students had learned the practice of medicine “… in their

preceptor’s office and the patient’s home” (Starr 1982, p. 116).

        Following the reforms at Johns Hopkins, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the

Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) pushed for stricter entrance requirements and more

rigorous courses of study in all medical schools. The changes at Hopkins spurred reforms elsewhere, and

by the time Abraham Flexner published his famous indictment of medical education in 1910, the Hopkins

model had become the standard for medical education that other schools strove to imitate.

        The link between medical education and clinical experience in hospitals ushered in the era of

hospital-based medicine. On the supply side, physicians trained in hospitals came to view hospitals as

physician workshops, and as the number of physicians trained in hospital settings continued to grow, the

shift in medical care from home to hospital began in earnest. Hospitals focused on image-building and

customer-service, specializing in obstetrical deliveries, tonsillectomies, and appendectomies—all

procedures with usually happy outcomes (Stevens 1989, p. 105). On the demand side, the decline in

average family size that occurred with urbanization further spurred the shift as families moved into

smaller homes with fewer people left in the home to care for the sick (Vogel 1980, p. 99; Temin 1988, p.

83). Medical discoveries such as the prophylactic treatment of rabies (1885), diphtheria antitoxin (1891),


                                                                                                              3
and tests for typhoid (1897) and syphilis (1906) lent a new scientific aura to medicine (Rosenberg 1987,

p. 159). By 1920, American upper- and middle-class families began to accept hospitals as a consumer

good, and hospitals catered to this new consumerism.

         While the shift from home to hospital is well-documented, what is less clear is the extent to which

this shift occurred because it benefited practitioners or because it benefited patients. Obstetrical care in

particular is a remarkable example of the shift from home to hospital, and an example in which the

reasons underlying the shift may not have been due to the fact that women received better care in

hospitals than in their homes. In 1900, only five percent of all births occurred in hospitals (Wertz and

Wertz 1977, p. 133). Particularly in urban areas, the shift from home to hospital occurred quickly. By

1935, nearly 75 percent of urban births occurred in hospitals, and nearly all urban births occurred in

hospitals by 1950.2

         Despite the rapid shift from home birth to hospital birth, Figures 1 and 2 show that maternal

mortality remained flat until the mid-1930s, even as death rates among women due to other causes such as

respiratory tuberculosis decreased. Figure 1 shows total, urban (places over 10,000) and rural maternal

mortality from 1915-1940. Strikingly, maternal mortality was higher in urban areas than in rural areas

until the late 1930s when sulfa drugs became available, even though women in urban areas had greater

access to physicians and hospitals. Figure 2 shows the death rate among women for tuberculosis and all

causes related to childbirth (puerperal causes) from 1900-1940. While tuberculosis death rates fell

throughout the period, maternal mortality did not begin to decline until the 1930s. Ignoring the spike in

maternal mortality rates associated with the 1918 influenza epidemic, maternal mortality death rates are

essentially flat until the 1930s, even as childbirth increasingly moved from home to hospital over the

period.3 Further, infant mortality rates due to birth injuries increased 40-50 percent between 1915 and


2
  The transition occurred more slowly in rural areas initially. In 1935, roughly 20 percent of rural births occurred in
hospitals. By 1950, over 70 percent of rural births occurred in hospitals, and by the 1960s, it was rare for any birth to
occur outside of a hospital (Leavitt 1986, p. 171; Wertz and Wertz 1977 p. 135).
3
  The spike in 1918 due to influenza occurs because the U.S. classified influenza deaths among pregnant women as
due to puerperal causes instead of influenza. When joint causes of death were present, they were coded using the
Manual of Joint Causes of Death prepared by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. For each cause of death, the Manual of


                                                                                                                       4
1929 as hospital birthrates increased (White House Conference on Child Health and Protection 1933, pp.

215-217).

         It could be argued that the seeming rise (or lack of decline) in maternal mortality rates may have

resulted from improved reporting of maternal deaths as time progressed, or because a decline in the birth

rate meant that more hazardous first births accounted for a greater share of total births over time.

However, neither of these reasons can fully account for the trend in maternal mortality from 1900-1940.

Improvements in reporting could have led to a seeming increase in maternal mortality for two reasons.

First, states with higher mortality rates may have been admitted to the U.S. death registration area later

than states with lower rates. As these higher mortality states were admitted, the U.S. overall maternal

mortality rate would increase. While plausible, it does not appear to be the case that an increasing number

of states admitted to the death registration area was responsible for the trend in maternal mortality. Even

in those states that were in the death registration area in 1900, maternal mortality did not decline over the

period. Figure 3 shows the essentially flat trend until the 1930s in Massachusetts, a state that had

collected maternal mortality data since 1850. Further, international comparisons, shown in Figure 4,

reveal that both England and Sweden had flat or rising maternal mortality rates during the same period,

even though they possessed fairly accurate vital statistics data (Loudon 1992, p. 240).4

         Another reason why the increase in maternal mortality in the early twentieth century may be an

artifact of the data is that there may have been a tendency on the part of physicians to misreport deaths

from puerperal fever in order to avoid blame (Loudon 1992, pp. 35-36). While such deaths were usually

classified as due to another puerperal cause such as hemorrhage, so that the overall maternal mortality

rate would be the same, some doctors may have coded deaths from puerperal infection as due to non-



Joint Causes tells what other causes are “preferred” and should be listed as the primary cause if both are present. For
example, puerperal septicemia as a primary cause took precedence over tuberculosis, but not over syphilis.
4
  A note of caution when looking at this figure: the levels are difficult to compare because of differences between
countries in classifying deaths due to joint causes (for example, Sweden and England coded joint deaths in which the
mother had influenza as due to influenza, not due to puerperal causes as was done in the U.S., so that the U.S. has a
spike in maternal mortality during the influenza epidemic that is not seen in international data). A study done in
1927 found that the rates in England and Sweden would be higher if classified using the American method, although
the rank order would be the same (Tandy 1935).


                                                                                                                     5
childbirth related causes. As the quality of vital statistics reporting improved over time, these deaths may

have been more accurately reported, so that maternal mortality seemed to increase. These effects were

undoubtedly present, but probably small and not large enough to obscure the overall trend, especially by

the 1920s. In a 1917 study that investigated maternal mortality in the U.S. and examined the quality of the

data, Meigs states, “… it is safe to say that any marked decrease in the actual death rate from childbirth

during the last 13 years could not have been masked by “the improvement in reporting deaths from

childbirth (Meigs 1917, p. 18).

        Even if the data were accurately reported, it may be that maternal mortality failed to decrease

over this period because a decline in the birth rate meant that more hazardous first births (primiparity)

increased as a share of total births. While it is true that first births are more hazardous than second or third

births, it is also true that grand multiparity (four or more births) is more hazardous as well (Loudon 1992,

p. 242). If birth rates were declining, then primiparity was increasing, but grand multiparity was

decreasing. Thus, the increased risk of maternal mortality associated with higher primiparity may have

been offset by the decreased risk of maternal mortality associated with lower grand multiparity. Statistics

available from 1920-1940 suggest that as the total birth rate per 1,000 women aged 10-54 fell from 72.6

births to 52.3 births, the percentage of first births as a share of total births rose from 29 percent to 37

percent. At the same time, the share of fourth and subsequent births fell from 35 percent to 24 percent

(Linder and Grove 1947, Table 48, Table XIV-A). Given that the decrease in grand multiparity more than

offsets the increase in primiparity as a share of total births, it seems unlikely that the overall trend in

maternal mortality can be attributed to changes in fertility.

        The data clearly suggest, then, that maternal mortality was not decreasing over the period 1900-

1940 even as hospital birth rates increased. If, ostensibly, one of the primary reasons underlying the shift

from home to hospital birth was that hospitals provided greater safety for women and infants during labor

and childbirth, why was this effect not seen in declining maternal mortality rates? Several historians have

argued that stagnant maternal mortality rates and rising rates of infant mortality due to birth injury

occurred as a result of increased operative intervention on the part of practitioners as birth moved from


                                                                                                               6
the home to the hospital, combined with a lack of set standards for the practice of obstetrics. Unnecessary

intervention may have led to excess maternal deaths for a number of reasons. A primary cause of maternal

mortality was puerperal septicemia, and increased operative intervention in the form of version, forceps

delivery and cesarean section all increased the likelihood of such an infection. Complications from

anesthesia could also lead to maternal death. How preventable was maternal death in this period? Two

studies in the early 1930s claimed that between half and two-thirds of maternal deaths could have been

prevented by better training of the attendants (White House Conference on Child Health and Protection

1933; New York Academy of Medicine 1933 p. 213). If these arguments are correct, then modern

medicine may have actually increased the number of maternal deaths due to childbirth than otherwise

would have occurred.

        This paper uses a panel of city-level data over the period 1927-1940 to examine the shift of

childbirth from home to hospital and to analyze whether or not medical care contributed to maternal

mortality. Results indicate that medical care generated a slight increase in maternal mortality prior to

1937, and a slightly larger decrease after 1937 when sulfa drugs became available. The remainder of the

paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the background and history of childbirth in the United

States, and frames the model discussed in Section 3. Section 4 describes the data and results, while

Section 5 concludes.

2.      The History of Childbirth in America

Childbirth Prior to 1900

        Before 1750, women controlled childbirth. Typically, a pregnant woman entering confinement

requested the attendance of a midwife and several close friends and relatives who would aid her during

the process of childbirth in her home. The technology of childbirth was relatively simple; midwives were

generally passive but supportive participants in the birthing process, especially during normal deliveries.

They were able to turn breech births, but in complicated cases could do little to prevent either maternal or

infant death (Wertz and Wertz 1977, p.17-18). Women feared childbirth, and while actual data are scarce,

Leavitt notes that women’s diaries in colonial times (and even through the turn of the twentieth century)


                                                                                                              7
showed that “… an important part of women’s experience of childbirth was their anticipation of dying or

being permanently injured during the event” (Leavitt 1986, p. 14).

        Medical intervention during childbirth, even the presence of a physician during labor and

delivery, was rare until after 1750, when men trained as physicians abroad returned to practice in America

(Wertz and Wertz 1977, p. 29). Physicians trained in the “new midwifery” in Europe brought forceps to

the United States, offering middle- and upper-class women an alternative to traditional, midwife-attended

childbirth.5 The fear of childbirth led women to invite physicians (and their promises of greater safety and

less pain) into the birthing room (Leavitt 1986, pp. 37-38). With forceps, physicians could assist women

in difficult births, or hasten slow deliveries. Technological developments such as with the introduction of

ergot (a drug used to cause uterine contractions), and the advent of pain-relieving drugs such as ether and

chloroform also provided physicians with an aura of science that led more and more women to choose to

have physician-attended births. General practitioners were eager to accommodate women. They viewed

childbirth as central to their attempts to build a practice, given that successful births led to more patients

(Wertz and Wertz 1977, p. 67) At the same time, midwives, most of whom were without formal education

and who lacked professional organization, gradually attended fewer and fewer births as the century

progressed.

        The idea that physician-attended deliveries were in fact safer was not necessarily true; while there

are no records of epidemics of puerperal fever in America during the 18th century, puerperal fever became

more common in America after 1840, perhaps because of increasing physician intervention during

childbirth (Wertz and Wertz 1977, p. 119). Regardless, by the end of the nineteenth century nearly 50

percent of all births were physician-attended, although the majority still occurred in women’s homes.

Most middle-and upper-class white women were attended by physicians in their homes during childbirth,

while Southern black families and immigrants relied heavily on midwives (Litoff 1978, p. 26). The only


5
  An Englishman named Peter Chamberlen is believed to have invented forceps in the early 17th century. The device
consisted of “… two enlarged spoons with handles” that could be joined and locked together. The Chamberlen
family kept the device a secret for over 100 years, so that they were not widely used until after 1800 (Wertz and
Wertz 1977, pp. 34-35; Radcliffe 1967, pp. 31-32).


                                                                                                                 8
births that occurred in hospitals were those of homeless women or women who could not receive in-home

assistance (Leavitt 1986, p. 61).



Childbirth After 1900

        After the turn of the century, the shift from home to hospital began in earnest, although it

occurred slowly at first. A Children’s Bureau study conducted in Baltimore in 1915 sheds some light on

trends in urban areas. By 1915, the percentage of births attended by physicians had increased, and women

were more likely to deliver in hospitals (Rochester 1923, pp. 212-213). However, as shown in Tables 1a

and 1b, the percentage of women attended by physicians and delivering in hospitals varied widely by both

income and nationality of mother. Table 1a shows that physician-attended births in Baltimore hospitals

were highest among families where the father reported no earnings and among the highest-earning

fathers. Middle-class families were more likely to deliver at home while being attended by a physician,

while midwives generally limited their services to middle- and lower-income families. Table 1b illustrates

the fact that foreign-born mothers in Baltimore were more likely to use midwives than native-born

mothers, usually because of a reluctance to admit men into the birthing room. Only 27.4 percent of infants

born to white, native-born mothers were delivered by midwives in 1915, while midwives attended the

births of over 77 percent of Italian-born women.



The Rise of the Physician and Hospital-Based Childbirth

        What engendered the shift from home to hospital based childbirth in the first decades of the

twentieth century? On the supply side, reforms in medical education, increasing professional organization

and specialization among physicians, the economic gains that accrued to physicians who had hospital-

centered practices, and the disappearance of the midwife as an alternative to physician-attended birth all

played a role in the transition of birth from home to hospital.

        By the turn of the century, reforms in medical education were well underway. The impetus for

reform stemmed from the success of the Johns Hopkins model and the willingness of American


                                                                                                             9
philanthropists to fund improvements in medical science and education.6 However, the chief proponent

for change became the newly restructured and more powerful American Medical Association (AMA).7

The AMA recognized the fact that improving standards would not only lead to additional funding of

medical school endowments and improvements in the quality of medical care, but would also serve to

reduce the number of medical practitioners at a time when many physicians were struggling financially.

The problem of “overcrowding” in the profession was referred to in several articles at the turn of the

century. A Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) editorial written in October, 1901

stated, “It is evident from the census statistics that we must be rapidly approaching the limit of additions

to the medical profession if the individual members are to find the practice of medicine a lucrative

occupation” (JAMA, October 26, 1901, p. 1119).

         Regardless of motive, the reforms in medical education that occurred in the first two decades of

the twentieth century influenced the shift in childbirth from home to hospital in two ways. First, reforms

in medical education focused on the close incorporation of hospitals with physician education. Prior to the

twentieth century, most physicians had little clinical experience in hospitals. Even before the Flexner

Report was published in 1910, medical reformers recognized the need for a close tie between hospitals

and medical training.8 Thus, increasing numbers of physicians were routinely trained in hospitals and

came to view hospitals as workshops in which they could use the latest medical technologies. With

respect to childbirth, hospitals enabled physicians to use technologies that may have been more difficult at

home. For example, physicians often had physical difficulty utilizing forceps in the home birthing bed,


6
  Stevens notes that endowments to medical schools rose as educational standards increased. She quotes the
president of Harvard in 1907 as stating “Gentlemen, the way to get endowment for medicine is to improve medical
education.” American Medical Association Bulletin, 1907, p. 263, quoted by Stevens 1971, p. 60.
7
  The growth in AMA membership over the time period is striking. While the reorganization of the AMA in 1913 to
include all members in good standing with local medical societies makes it difficult to compare AMA membership
over time, Burrow notes that by comparing the number of AMA fellows (members who were in good standing with
a local society, actually applied for AMA membership, subscribed to the Journal and paid the annual fee) with the
number of members before 1913 allows for nearly parallel comparisons. Total fellows in the AMA in 1920 equaled
47,045 (of total membership of 83,338), compared to 8,401 members in 1900 (Burrow 1963, pp. 49-50).
8
  Some philanthropists encouraged the development of ties between medical schools and hospitals. Markowitz and
Rosner (1973) note several incidences where philanthropists and other industrialists “… attempted to foster
consolidation of the medical school and hospital by giving money with certain substantial strings attached,” usually
requiring hospitals to allow medical schools to use their facilities for teaching (p. 103).


                                                                                                                  10
and some types of anesthesia were best administered in a hospital environment. Further, an increasing

awareness of the importance of a germ-free environment to prevent puerperal fever led doctors to prefer

hospital-based over home-based childbirth (Leavitt p. 177).

        In addition to being more comfortable practicing in a hospital setting, physicians also found that

centralizing childbirth in hospitals was more convenient and perhaps more lucrative. They no longer had

to carry their equipment and travel great distances to women’s homes to attend labor and delivery, and

hospitals provided trained nurses to assist doctors during delivery (Wertz and Wertz 1977, p. 144; Vogel

1980, pp. 102-103). In addition, hospital-centered practices may have allowed doctors to increase their

incomes. Doctors could see more patients than they could if they traveled to patient’s houses, and

hospitals enabled them to do more complicated (and more expensive) procedures. The idea that

physicians may have used excessive intervention to increase their incomes is in line with the modern

theory of “supplier-induced demand.” For example, Gruber and Owings (1996) found that the decrease in

fertility that occurred from 1970-1982 led obstetricians to substitute normal childbirth with more highly

compensated cesarean deliveries. Two studies published much earlier are also suggestive of the presence

of supplier-induced demand. A 1915 Children’s Bureau study found that physicians used forceps (for

which they were reimbursed more) in only 4.3 percent of births in families with fathers earning less than

$450, compared to 14.2 percent of births in families with earnings over $1,850 (Woodbury 1925, p. 236).

Similarly, results from the National Health Survey of 1935-1936 found that the cesarean birth rates varied

from a low of 1.4 percent among those families on relief to 3.7 percent among those women with a family

income of $2,000 or more. Even more striking, the percentage of hospitalized women undergoing

episiotomy ranged from a low of 25 percent among relief families to nearly 50 percent among women

with family income over $2,000. (Goddard 1941, pp. 44-45).

        The second reason reforms in medical education helped to foster the shift in childbirth from home

to hospital was that they were part of a larger effort by the AMA to increase the level of professional

organization and status among physicians, activities that may have in turn reduced the number of non-

physician practitioners (such as midwives) that were available as alternatives to physician-attended


                                                                                                          11
childbirth. As the scope of medical knowledge broadened, greater numbers of physicians sought to

specialize in an area of medicine rather than practice as generalists.9 State licensing requirements rose

with increasing standards in medical education, and physicians resisted efforts by non-medical

competitors to treat patients (Stevens 1971, p. 99-100). The desire to reform obstetrics education and to

raise the status of obstetricians led some physicians to call for the elimination of the midwife. Physicians

may have felt threatened economically by midwives, who typically received one-half the fee charged by

physicians for performing obstetrics services (Litoff 1978, p. 73; Chapin 1923, p. 77). Further, some

suggested that midwives took teaching opportunities away from medical students, particularly midwives

who worked on charity cases. Accordingly, many physicians regarded midwives as inferior substitutes

and blamed them for high rates of maternal mortality. A physician writing in the American Journal of

Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children in 1911 stated:

         …40 to 50 per cent. of the births in the large cities of this country are attended by midwives who,
         except in some rare instances, are ignorant, untrained, incompetent women, and some of the
         results of their obstetric incompetence are unnecessary deaths and blindness of the infants, and
         unavoidable invalidism, suffering and deaths of the mothers…the gist of the matter is that one or
         two things must be done with the midwife—she must be eliminated or educated and placed under
         state control. (Edgar 1911, p. 881).


         Indeed, there is little disagreement that untrained midwives contributed to high maternal mortality

rates. However, it is not clear that trained midwives were any more hazardous than poorly trained

physicians, especially since the maternal mortality rate did not fall as fewer and fewer women were

delivered by midwives over time. Speaking in 1911 to the New York Academy of Medicine about the

“midwife problem”, a New York physician noted that “... much that is said to-night concerning the evil

results of midwife practice here in New York, can be said—even to a higher degree—of the physician.

The poorly trained physician does far more harm than the midwife, as is abundantly shown by the various

hospital records as well as by the records of the Board of Health” (Lobenstine 1911, p. 879).

9
  Only 23 percent of medical students graduating in 1915 went on to practice solely as general practitioners. Thirty-
six percent developed a specialist interest, while 41 percent limited themselves entirely to a specialty (Stevens 1971,
p. 116). As more physicians became specialists, specialists sought to organize and delineate their specialties. The
American College of Surgeons (ACS) was founded in 1912 to standardize surgical quality and to openly distinguish
between “quality” surgeons and other surgical practitioners. Other specialties soon followed suit.


                                                                                                                    12
        Some physicians and public health officials were actually in favor of training and regulating

midwives to reduce maternal mortality. Midwife proponents pointed to the much lower puerperal death

rates experienced by some European countries that relied almost exclusively on trained midwives to

deliver pregnant women. Mothers in Sweden and England relied more extensively on midwives than did

mothers in the U.S., and midwives in these countries were better trained and regulated (Loudon 1992).

Despite the much greater number of births delivered at home, both England and Sweden realized much

lower levels of maternal mortality than the United States, as shown in Figure 4.

        In America, further evidence of the ability of trained midwives to reduce maternal mortality is

given by the example of the Kentucky Frontier Nursing Service, founded by Mary Breckinridge, a nurse

who later trained as a midwife in England. In the Frontier Nursing Service, more than 30 nurses trained as

midwives in England and then provided midwifery services to families in rural Kentucky. Over the period

1925-1937, the nurse-midwives delivered 3,000 babies. Physicians were called in to perform cesarean

sections 6 times, and forceps were used only 14 times. The maternal mortality rate associated with the

Frontier Nursing Service over the period was 6.8 deaths per 10,000 births, in contrast to 56-68 deaths per

10,000 births for the U.S. as a whole, and 80-90 deaths per 10,000 births for white women delivered in

hospitals in Lexington. (Dye 1983, pp. 501-502). New York City and New Jersey also experienced

significant declines in infant mortality after implementing midwife training and regulatory programs

(Litoff 1978, p. 93).

        Despite the efforts of midwifery proponents, the percentage of births attended by midwives

decreased from 50 to 12.5 percent over the period 1900 to 1935 (Loudon 1992, p.298).10 The absolute

number of midwives declined from 7.39 midwives per 100,000 people in 1900 to 2.90 per 100,000 in

1930. This trend was particularly pronounced in large cities. Southern states reported greater numbers of

midwives throughout the period, and lower levels of decline, as seen in Figure 5.




10
 In New Jersey, 42 percent of births were attended by midwives in 1918, compared to less than 19 percent in 1930.
By 1930, 80 percent of midwives were in the rural South (Stevens 1971, pp. 100, 180).


                                                                                                              13
        Efforts by physicians to discredit the midwife profession were likely responsible for at least some

of this decrease, as physicians regarded midwives as a “… temporary stopgap until all patients could be

delivered by physicians” (Stevens 1971, p. 180). States began to pass laws to regulate midwives over this

period, and one state (Massachusetts) even outlawed midwifery (Litoff 1986, p. 9).11 Overall, these laws

did little to reduce the number of midwives as they were fairly lenient and poorly enforced. There were

many other factors that contributed to the decline of midwives (Litoff 1986, pp. 9-10). In contrast to

physicians, midwives were not professionally organized, and given that many midwives were women

who attended blacks and immigrants, they may have lacked a political voice. Midwife proponents were

less organized than opponents, and the demand for midwife services also fell as immigration declined

(Litoff 1978, p. 113).



Advances in Anesthesia and Women’s Preferences for Hospital Birth

        While supply-side factors such as the increasing professionalization of physicians and their

preferences for hospital-centered births, and the fact that fewer midwives were available to serve as

alternatives doubtlessly contributed to the shift of birth from the home to the hospital, demand-side

factors also played a role. Some women may have simply preferred hospital births over home births. With

technological advances in anesthesia, more and more women turned away from midwives and turned to

physicians who could administer anesthetics during labor and delivery. As hospitals shifted their focus to

customer-service, they offered women greater comfort and assistance than women could receive at home.

Trained nurses could assist women, and lengthy hospital stays permitted women to rest and escape

household duties.12 Safety concerns also prompted women to adhere to their physician’s advice regarding




11
   In 1896, the year Washington, D.C. enacted a law requiring midwives to pass an examination, midwives attended
50 percent of all births. By 1910, midwives attended less than 10 percent (Chapin 1923, p. 77).
12
   Even after a nursing shortage following World War II shortened obstetrical length of stays in hospitals, ward
patients stayed an average of two weeks post-partum, and private, paying patients often stayed as long as three
weeks, perhaps they “…appreciated the efficiency of transferring to an institution the whole daily round of care,
feeding, and washing that could hardly be done anymore in the home” (Wertz and Wertz 1977, p. 156). Leavitt also
suggests that urbanization transformed birth from a “woman-centered” event where a woman’s friends and relatives


                                                                                                              14
hospitals. Childbirth in the early twentieth-century was hazardous; a 1917 report noted that childbirth in

1913 caused more deaths among women 15 to 44 years old than any disease except tuberculosis (Meigs

1917, p. 7). Advertisements in popular women’s magazines trumpeted the virtues of hospital births by

proclaiming that “…motherhood is easier and far safer due… to the modern hospital and the great strides

made in obstetrics” (Ladies’ Home Journal, September 1930, p. 83). Advertisements also frequently

touted their products as those used by “hospital leaders” and as “hospital-safe” (Ladies’ Home Journal,

February 1932, p. 120).

        While doctors’ advice, comfort, convenience, and supposedly greater safety played a role in the

shift from home to hospital birth, the availability of anesthesia also contributed to a growing demand for

hospital birth. The advent of pain relieving drugs and techniques, notably “Twilight Sleep” in 1914

(Leavitt 1986, p. 130 and Wertz and Wertz 1977, p.150), likely played a large part in convincing women

that hospitals were more comfortable than homes for delivering a child. Although ether and chloroform

had been used since the mid-1800s, they were far from ideal. Induction and recovery were slow with

ether, and while women were induced much faster using chloroform, it carried higher risks of cardiac

complications (Rushman, Davies, Atkinson 1996, pp. 23-26). Most other drugs could not be administered

until late in labor, so that women still experienced pain (Leavitt 1986, p. 127).

        An advance in the early twentieth-century opened the door for greater anesthetic possibilities.

Unlike earlier methods, “twilight sleep” involved the administration of the amnesiac scopolamine, which

did not relieve pain but rather prevented women from remembering the painful experience. Pioneered in

Germany, U.S. physicians were reluctant to use twilight sleep since they were unsure of its safety.

Complications included delayed labor, and infant respiratory depression (Sandelowski 1984, pp. 11-15).

Women sometimes had to be restrained during its use, making the hospital the preferable setting for

delivery (Sandelowski 1984, p. 16). By slowing labor and incapacitating women, twilight sleep often

required obstetrical interventions such as the administration of Pituitrin (a drug used to increase


took care of her and her family both during labor and after delivery to one in which women could not find the help
they needed (1986, p. 175).


                                                                                                                 15
contractions) and the applications of forceps to deliver infants. Despite its drawbacks, women

campaigned vigorously for its adoption. Proponents of twilight sleep included many wealthy society

women, including Mrs. John Jacob Astor, whose picture appeared in newspaper articles endorsing the

method (Leavitt 1986, pp. 131-33; Wertz and Wertz 1977, pp. 150-54). While the popularity of the

Twilight Sleep method faded somewhat after 1915 when a noted advocate died during childbirth, the

furor it initially created served to increasingly medicalize childbirth, and to make obstetrics an

increasingly surgical specialty that routinely involved anesthesia and instrumental intervention.

         Because of these reasons, increasingly large numbers of American women began to give birth in

hospitals. The image of hospitals as safer places to give birth, however, is little supported by empirical

evidence. Maternal mortality rates were flat and in some cases increasing until the 1930s, and several

studies blamed the increase on excessive physician intervention in childbirth.13 As early as 1880

physicians were aware of the streptococci bacteria that caused sepsis, often called “child-bed” or

“puerperal” fever. Nevertheless, puerperal septicemia remained a leading killer of women of childbearing

age until the mid-1930s, when the anti-infective sulfonamide drugs were developed.14 Women attended

by physicians and giving birth in hospitals prior to 1936 may have been at increased risk for septicemia,

given that they were much more likely to have some sort of physical intervention. Results from the 1935-

1936 National Health Survey found that forceps were used “… with two or three times the frequency” in

hospital deliveries compared to nonhospitalized deliveries (Goddard 1941, p. 47). One prominent


13
   A study conducted by the Children’s Bureau in 1927 and 1928 found that maternal deaths due to puerperal causes
were 36 percent higher in urban areas than in rural areas (Maternal Mortality in Fifteen States Children’s Bureau
1934, p. 19). Loudon (1991, p.294) and Leavitt (1986, p.183) also provide evidence that maternal deaths due to
puerperal fever remained higher in urban areas than in rural areas. Given the higher incidence of hospital births in
urban than rural areas this may suggest that hospitals may have actually increased the risks associated with
childbirth. Further evidence is suggested by interracial comparisons: Despite the fact that white mothers were
hospitalized with much greater frequency than nonwhite infants (twice as many white births occurred in hospitals
than did nonwhite births), the racial gap in maternal mortality did not widen and even narrowed during this time
period (Loudon 1991, p. 299).
14
   Until sulfa drugs were developed, between 35-55 percent of maternal deaths were due to sepsis. Twenty percent
were due to eclampsia, 20 percent due to hemorrhage, with the remainder due to other causes such as abortion
(Loudon 1991, p. 34). Dr. Gerhard Domagk described the antibacterial properties of the first sulfa drug (called
“Prontosil” in results published in February, 1935. The antibacterial action came from the drug’s sulphonamide
compounds, which were generally effective against streptococcal agents, and to a lesser extent against staphyloccal
infection. Domagk won the 1939 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for his work.


                                                                                                                  16
physician, Joseph B. DeLee, recommended the routine use of episiotomy and outlet forceps after sedating

patients with ether and scopolamine. Describing this as the “prophylactic forceps operation,” DeLee

stated that the technique was a “…rounded method for relieving pain, supplementing and anticipating the

efforts of Nature, reducing the hemorrhage, and preventing and repairing damage” (DeLee 1920, p. 34).15

This “meddlesome midwifery” may have increased morbidity and mortality among childbearing women.

Drugs slowed delivery and necessitated interventions such as forceps that could transmit infection.

Physicians who inappropriately applied forceps risked lacerations of the cervix and perineum, as well as

infection and hemorrhage.

        Two studies conducted in the early 1930s confirmed the notion that physician interference may

have harmed women. A study conducted by the New York Academy of Medicine from 1930-1932 found

the septicemia death rate to be 1.67 deaths per 1,000 live births in the hospital, but only 0.90 deaths per

1,000 live births for infants delivered at home.16 A second study conducted by a subcommittee of the

White House Conference on Child Health and Protection also suggested that excessive interference led to

increased morbidity and mortality, with the result that “… all the advances in medical knowledge have

been almost lost to the parturient woman through too great a recourse to instrumental delivery” (White

House Conference 1933, p. 18).

3.      Model

        Despite the purported claims of increased maternal safety associated with hospital birth, Section 2

shows that it is not clear that hospitals really led to safer birth outcomes for mothers. However, if

hospitals were really actually dangerous for mothers, would more and more women voluntarily give birth

in hospitals? In this paper, we seek to statistically examine the link between hospital births and maternal

mortality. Loudon (1991) suggests that there are two views that explain differential maternal mortality

rates. The first is that “…high mortality is due to poor obstetric practice and low mortality to good

15
   Other doctors such as J. Whitridge Williams believed that DeLee proposed excessive intervention, a debate that
played out in medical journals in the 1920s (Leavitt 1986, p. 120).
16
   Even if cesarean sections are excluded, the hospital maternal mortality rate falls to 1.07—still 18 percentage
points higher than the maternal mortality rate associated with home births (New York Academy of Medicine 1933,
p. 85).


                                                                                                                17
practice” whereas the second is that the underlying causes of high maternal mortality “…can be found in

the social, economic, and political conditions of a population” (Loudon 1991, p. 34). By attempting to

control for medical inputs as well as the socioeconomic conditions that prevailed at the time, we seek to

shed light on the question of whether or not the shift to hospital births actually benefited women.

         We begin by using city-level data for the period 1927-1940 that allow us to control for different

factors—both medical and socioeconomic—that may have impacted maternal mortality rates.17 To

capture medical factors that may have impacted maternal mortality rates, we include a control for medical

inputs. Ideally, this variable would be measured as the percentage of all births in a city occurring in

hospitals; however, it is not possible to construct this variable for every year in the sample. Instead, we

use hospital beds per 100,000 population to control for medical inputs. Presumably, cities with greater

numbers of hospital beds may have provided greater levels of physician-attended, hospital births for

several reasons. First, the costs (both actual costs and travel costs) of using a hospital may have been

lower in cities with more hospital beds per 100,000. In addition, if physicians are more likely to locate in

areas with greater numbers of hospital beds, then this may have increased the probability that a pregnant

woman sought a physician’s assistance during delivery and thus increased her chance of delivering in a

hospital.

         A priori, it is not clear whether the sign on the estimated coefficient on hospital beds per 100,000

should be positive or negative. Clearly, physicians and mothers believed that hospital births were safer.

Undoubtedly, the lives of some women were saved by the efforts of a physician during difficult births. On

the other hand, we are aware that excessive medical intervention may have claimed lives. It is possible

that the impact of medical inputs on maternal mortality changed during the period of time we are

considering. In particular, with the introduction of sulfa drugs in the spring of 1937, obstetricians were

able to more effectively combat puerperal infections. After sulfa drugs were introduced, doctors could


17
   Ideally, we would like a panel of city level data from 1920-1950 to more fully capture the shift, given that
maternal mortality already begins to fall in the early 1930s. However, consistent city-level information on hospitals
is not available until 1927, and beginning in 1943, only county information is reported on maternal mortality. Thus,
we limit ourselves to the 1927-1940 period.


                                                                                                                   18
intervene with less chance of spreading an infection that would later claim the mother’s life. For this

reason we included a dummy variable indicating observations prior to 1937 as well the interaction

between this variable and hospital beds per 100,000 in order to distinguish between pre- and post-1937

effects of medical care on maternal mortality.

        In order to control for socioeconomic characteristics that may have affected maternal health, we

include county level measures of education, real income per capita, and race. Construction of the

variables is discussed in the data appendix. Education may be important if maternal health practices

influenced maternal mortality. For example, educational deficiencies might also have facilitated the

continuing influence of superstition, folk remedies, and “lay referral” even when modern medical care

and information was available (Beardsley 1987, pp. 32-35). In addition, better educated people appear to

be more behaviorally responsive to health-related information than others (Berger and Leigh 1989,

Kenkel 1991, Meara 2001). The percent of the population that is illiterate is included as a measure of

educational attainment. As a proxy for income, we include real retail sales per capita (Fishback et al

2001). Income may be important for several reasons. First, women with higher incomes may have been

better nourished and thus better able to withstand childbirth and its potential complications. This suggests

that the estimated coefficient on the income variable should be negative. Higher income families may

have also been able to obtain better access to medical care. To the extent that medical care lowered

maternal mortality, this suggests that the estimated coefficient on the income variable should be negative.

However, if medical care did increase the risk of maternal mortality, and to the extent that the hospital

beds per 100,000 variable inadequately captures the impact of medical care on maternal mortality, then

the estimated coefficient on the income variable may be positive.

        The percentage of the population that is black (also from the census) is included to measure the

extent to which racial differences impacted maternal mortality. Finally, women under 16 years of age and

women over 35 are at a greater risk for puerperal complications (Cunningham et al 1997, pp. 570-572).

As a control for this potential maternal health risk we include variables reflecting females in various age




                                                                                                            19
groups as a percentage of women in their childbearing years (ages 15 to 44). Thus, our basic regression

equation is:

                        MMRit = Zitα + Ytθ + [Yt*Zit]π + Xitβ + eit ,

described above. In some specifications we include state dummies to capture any additional effects that

vary across states but were constant over time. Finally, because it could be the case that cities that were

added to the registration areas after 1927 may have had greater levels of maternal mortality and more

incomplete registration of maternal deaths as well as infant births, we run a balanced panel consisting of

only those cities that were in the sample in the first year (1927) and an unbalanced panel consisting of all

cities regardless of when they entered the sample. Table 2 presents summary statistics for the variables.

4.            Results

              Regression results are reported in Table 3. Looking at the results for the balanced panel in column

[1], the estimated coefficient on the beds per 100,000 population variable is negative and statistically

significant, suggesting that beginning in 1937, an increase of 100 beds per 100,000 population resulted in

10.5 fewer maternal deaths per 100,000 births. The estimated coefficient on the beds per 100,000

interaction term is positive and statistically significant, suggesting that prior to 1937, an increase of 100

beds per 100,000 population resulted in an increase of about 7 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births.

These results are consistent with the conjecture that until the late 1930s obstetrical devotion to medical

intervention rendered medical care detrimental to the health of women during the birthing process. The

introduction of anti-infective sulfa drugs and improving obstetrics practices enabled obstetricians to

prevent injury and combat infections induced by their medical interventions later in the 1930s.18 The         TP   PT




     estimated coefficient for the pre-1937 variable indicates that maternal mortality was higher during the


18
TP     Sulfa drugs were effective against puerperal fever, but not as effective as antibiotics. City-level data are not
      PT




     reported beyond 1943, and antibiotics were not widely produced until 1946. However, state level data run for the
     period 1937-1950 (not reported here) show that penicillin had an even stronger impact on reducing maternal
     mortality after 1946.

early to mid 1930s than the rest of the period. Racial differences also appear to have played a role in

maternal mortality; cities with larger black populations had higher levels of maternal mortality. The odd

result in the balanced panel is the negative and statistically significant coefficient on the percent of the

population that is illiterate. There is speculation in the historical literature that maternal mortality may

have been higher among more educated, higher-income women exactly because of the fact that they

tended to use hospitals for births, while less educated, lower-income women may have been less likely to

deliver in hospitals.

          Results for the unbalanced panel are somewhat different. The reason we use the balanced panel is

because it may have been the case that cities added to the birth registration area later might have had

higher rates of maternal mortality. This is consistent with the summary statistics presented in Table 2; the

mean maternal mortality rate for the full sample is 627 deaths per 100,000 births, compared to 598 deaths

per 100,000 births. To a large extent, the cities added later were in the South, where hospital quality may

have been more dubious than in northern cities, and where blacks in particular had a more difficult time

obtaining access to hospitals. Thus, it may not be surprising that the estimated coefficient on beds per

100,000 is not statistically significant. However, the interaction term is again positive and statistically

significant, suggesting that prior to 1937 medical care may have hindered maternal mortality more than it

helped.

          We also estimate separate regressions by race over the same period to gauge whether medical

care had a differential impact on blacks and whites.19 Blacks, particularly in the South, may have had

difficulty gaining access to quality medical care. Black women may have preferred to use black

physicians, who were often excluded from good medical schools and residencies, and denied privileges at

all but black hospitals or hospitals for the indigent, many of which were unable to keep up with rapidly

advancing medical technologies (Smith 1999, p. 21). Even if blacks did not prefer to be attended by black


19
   The number of observations in the race regressions is significantly lower than for the regressions based on the
total population as mortality and birth data were only provided for cities in which the minority population was
greater than 10,000 or 10% of the total population. Also, mortality data by cause of death was not reported by race
at the city level in 1938.


                                                                                                                 21
physicians, they may have been excluded from other hospitals or restricted to segregated facilities that

offered lower quality care, especially in Southern cities (Almond, Chay and Greenstone 2001). If blacks

were restricted in their access of medical care, or if they received substandard care, we would expect to

see a differential effect of medical care on black maternal mortality relative to white maternal mortality.

        Summary statistics by race are provided in Tables 4 and 5. Estimates from the race regressions

are provided in Tables 6 and 7. Overall, results are consistent with those reported in Table 3, suggesting

that hospitals had an adverse impact on maternal mortality for both blacks and whites prior to the advent

of sulfa drugs. There is however, a differential effect of medical care for blacks compared to whites.

Results from both the unbalanced and balanced panels show that the estimated coefficient on the

beds*pre-1937 interaction term is much larger for blacks than whites, which is consistent with the

hypothesis that blacks received lower quality care. Also consistent with this hypothesis is the estimated

coefficient on hospital beds per 100,000. For white mothers, improvements in obstetrics practice and the

use of sulfa drugs lowers maternal mortality; an increase in hospital beds per 100,000 after 1937 lowers

maternal mortality by between 9.5 and 31 deaths per 100,000. For black mothers, medical care does not

have a statistically significant effect on maternal mortality after 1937, suggesting that black mothers may

have received a lower quality of care than white mothers.



5.      Discussion

        Despite the fact that hospital births increased dramatically over the period 1920 to 1950, maternal

mortality rates did not decline until the mid-1930s when sulfa drugs were developed. This paper seeks to

understand the relationship between medical care and maternal mortality. Did maternal mortality rates

remain flat and even increase because of iatrogenic causes? If so, why did women increasingly seek

hospital births for their children? Results based on a sample of city-level data from 1927-1940 provide

support for the hypothesis that medical intervention prior to the advent of sulfa drugs in 1937 increased

maternal mortality rates. From 1927-1936 the number of hospital beds per 100,000 people in a city seems

to have increased maternal mortality, albeit very slightly. However, the development of anti-infectives


                                                                                                            22
such as sulfa drugs did enable doctors to save mothers’ lives in childbirth. In a sense, these drugs made

medical care more effective by not only directly reducing deaths from puerperal fever, but also by

enabling doctors to perform potentially life-saving procedures such as cesarean sections without the risk

of subsequent life-threatening infections.

        Regressions estimated separately by race reinforce the overall results that medical care increased

maternal mortality prior to 1937, but also suggest that the impact of medical care on maternal mortality

differed for blacks and whites. Relative to whites, hospitals posed a greater risk for black mothers prior to

the availability of sulfa drugs in 1937, and were less beneficial for them afterwards, suggesting that blacks

received lower quality medical care.

        If medical care did not contribute to reducing maternal mortality, why did women increasingly

turn to hospitals for childbirth? We can only speculate as to the reasons why the shift occurred, but it

appears that women’s preferences for anesthesia and physician preferences for convenience and higher

incomes played a significant role. In addition, it may be very likely that women were not aware of the

increased risk. Overall, hospitals increased maternal mortality in the late 1920s and early 1930s by only

10 deaths per 100,000 births, a number that few women may have noticed and may have been willing to

overlook given the lack of alternatives and the comfort and convenience offered by hospital birth.




                                                                                                            23
                                           DATA APPENDIX

          Data on maternal deaths and number of live births were obtained from reports on vital statistics
published annually by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. These reports provided data at the city level for
each city with a population of at least 10,000. There were 941 cities consistently represented in these
reports. The maternal mortality variable was constructed by dividing maternal deaths by live births and
multiplying by 100,000. This variable was used as the dependent variable in all regressions.
          The American Medical Association’s annual report on “Hospital Service in the United States”
provided a listing of hospital beds by city. From this report an annual count of hospital beds could be
obtained for each city. City populations for 1920, 1930, and 1940 were obtained from the Fourteenth,
Fifteenth, and Sixteenth U.S. population censuses. Populations for all other years were calculated using a
straight line interpolation between the two closest census years. The hospital beds and city population
data were utilized to construct a hospital beds per 100,000 population variable. This variable was
included in the regressions as an explanatory variable representing medical inputs.
          Socioeconomic variables were constructed based on county level census data. Percent black,
percent illiterate, and percentages of females in different age groups were calculated for 1920, 1930, and
1940. Straight line interpolation was used to obtain values for all other years. The percent black variable
was created based on population data obtained from Historical, Demographic, Economic, and Social
Data: The United States, 1790-1970, ICPSR file 0003, as corrected by Michael Haines. The percent
female variables represent the number of females in each age group as a percent of the female population
from 15 to 44 years of age. These variables were calculated from data provided in Gardner and Cohen’s
ICPSR file 0020 and the Fourteenth U.S. population census. For 1920 and 1930, the percent illiterate
variable was calculated as the percentage of the population aged 10 and older that was illiterate. This data
was captured in the 1920 and 1930 censuses and reported in ICPSR file 0003 as corrected by Michael
Haines. However, beginning in 1940 the illiteracy counts were replaced in the census by years of
schooling completed for people over 24 years old. We were able to combine this data with illiteracy data
by age group and level of education for the entire U.S., obtained from the U.S. Bureau of the Census
(1948, 7), to calculate percent illiterate for 1940. This process involved computing separate national
illiteracy rates for males and females over 24 years old with no schooling (78.2% and 80.7% respectively)
and males and females over 24 years old with one to four years of schooling (22.5% and 16.7%
respectively). Applying these percentages to the census figures for the population aged 25 and older by
sex and years of schooling provided a count of illiteracy from which we could calculate the percent
illiterate. This is the same method utilized by Thomasson (2002) and Fishback et al. (2001).
          The last socioeconomic variable included in the regressions was real retail sales per capita. This
variable was constructed from county level data on population and retail sales. Population data for 1920,
1930, 1940, and 1950 was obtained from ICPSR file 0003 as corrected by Michael Haines. We used
straight line interpolation to obtain population counts for 1929, 1933, 1935, 1939, and 1948. These were
the only years in which retail sales information was available. Retail sales data for 1929 and 1939 were
obtained from ICPSR file 0003 as corrected by Michael Haines. For 1933 and 1935 the data were
acquired from the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Foreign and Domestic Commerce, 1936 and
1939. Lastly, 1948 retail sales figures were pulled from the City and County Data Book Consolidated
File, County Data 1947-1977, ICPSR file 7736. The retail sales per capita variable was calculated
directly for these years and was interpolated for all other years. The interpolation procedure involved a
weighting mechanism based on changes in per capita state income. This was included to reflect the
likelihood that retail sales per capita was closely linked to general economic performance. This variable
was also adjusted for inflation.
