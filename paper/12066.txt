Testing for Racial Differences in the Mental Ability of Young Children

                                             ABSTRACT

On tests of intelligence, Blacks systematically score worse than Whites, whereas Asians frequently

outperform Whites. Some have argued that genetic differences across races account for the gap.

Using a newly available nationally representative data set that includes a test of mental function for

children aged eight to twelve months, we find only minor racial differences in test outcomes (0.06

standard deviation units in the raw data) between Blacks and Whites that disappear with the

inclusion of a limited set of controls. The only statistically significant racial difference is that Asian

children score slightly worse than those of other races. To the extent that there are any genetically-

driven racial differences in intelligence, these gaps must either emerge after the age of one, or

operate along dimensions not captured by this early test of mental cognition.

        Blacks in the United States have consistently scored worse than Whites on tests of

IQ and academic achievement (Shuey, 1958; Jensen, 1973, 1998; McGurk et al., 1982;

Hernstein and Murray, 1994). Among teenagers and adults, the Black-White test score

gap is typically one standard deviation in magnitude. Large racial gaps in test scores

have been found in children as young as two years old (Scott and Sinclair, 1997), and the

one standard deviation racial gap observed later in life is present by age three (Rushton

and Jensen, 2005). Even after accounting for a host of demographic and socio-economic

factors such as parental income, education, occupation, home environment, birth weight,

region, and urbanicity, a substantial Black-White test score gap generally remains.1

Asians, on the other hand, tend to have systematically higher mean test scores than those

of other races (Campbell et al., 1966; Burkett et al., 1995; Rushton, 1995; Fryer and

Levitt, 2004; Brooks-Gunn and Markman 2005).

         Some scholars have argued that the combination of high heritability of

intelligence (typically above .7, see, for instance, Neisser, 1996) and persistent racial

gaps in test scores is evidence of genetic differences across races (Jensen, 1973, 1998;

Rushton and Jensen, 2005). As Nisbett (1998) and Phillips et al. (1998) argue, however,

the fact that Blacks, Whites, and Asians grow up in systematically different environments

makes it difficult to draw strong causal genetically based conclusions.




1
  See, for instance, (Campbell et al., 1966; Baughman and Dahlstrom, 1968 Scarr, 1981; Kaufman and
Kaufman, 1983; Naglieri, 1986; Bracken, Insko and Sabers, 1987; Humphreys, 1988; Krohn and Lamp,
1989; Brooks-Gunn, 1993a; Brooks-Gunn, Duncan and Kelbanov, 1994, 1996; Phillips et al., 1998;
Phillips, 2000; Coley, 2002). A notable exception to this pattern emerges in the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Study Kindergarten (ECLS-K) sample of children who entered kindergarten in 1998. This
nationally representative sample differs from prior data in that the raw Black-White test score gap at the
time children enter kindergarten is substantially smaller than in most prior studies (0.64 standard deviations
in math, and 0.41 standard deviations in reading), and that the inclusion of a small number of demographic
and socio-economic controls erases the gap (Fryer and Levitt, 2004). Although through the first four years
of school, the Black-White test score gap grows substantially, and by the end of third grade these controls
no longer account for the differences in test scores across races (Fryer and Levitt, forthcoming).

                                                                                                            2
         Data on mental function in the first year of life represents a potentially important

piece of evidence to inform this debate.2 To the extent that environmental factors play a

smaller role at early ages (or alternatively, researchers are better able to measure and

control for the environmental factors affecting infants), the presence of an early racial gap

in test scores would bolster the argument in favor of a genetic basis for racial differences.

On the other hand, an absence of racial differences in mental abilities among children age

9-12 months substantially complicates (but does not rule out) a genetic basis for a racial

IQ gap. To the extent that some aspects of adult intelligence only emerge at later stages

of development, or that these aspects go unmeasured in the early test of mental function,

the genetics story cannot be definitively rejected with these data.

          Because of data limitations, prior research has not been able to directly address

this question (Rushton and Jensen, 2005). Studies measuring cognitive abilities of young

children have been small-scale, rare, and based on convenience samples that are not

drawn with the goal of being nationally representative. For instance, many of the samples

involve a limited number of babies born in a particular hospital or metropolitan area

(Gravem, Ireton and Thwing, 1970; Wilson 1983), preterm infants (Rose and Wallace,

1985), those with birth weights less than 1,500 grams (Dezoete, MacArthur and Tuck,

2003), or children with rare medical conditions (McGarth et al., 2004). The Early

Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) is the first large, nationally

representative sample with measures of mental functioning (a shortened version of the

Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID)) for children aged one and under.

2
  The usefulness of early tests of mental function depends critically on the assumption that these tests are
strongly related to future test scores. Measures of cognitive ability at one year of age (similar to those used
in this study) have been found to be strong predictors of test scores later in life by some researchers
(Bradley, Caldwell and Elardo, 1975; Wilson, 1983; DiLalla et al., 1990; McGarth, 2004), although other
studies report a weaker relationship (Honzik, 1983; Rose and Wallace, 1985; Kopp and McCall, 1990;
Anderson, Sommerfelt and Sonnander, 1998). This evidence is discussed in greater detail later in the
paper.

                                                                                                              3
       Analyzing these data, we find extremely small racial differences in mental

functioning of children aged eight to twelve months. With controls only for the child’s

age and gender, the mean White infant outscores the mean Black infant by .064 standard

deviation units – only a tiny fraction of the one standard deviation racial gap observed at

older ages. The raw scores for Blacks are indistinguishable from Hispanics and Asians,

who also slightly under perform Whites. Adding controls for socio-economic status,

home environment, and prenatal circumstances further compresses the observed racial

differences. With these covariates, we cannot reject equality in test scores across any of

the racial/ethnic groups examined, except Asians. In our sample Asian babies do slightly,

but statistically significantly, worse than babies of other races.

       When we calibrate these results to a simple model in which test scores are

affected by both genes and environment, the characterization that best matches the

observed data is one in which there are small mean racial differences in intelligence,

environmental factors become increasingly important determinants of test scores as

children age, and there are large mean racial differences (roughly 1.5 standard deviations)

in environment.

       These findings pose a substantial challenge to the simplest, most direct, and most

often articulated genetic stories regarding racial differences in mental function. They do

not, however, preclude systematic genetic differences across races as an explanation for

later observed test score gaps if, for instance, racial gaps are concentrated in higher-order

thinking which only emerges later in life. The late emergence of racial differences in test

scores is also consistent with the existence of a gene-environment interaction such as

argued by Dickens and Flynn (2001). In their model, a positive feedback loop exists




                                                                                              4
between genes and environment, which over time serves to magnify small initial

differences when genetics and environmental circumstances are positively correlated.

        The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section II describes the data.

Section III presents the basic empirical estimates. Section IV assesses the sensitivity of

the findings to alternative specifications. Section V develops a simple model of genes and

environment and explores the extent to which particular characterizations of the model

are able to reproduce the observed patterns in the data. Section VI concludes.



II. The Data

        The data we analyze, the Early Childhood Longitudinal Survey Birth Cohort

(ECLS-B), is a nationally representative sample of over 10,000 children born in 2001.

The first wave of data collection was performed when most of the children were between

eight and twelve months of age.3 The data set includes an extensive array of information

from parent surveys, interviewer observation of parent-child interactions, and mental and

motor proficiency tests. Further details on the study design and data collection methods

are available at the ECLS website (http://nces.ed.gov/ecls).

        To measure mental proficiency, the ECLS-B uses an abbreviated version of the

BSID known as the Bayley Short Form–Research Edition (BSF-R), which was designed

to measure the development of children eight to eleven months of age in five broad areas:

exploring objects (e.g., reaching for and holding objects), exploring objects with a

purpose (e.g., trying to determine what makes the ringing sound in a bell), babbling, early

problem solving (e.g., when a toy is out of reach, using another object as a tool to retrieve

the toy), and communicating with words. A child’s score is reported as a proficiency

3
 These children will eventually be resurveyed four times between the present and first grade. At the
present time, only the first wave of data is available.

                                                                                                       5
level, ranging from 0 to 1 on each of the five sections. These five proficiency scores

have also been combined into an overall measure of cognitive ability using standard scale

units. Most of our analysis focuses on this overall metric. The test is administered by a

trained interviewer and takes twenty-five to thirty-five minutes to complete.

          Because this particular test instrument is newly designed for ECLS-B, there is no

direct evidence regarding the correlation between performance on this exact test and

outcomes later in life. There is, however, a substantial literature of longitudinal studies

relating BSID test scores of children aged eight to twelve months to tests of intelligence

later in life. Figure 1 provides a graphical representation of the correlations observed in

this prior literature, weighting the estimates of the various papers by the number of

subjects included in each study.4 The horizontal axis is the age in years that the

subsequent tests were administered and the vertical axis contains the average correlation

between the BSID score and another measure of intelligence. The figure shows that the

average correlation between BSID and future IQ scores starts very high and decreases as

children age, stabilizing with an average correlation around 0.3 at approximately five

years of age. For purposes of comparison, when older children are given achievement

scores three years apart, the correlation between scores is on the order of 0.6 (Cruse et al.,

1996).5

          A correlation of .3 between the BSID and future measures of IQ means that the

BSID score explains only nine percent of the variation in future test scores for a

particular individual. Even though one can explain relatively little of the within-person

variation over time in test scores, one would still expect to observe large differences in

 Other infant tests, such as the Cattell Infant Intelligence Scale, Gesell Development Schedules, or Brunet-
Lezine Development Scales, have a substantially lower correlation with later achievement than does the
BSID (Escalona and Moriarty, 1961; Karlberg et al., 1968; Birns and Golden, 1972).

                                                                                                           6
mean test scores by race on the BSID given the prior evidence. Yeates, et al. (1983), for

instance, report a correlation between maternal IQ (assessed using the Wechsler Adult

Intelligence Scale at the time of interview) and the BSID of twelve month old children as

.36. For purposes of comparison, the correlation between maternal IQ (using the same

metric) and the well-known Stanford-Binet at three years old is .39. Given the observed

one standard deviation in maternal IQ between Whites and Blacks, a correlation of .36

between child’s BSID and mother’s IQ would imply expected mean differences between

White and Black one-year olds of .36 standard deviations.6

         The ECLS-B sample includes observations on 10,688 children. For 556 of these

individuals, no mental ability test was performed. These subjects are dropped from the

analysis. This is the only exclusion we make from the sample.7 Throughout the analysis,

the results we report are weighted to be nationally representative using sampling weights

included in the data set.8

         Table 1 provides summary statistics by major racial/ethnic group in ECLS-B.

The mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive racial/ethnic categories we report are:

non-Hispanic Whites (which we simply deem “White”), non-Hispanic Blacks (“Black”),

Hispanics, Asians/Pacific Islander (“Asian”), and other race (which combines children

characterized as Native American, mixed race, or other race). The top panel of the table

reports means and standard deviations by race on the overall measure of mental ability.

For ease of interpretation of the regressions, the overall test score has been normalized to

6
  Indeed, given the results cited in Rushton and Jensen (2005) regarding one standard deviation racial gaps
in IQ tests administered at age 3 and the stability in Black-White differences over time, one might expect to
observe racial differences in the BSID of one standard deviation.
7
  In cases where there are missing values for another of the covariates, we set these missing observations
equal to zero and add an indicator variable to the specification equal to one if the observation is missing
and equal to zero otherwise.
8
  A comparison of the ECLS-B sample characteristics with known national samples such as the US Census
and the Center for Disease Control’s Vital Statistics confirms that the sample characteristics closely match
the national averages.

                                                                                                           7
have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one for the sample as a whole. Whites

score .018 standard deviations better than the sample mean on the overall mental

measure.

         The next panel of the table presents basic demographic characteristics, which are

generally similar across groups. Age at testing is approximately equal across races. As

would be expected, Blacks are over represented in the South and underrepresented in the

West. Asians and Hispanics are seen in greatest numbers in the West. The fraction of

girls and boys are similar across all racial groups.

         The third panel has variables capturing the home environment, including socio-

economic status (SES) quintiles, number of siblings, family structure, mother’s age, and

an interviewer rating of the effectiveness of the “parent as a teacher” based on

observation of parent-child interactions in a structured problem-solving environment.9

The socio-economic status measure is constructed by ECLS and includes parental

income, occupation, and education. Whites and Asians are concentrated in the higher

ranges of the SES distribution; Blacks, Hispanics, and the “other race” category have

below average SES. Roughly 90 percent of White and Asian infants are living in

households with two biological parents compared to only 41 percent among Blacks. On

average, children in our sample have approximately one sibling; Asian children have

slightly fewer and Black kids slightly more. White and Asian mothers tend to be older.

White parents fare better than the other racial groups on the interviewer evaluation of

“parent as teacher” effectiveness.

9
 The “parent as a teacher evaluation” is based on the Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS).
The NCATS scale is composed of 73 binary (yes/no) items that are scored by trained observers. The
NCATS coding system has two main scales: the parent scale, which has 50 items, and the child scale with
23 items. The parent scale of the NCATS focuses on the caregiver’s use of a “teaching loop,” which
consists of four components: (1) getting the child’s attention, and setting up the expectations for what is
about to be done; (2) instruction giving; (3) letting the child respond to teaching; and (4) feedback, on the
child’s attempts to do the task (Nord, 2004). The total parent score can range from 0 to 50 (Yes=1, No=0).

                                                                                                           8
         The final panel of Table 1 presents statistics on the prenatal circumstances of the

children. Extremely low birth weight (<1,500 grams) and premature birth are most

common among Blacks and least frequent for Whites and Asians. Twins and higher

order births are much more frequent among Whites, due primarily to the greater use of

infertility techniques such as in vitro fertilization (Hamilton and McManus, 2004).

         Figure 2 plots the density of BSID test scores by race. The test score distributions

for infants of different races are essentially indistinguishable visually. Note that this is in

stark contrast to the distribution of other measures of intelligence for older children in

prior studies. Figure 2 makes the main point of the analysis. In the regression analysis

that follows, we control for a wide range of other factors, but the basic conclusion

suggested by Figure 2 is unchanged.



III. Racial Differences in the Mental Ability of Young Children

         Our empirical approach involves weighted least squares estimation of equations

taking the general form:

                            MENTAL TESTi =             β r Ri + ΓX i +ε i
                                                   R                         (1)

where i indexes individuals and r corresponds to the racial group to which an individual

belongs. MENTAL TEST reflects either the overall test score, or one of the underlying

components of the test – depending on our particular specification. The vector X captures

a wide range of possible control variables, and is an error term. Also included in all

specifications are interviewer-fixed effects, which adjust for any mean differences in

scoring of the test across interviewers.10


10
  Each of the 13 regions was staffed by one field supervisor and between 14 and 19 interviewers, for a total
of 256 field staff (243 interviewers), who conducted an average of 42 child assessments each. The number

                                                                                                          9
        The basic results for the coefficients on the race variables are presented in Table

2. The omitted race category is “Whites,” so the other race coefficients are relative to

that omitted group. Each column reflects a different regression. The first column

includes only interviewer-fixed effects. As in the raw data, Blacks, Hispanics, Asians,

and “Other” races slightly under perform Whites. Only for Blacks can one reject the null

of no difference at the .05 level.

        As one moves from left to right in Table 2, the set of covariates is progressively

expanded. The coefficients on the other covariates are not shown in the table, but full

estimation results can be found in Appendix Table 2. Column (2) adds controls for age at

which the test is administered and the gender of the child. Because the age the test is

taken is such an important determinant of test performance, we adopt an extremely

flexible, non-parametric functional form for age (including age in days linearly, age in

days squared, all the way up to a quintic in age). The R-squared in the regression jumps

substantially with the inclusion of the age and gender controls (from .14 in the first

column to .68 in the second column); which is mainly due to the age controls. A child

taking the test at age eleven months is predicted to perform .66 standard deviations better

than the same child when tested at age nine months, according to our estimates. Girls

outscore boys by .06 standard deviations on average, a difference that persists throughout

all our specifications. Including these controls improves the performance of Whites

versus other races because Whites are slightly younger on average when tested.

        Column (3) adds indicators for the family’s SES quintile. The SES variable (not

shown in the main table) enters with the expected sign, i.e. higher SES children score

higher on the test, but the magnitude of the effects are small (a top quintile SES child

of interviews per interviewer range from 1 to 156. Almost all interviewers assessed children from different
races (James et al., 2004).

                                                                                                        10
outscores a bottom quintile child by .08 standard deviations). Inclusion of the SES

variable shrinks the coefficient on Black and “other race.”

       Adding a range of other controls for a child’s home environment (family

structure, mother’s age, number of siblings, and region dummies) shrinks the gap

between Whites and each of the other races. The only race coefficient that remains

statistically significant is the underperformance by Asians of roughly .06 standard

deviations. Adding a control for the interviewer assessment of “parent as teacher” in

column (5) further shrinks all of the race coefficients.

       The final column adds controls for a range of prenatal condition variables (birth

weight, premature birth, and multiple births). The coefficient on Black becomes very

close to zero; the other race variables are not greatly affected. All the point estimates are

substantively small: the largest gap, between Asians and Whites, is only .048 standard

deviation units. After Whites, the group performing best is Blacks, although one cannot

reject equality between Blacks and any of the other groups.



IV. Sensitivity Analysis and Extensions of the Basic Analysis

       Although on average we observe only minor differences across races in mental

test performance, important differences in sub-groups of the population remain a

possibility. Table 3 presents a wide range of estimates to test the sensitivity of our basic

results. Each row of the table presents the race coefficients from a separate regression.

In each case, the specification uses the full set of controls included in the final column of

the preceding table.

       The top row of the table simply reproduces the baseline estimates from column

(6) of Table 2. The next row presents unweighted estimates. The subsequent rows


                                                                                            11
segment the table by gender, SES quintile, family structure, region, urbanicity, and birth

weight. Of the 104 coefficients presented, twelve are statistically significant at the .05

level; almost all of these correspond to underperformance by Asians.

       Evidence exists that there are racial differences in early motor skills, with Blacks

outperforming other races and Asians lagging (Malina, 1988; Colombo, 1993; Toy et al.

2000). In our data, both Blacks and Asians outperform Whites on the test of motor skills.

If the early life test of mental abilities depends on both sensorimotor and intellectual

skills, precocity in the former might mask a deficiency in the latter among Blacks.

Therefore, we report results controlling for an individual’s performance on the test of

motor skills. The black coefficient increases from -.002 to -.034 with the inclusion of

motor skills, though the absolute magnitude of the difference continues to be extremely

small. All other racial groups remain essentially unchanged.

       The final sensitivity test we report corresponds to the age at which the test of

mental function is administered. In prior studies, the correlation between BSID tests and

later IQ scores were higher when the BSID was administered to older infants (Bayley,

1955). Thus, if true, racial differences in intelligence are being masked by limitations of

the BSID to ascertain these differences for children at young ages, then we would expect

the racial differences in our sample to be smaller among the youngest children sampled

and larger among the older children sampled. The final rows of Table 3 provides no

evidence of this for Blacks, although for the “other race” category, the gaps are steadily

rising versus Whites with age.



A. Investigating the individual components underlying the composite mental test score




                                                                                             12
       The overall test score is made up of five underlying components: exploration,

exploration with purpose, babbling, problem solving, and word use. Table 4 presents

regression estimates on each of these parts of the test. Each column corresponds to a

different component of the test. The mean level of proficiency and standard deviation in

that mean are reported at the bottom of each column. Note that we have not transformed

the proficiency scores on the sub-tests to have mean zero and standard deviation one, so

the estimates in this table are not directly comparable to those of the two preceding

tables. Because there is so little variation on some of the sub-tests, transforming each of

the tests to have the same standard deviation across children will artificially inflate test

score differences on the sections with little variation (i.e., explores objects and uses

words). Only the race coefficients are shown in the tables. The specifications include the

full set of controls, mirroring column (6) of Table 2. Nineteen of the twenty race

coefficients are negative, implying that in virtually all of the cases the omitted group

(Whites) shows greater proficiency. The magnitudes of the estimates, however, are quite

small: less than one-half a percentage point difference in proficiency in almost all cases.

In only one instance (less babbling done by Asians infants) is the gap between another

group and Whites statistically significant at the .05 level. The only positive estimate in

the table is associated with greater (but not statistically significantly different) babbling

by Blacks. Thus, there is little in the underlying test components to alter the conclusions

suggested by the composite measure of mental function.



V. Interpreting the results through the lens of a simple model of genes and environment

       A number of stylized facts emerge from the analysis and literature reviewed in the

previous sections. In this section, we build a highly stylized model of the factors


                                                                                                13
underlying test scores. We then calibrate the model using research-generated parameter

estimates to determine how successful competing theories are in reconciling the facts

described above.



A. The model

        We model test scores as determined by four factors: intelligence (denoted I),

environment (E), and an error term composed of two parts, a person-age specific error

component (θ) which is constant for an individual taking repeated versions of the test at a

given age, and a random noise term (ε) which varies with each administration of the test.

Both error terms are assumed to be mean zero. The person-age specific error term

captures the fact that different skills are tested at different ages (e.g., at early ages,

babbling is one of the measures, at later ages, how quickly one can complete a maze). An

individual may excel at the particular skills emphasized when testing is done at one age,

in which case the internal validity of the test will be high, but the predictive value for

future test scores (when other skills are emphasized) may be much lower. Formally, we

model the test score S as generated by:

(1)     S it* = α t I it + β t Eit + ε it + θ it

where i indexes individuals and t corresponds to the age at which the test is taken. Our

primary focus is on two periods t, which we denote e (age 8-12 months) and l for “later”

in life (roughly age 5 and beyond).

        The test scores, measure of intelligence, and environmental factors are all scaled

in arbitrary units. Without loss of generality, we normalize the variables I and E to have

mean zero and variance equal to one. For simplicity, we will assume in the formal

modeling that there is a zero covariance between I, E, and the two error terms. We will

                                                                                             14
also assume that cov(θie θil)=0, cov(εie εil)=0, and cov(θit εit)=0 for all t. For simplicity,

we assume that environment and intelligence are uncorrelated, only briefly discussing at

the end of the section the implications for the model of allowing for feedback effects

between intelligence and environment. We do allow for correlations between intelligence

at early and late points in life, and likewise environment may be correlated over time for

an individual.         The coefficients on intelligence and environment are allowed to vary

depending on the age at which the test is taken.

         Intelligence and environment are not directly observable. Rather, we see only a

test score. The test score is also measured in arbitrary units. We transform this test

score, which already has mean zero given the assumptions above, to have variance equal

to one across the population by dividing through by the standard deviation of the test,

calling the resulting variable S it :

                  α t I it + βt Eit + θit + ε it
(2)      Sit =
                 (α t2 + β t2 + λt2 + σ t2 )1/ 2

where λt2 and σ 2 denote the variances of θ it and ε it respectively.

         Given our assumptions above, the internal reliability of the test as measured by

the correlation in test scores when the same person takes the test twice at the same age is

                         α t2 + βt2 + λt2
(3) corr ( Sit , S ) = 2
                   '
                  it
                      α t + βt2 + λt2 + σ t2

         The correlation between an individual’s test scores early in life and when later

tested is given by

                                    α eα l cov( I e , I l ) + β e β l cov( Ee , El )
(4)      corr ( Sie , Sil ) =                                                               .
                                (α + β e2 + λe2 + σ e2 )1/ 2 (α l2 + β l2 + λl2 + σ l2 )1/2
                                   2
                                   e




                                                                                                 15
Because the variance of each of the test scores is normalized to one, the correlation

between the test scores is also the covariance between the test scores.

       Assuming that the same equations determine Black and White test scores and that

the tests are not racially biased (in the sense that θ and ε are mean zero for all races), the

mean racial test score gap at a point at a given age is represented by

                           α t ( IW ,t − I B ,t ) + βt ( EW ,t − EB ,t )
(5)     SW ,t − S B ,t =
                                  (α t2 + β t2 + λt2 + σ t2 )1/ 2

where W and B correspond to White and Black, respectively, and a bar over a variable

represents the sample mean.



B. Reconciling the empirical estimates of the parameters with the model

       The model presented above, in its most general form, imposes few restrictions on

the processes generating the data. For instance, an individual’s intelligence and

environment are allowed to change over time, as is the contribution of each of those

factors in determining the test score. In what follows, we consider the extent to which

more restrictive versions of the model that correspond to plausible theories of nature vs.

nurture are able to reproduce observed patterns in the data.

       Table 5 presents the values that we use as stylized facts in calibrating the model.

The first two rows of the table correspond to the internal reliability of the test.

Andreassen and Fletcher (2005) report an internal reliability of .80 for the BSID test at an

early age. Later intelligence tests have been found to have internal reliability of .94

(White et al., 2004). Another parameter of interest is the correlation between test scores

early and later in life, as captured by equation (4). Based on Figure 2, we assign a value

of .30 to that correlation. Also relevant to pinning down our model is the correlation


                                                                                             16
between test scores when the same individual takes the test later in life, but separated by

several years. We assume a correlation of .60 in that case (Cruse et al., 1996). The

estimated Black-White test score gap at young ages is taken as .06 based on our findings,

compared to a gap of 1.0 at later ages based on prior research (Rushton and Jensen,

2005). The measured correlation between test scores early and late in life and parental

test scores is also useful to the analysis. Based on prior research, we take these two

correlations as .36 and .39 respectively.

        The primary puzzle raised by our results is the following: how does one generate

small racial gaps on the BSID test scores administered at ages 8-12 months and large

racial gaps in tests of mental ability later in life, despite the fact that these two test scores

are reasonably highly correlated with one another ( =.3), and both test scores are

similarly correlated with parental test scores ( >.35)?



Model 1: Intelligence and environment are constant over time

        The simplest version of the model is one in which an individual’s intelligence and

environment stay fixed over time, and the relationship between the test score and these

two factors is the same both early and later in life. Mathematically, in such a model, Iie=

Iil, Eie= Eil, e= l, and        e=   l,.   To solve the model, it is also convenient to assume that

λe2 = λl2 . Given these restrictions and noting the observed correlation in the data,

equation (4) above simplifies to

                                                      α2 + β2
(4’)    corr ( Sie , Sil ) =                                                              = .30
                               (α 2 + β 2 + λ 2 + σ e2 )1/ 2 (α 2 + β 2 + λ 2 + σ l2 )1/2

Rearranging equation (3) and imposing the observed levels of internal reliability for the

tests administered early and late in life yields


                                                                                                      17
                                α 2 + β 2 + λ2
(3’) α 2 + β 2 + λ 2 + σ e2 =
                                      .80

                                 α 2 + β 2 + λ2
(3’’) α 2 + β 2 + λ 2 + σ l2 =
                                      .94



Substituting (3’) and (3’’) into the denominator of equation (4’) eliminates σ e2 and σ l2

from (4), yielding

              α2 + β2
(6)                              = .345 .
         (α 2 + β 2 + λ 2 )

        In order for this simplest model to reconcile the high internal reliability of the

tests with the much lower correlations for an individual across ages, almost two-thirds of

the variance in test scores at a point in time is being driven by the person-age specific

error term, rather than by intelligence or environment. Since the impact of intelligence

and environment are held fixed, the only thing that varies over time is the person-age

specific error term. The necessary variance in the person-age specific error term required

to fit the data would appear to be far too large to be realistic. Furthermore, in this

simplest of models, the racial test score gap observed early and late in life should be

similar, which is not the case. Consequently, the data are inconsistent with a simple

characterization in which both the level of an individual’s intelligence and environment

remain fixed over time and the importance of those factors in determining test scores.



Model 2: Intelligence has not yet emerged early in life

        An alternative model is one in which an individual’s intelligence has not yet fully

developed at age 1, but otherwise the restrictions in the simple model are maintained. In

the most extreme conceptualization of this view, one would assume that Iie=0 for all

                                                                                             18
individuals. Such a model can generate a small racial test score gap early in life and a

one-standard deviation gap later in life if I W ,l > I B ,l . This model still implies a large

variance on the person-age specific shock. Most importantly, the model cannot explain

how one observes a similar degree of correlation between parental test scores and their

children’s test scores both early and later in life. Given the high degree of heritability in

intelligence, one would expect that if early test scores do not reflect intelligence, then

they should correlate much less strongly with parental test scores than later tests.11



Model 3: Intelligence remains fixed; environment grows in importance over time

         One simple parameterization of the model that can generate results that are more

consistent with the observed correlations is one in which (1) intelligence remains fixed

for an individual over time, (2) the early and late test scores are equally influenced by

intelligence, and (3) the importance of environmental factors grows with age.12 A

mathematical characterization of these assumptions implies Iie= Iil,                    e=   l,   e=0,   and

 l>0.   As in the earlier model, for convenience we will impose λe2 = λl2 , although this

assumption could be relaxed. Under these assumptions equation (4) becomes

                                                 α2
(4’’) corr ( Sie , Sil ) = 2                                                  = .30 .
                          (α + λ 2 + σ e2 )1/ 2 (α 2 + β l2 + λ 2 + σ l2 )1/2

Solving for σ e2 and σ l2 using the internal validity of the tests leads to


11
   One possible line of argument in favor of such a model would be that early in life parents exert an
enormous influence on the child’s environment, and that there is a strong correlation between the parent’s
early environment and the child’s. Arguing against this conjecture is the relatively weak impact of
observable dimensions of environmental factors like SES in our test score regressions. Furthermore, since
the internal reliability of the early test score is lower, a similar correlation between parental test scores and
a child’s test scores early and later in life actually implies an even stronger correlation between parental and
child early in life, if we are able to measure the child early and late in life.
12
   Alternatively, one can allow for the environmental impact to be similar early and late in life, with Black
and White environments being similar on average early in life, but with Blacks experiencing much worse
environments later in life.

                                                                                                               19

The racial test score gaps early and late in life are respectively

                             1.031*(α t2 + β l2 + λ 2 )1/ 2

         To close the model, we make the additional assumption that all of the variation in

test scores when children take the test later in life but three years apart (such test scores

are correlated .60) is due to the error terms, rather than changes in intelligence or

environment. This assumption will tend to exaggerate the magnitude of λ 2 . That final

assumption yields a final equation

                                   α 2 + βl2
(10) corr ( Sil , Sil +3 ) =                          = .60 ,
                             1.064*(α 2 + βl2 + λ 2 )

where we have already solved out for the ε term in equation (10) using the internal

reliability of the test later in life.

         Equations (7)-(10) contain five unknowns ( α , βl , λ , and the mean racial gaps in I

and E). Without loss of generality, we can restrict α=1, with β and λ now scaled relative

to α,13 leaving four equations and four unknowns. Tedious algebraic manipulation yields

a solution to this set of equations such that

α * = 1, β * = 1.145, (λ 2 )* = 1.144, ( I w − I B )* = .102, and ( Ew − EB )* = 1.624 .

         This model is able to generate the observed racial test score gaps both early and

late in life, and it does so with a smaller, more realistic variance on the person-age

13
  This can be seen by multiplying both the numerator and denominator of the left-hand sides of equations
(7)-(9) by 1/α.

                                                                                                       20
specific error term.14 This model can also reproduce the high levels of internal reliability

of the tests, fit the .30 correlation between early and later test scores, and plausibly

generate similar correlations between parent and child test scores early and later in life.15

         In this model, a one-standard deviation change in environment has roughly the

same impact on test scores as does a one-standard deviation change in intelligence. The

required mean difference in environment between Blacks and Whites is slightly more

than 1.5 standard deviations. This magnitude of environmental difference, while large,

does not seem implausible. Using estimates from Fryer and Levitt (2004), there is a .75

standard deviation difference between Blacks and Whites in socioeconomic status, .83

standard deviations in the number of children’s books in the home, 1.30 standard

deviation difference in female-headed households, 1.51 standard deviation difference in

whether or not one feels safe in their neighborhood, a 1.5 standard deviation difference in

the percentage of kids in their school who participate in the free lunch program, and a

1.31 difference in the amount of loitering reported around the school by non-students.16

Adding to this the possible role of difficult to measure factors such as racial

discrimination or behavioral differences discouraging achievement (e.g. Austen-Smith

and Fryer, 2005), makes a 1.5 standard deviation difference in environment between

Blacks and Whites quite conceivable.


14
   Whereas in the earlier model the person-age specific error term had to represent more than two-thirds of
the overall variance in test scores, in this model, about one-third of the variance comes from this source.
15
   Early in life, all of the variation in test scores is driven by intelligence, which is highly heritable,
generating a parent-child correlation. Later in life, the intelligence channel continues to operate, but there
is an additional effect operating through environment. If the cross-generation correlation in environment
was as strong as that in intelligence, then one would expect to observe a higher correlation between later
test scores and parental test scores than is the case for early tests. In practice, however, the cross-
generation correlation in environment is much weaker than that for intelligence. Consequently, one could
plausibly generate similar correlations between a parent’s test score and a child’s test score early and late in
life in this model.
16
   All estimates are derived by taking the difference in the mean of a variable between Blacks and Whites
and dividing by the standard deviation for Whites. The socioeconomic composite measure contains parental
income, education, and occupation.

                                                                                                             21
More complicated models

       In practice, it is likely that the true model generating the data incorporates

elements of both of the last two models discussed: allowing for intelligence to be only

partially formed at the time of the early test, and letting the importance of environment

grow with age. Such a model would allow us to fit the basic facts of the data, but with

smaller estimate on the coefficient on environmental differences. Allowing for gene-

environment interactions as in Dickens and Flynn (2001), which introduces a multiplier

effect with age, would further move the model in that direction.



VI. Discussion

       The debate over racial differences in intelligence is among the most divisive in

the social sciences. Utilizing a newly available, nationally representative data set with

measures of mental function among children before their first birthday, we find little

evidence of systematic racial differences. Some substantively small, but statistically

significant differences are present in the raw data. Including controls for age, socio-

economic status, home environment and prenatal environment largely erase these small

differences. A simple calibration exercise suggests that many of the basic facts in the

data can be generated from a model in which there are small mean differences in

intelligence across races, but large environmental differences across races that become

increasingly important as children age.

       Comparing the magnitude of differences observed in these data to prior studies of

children, teens, and adults puts into perspective how small the observed differences are in

this analysis of infants. Phillips et al. (1998), which investigates test outcomes among


                                                                                            22
kindergarteners in the early cohorts of the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey

of Youth (NLSY), finds some of the smallest published racial gaps. They report a raw

Black-White gap of over one standard deviation, which shrinks to one-third of a standard

deviation with the inclusion of myriad controls. Those gaps are an order of magnitude

larger than what we find among infants.17

         Although damaging to the hypothesis that genetic differences are at the root of

racial gaps in intelligence, the results of our analysis do not preclude a possible role for a

genetic contribution to racial differences in intelligence for a number of reasons. First,

one could reasonably argue that the control variables we include in the regression

analysis are themselves partly genetically determined. By controlling for factors such as

socio-economic status and birth weight (which systematically differ across races), we

may indirectly be parsing out important channels through which genetics are operating.

The fact that the raw differences in test performance across races are so small, however,

makes this argument largely moot.

         A second possible argument one can make against our findings is that the

particular form of the BSID used in ECLS has not been proven to correlate with future

measures of intelligence. The relationship between other forms of the BSID and later test

scores calls this argument into question. Nonetheless, the answer to this inquiry cannot

be definitively determined in this data set at the present time. In principle, however,

retesting the subjects as they age provides a means of resolving this question.

         A third argument in defense of the genetic story is that the BSID test is racially

biased in favor of Blacks. This is an issue worthy of further testing, although the fact that


17
   As noted earlier, one possible explanation for the growing racial gap with age is a genetics-environment
interaction as proposed by Dickens and Flynn (2001).


                                                                                                         23
small racial differences are observed across the four different skills that comprise the test

is circumstantial evidence against this claim.

   A final argument in defense of the genetic story would be one in which the racial

differences are concentrated in higher order thinking (or general intelligence, “g”, see

Jensen, 1998) which may not yet have emerged among one year olds. Unlike the

argument in the preceding paragraph, it is not clear that such a hypothesis is easily tested

even with the passage of time.

NOTES: The entries are means and standard deviations of child-level data for those children in ECLS-B who
do not have missing values for test scores. Test scores are a mental composite score, normalized to have a mean
of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The category “White” includes only non-Hispanic Whites. Precise
definitions of the variables are provided in the data appendix. The SES measure incorporates information on
parental education, occupational status, and family income. Days premature is conditional on being premature.
The total number of children in the sample who receive a positive weight in the estimation is 10,132. In all
cases, sample weights provided with ECLS are used in the calculations.

NOTES: The dependent variable is the mental composite score, which are normalized to have a mean of 0 and a
standard deviation of 1 in the full, unweighted sample. Non-Hispanic Whites are the omitted race category, so
all of the race coefficients are gaps relative to that group. The unit of observation is a child. Standard errors are
in parentheses. Estimation is done using weighted least squares, using sample weights provided in the data set.
In addition to the variables included in the table, indicator variables for children with missing values on each
covariate are also included in the regressions. All regressions include interviewer fixed effects.

NOTES: To generate relevant literature, Pubmed, EBSCOhost and JSTOR were searched for all years. Keywords used for the search included, “Bayley Scale of
Infant Development,” “BSID, “predictive power,” “correlation,” and “IQ” – which generated a list of roughly 2,000 references. Among these, we selected
according to the following criteria. (1) the test of infant cognition was the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID); (2) The “future” test age was
administered more than 2 years after the infant measure was taken (correlations at 12 and 18 months were obtained from Wilson 1983); (3) the initial BSID had
to be administered between 6 and 12 months of age; (4) the sample had to be “representative” – we omitted studies with subjects afflicted by major health issues
(e.g., heart disease, Down syndrome, mental retardation) or severe complications at birth (i.e. pre-term, mother used drugs or alcohol); and (5) only studies done
in the United States were used. The final compilation contained 14 studies.
