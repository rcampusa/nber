             DO UNION WEALTH CONCESSIONS EXPLAIN TAKEOVER PREMIUMS?
                         THE EVIDENCE ON CONTRACT WAGES


                                      ABSTRACT

     I                                                          associated with
         estimate   changes in levels of union real wage growrh

            takeovers   and accompanying   chief executive   officer changes.   Ihe
corporate

effects are statistically insignificant.        The results are used to construct

union wealth changes assotiated with corporate control events.          Target fire

shareholder wealth premiums are estimated using a simple market model.           The


union and shareholder wealth changes are compared,       and I conclude that

transfers of wealth from unions to shareholders ate not an economically

significant explanation of shareholder wealth premiums.

     Empirical    studies show that tsrget firm shareholder wealth increases      when

a takeover occocsj      The sources of the wealth increase sre not well

understood.     Most explanations of takeover premiums fall into one of two

categories:     efficiency or transfer.   The efficiency hypothesis states that

newly expected reallocation of poorly performing resources into more highly

valued uses causes upward revision of the expected return to owning those

resources.     The share price   is bid up, and target firm shareholders    receive

the premium.     The alternative, or transfer, hypothesis attributes target firm

shareholder wealth increases to transfers from other parties with an interest

in the firm.     The transfers are expected to occur as a result of the takeovec,

and this expectation raises share prices.       Both explanations may play a role

in the observed target firm shareholder wealth gains.       Other hypotheses

attribute     takeover premiums to increased product market power2 or

irrationality     in stock pricing.

     This study uses both stock market and contract wage data to determine the

extent to which target firm shareholder wealth increases are accounted for by

transfers from unions.      The changes in union wage growth associated with

takeovers and accompanying chief executive officer      (CEO) changes3 are

estimated and the implied union wealth changes associated with takeovers ate

calculated.      These wealth changes are then compared to the corresponding

wealth changes experienced by target firm shareholders in association with

takeovers.

      For corpanies    traded on the New York or American Stock Exchanges and for

which the Bureau of National Affairs reported at least one union contract

settlement between 1976 and 1987, the data indicate the following          regarding

the effect of takeovers and CEO changes on the level of the rate of growth of

real wages measured in percentage terms:       the lower bound for a takeover
                                                2

accompanied by a CEO change is about —1% per year.              Hence if real wage growth

for the firm was .5% per year prior to the takeover/CEO change, it would be

—.5% per year afterwards.        The lower bound for a takeover alone is about —.6%

per year.   The upper bounds are, roughly,           +3%   following   a takeover alone, and

no effect for a takeover with a CEO change.

     Lower bound estimates       come from regressions       that do not allow sector—

apecific takeover effects,       so they are essentially sample mean effects.         Tho

lower bounds are statistically       insignificant.        Upper bounds come from

specifications   that allow sectoral disaggregationof effects.              Upper bound

estimates vary both between sectors and within sector across specifications,

but within the largest sectors (durables and non—durables manufacturing)

estimates are statistically       significant       end generally more stable than for ths

lower bounds.

     The wage effects are economically          insignificant    in the sense that tho

implied union wealth gains or losses are small relative to shareholder              wealth

gains at the time of a takeover announcement.              Under assumptions designed to

give the transfer hypothesis the greatest chance of success and using

statistically    insignificant    parameter estimates       from specifications nor

favored by the data, the median value of the shareholder wealth
                                                                gain that can

be explained by union concessions is 12%.             When the same assumptions are used

in conjunction with results least favorable to the transfer hypothesis, union

wealth actually increases following a takeover, by up to 4% of the value of

the shareholder wealth premium.        Given these extremes and the assumptions          that

generate them, I conclude that transfers of union wealth do not explain target

firm shareholder gains.

     The paper haa aix sections.         Section T summarizes    related literature    and

indicates the contribution of this paper.         Section II describes     the data.


Section III addresses the representativeness        of the sample.     Section IV


presents the empirical findings regarding contract wage growth rates and

takeovers.    Section V compares union wealth changes associated with takeovers

to target firm shareholder wealth changes.         Section VI draws conclusions.




Section I.

     Theories regarding the market for corporate control support both the

transfer and efficiency hypotheses        for takeover premiums.     From the

shareholder's    point of view, management performs poorly in two ways:           either

resources    are inefficiently   used, or the portion of the wealth genersted by

the ongoing operations of the firm distributed           to shareholders   is too smal.l.


Monitoring coats can cause either sort of poor performance to be tolerated by
shareholders to some degree.4 If performance is sufficiently bad that a third

party expects the gain from taking over the firm and improving performance              to

exceed the cost of the takeover, the market for corporate control provides

external disciplining     incentives.5     Competition    in the msrket for corporate

ownership ensures that tsrget firm share prices sre bid up to reflect the

expected increase in the value of owning those shares in the post—takeover

environment     (less the costs of the takeover).6

     Event studies of takeovers do not generally           address the reasons for the

takeover directly, but they do strongly support the role of the market for

corporste    control in transferring to current shareholders        the present value of

some expected incresse in income from owning an asset.            Some explanations,

such as that of Manne (1965), attribute the lsrge premiums to efficiency.
                                           4

However,    there are relatively   few empirical    atudiea that try to addreas

efficiency.     Lichtenberg and Siegel (1987, 1989) find evidence for increased

productivity following ownership changea.          They examine meaaurea auch as total
factor productivity using large samplea of eatablishment level Cenaua Bureau

data.     Ravenscraft and Scherer (1988) reach the opposite conclusion in an

examination of pre— and post—merger performance based on accounting measures

of profitability. Healy, Palepu, and Ruback (1989)
                                                   argue that cash—flew is a
better accounting measure of poat—merger
                                         performance.         They find post—merger
improvements in asset productivity.

        Other authors have emphasized the role of transfers in
                                                               explaining
shareholder wealth increases.      The potential sources of wealth for such

transfers    include the following:   unions (which will be examined here) and

other employees;7 bidding firm                       the government
                               shmreholders;8                         (in the form of
tax benefits which could not be realized without the
                                                     takeover);9 mansgementj°

over—funded pension funds that msy be raided by new
                                                    management;11 bondholders,
if the risk of default on
                          pre—existing bonds is increased by the takeover (as
when a highly leveraged takeover is based on junk—bond
                                                       financing); and

suppliers   of inputs other than labor.    Most careful empirical studies of

potential   sources of transfers have not found systematic                     across
                                                                explanations

msny takeovers of more than a small fraction of the takeover premium.

     The additional piece of the puzzle examined here, the role of union

wealth concessions, has been emphasized by Shleifer and Summers
                                                                (1988).           They
consider the welfare and efficiency implications of hostile takeovers which

impair the ability of managers and employees to form implicit contracts.
                                                                                  They
make two arguments supporting the notion that hostile takeovers are

inefficient.    First,
                                           5

       To take advantage of implicit contracts, shareholders must be trusted by
       potential stakeholders.  Otherwise  stakeholders would expect breach
       whenever it raises the firm's value and would never enter into implicit
       contracts.   (p38)

A   hostile takeover is one in which new managers replace old managers and

breach implicit contracts.      The fact that such an event may occur leads to ox

ante inefficiency as the ability to contract implicitly is compromised.             This


proposition is difficult to test as all firms face the same environment in the

market for corporate control and observable differences pre— and post—takeover

are   not relevant.
       Second,    they argue that breaches can cause ex post inefficiency.     They

examine two aspects of this story:       first, problems such as informational

asymmetries      between the new owner and employees in an environment of lack of

trust lead to inefficient contracting.         Second, transfers may account   for a

large fraction of the shareholder wealth premium.         When both of these

conditions hold, there is ex post inefficiency.

       The weakness in the Shleifer and Summers argument      is that transfers     may

not explain the premium.       If factors such as increases in productive

efficiency in dimensions other than labor explain the premium, then the net

effect of the takeover could be a substantial efficiency increase.          Hence

establishing the magnitude of transfers is important to the ex post

inefficiency      case.

       Shleifer and Summers do not restrict their analysis to union concessions.

However,   if takovers occur in order to appropriate      rents, then the

breach/transfermodel they posit should leave a trace in observed union wages.

       This paper contributes to the takeover literature by providing an
additional piece of evidence regarding the aourcea of observed target firm

stock value premiums.



Section II.

        This section describes the data sources and the construction of the data

set used here, and it provides tables of descriptive statistics.             The

principal     sources of data used in this study are the tureau of National

Affairs'      (BNA) Collective Bargaining Negotiations and Contracts (CBNC)12 fiia,

which records the details of labor contract settlements, and the University of

Chicago's Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) files, which cover

stock prices, quantities, and related information.            These aourcea jointly

determined the primary sample analyzed in the next section and supplied the

basic information necessary for calculating employee and shareholder               wea].th.

The unit of observation on the ENA file is a contract settlement between a

company (or employer organization)          and a union.   The principal data items used

from the BNA file were company and union identifiers, an industry code (SIC),

the settlement,     effective,    and expected expiration dates of the contract

(expected      length is calculated as expected expirationdate minus effective

date)       the wage at   the end of the previous   (expiring) contract   (W0), immediate
        ,




and scheduled deferred wage increases and the dates on which they became

effective,     information regarding      cost of living adjustment (COLA) clauses, and

the number of employees        covered.   CRSP company identification numbers

(CUSIPsP3 were matched to the BNA records by hand using as much relevant

identifying information as possible from both sources.           The resulting sample

of 5,353 contracts signed by 1,009 companies over the period                            1976
                                                             January               1,

to June 30, 1987 includes all companies for which at least one contract
                                           7


settlement was reported by the ENA between January 1976 and June 1987, and

which could be matched to the CRSP tapes covering the New York Stock Exchange

                                                                               Hence
(NYSE) and the American Stock Exchange      (AMEX) through December,   1986.

both wage and stock information are available for all observations        in the


sample

     Jage profiles, rates of wage growth, and contract costs over the lives of

the contracts    were produced using the 8NA data and auxiliary   information.     In

general, I assume that expectations    formed at the time of the contract

settlement follow the simple rule that growth rates will persist at the levei

observed over the 12 months prior to the settlement.       The nominal wage profile

starts with W0, the wage at the end of the previous contract (as recorded by

the ENA at the time of the settlement), and information regarding         the contract

settlement is used to project the wage level in each month of the contract.

                                                 P36 in addition to P0.
For example,    a 36 month contrsct has P1                                 The

projected wage profile reflects sll immediate and scheduled deferred wage

incresses    as of the dates specified in the contract,   and the COLA if it is

present snd active.     The COLA is evaluated using the 1967—based CPI and, as

described above, the assumption that, at the time of the contract settlement,

inflation    is expected to persist at the rate observed over the previous 12

months.14 The real wage profile,      w,   is constructed from the nominal pcofile

using the CPI and the same assumption concerning      the expected rate of

inflation.      The annual percentage growth tste of the real wage over the

contract was calculated as
                                                        8

                                       w      (12/36)

for a contract with and expected length of 36 months, and similarly for other

lengths.

     The expected contracc cost per employee for each month,                     t,    of the

contract, was calculated using the projected wages and auxiliary                        information:




                        x (H+l5xOT) x (l+F) x 4.3452
             C

                                   +




where        is the nominal wage in month t of the contract, H is hours worked, UT

is overtime hoursj5 F is the value of fringe benefits16 as a fraccion of

payroll, 4.3452 is weeks per month, r is Moody's Baa corporate                        bond yield in

the month of the settlement (converted to a                                        M
                                            monthly rate), and                          is a

correction for the time (in months) from the settlement to the effective date

of the contract       (H,   OT, and F are all merged to the concract observations                 by

two—digic    SIC in the year of the settlement)               .   Hence   C is the expected
current dollar present value of the contract coat                                     as of the
                                                  per employee,
settlement    date, for month c of the contract.                  The monthly costa can then be

aummed to produce the preaent value of the total contract coat or the coat for

any sub—periodwithin the contract.                  Real dollar figures use the CPI for

deflation.

     Table 1 auaimarizea the constant (1967) dollar wage, wage growth, and

contract coat figures.         The number of contracts obaerved by year and sector
                                             9

can also be seen in this table.         Employment weighted means and standard

deviations are shown for all 5,353 observations       as well as for each year


(grouped by the aettlement date of the contract)       ,
                                                           whether   the contract was in


manufacturing (SIC's 20—39) or not, and a further disaggregation into seven

aectors.    The wage at the end of the previous contract (W0) and percentage

annual wage growth figures jointly contain much of wage information            from the

BNA in compact fotm.        Both ace used in the regression specifications of

Section IV.    The wage growth figure serves as the dependent variable, and

is used in conditioning variables.         In addition, Table 1 ahows the present

value of the contract cost per employee—year        in thousands of 1967 dollars.

The union wealth changes calculated in Section       V     are based, in part, on these

numbers.

        Figures 1 and   2   give a visual presentation of the wage level and wage

growth information in Table 1 for all companies, and manufacturing            and non—

manufacturing firms separately.         Figure 1 shows the yearly (employment

weighted)   average real wage level at the end of the previous contract, and

Figure 2 shows the corresponding        real wage growth over the new contract.      The

variation in wage levels from year to year reflects both real factors, which

are evident in the decline in wage growth seen in Figure 2, and the sectoral

composition of new wage settlements, which varies substantially from year to

year.     The last seven columns of Table 4 show the sectoral variation over time

in terms of employees        covered.

        Figures 3 and 4 present the same information at a finer degree of

sectoral disaggregation.         The main reason for presenting these figures is to

show that most sectors behave similarly over this time—period, but also that

airlines are evidently quite different from the other sectors.             Part of the
                                             10

difference in wage levels can be explained by the occasional appearance of a

pilots' union contract, with wages an order of magnitude higher than other

wages in the data set.      However,    this explanation   is not so satisfactory for

rates of real wage growth, which, as Figure 4 shows, persist at levels much

greater than all other sectors for most of the sample period.            As will he

elaborated below, this data set is deficient with regard to post—takeover

contract settlements      in the airline industry, but the patterns presented in

Figures   3   and 4 suggeet that, even if results could be obtained for airlines,

they would not be broadly representative          of industry overall.

     Table 2 provides a rough check of the wage profile predictions.             It

compares the realized levels of wages at contract expirations            (W0) in a given

year with the predicted levels from contracts settled in previous years and

due to expire in the given year.         This rough check of the data indicates that

the predicted wage profiles end up close to observed values just prior to the

start of subsequent contracts.         Apart from the first predicted figure, which
is based on just 34 observations, the largest differences occur for contracts

signed before and expiring during or just after the receseion of the early

1980's.       This is not surprising as expected and realized inflation (and other

factors) differ over these years.

     Takeover and related event information was developed as followa:             using
the CRSP tapes, a list was produced of all companies          in the sample for which

trading was suspended      at any time after January 1973.      This list served as the

basis for collecting auxiliary files regarding takeovers and related events.

Takeover event dates and information regarding hostility,'7 CEO18 and other

top management changes in conjunction with the takeover, acquirer,            and form of

acquisitionwere recorded from the Wall Street Journal Index (WSJI)

(1973—1987)      Completion of takeover date and acquirer were obtained from the

Commerce Clearing House, Capital Changes Reporter (1988).          Announcement    date,

completion date, acquirer,     and various comments regarding     the bid were

recorded from    VT.   Grimm & Company, Mergerstats Review (1981—1987).        All data

sources were compared for corroboration        of announcement   and completion of

takeover dates.     In cases of inconsistency between sources, the source with

the most explicit date and event—type     reference was used for analysis.          This

rule dictated the use, in general, of announcement dates          from the WSJI and

completion dates from Capital Changes Reporter.         WSJI completion dates or

Grimm's announcement or completion dates were used on occasion,          if they

appeared to be more reliable in the given case.

     The auxiliary files were used to merge the following corporate            control

events and dates to the contract information: takeovers,          hostility in the

takeover process,      and CEO changes associatedwith the takeover.       Table    3


summarizes    the event indicators.   Of the 1,009 companies represented in the

data set, 288 were taken over after January 1973.         In 43 cases, the WSJI

indicated that the takeover was 'hostile' and that in 68 cases, a CEO change

accompanied the takeover.      The table also shows the distributions      of contracts

(as a single company can generate more than one contract at a time) with

events indicated.       The event information is set up to indicate not just that

the event occurred, but whether it occurred before or after the current

contract settlement date.       Only the first two contracts following the takeover

are considered.     Very few contracts are observed beyond that point, and it               is


reasonable to expect that if takeovers occur because of the possibility                of

wage reductions,    then a significant effect (economically       as well as

statistically)    should be evident within the first six to nine years following
                                            12

the takeover.     The indicators for CEO and other management changes associated

with a takeover take on the value 1 only if the takeover indicator also takes

on the value    1, so these   indicators   capture the marginal effect of, for

example,    a CEO change, given that a takeover occurredJ9




Section III.

       This section discusses    the representativeness   of the sample.   The sample

covets a large proportion of both the total unionized work force in the U.S.

and of all firma traded on the NYSE or AMEX.        Furthermore,   the frequency of

takeovers    does not appear to differ greatly between the sample and the CRSP

population.     Unfortunately, the number of observed contracta declines

following a takeover.     This may bias the results presented in the following

sections, but there is some evidence that the potential        biaa ia not aevere.

       The aample covers a substantial portion of the total unionized work force

in the U.S.     Table 4 shows the number of employees     covered by contracts   signed

in each year of the sample (column 3) and the number of union members in the

U.S.    in the same year (column 2).       All figures in the table are in thousands

of union members.     As moat contracta laat three years,20 the number of

employees covered in the SNA data in a given year can be estimated by summing

the total coverage figures over three year windows        (column 4).   Column 5 shows

the number of union members covered in the BNA data as a percentage of total

U.S.    union membership in the aame year.       More than 15% of the unionized work—

force is covered in this study.

       The 1,009 companies in the sample cover only about one fifth of the

companiea    listed on the CRSF tapea covering the NYSE and the AMEX (the CRSP

tapea covered 5,019 through 1986, but the number with valid information          during

deleted from the tapes)   .   Under the hypothesis    that takeovers   occur at least

                                                         takeovers might be more
partly in response to rent—seeking opportunities,

            among more highly unionized firms.       The takeover information used

for the empirical   analysis presented in the next section is not exactly

frequencies as the Chi—square      test for homogeneity between the groups is only

significant at the .30 level.

     A potentially serious drawback in this data set is that fewer contracts

are observed following takeovers      than before.    Identifying   target company

contracts   in the post—takeover environment was done both by matching the names

of units which retained their pre—takeover names and by checking contracts

signed with acquiring companies      to see if any could be re—assigned to the

original company.    The former procedure was most likely possible for divisions

of target firms which were taken over and then continued to operate as a

division of the acquiring firm while retaining their original names.               The

latter procedure resulted in only a few additional post—takeover contracts.

feel that most of the contracts      that could be positively identified as being

between the former target company and one of its unions were discovered by

these methods.

      Despite these efforts, the number of contracts        observed per year at risk

of reporting declines following a takeover.          This measure has the advantage of

controlling   for the length of time over which reporting       occurs.     For a company
                                           14

not taken over, the measure of contract observations per year at risk is

               where
01=N1/ll.5,            N1 is the number of contracts observed for the given

company,    and 11,5 is the number of years from 1/1/76 to 6/30/87.         For a

company with a takeover, two additional statics are calculated:            02—N2/T2,

where N2—contracts     prior to the completion   of the takeover,    and T2=the number

of years from 1/1/76 to the completion of the takeover; and 03=N3/T3, where

Ny—contracts    following   the takeover, and T3=the number of years from the

completion of the takeover to 6/30/87.

     Table 6 shows the distributions     of these three statistics by giving the

values of each at each quartile and extreme values,       and the mean and standard

deviation for each.      The mean number of contracts observed per year declines

by about half following a takeover.      This would be an indication of a serious

sample selection bias if the decline were due to dramatic reporting declines
for some firms and no decline for others.        In this case, wage growth rates

could be highly correlated with reporting (if, for example, union—busting

takeovera   occur), causing a sample selection bias.      However,   if average

observed contracts per year decline for all firms equally following the

takeover,   then such a bias would only be present if there was great variation

in the effect of the takeover on wage growth within each firm, and the

contracts with lower wage growth were the ones not                    As the next
                                                   reported.

section will show, there is little evidence that wage growth reductions are

associatedwith the contracts actually observed following takeovers.               Given

this, the presence of other contracts     from the same firms that feature both

much larger wage reductions and non—reporting seems unlikely.          A   more

plausible explanation for the case of proportional declines in observed
                                             15

contracts    is that matches are simply more difficult to make as the identifying

information       changes.

     The former case, which would indicate a serious potential             for sample

selection bias, would cause the values of contracts per year at the lower

percentiles       to be lower for post— than for pre—takeovers,       while the values at

the upper percentiles        would be unchanged.       This would also increase the

standard deviation in the post—takeover period.             The implication of the latter

case is that contracts        per year would decrease proportionately      at each

percentile,       and the standard deviation would be reduced.        Table   6   supports the

latter case, which reduces the worry of sample selection bias.                The apparent

relative decrease in observations per year in the lower percentiles of the

post—takeover column reflects the fact that for many companies only one

contract is observed,        so zero contracts observed per year is reached at

roughly twice the percentile rank as for the pre—takeover distribution.

Finally,    even if sample selection biases are present, they would have to be

extremely     severe to change the economic significance         of the findings in

Sections IV and V.

     Despite the evidence that, overall, the reduction in observed contracts

following     takeovers may not be a problem, there are particular instances             in

which it    is.     Most notably, no post—takeover contracts could be found for the

airline     industry, which is one of the major examples in the Shleifer and

Summers analysis.        Hence no direct response can be made to their stylized

example involving TWA.         However, Figures    3   and 4 made it clear thet airlines

were a special case during the sample period.

Section IV.

      This section provides empirical evidence on the pattern of union wage

growth relative to takeovers and CEO changes.               Employee wealth changes

presented in Section V are based on the results shown in this section.

      The primary goal in running the regressions presented here is to

determine     the extent to which wage growth is associated with takeovers and CEO

changes, other things equal.          The dependent variable is the compound annual

percentage growth rate of the wage level over the contract, as described in

Section TI and summarized in Table I.           The relation between wage growth and

corporate     control events is explored using indicators           for takeovers and CEO


changes both independently          and interacted with other regressors.       These

indicators     are constructed as follows.

      There are three mutually exclusive classes representing a takeover:                 no

takeover for the given company either before or (up to two contracts)                 after

the current contract settlement date; a takeover (up to two contracts)

following the current settlement          date (PlO)   ;   or a takeover prior to that date

(PTO).    The no—takeover       category is omitted as the base case.        If the takeover

is associated in time with a change in regime regarding wages, then the

difference     between the parameter estimates associated with the two included

indicators should capture it, and a test of their equality               (PTO = FTO) is

appropriate     for   determining    such a difference.       If the two parameters are nor

different     from each other but are both different from zero, then there is some

systematic difference between companies involved in takeovers and other

companies,     but the manifestation of this difference observable in wages does

not change when the takeover occurs.
                                             17

       Additional indicators are included for a CEO change accompanying the

takeover,21 one for pre— (PTC) and one for post—takeover (FTC) contract wage

settlements.       These can only have a value of 1 if the corresponding         pre— or

post—settlement takeover indicator is equal to 1.

parameter estimates is the marginal effect of the CEO change, given that the

takeover occurs.       The total effect of the takeover and CEO change is the sum

of the parameter estimates of takeover and CEO change.           As in the takeover

with no CEO change case, a test of the marginal association of the CEO change

with   wage growth is that the indicators for pre— and post—takeover joint with

a CEO change are equal (PTC          FTC).   Similarly,   the total effect of a takeover

                                                       + PTC — FTO + FTC.
joint with a CEO change can be judged by a test of PTO

        Previous   work with these data (Rosett (1989)) has shown      that, although
there    is some variation of the wage growth response to the takeover as time

(contracts) passes,       grouping the data by the number of contracts      or years

since the takeover produces poorly estimated and, when statistically

significant,       contradictory results.    The data do not appear to be able to

                                                            the takeover.                  The
support any detailed tracing of wage effects over time past

number of contracts observed at points more than two contracts following the

takeover is small and wage effects for those contracts           are generally


insignificant.        Also, differences between the wage coefficients      when the

takeover effect is limited to one contract or two are small, so I have chosen

to   estimate effects by pooling up to       two   contracts following the takeover.
This    choice is arbitrary, but unimportant with respect to parameter estimates.

        Several regressors are included to control for economy—wide         and sectoral

conditions.        Macroeconomic   variables include (the rates of growth over the          12

months    prior to the settlement of) the      unemployment   rate, the   CPI, and   real
                                             18

(1982—100)      CNP.   In addition, the difference between the wage at the end of

the expiring contracr and the (two—digit SIC) industry
                                                       average wage in the

month of the settlement (expressed as a percent of the industry wage), and the

log of the wage at the end of the expiring contract are included as well.                 All

regressors are entered linearly and as squares.            F—statistics for the joint

significance of the squared terms indicate their inclusion at the .001
         22
level

        The summary statistics and graphs in the previous section indicate that

teal wage growth from 1976 to 1981 was changing dramatically,             first rapidly

falling and then rising.         From 1982—1987, the pattern was much more stable and

was characterized      by alight erosion of real wages.       The apparent change of

regime beginning with the long expansion of the 1980's indicates             that some

sort of time effects may be useful as
                                      proxies for omitted regressors             if the
available macro— and industry—level        information is not sufficient to explain

much of the variance in wage growth.                       sector indicators capture
                                             Similarly,

differences across sectors explained by fundamentals           such as the regulatory

climate in the given industry, the state of supply of raw materials             or demand
for the product of that industry (which may not be
                                                   highly correlated across
industries      or sectors).

        Two methods were tried for both time and industry effects.           For time

effects,      indicators   for the year of settlement    of the rontract (excluding 1976

as the base year) and a period effect for the 1980's
                                                     expansion (effectively
allowing a structural shift in 1982) were both tried.            For industry

differences, both including        as many two—digit    SIC indicators   as possible and

dividing the sample into seven larger aectora23 (excluding services as the

base) were tried.

     Table    7   ahows four specifications    using the full sets of year and SIC

indicators in addition to the macro— snd industry—level             quantitative

regressors.       Using the set of settlement year indicators           is strongly supported

by an F—test for their joint significsnce, which rejects the hypothesis that

they are jointly zero at the .0001 level.             The same is true for the full set

of SIC indicators.       In all four specifications,        the point estimates      on che

pre— and post—takeover      indicators   support the hypothesis that wages rise more

quickly than average prior to and less quickly than average following a

takeover.     However,   the effects are uniformly        small and statistically

insignificant.       For takeovers without CEO changes, the estimated level of wage

growth declines from before to after a tskeover by —0.36% per year

(   —0.03 —   0.33) in   the first specification,       and is highest in the third

specification      (—.6% per year).   The marginal effects of a CEO change wich the

takeover are as expected in the third and fourth equstions,                indicating    even

higher increases before and lower after the takeover.              However,       they are

reversed in the first two specifications,             and again all estimates are

insignificant.       If CEO change effects sre included, the largest estimated

decline   in the level of wage growth is —1.04% per year (= —0.24 —0.03 —                    0.31   —


 0.46) in     the fourth specification.       Hence    if real wsge growth was 1.04% per

year prior to a takeover (which, in the fourth specification,                indicates       that

wages were growing       .27% per year faster than they otherwise          would have been),

then the largest estimated effect would lower real wage growth to zero.                       In

the first specification,      the level of wage growth increases           .12%   per year

following     a takeover and CEO change.

      In addition to being individually insignificant according to the

t—statistics,      the event indicator estimates        are generally    insignificant       in
                                              20

other tests.       The F—statistic    for the joint significance of the four

indicators       does not reject the hypotheais     that they are all equal to zero in

the first two specifications.          For the first specification,      that statistic     is


F(4,5290)    =    .66,   with the probability of a greater F value of      .62.      The

statistic    is similar for the second specification.         However,    the four

indicators       are found to be jointly significantly     different   from zero in the

last two specifications,         with probability of a greater F of      .02   and   .04,


respectively.

     Tests of equality of the pre— and post—takeover parameter estimates, as

discussed earlier in this section, also show mixed results.              None of the three

tests reject the null for the first two specificstions.            The highest level of

significance       among the six tests is for the test that the pre—tskeover and

post—takeover indicators are the same in the second equation, which has a

probability of a greater F value of         .10.   In the last two equations, equality

of the pre— and post—takeover         indicators   is rejected in both cases (at the        .02

and .04 levels, respectively),         while equality of the pre— and post—CEO change

estimates    are not significsnt even at the .10 level.         The last test, for the

equality of the totsl effects of takeover and CEO—change pre— and pos t—

takeover,    is significant at the .02 level in the third and fourth

specificstions.

     Overall,       these findings do not support a statistically        significant

relation between takeovers (with or without CEO changes) and wage growth.                   The

first specification         is most strongly favored by tests for the inclusion of

yesr and SIC indicators.          This specification shows a decline in wsge growth

following a takeover alone, and an increase following a takeover and CEO

change.     All significsnce      tests indicste no statistical relstionship in this
                                          21

specification.    All point estimates are insignificant     in all specifications,

and a few joint tests are significant     in unfavored specifications.

     One objection to these results is that no account is taken of sector

specific variation in takeover effects.        Such effects can not be examined

using the full sets of year and industry indicators, as degrees of freedom are

quickly used up in year/SIC cross—effects.        Instead, the specifications    shown

in Table 8 are based on period and sector groupings,       and they appear to

capture most of the variance explained by the year and SIC indicators.           These

specifications    have the advantage of allowing cross—effects    to be estimated

and tested.24     These cross—effects   may be important if, for example, the

regulatory climate changes within an industry over time (as it did in airlines

and trucking).

        The first specification   in Table 8 has the interpretationof allowing a

structural break in 1982 (for all aspects of wage determinants other than

takeovers)    as the period indicator   is interacted with the other regressors      as

well.     An F—test for the joint significance of the period indicator and its

interactions with the other regressors      has the interpretation    of a Chow test2

for the structural shift.       In a specification excluding all takeover and CEO

change indicators, this test is significant at the .0001 level.

        The sector indicators   exclude the FIRE (Finance, Insurance,    and Real

Estate) and other services sector as the base.        Hence if interactions     of the

six included sectors and the four takeover—related       indicators   are made, there

are 24 possible indicators which capture the marginal effects of each event in

each sector, in addition to the main effects.        As the four uninteracted event

indicators    and the six uninteracted sector indicators are included as well,
                                                 22

the base case is a service sector contract for a firm that does not experience

a takeover between 1973 and 1987.

     In Table    8,   the change in wage growth within a sector from before to

after a takeover (with no CEO change) is the difference between the

uninteracted takeover estimates plus the difference between the interacted

takeover estimates within the given sector.              For example,    in the first

apecification,     the effect of a takeover (with no CEO change) in durables

manufacturing is (—1.99) —          (+45)   +   (+2.77) — (0)     33.    The overall effect

of a takeover in durables is actually to increase wage growth slightly.

     Table 9 auamiarizes the wage growth changes from before to after takeovers

(and CEO changes) by industry for industries             for which all necessary

coefficients     could be estimated.        The increased wage growth result found for

the first specification          in durables manufacturing      is found in two other

apecifications     for durablea, and in all four cases for both non—durables and

transportation/utilities.           When CEO change effects are included as well, the

signs reverse in all sectors for which estimates of all parameters could be

obtained, but the effects are modest.

     Only mining shows a relatively large wage effect in the expected

direction (for the transfer hypothesis), and then only for takeovers without a

CEO change.      Table 3 shows that mining accounts for only 2.5% of the contracts

in the sample.        The point estimates       for mining are not significantly    different

from zero.

     The results shown in tables 8 and 9 again do not support wage growth

reductions following takeovers.             Rather, the opposite now appears to be true

in many cases.        Further,    the point estimates    are more stable across

specifications     and in many cases statistically         significant    at the 5% level in
                                             23

Table   8.   However,   the magnitudes of the effects are again quite small.       There

is evidence that a CEO change with the takeover reduces wage growth in

manufacturing,    but this result is reversed in mining.

     The results of this section do not support the hypothesis that union

wages are strongly affected by takeovers.         Estimates of the change in tha

level of teal wage growth from before to after a takeover           (and CEO change)

range from a reduction       of about 1% to and increase of about .3%.      The

estimates    of reductions are statistically      insignificant,   and the results are

not robust to the specification.         Results also differ across sectors.      The

most reasonable conclusion is that there is no clear pattern of wage growth

changes associated with takeovers        and CEO changes.




Section V.

     This section compares union wealth changes calculated from the results of

Section IV to target firm shareholder wealth changes associated with

takeovers.     Estimates of union wealth changes are made under assumptions

designed to show the largest possible concessions or gains given the results

of rho previous section.         Target firm shareholder wealth premiums are

estimated using a simple market model, and the magnitudes of the premiums are

well within the normal rsnge.         This procedure gives the transfer hypothesis

its best chance to explain takeover premiums.          It also allows some perspective

on the economic significance of the findings in the previous section.

        Employee wealth changes associatedwith takeovers are calculated as

follows:     Real contract costs per employee—year      were calculated for each

contract     (see Table 1)   .   These are used to find the average real cost per

employee—year     in the pre—takeover time period,          for each firm taken over.

before to after takeovers and CEO changes,               d,   were taken from the regression

results    in the previous section.            Aasuming contract costs are linear in wagaa,

the information above and the intereat rate at the time of the takeover,
                                                                                           rt
(Moody's Baa corporate rate), are sufficient                  to calculate   the present value of

the change in contract costs per union member over the first two contracts

(assumed to he 3 years           each) following    the takeover as




                            6              n                  n
                    C              (l+w)       —   (l4wd)
                        Xn         (l+rt)n         (l+r)n


This calculation allows the effect of the change in the level of wage growth

to compound over the aix year period.               Hence the full estimated effect in the

previous section is firar calculated.

        It is not reasonable to assume that the decrease in wage growth persists

indefinitely,     as the mean real wage growth in the sample is just 0.17% per

year.     A   reduction by 0.6% per year implies real wages declining

asymptotically to zero.           A more realistic assumption is that wage levels are

lowered at first (relative to what they would have been in the absence of the

takeover)      but that the growth rate reverts to the industry— or economy—wide

rate over time.      The movement to a new wage path parallel to the old one

implies constant wealth concessions per year after some point.

        The infinite horizon present value of such a yearly concession is the

measure used here for the wealth concession per employee.                    It is calculated oa
                                                    25

This formula finds the infinite horizon present value of the perpetuity with

the yearly value V         where V solves

That is, it extends the six equal yearly concessions implied by                W6   to a


pbraanent basis.

     Finally,    rather than multiply the wealth change per union member figure

by the number of employees covered by each contract, total union employment

figures for each firm are estimated by obtaining total employment figures for

each firm at the tiae of the takeover26 and multiplying them by the percent

unionized in the sector.27                 These figures are generally larger than estimates

from the sample as contracts are missing.                 The implicit assumption that fira

production worker employment does not change much following takeovers is

empirically supported by Lichtenberg and Siegel (1989) and Brown and Medoff

(1988).   The calculations         described should provide a good chance for wage

growth reductions      to explain takeover premiums.

     The estimates         of target firm shareholder wealth changes are calculated

from a simple market model of the form

where
        Rit is the monthly return for firm i in month                 t,    R     is the value—

weighted market return (including dividends) in month                      t,   and   e   is a classical

disturbance term.             The excese return was calculated over the month containing

the first mention of the takeover.                   This procedure   is standard and the details

are omitted.28 The median of the premium distribution is 25%, which                             is   well

within the typical range for event studies of takeover wealth effects.                               To

make the dollar figures comparable to the union wealth change figures, they

have been deflated by the 1967—based CPI.

        Table    10 summarizes         the wealth change information.           Each column from the

second to the seventh shows a distributionwith values at the percentile ranks

shown in the first column.                  The second column shows the distribution of

(constant) dollar amounts of the shareholder wealth change, while the third

shows the distribution of premium percentages.                   The fourth to the seventh show

the distributions             of the ratio of union wealth concessions to shareholder

wealth gains using the wage growth change coefficients from the indicsted

table and specification.                   Union concessions are positive numbers, and union

gains are negative numbers.                    Shareholder gains are positive end losses are

negative.        Hence negative ratio values indicate that shareholder and union

wealth moved in the same direction.                   The distribution     in each column is

ordered independently              of the other columns, so figures at the same percentile

rank in two different columns do not necessarily correspond to the same

company.        All of the information necessary to calculate both union and target

firm shareholder wealth could be found for 212 companies,29 but coefficienta
                                             27

were not available for all sectora in the specifitationa           from Table   8,   ao the

last two distributions have fewer observations.

     The last four columns show the evidente on the transfer hypothesis.                  The

distributions        shown are for all takeovers   (with and without CEO changes)

combined.      The fifth column is constructed by combining       the coefficients most

favorable to that hypothesis from the last two specifications            on Table    7.


Even with the liberal sssumptions for constructing wealth concessions

described above and mixing the results of two estimstions to magnify the

effect,      at the median only 12% of the shareholder gain is explained        by union

concessions.         The fourth column is constructed   from the first specificstion        on

Table   7,   which was the most favored one in terms of included regressors.              In

this specification,        only 3% of the premium is explained at the median value.

The final two columns were constructed from the sector—specific            information

from Table      9.    In some sectors, the effect of the takeover alone was to

increase wage growth.         This is reflected in the negative values at the medians

in both columns.         In the sixth column, the union gains 4% of the shareholder

wealth increase.         The corresponding figure in the last column is 2%.

     A    slightly stronger case for the transfer hypothesis can be made by

looking only at takeovers        that include s CEO change.     The final footnote on

Table 10 shows the median values for the four distributions in this case.

Using the fourth specification        from Table   7, the   median value is 21%.     I

present this number only in order to make the following points: It is possible

to explain one fifth of the takeover premium by union concessions.              To accept

this result, however, one must focus only on the results of the least favored

specification        (both year and industry indicators are excluded),     ignore
statistical      insignificance,   and allow the liberal assumptions used in
                                            28

constructing the union wesith chsnges.       When yesr snd industry effects are

included (the first specification of Table       7),   the result is reversed in sign.

In this case, unions gain 2% of the value of the shareholder premium.            Both

specificstions   based on Table   9   show modest union concessions   (5% and 6%) as a

percentage of shareholder premiums.        Although it is possible to show larger

concessions by focusing only on takeovers with CEO changes, I believe            that the

most reasonable conclusion is again that the effect is small.          These resulte

are not sufficiently differen from the results          for all takeovers   to warrant

emphasis.

     The minimum and maximum values in the lsst four columns of Table 10

deserve comment.     They are all generated in cases where the shareholder wealth

change is very small compared to the median value, as documented at the bottom

of the table.     Hence small variations    in union wealth changes can cause large

movements in the ratios.     Apart from the two extreme values at each end of

each distribution)    the ranges are fairly narrow.      These characteriatica    of the

distributions    make it clearer that that the median values are reasonable

statistics   to represent the overall rate of transfer.

     The evidence from this table rejects the proposition chat wealth

transfers    from unions explain target firm shareholder wealth premiums.

Rather, there is just as much evidence       that unions gain when a takeover

occurs.     In either case, the relative magnitudes make it clear that union

wealth changes associated with takeovers and CEO changes are economically

insignificant    compared to target firm shareholder wealth changes.

Section VI.

     This paper provides empirical evidence that transfers of wealth from

unions do nor account for target firm shareholder wealth premiums.        Regression

analysis reveals that reductions    in real wage growth sssociated with takeovers

and CEO changes are statistically    insignificant,   and sectoral decompositions

show increased real wage growth in major manufacturing sectors.       In the

extreme specifications, levels of real wage growth may be reduced by up          cc 1%


annually or increased by up to .3%.     In more favored specifications,    the

effects ste much smaller.

     Union weslth concessions associatedwith wage growth reductions were

calculsted under assumptions favorable the transfer hypothesis, and one month

target firm shareholder wealth premiums were calculated using a simple market

model.   These figures were used to calculate the ratio of union concessions         to

shareholder   premiums.   At most, 12% of the shareholder premium can be

explained.    At the opposite extreme, union wealth increases by 4% of the value

of the shareholder premium.     Again, the effects are smaller in more reasonable

specifications.    I   conclude that the effects of takeovers and CEO changes on

union wages and wealth are both statistically insignificant and economically

insignificant   in the sense that they do not explain target firm takeover

premiums.

1.   Most studies find that target firm share prices rise 15% to 5O% around

ths time of the initiation of the takeover, with variations in the magnitude

partly explained by the type of takeover.              See Jensen and Ruback (1983), and

Jarrell, Erickley,        and Netter (1988) for summaries of this literature.

2.   Eckbo    (1985), Eckbo and Pier (1985), and McCuckin,         Warren—Boulton,   and

using stock market data.

3.   CEO changes are included as an indicator of 'hostility.'             Previoua work

with these data ahows that traditional hostility indicators, such as

resistance     by the target firm board, perform poorly relative to CEO changea

(P.oaett,    1989).    I argue that CEO changes accompany real shifts in corporata

strategy, while protestations         by board members at the time of a takeover bid
contain less information.

6.   Rubmck (1983) provides evidence that "...on average, the successful offer

price exhausts        the potential   gains for unsuccessful bidders"    (1983, p.152).

He concludes that the market for corporate control is competitive.

7.   Brown and Medoff (1988) used a sample of Michigan firma to estimate the

effects of takeovers        on wages and employment.       Their results for wages vary

aomewhmt by acquisition type and the time period examined, ranging from 5%

higher than would be expected in the absence of the acquisition for "aaaeta
                                                31

only' acquisitions    (the bidder purchases the target's assets without

absorbing    its work force)   ,   to   6% to 5% lower for acquisitions     involving

changes of ownership with or without the integration of the target into an

existing firm (pp.19—20).          Their analysis is not explicitly aimed at

determining whether employee wealth is transferred to shareholders               through

takeovers, but the results do not appear to support that hypothesis.

8.   Roll (1986) points out that both target and bidding firm wealth effects

must be accounted for in determining the extent of wealth creation through

takeovers.     If acquiring firms are larger than target firms, then even small

negative returns to bidding firm shareholders may imply zero or negative net

wealth creation.      Roll defends the possibility of such a result on the basis

of irrational behavior by managers:            "If there actually are no aggregate

gains in takeover,     the phenomenon depends on the overbearing presumption by

bidders that their valuations are correct"             (Roll, 1986, p. 200).    Bradley,

Desai, and Kim (1988) respond to Roll's point using a sample of 236 tender

offer contests using matched bidder/target            pairs.     All companies were listed

on the NYSE or AMEX, and all acquisitions occurred after 1963.                 They   fonrid


company value weighted combined returns of 7.43%, based on .97% returns for

bidders     and 31.77% for targets.        In millions of 1984 dollars, they found mean

wealth increases of $17.3, $107.08, and $117.11 respectively for bidders,

targets, and both combined.

9.   Auerbsch and Reishus (1988) provide evidence that tax advantages                 do not

drive takeover activity.           They show that the probability of tax advantages

through mergers and acquisitions           is similar between company pairs actually

involved in takeovers and pairings made              randomly.    However, Kaplan (1989)

finds significant     tax effects in the case of management buyouts.

10.   Lichtenberg and Siegel (1989) find significant cuta in central office

petaonnel,       but not for production workers, following takeovers.

11.   Pontiff, Shleifer,         and Weisbach (1989) find that pension tevereions

follow toughly 10% of takeovers            (slightly higher for hostile,   lower for

friendly)    ,
                  and that the reversion explains roughly 10% of the takeover

premium.         Hence, roughly 1% of the value in takeovers      might be explained

through reversions,           However,   their evidence that the reversions would not

have occurred in the absence of the takeover is weak.

(not just companies       with trading suspensions)     .    In   previous versions of this

study these were included in the regression analysis to account for the

independent       effect of CEO changes.     Excluding this information greatly

simplifies    the interpretation    of the results without substantially            altering

them.     See Rosett (1989).

21.     In previous work with these data, a traditional hostile takeover

indicator     was used in addition to the CEO change indicator.              The distribution

of this     indicator    is shown in Table 3.       The wage growth effects were weaker

and often     of the wrong sign using the hostile indicator.              See Rosett (1989)

22.     Alternative specifications    including      interactions of takeover indicators

with the quantitative regressors were explored but not presented as they

complicate the interpretationwithout providing evidence for stronger wage

effects.

and utilities (excluding sir transportation),        airlines, wholesale and retail

trade, and FIRE (Finance, Insurance,        and Real Estate) and other services.

24.   Additional specifications       in which takeover and CEO change indicators

were interactedwith other regressors were explored.           In particular,      changes

io bargaining power or breaches associatedwith takeovers can be interpreted

as altering the responsiveness        of contracted wage growth to current

differences   between firm and industry wages.        Interacting   the takeover

indicators with the firm—to—industryrelative wage variable should captura

aurh a change.     The results were not substantially      different   from the

specifications    presented,   but are difficult to interpret and are omitted.

26.   COMPUSTAT data item 29 reports the average or year—end employment,

including all part—time      and seasonal employees,    and employees of both doaestio

and foreign aubaidiariea.          See Section 8, P. 46 of the April 15, l9E6

Industrial    COMPUSTAT   guide.     In most cases, the employment figure   is for the


year prior to the completion of the takeover.

      For 49 companies,     COMPUSTAT did not provide information.       Figures for 45

ef these companies were obtained from Moody's, again for the year prior to the

takeover in moat cases.
