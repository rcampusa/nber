                                              ABSTRACT

To analyze the effect of health on work, many studies use a simple self-assessed health measure based
upon a question such as “do you have an impairment or health problem limiting the kind or amount
of work you can do?” A possible drawback of such a measure is the possibility that different groups
of respondents may use different response scales. This is commonly referred to as “differential item
functioning” (DIF). A specific form of DIF is justification bias: to justify the fact that they don’t work,
non-working respondents may classify a given health problem as a more serious work limitation than
working respondents. In this paper we use anchoring vignettes to identify justification bias and other
forms of DIF across countries and socio-economic groups among older workers in the U.S. and Europe.
Generally, we find differences in response scales across countries, partly related to social insurance
generosity and employment protection. Furthermore, we find significant evidence of justification bias
in the U.S. but not in Europe, suggesting differences in social norms concerning work.

1. Introduction
        The fraction of workers on disability insurance (DI) is vastly different across Western

European countries with similar levels of economic development and comparable access to

modern medical technology and treatment (Eurostat, 2001). Institutional differences in eligibility

rules or generosity of benefits contribute to an explanation of differences in disability rolls

(Boersch-Supan, 2007). Recent survey data show, however, that significant differences between

Western European countries and the U.S. are also found in self-reports of work limiting

disabilities. Table 1 below, taken from Kapteyn et al. (2009), illustrates the point.1 We see

considerable variation in both DI-expenditures as a percentage of GDP and the percentage of

males between 40 and 65 reporting some form of work disability. Remarkably the two columns

are only weakly correlated: the correlation is 0.20.

  Self-reports for the European countries are taken from the European Community Household Panel. For the U.S.
they are taken from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. The exact question on work disability in ECHP is: “Are
you hampered in your daily activities by any physical or mental health problem, illness or disability?” In the PSID, it
is: “Do you have any physical or nervous condition that limits the type of work or the amount of work you can do?”


                                                          2
        Croda and Skinner (2009), using data from SHARE and HRS, find little or no evidence

that in countries with a higher proportion of individuals on DI, the fraction of DI recipients with

self-reported fair or poor health is lower. This is what one would expect if access to DI were

largely driven by health considerations and if the distribution of health in different countries

would be roughly the same. In that case a system with strict eligibility rules or less generous

benefits would mainly select individuals with the worst health condition. The more generous

benefits or eligibility rules become, the more likely it is that individuals in better health are

drawn into the pool of DI recipients. One explanation for the weak relation between DI-

recipiency rates and self-reported health across countries may lie in differences in response

scales used to answer subjective health questions adopted by residents of different countries.

        This paper applies the same vignette methodology as in Kapteyn, Smith, and Van Soest

(2007) to determine the extent to which differences in self-reported work-limiting disability

between several European countries and the U.S. are due to differences in response scales. In

addition, we also consider the effect of work disability on employment and the potential effect of

justification bias on the estimate of this effect.

        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The second section describes the

data collection efforts in HRS and SHARE that make this research possible. Section 3 outlines

the vignette methodology and our statistical model that corrects for response scale differences

across countries. The fourth section briefly describes the vignettes used in this study and how

respondents in different European countries and the US respond to the same vignette scenarios.

Section 5 presents the empirical results and their implications for interpreting observed

differences in self-reported work disability. Section 6 extends the model developed in Section 3

to include employment and justification bias. Section 7 presents the estimation results of that

model and shows their economic importance by means of a number of simulations. Our principal

conclusions are contained in the last section.

2. Data Sources

        For the United States, we use the 2004 wave of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),

a bi-annual panel with a representative sample of the US population over 50. It has been

conducted by the University of Michigan since1992. Information collected includes physical and

mental health, socio-economic status (including measures of labor market status, income,

education and wealth), social support, etc. The surveys use a mixture of modes with most new

interviews conducted face-to-face and most re-interviews by phone. Wave-specific overall

response rates for the HRS have improved from 81.7% in 1992 to close to 90% at later waves,

specifically 87.8% in 2004. The survey has a complex sample design and oversamples Blacks,

Hispanics, and residents of Florida. Details on the HRS methodology and the 2004 Wave are

available elsewhere (Heeringa and Connor, 1995). For our analysis we use a subsample of

respondents who first completed a face-to-face interview and later completed a leave-behind

questionnaire. The leave-behind questionnaire consisted of a series of work disability vignettes

and was targeted toward respondents less than 75 years of age.

        SHARE is a large-scale project that aims to collect interdisciplinary longitudinal data on

European citizens of age 50 and older and their spouses. The eleven participating countries in the

baseline wave were Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria,

Switzerland, Spain, Italy, Greece and France.2 Using a common instrument, SHARE includes

information on physical and mental health, socio-economic status including measures of income,

  The Czech Republic, Poland, Israel, and Ireland, were added later. See www.share-project.org for exact sample
sizes.

education and wealth, and social support. The first wave of the main survey was fielded in 2004,

with between 1000 and 4000 individuals in each country, adding up to about 29,000 individuals.

         While containing many unique features, in order to facilitate additional comparisons with

the USA and England, SHARE was purposely modeled after the HRS and the English

Longitudinal Survey of Aging (ELSA) and follows a common set-up across all countries with the

goal of facilitating cross-country research.

         For a subset of countries that agreed to participate, SHARE included a set of self-

assessments and vignette questions on general health status and on work limiting disabilities as

part of a drop-off questionnaire. The eight countries that participated in this vignette experiment

were Germany, France, Spain, Belgium, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, and Sweden. The work

disability vignettes were identical to the work disability vignettes in the HRS leave-behind

questionnaire. Both were taken from the surveys used by Kapteyn et al. (2007).

         The work disability vignettes deal with work-limiting health problems in the domains of

pain, depression, and cardio-vascular disease. An example of a vignette is the following one (the

first vignette cited in Appendix B which contains the full set of vignettes):

[Eva] feels worried all the time. She gets depressed once a week at work for a couple of days in a
row, thinking about what could go wrong and that her boss will disapprove of her condition. But
she is able to come out of this mood if she concentrates on something else.

For each vignette, the respondent is asked: “Please give us your judgment on how limited these

people are in the kind or amount of work they can do”3

    1.   Not at all limited
    2.   Mildly limited
    3.   Moderately limited
    4.   Severely limited
    5.   Cannot do any work


3
 This is the question wording in the HRS. The wording in SHARE is slightly different (and translated in each
country’s language). See www.share-project.org.


                                                        5
The names used in the vignettes (Eva in the example) vary by vignette and, moreover, to each

vignette either a male or a female name was randomly assigned. (See Appendix B for details4)

        Preceding the vignette questions, a respondent is asked the self-assessment of work

disability question: “To what extent are you limited in the kind or amount of work you can do

because of an impairment or health problem?”5 with the same answer categories as above. As

explained in the next section, these vignettes make it possible to analyze cross-country

differences in work related health, corrected for international differences in response scales.

Moreover, the vignettes will also be used for comparisons of different socio-economic groups.



3. The Theory of Vignettes

    In this section, we first provide an intuitive description of the use of vignettes for identifying

response scale differences and then sketch our statistical approach. The basic idea is illustrated

in Figure 1, which presents the distribution of health related work limitations (work disability for

short) in two hypothetical countries. The density of the continuous work disability variable in

country A is to the left of that in country B, implying that on average, people in country A suffer

less work disability than in country B. The people in the two countries, however, use very

different response scales if asked to report their work limitations on a five-point scale (none-

mild-moderate-severe-extreme). These differences may be caused by cultural differences, or

simply be the result of inadequate translation, for instance because there exist no exact one-to-

one translations of concepts from one language to the other. In the example in the figure, people

in country A have a much more negative view on their capacity for work than people in country

4
  There we also describe some differences in the formulation of the self-reported disability questions and one
vignette across the two surveys. In this version of the paper we have ignored these differences.
5
  Again, this is the wording in the HRS; the wording in SHARE is somewhat different: “Do you have any
impairment or health problem that limits the kind or amount of work you can do?” with answer categories “None”,
“Mild”, “Moderate”, “Severe” and “Extreme.”


                                                      6
B. Someone in country A with the health indicated by the dashed line would report to have a

severe work disability, while a person in country B with the same actual work limitation would

report only a mild work disability The frequency distribution of the self-reports in the two

countries would suggest that people in country A are more work disabled than those in country

B—the opposite of the true disability distribution. Correcting for the differences in the response

scales (DIF, “differential item functioning,” in the terminology of King et al., 2004) is essential

to compare the distributions of actual work limitations in the two countries.



         Figure 1. Comparing self-reported health related work limitations




                                                            Country A




    None      Mild Mod- Severe                    Extreme                       Work Disability

     Country B



              None         Mild      Moderate        Severe     Extreme         Work Disability



       Vignettes can be used to do the correction. A vignette question describes the work

limitations of a hypothetical person and then asks the respondent to evaluate the work disability

of that person on the same five-point scale that was used for the self-report of their own health.




                                                 7
Since the vignette descriptions are the same in the two countries, the vignette persons in the two

countries have the same actual work limitations. For example, respondents can be asked to

evaluate the work limitation of a person whose disability is given by the dashed line. In country

A, this will be evaluated as “severe.” In country B, the evaluation would be “mild.” Since the

actual work disability is the same in the two countries, the difference in the country evaluations

must be due to DIF.

   Vignette evaluations thus help to identify differences between the response scales. Using the

scales in one of the two countries as the benchmark, the distribution of evaluations in the other

country can be adjusted by evaluating them on the benchmark scale. The corrected distribution

of the evaluations can then be compared to that in the benchmark country—they are now on the

same scale. In the example in the figure, this will lead to the correct conclusion that people in

country B are more disabled than those in country A, on average. The main identifying

assumption is response consistency: a given respondent uses the same scale for self-reports and

vignette evaluations. King et al. (2004) provide evidence supporting this assumption by

comparing self-reports and vignette evaluations of vision with an objective measure of vision.

Van Soest et al. (2007) provide similar supporting evidence by comparing self-reported drinking

problems to actual alcohol consumption.

   We will apply the vignette approach to work limiting disability, using vignettes not only to

obtain international comparisons corrected for DIF, but also for comparisons of different groups

within a given country. For example, it is often hypothesized that men self report themselves in

better health than objective circumstances would warrant, that as they age people adjust their

norms downward about what constitutes good health, and that some of the SES health gradient




                                                8
reflects different health thresholds by SES rather than true health differences. Vignettes offer the

potential for systematic testing of these hypotheses.


3.1 A Formal Model of Response Scales and Vignette Corrections

   Our model is an extension of the conditional hopit model (Chopit, cf. King et al., 2004, and

Kapteyn et al., 2007). It explains respondents’ self-reports on work limitations and their reports

on work limitations of hypothetical vignette persons. The first of these is the answer Yi (where i

indicates respondent i) to the question

“Do you have any impairment or health problem that limits the kind or amount of paid work

you can do?”

       The questions on work limitations of the vignette persons use the same 5-point scale and

are formulated in the same way (“Does Mr/Mrs X have any impairment or health problem that

limits the type or amount of paid work that he/she can do?”). The answers will be denoted by Yli

where each respondent i evaluates L vignettes l=1,…,L.

       Self-reports are modeled as a function of respondent characteristics Xi and an error term

 i by the following ordered response equation:

                        Yi *  X i    i ;  i    N (0,1),  i independent of X i                    (1)

                                   Yi  j if  i j 1  Yi *   i j , j  1,...5                      (2)

The thresholds  ij between the categories are given by

              i0  ,  i5  ,  i1  X i 1  ui ,  i j   i j 1  exp( X i j ), j  2, 3, 4   (3)

                         ui N (0,  u2 ), independent of  i and X i               (4)
The error term ui reflects unobserved heterogeneity in the thresholds. The fact that different

respondents can use different response scales  i j is called “differential item functioning” (DIF).



                                                              9
           Using the self-reports on own work disabilities only, the parameters  and  1 cannot be

separately identified;6 the reported outcome only depends on these parameters through their

difference. For example, consider country dummies: two people (with the same characteristics)

in two different countries can have systematically different work disability, but if the scales on

which they report their work disability can also differ across countries, then self-reports alone are

not enough to identify the work disability difference between the countries. This was illustrated

in Figure 1 above.

            For our analysis we are using a common set of L=9 vignette questions, three in each of

three domains: affect, pain, and heart problems.7 The evaluations of vignettes l=1,…, L are

modeled using similar ordered response equations:

                                                  Yli*  l   li                                      (5)

                                   Yli  j if  i j 1  Yli*   i j , j  1,...5                      (6)

                      li   N (0,  v2 ), independent of each other, of  i and of X i                  (7)

The assumption of “response consistency” means that the thresholds  i j are the same for the self-
reports and the vignettes. The assumption of “vignette equivalence” implies that genuine work-
related health of the vignette person Yli* does not depend on X i ; it only depends on the vignette
description (l) and an idiosyncratic error term.8
           Given these assumptions, it is clear how the vignette evaluations can be used to

separately identify β and  (= 1 ,... 4 ) : From the vignette evaluations alone,  , 1 ,... L can be

identified (up to the usual normalization of scale and location). From the self-reports,  can then


  The  for j>1 will still be identified.
6      j

7
  Kapteyn et al. (2007) also discuss a model in which thresholds are allowed to vary across the three domains of
work disability. They find that the results for this more general model are very similar to the results for the model
imposing equal thresholds across domains.
8
  Allowing the vignette evaluations to depend upon gender of the vignette person (as was done in Kapteyn et al.,
2007) does not affect the results.


                                                              10
be identified in addition. Thus the vignettes can be used to solve the identification problem due

to DIF. The two-step procedure is sketched only to make intuitively clear why the model is

identified. In practice, all parameters will be estimated simultaneously by maximum likelihood.9

         Adjusting for DIF is straightforward in this model once the parameters are estimated.

Define a benchmark respondent with characteristics Xi = X(B). (For example, choose one of the

countries as the benchmark country.) The DIF adjustment would now involve comparing Yi* to

the thresholds  Bj rather than  i j , where  Bj is obtained in the same way as  i j but using X(B)

instead of Xi. Thus a respondent’s work ability is computed using the benchmark scale instead of

the respondent’s own scale. This does not lead to an adjusted score for each individual

respondent (since Yi* is not observed) but it can be used to simulate adjusted distributions of Yi

for the whole population or conditional on some of the characteristics in Xi. Of course the

adjusted distribution will depend upon the chosen benchmark.



4. Responses to Vignettes in Western Europe and the U.S.

         Respondents in each of the eight European countries and the U.S. were given vignettes in

three domains of work disability—pain, affect, and heart disease. In each of the three domains,

three distinct vignettes are used to describe the conditons of a hypothetical person. The actual

vignettes used are presented in Appendix B.10 Table A.1 in Appendix A compares the responses

for the pain domain, while Tables A.2 and A.3 do the same for the affect and heart disease

   This is more efficient than the two-step procedure. Since all error terms are independent, the likelihood
contribution is a product of univariate normal probabilities over all vignette evaluations and the self-report, which is
relatively easy to compute.

   The selection of vignettes is the result of simulation studies with the Dutch CentERpanel, where we administered
five vignettes per domain and then estimated Chopit models that used subsets of these five. We found that the
extreme vignettes (either describing someone who is healthy or someone who is clearly too sick to work) carried
little information. We also looked at the effect of the number of vignettes per domain. Obviously, more vignettes
will lead to more accuracy, but for practical reasons the number of vignettes per domain had to be limited. The
simulation study led to the conclusion that three vignettes per domain strikes a reasonable balance between practical
feasibility and statistical accuracy.

(CVD) domains, respectively. The numbering of vignettes corresponds to how vignettes are

presented in Appendix B. For instance, pain1 is the first pain vignette shown in Appendix B,

pain2 is the second pain vignette, etc. Although the health conditions of the persons described in

the vignettes are supposed to be the same in all countries, Tables A.1-A.3 show that there are

large differences in the evaluation frequencies between the countries.

       Some differences are striking. For instance pain2 (“[Catherine] suffers from back pain

that causes stiffness in her back especially at work but is relieved with low doses of medication.

She does not have any pains other than this generalized discomfort.”) is said to provide no work

limitation by almost 25% of the American respondents, while in the European countries that

percentage is less than 4, with very little variation across European countries. Similarly for

CVD2 (“[Tom] has been diagnosed with high blood pressure. His blood pressure goes up quickly

if he feels under stress. Tom does not exercise much and is overweight.”) almost 29% of

Americans consider this to be no or only a mild work disability, while the SHARE average is

about 16%. The differences for the Affect vignettes are most pronounced. For all three vignettes

Americans are much more likely than Europeans to say that the health condition described in the

vignette does not constitute a work disability.

         Table 2 summarizes the responses to the work disability vignettes in the nine countries.

The three vignettes per domain were selected to deliberately eliminate the extremes where

individuals in all countries would tend to describe the vignette person as clearly work disabled or

clearly not work disabled. As a result, the differences in the scenarios described in the vignettes

are often not large (at least among the European countries) and there is noise in the ranking both

within and across countries. Table 2 summarizes the vignette evaluations in two ways. First, the

five-point scale on work disability is collapsed into three groups, with none and mild combined




                                                  12
into one group and severe an extreme into another group. The percentage of respondents

reporting in two of these three groups (none/mild and severe/extreme) is listed for each of the

three vignettes in each of the three domains - pain, affect, and CVD.

         The second way of arriving at a simple summary is contained in the rows labeled

“Average rank” under each domain. This row is derived by ranking the countries in each of the

three vignettes within a domain by which country is ‘hardest’ on the vignette persons - that is

which country has the highest percentage of responses in the mild or no work disability category

and the lowest percentage of responses in the severe or extreme category. The final row in Table

2 labeled “Grand Average Rank” is just the average of these ranks across the three work

disability domains.

         Before we concentrate on the patterns in Table 2, we first discuss some correlations

summarized in Table 3. The upper panel shows correlations between the average rankings of

countries within domains. For example, the entry 0.44 in the upper left corner is the correlation

of the average ranking of countries obtained by calculating the average ranking for vignette 1

and for vignette 2 in the pain domain. One would expect that if countries differ strongly in how

“soft” or “tough” they are in their vignette evaluations, the ranking of countries would be pretty

much the same for each vignette. Table 3 indeed shows that all correlations but one are positive,

but often the correlations are not particularly high. The correlations appear lowest for pain and

highest for CVD. Thus, in particular for pain there may be a fair amount of noise in the vignette

evaluations.

         The bottom panel shows the correlation of rank averages across domains. For example,

the entry 0.69 is the correlation between the average ranking of countries for pain and for affect,

as shown in Table 3. We observe that the correlation of rank averages across domains is much




                                                13
higher than within domains (the average of the three correlations in the bottom panel is 0.67,

while the average of the nine correlations in the top panel equals 0.40). This supports the notion

that the sometimes weak correlations in the top panel of Table 3 are at least partly the result of

noise. Aggregating across vignettes leads to a considerable reduction of noise and thus to higher

correlations in rankings of countries based on different vignettes.

       Table 2 indicates several salient patterns. First, residents of the eight European countries

do not share a common view on what constitutes a work disability. For example, while a third of

the Dutch respondents state that the first CVD vignette constitutes no or only a mild work

disability, the comparable fraction for Spaniards is one-in-twenty and for Swedes one in fifty.

Yet, the variation within Europe is less striking than the difference between Europe and the US.

Comparing the last two columns, which present the US and the SHARE averages, we see that

with the exception of pain3 (“[Mark] has pain in his back and legs, and the pain is present almost

all the time. It gets worse while he is working. Although medication helps, he feels

uncomfortable when moving around, holding and lifting things at work”) European respondents

are always more likely to call a vignette person work disabled than Americans.

       Second, the ranking amongst the European countries depends to some extent on the

specific domain chosen. For example, the Italians are quite demanding (“tough”) in the affect

domain, but the Dutch are the toughest on CVD. Yet the differences in ranking across domains

are not dramatic, consistent with the earlier observed high correlations across domains. The

Americans are the toughest overall, followed by the Italians, the Belgians, the Dutch and the

French. At the other end of the spectrum, the Greeks, Swedes, and Spaniards appear most

inclined to call a health condition work limiting. The Germans are in the middle.

       It is of interest to relate national norms about work disability to institutional

arrangements. Table 4 provides a very simple way of doing so. The first column reproduces the

grand average ranks from Table 2. Columns 2 and 3 show two indicators of employment

protection published by OECD (2004). Both indicators aggregate in some fashion three main

domains that make it difficult for an employer to dismiss an employee. These domains are (see

OECD, 2004, p. 65):

i) difficulty of dismissal, that is legislative provisions setting conditions under which a dismissal

   is “justified” or “fair”;

ii) procedural inconveniences that the employer may face when starting the dismissal process;

iii) notice and severance pay provisions.

Version 2 is somewhat broader than version 1.

       There is a fairly strong positive correlation between the strength of employment

protection and a country’s rank in the vignette distribution. People in countries with more

employment protection are on average “softer” on work disability (i.e. more inclined to see a




                                                 16
given health condition as work limiting). Naturally, there are various alternative explanations for

this positive correlation. One would be “culture”. In a country with a tough culture, citizens are

tough on work disability and don’t find employment protection very important. This is then

reflected in laws with little protection. The US would be a case in point.

5. Model Estimates for response scales and self reported work disability

       In this section, we present our parameter estimates for predicting work disability in the

nine countries. Our models incorporate a number of standard demographic covariates- age

dummies (less than 58, 58-64, 65-71, 72 or more), years of education, dummies for being female

and for currently married. In addition, a series of health indicators are included (heart problems,

lung disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, pain, arthritis, cancer, CESD score- with for the

European countries the EuroD. The benchmark country is the US. We include a full set of

interactions with an EU dummy. Furthermore we include country dummies for the separate EU

countries. Table 5 lists the means of the explanatory variables and self-reported work disability

by country.

        The first part of the table shows large differences in years of education, with low means

in the southern European countries. There are also substantial differences in the age composition,

with, for example, relatively few 65-71 year olds in Sweden. Most chronic conditions are much

more prevalent in the US than in most European countries. This applies in particular to obesity,

high blood pressure, diabetes, arthritis and heart problems. Still, self-reported work disability in

the US seems well in line with that in the European countries. Only Greek and to a lesser extent

Dutch respondents seem to face fewer work related health impairments. The vignette evaluations

suggest that, compared to Europeans, US respondents underemphasize work related health

impairments, so that their actual work related health limitations may be larger than those

suggested by the means in Table 5B. Simulations based upon the estimates of the econometric

model will look at this in detail.11

        Table A.4 in the appendix presents estimation results for the complete model, allowing

for DIF. Table A.5 presents the work disability equation in a model without DIF. The latter

model is a standard ordered probit explaining the self-reported work disability on a five point

scale. The differences between the two models illustrate the effects of allowing for differences in

response scales. The model not allowing for response scale variation is strongly rejected by the

data, as is immediately apparent from a comparison of the log-likelihoods.

        The estimated coefficients for the demographic attributes yield few surprises. Work

disability increases with age, decreases with schooling and is lower for married respondents.

Having any of the health conditions that are included in the model makes it more likely that one

reports a work disability. The interactions with the dummy for Europe show that in particular the

effects of cancer and depression on work disability are stronger in the European countries than in


11
  The difference in wording between the work disability self-assessment in the US and Europe might also play a
role.


                                                       19
the US. No such effects are found in the model that does not correct for DIF (Table A.5). The

country dummies in Table A.4 demonstrate that, once we correct for response scale differences

and control for health conditions, the Europeans are considerably less likely to be work disabled

than the Americans (the US is the reference category). The effects are similar, but smaller, in the

model without DIF, in accordance with the fact that US respondents less easily classify someone

as work disabled (cf Table 2). Both the models with and without DIF show that the effect of

education or being married on work disability is less in Europe than in the US.

        The significant estimates of the effect of covariates on the thresholds explain why the

effects of demographics and health conditions on self-reported work disability change once we

take response scale differences into account. Comparing effects of country dummies on the first

threshold across the European countries, suggests that Italians are toughest and Spaniards softest,

consistent with the raw data summarized in Table 2. Compared to country dummies, effects of

health conditions and demographics on the first threshold are modest. More educated

respondents tend to be softer, albeit less so in the EU than in the US. Females are harder in the

US, but not in the EU. Older respondents are softer in the US, but not in the EU.

        The interpretation of the estimated parameters for the remaining thresholds is not very

straightforward since these parameters reflect shifts of the second threshold relative to the first

one (cf. Equation (3)). Rather than extensively discussing these parameters we turn to some

simulations that are easier to interpret.



5.1 Simulation Results

        Figure 2 provides a first impression of the effects of using different scales. The first

column presents the distribution of self-reported work disability for the US, using US data and




                                                20
US parameters. This simply predicts sample observations for the US. Similarly the last column

predicts the distribution of work disability using EU (SHARE) data and EU parameters.

Comparing the first and last column suggests relatively minor differences in work disability

prevalence between the EU and the US. For instance the percentage saying that they have no

work disability is predicted to be about 51% in the US and 49% in the EU. On the other hand the

percentage of Americans with severe or extreme work disabilities is predicted to be about 16% in

the US and only 12% in the EU. These seemingly modest differences are the result of two

counter-acting effects: Americans use response scales that are “harder” while Europeans appear

to suffer from less work disability. This is illustrated by the remaining three columns in Figure 2.

       The second column uses EU data, but US scales and US parameter estimates to predict

EU disability. The distributions in columns 1 and 2 are virtually identical, with a slight shift in




                                                21
the direction of more work disability in the EU. This implies that distributional differences in

demographics and health have only a minor effect on differences in observed work disability

prevalence in the US and the European countries.

       The middle column is based on EU data, US parameters of the work disability equation

and EU response scales. Compared to the first and second column, we now see a dramatic shift

in the distribution in the direction of increased work disability. The shift is due to the fact that

Europeans use softer response scales and more easily call someone disabled. It is also instructive

to make a comparison with the fifth column (both EU data and EU parameters). Since the only

difference between the third and fifth column is the use of US parameters in the work disability

equation, this comparison suggests that, for given demographics and health conditions, the risk to

face an actual work disability is substantially higher in the US than in Europe. For instance,

column 3 implies that 34% has no work limitation, while column 5 implies that 49% has no work

limitation.

       Finally, a comparison of columns 4 and 5 isolates the effect of response scales on

observed work disability distributions in the European countries. When we assign US scales to

EU respondents, we observe a dramatic fall in reported work disability. For instance, the

percentage of respondents without a work disability goes up from 49% to 64%, while the

percentage with severe or extreme work limitations falls from 12% to about 10.5%. Again this is

a consequence of the fact that Americans less easily classify someone with a given impairment

as work disabled.

       Table 6 presents simulated work disability by country. The first row in each panel

presents work disability for the US; the second row presents work disability in the country, but

       As was observed for the set of all European countries, using US scales has dramatic

effects on the distribution of disability within each European country. It is worth noting that

generally most of the changes take place in the categories none and mild. The percentage of

respondents in the EU country whose work disability falls in the severe/extreme range is not

affected as much. This is as one would expect; there is probably less scope for disagreement

about whether a serious health condition constitutes a work disability than whether a mild

condition should be seen as work limiting. The biggest reduction in the severe/extreme category

takes place in Sweden (from 14.6% to 7.7%) and Spain (from 14.6% to 10.5%). In other

countries the changes are much less dramatic and in some cases the adoption of the US scales

leads to an increase in the percentage of respondents with severe or extreme work disabilities.

This happens for Italy (an increase by 1.4 percentage points) and The Netherlands (an increase

by .3 percentage points).

       When considering the changes in the categories none and mild we see the biggest

decrease in Spain (by 12.8 percentage points) and Sweden (12.2 percentage points). The smallest

decrease is seen in The Netherlands (2.6 percentage points) and Italy (4.6 percentage points).

       We have seen earlier that the use of US scales actually increases the difference in work

disability between the US and the EU countries we are considering here. It is also of interest to

investigate if the use of vignettes reduces the differences between the EU countries. A simple

measure is the variance of the percent none/mild and of the percent severe/extreme across

European countries. We find that the variance of the percentage none/mild is 36.9 if we use the

own country scales and 26.5 if we use the common (US-) scale. For the percentage

severe/extreme, the use of a common scale has virtually no effect. Using the own scale the

variance is equal to 11.0 and when using the common scale the variance equals 10.8.




                                                24
         Next we consider a number of socio-economic categories. Table 7 shows results by age.

The scale effects appear to be fairly uniform by age. For instance the effect of going from

European scales to US scales on the percentage severe/extreme varies from 1.2 in the 58-64

category to 1.8 in the 72+ category. Similarly the effect on the percentage none/mild varies from

-7.5 in the 58-64 category to -9.9 in the 72+ category.

6. Work Disability, Work, and Response Scales

   We now extend the model presented in Section 3 by adding an equation explaining

employment status, while allowing for justification bias. Justification bias has been introduced

by Bound (1991) as a possible effect of non-employment on self reported work disability, where

respondents may exaggerate their work limitations to justify that they don’t work. The empirical

evidence for the existence of justification bias appears to be mixed (see for instance Kreider and

Pepper (2007) or Jones (2007) and references therein). The use of vignettes provides a novel

approach to the estimation of justification bias.

   As before, Yi denotes the answer of respondent i to the five-point scale self-assessed work

disability question while the answers to the work limitations of the vignette persons on the same

five point scale are denoted by Yli where each respondent i evaluates L vignettes l=1,…,L.

       For employment status, we use a binary variable E, with Ei=1 if respondent i does some

paid work, and Ei=0 otherwise. In principle we could distinguish more than two categories here

(unemployed, on disability benefits, retired, homemaker, …) but the numbers of observations in

some of these employment states are quite small in some countries, making estimation of a richer

model difficult.

       The equation for self-reported work disability is the same as before, cf. (1)-(2). To keep

the model manageable by limiting the number of parameters to be estimated and to facilitate

interpretation of the results, we replace the threshold equations (3)-(4) by:

               i0  ,  i5  ,  i1  X i   Ei  ui ,  i j   i j 1   j , j  2, 3, 4   (8)

                              ui    N (0,  u2 ), independent of  i and X i                        (9)

This is a more parsimonious specification than the one used in (3). All threshold shifts are the

same. The error term ui again reflects unobserved heterogeneity in thresholds. The effect of


                                                           26
employment status Ei on the response scales reflects justification bias: depending on their

employment status, respondents may use different response scales. The advantage of the more

parsimonious specification is that in this model, justification bias is captured by a single

parameter  (which will be allowed to be different for US and European respondents in the

empirical work) instead of a set of parameters affecting several thresholds differently. We expect

a positive estimate of  if employed respondents are less likely to evaluate a given (vignette)

person as work disabled than non-employed respondents.

       The evaluations of vignettes l=1,…,L are also modeled as before, cf. (5)-(7). Employment

status is modeled using a probit-like equation:

                                       Ei*  X i   Yi *  i

                     i   N (0,1), i independent of X i , ui ,  ri , 1i ,...,  Li    (10)

                               Ei  1 if Ei*  0; Ei  0 if Ei*  0

The coefficient π represents the effect of work disability on employment status, which is the

main coefficient of interest in many studies of the effect of work related health on employment

(cf., e.g., Kreider and Pepper, 2007).

       In this model, error terms are all independent of each other, and no exclusion restrictions

are needed for identification. The intuitive argument for this is as follows: equations (5) and (8)

are identified from the vignette evaluations alone, since employment status is exogenous to the

errors in (5) and (8). Equation (1) is then identified as well, just like in the model of Section 3.

Since the error term  i in (1) is independent of the error term in (10), the variation in Yi* induced

by the variation in  i is sufficient to identify equation (10) (although estimation of (10) is

complicated by the categorical nature of Yi ).




                                                        27
       As a sensitivity check, we will also present results for an over identified version of the

model where we impose the exclusion restriction in the employment equation that health

conditions affect employment status through work disability only and not directly (maintaining

the assumption that all errors are independent of each other).

       Figure 3 presents the model including work and justification bias in graphical form.

Actual work disability affects employment status (the parameter  in (10)), but we assume there

is no reverse effect of employment status on actual work disability, in line with, for example, the

results of a recent panel data study of Böckerman and Ilmakkunnas (2009). We could in principle

allow for a reverse effect if appropriate exclusion restrictions were available. In our model,

employment status affects reported work disability through the justification bias effect on

response scales (the parameter  ).

       The figure does not show the vignette evaluations. We maintain the assumptions

underlying the vignette approach discussed in section 3, in particular vignette equivalence and

response consistency. The first now also implies that workers and non-workers do not interpret

the genuine work related health of the vignette persons in systematically different ways, and we

see no reason not to find this assumption plausible. Response consistency now also implies that

justification bias plays the same role in vignette evaluations as in self-assessments. This is an

identifying assumption that cannot be tested with the current data. Thus if non-workers evaluate

themselves as more work limited than workers with the same actual work related health, they are

assumed to also do this with the vignette persons. One might argue that they will be less inclined

to exaggerate the vignette person’s health problems than their own impairment, which would

imply that the effect of employment status on the vignette evaluations is an underestimate of

justification bias in self-assessments. Since our estimate of justification bias is driven by the




                                                28
effect on vignette evaluations, this would imply that with our method, we get a lower bound on

the “true” justification bias in self-assessments.

7. Model Estimates for Work Disability, Work, and Threshold Equations

       Tables A.6-A.10 present the model estimates with and without DIF. Comparing Table

A.6 with the estimates for the disability equation in Table A.4 shows that generally the

coefficients are of a similar order of magnitude and have the same sign. One notable difference is

the coefficient on gender, which is significantly negative in Table A.6, and which was

completely insignificant in Table A.4.




                                                     29
       The results for the threshold equation given in Table A.7 cannot be compared directly to

Table A.4, as the specification is much simpler. We will use simulations (see below) to see if the

simpler specification leads to very different outcomes. The country dummies (with the US as the

reference category) appear to be smaller, although Greece maintains its status as somewhat of an

outlier. The parameter of primary interest in Table A.7 is the coefficient on the dummy Work.

The coefficient is significantly positive in the US, while the interaction with the EU dummy

makes clear that the effect of employment status on the thresholds is essentially zero in the EU.

In other words, we find significant justification bias in the U.S. and no evidence of justification

bias in the EU. It suggests that not working is much more accepted in the EU (for whatever

reason) than in the US. Even if our estimate of justification bias is an underestimate of the true

justification bias since it does not affect vignette evaluations as much as self-assessments (see the

end of the previous section), we still believe this conclusion is justified, since we see no reason

why the violation of response consistency would apply in Europe but not in the US. It might

mean that justification bias is present in Europe as well as the US, but then it is still much bigger

in the US than in Europe.

       The estimates of the vignette equation are presented in Table A8. The estimated

coefficients on the vignette dummies are similar to those in Table A.4, although they do not

show exactly the same ranking across vignettes. Still, the correlation between the dummy

estimates in the two tables is 0.97.

       The employment equation estimates are shown in Table A.9. Since the model without

DIF is soundly rejected, we concentrate on the estimates for the model with DIF. Since (genuine)

work disability is controlled for, the effects of the health dummies indicate the effect of a

specific condition on employment keeping work disability constant. The negative effects of




                                                 30
mental health (measured through the CESD score) and, in the US, diabetes on employment

therefore imply that the negative effects of these health conditions on employment are larger than

their effect through work disability would suggest. On the other hand, the effect of obesity on

employment in the US is smaller than its effect through work disability. The insignificant effects

of other health conditions simply mean that the effects of conditions are well captured by the

effect of work disability. The estimated age dummies show the expected pattern that employment

falls with age. This pattern is much stronger in the EU than in the US. Similarly, females are less

likely to be employed than males and also this difference is stronger in the EU than in the US.

       The parameter of main interest in the employment equation is the coefficient of work

disability. It is more than twice as large in absolute terms in the US than in the EU (-.464 in the

US and -.192 in the EU). This result remains essentially unchanged when we specify the

employment equations more parsimoniously by omitting the health conditions (Table A.10). One

possible interpretation of this is that individuals in the US are more likely to work for pay and

that health is one of the main impediments for doing so. In the EU on the other hand, also

individuals in relatively good health are often not working, for instance as a result of more

generous income replacement schemes. Below we will present simulations that shed more light

on this (and other) interpretation(s).

       Comparing the coefficient of work disability with the estimate of the same coefficient in

a model without DIF shows the effect of controlling for justification bias when estimating the

effect of work disability on employment. For the European countries, there is virtually no

difference between the DIF corrected and not DIF corrected estimates in Table A.9 (-.192 and -

.197, respectively), which corresponds to the finding that there is no evidence of justification

bias for these countries. For the US the difference is larger (-.464 versus -.516) and, as expected,




                                                31
we find that the size of the effect of work disability on employment is overestimated if

justification bias is not corrected for – part of the negative correlation between work disability

and employment is due to the fact that the non-employed tend to over report their work

disability. But the size of the bias is modest. (But then again, our estimate might be seen as a

lower bound on the bias, if justification bias plays less of a role in vignette evaluations than in

self-assessments; see the discussion at the end of Section 6).



7.1 Simulation Results

       Figure 4 is analogous to Figure 2 above, but now based on the extended model including

an employment equation and allowing for justification bias. Compared to the model underlying

Figure 2, the current model has one extra equation (the employment equation) so that there are

more possible combinations of data and parameters that can be used in simulating

counterfactuals. The first three bars in Figure 4 are most comparable to those in Figure 2, while

the last two bars in Figure 4 correspond to the last two bars in Figure 2. Qualitatively the patterns

appear to be similar. If we move from US data to EU data (but retaining US scales and

parameters), i.e. from the first column to the second, we see again a slight shift in the direction of

more work disability in the EU than in the US.

       When we move from the second to the third column (EU data, US parameters, EU scales)

we see an increase in work disability, but the shift is not as dramatic as in Figure 2. Finally, a

comparison of the last two columns shows again that if we move from EU data and EU

parameters, but US scales to all data, parameters and scales European, then work disability

increases substantially (but not as much as in Figure 2). This illustrates once again the difference

in response scales used in the EU countries and in the US. The reason that the changes are less




                                                 32
dramatic than in Figure 2 is probably the fact that we have imposed that all threshold shifts are

parallel to obtain a parsimonious model (see Section 6).

       Comparing columns 4 (EU-data, US-disability equation, EU-work equation, US-scale)

and 8 (EU-data, EU-disability equation, EU-work equation, US-scale) shows a substantial fall in

the prevalence of work disability. Since the only difference between the two columns is the

difference in disability parameters, it illustrates once more the finding that Europeans are less

work disabled than the Americans, although the reported work disability levels are similar.

       The only difference between columns 6 (EU-data, EU-disability equation, US-work

equation, US-scale) and 8 (EU-data, EU-disability equation, EU-work equation, US-scale) is that

in the former the US employment parameters have been used, while in the later we use the EU

employment parameters. These differences in parameters appear to have minimal impact on the




                                               33
distribution of observed work disability, even though observed work disability does depend on

employment status through its (justification bias) effect on the response scales.

       Table 8 and Figure 5 show the percentage of people working for each of the five levels of

work disability (the last column of Table 8 is discussed below). As could be expected on the

basis of the raw data, a comparison of the first and last row of Table 8 shows that Europeans

work less than Americans for any work disability category. A comparison across the rows of

Table 8 (or the columns of Figure 5) shows that a major source of differences lies in the

parameters of the employment equation. Whenever we simulate labor market outcomes using the

US employment parameters, we find considerably higher employment rates than when we use

EU parameters. This is particularly true for the less severe work disability categories, in line with

the larger effect of work disability on employment in the US than in Europe. Once we move to

extreme work disabilities the differences become small; with an extreme work disability neither

Americans nor Europeans are likely to work.

       Figure 6 shows total employment rates in the US and the EU. Consistent with Table 8

and Figure 5, we see that employment is about twice as large when a US employment equation is

used than when we use the EU parameters in the employment equation. Whether the EU or the

US disability parameters are used has very little impact.

       Finally, we return to the issue of justification bias. The last column of Table 8 shows

simulated correlations between the binary outcomes employment (employment=1 and non-

employment=0) and not having a work limiting health condition (none=1, mild or worse=0).

Other things equal, one would expect a stronger correlation between work and self-reported

disability if US scales are used, because of justification bias, which is significant in the US and

absent in the EU. We see a small effect of justification bias. For instance, comparing the second

and third row we see the correlation decrease from .34 to .33. Other comparisons show similar

small effects. However using the US employment parameters rather than the EU ones has a much




                                                       35

employment in the EU than in the US.

8. Conclusions

       We have provided several pieces of evidence on differences in work disability between

older Europeans and Americans. The descriptive vignette analyses suggest that opinions about

what constitutes a health related work limitation are related to the generosity of earnings

replacement schemes and employment protection in different countries. We also find that the

differences in self-reported disabilities across European countries fall substantially when we use

common reporting scales (i.e. if we use vignette corrections to make scales comparable).

Consistent with earlier research, we find that Americans are less likely to call themselves work

disabled than Europeans.



                                               36
       The extended model with employment included, suggests that justification bias plays a

role in the US, but not in the EU. Americans use health as a justification for not working,

whereas Europeans don’t feel the need to do so. The effect of health limitations on employment

is about twice as large in the US than in the EU. Our simulations suggest that this mainly reflects

the fact that in the EU even healthy individuals are less likely to be working than in the US.

  APPENDIX B. The SHARE and HRS Work Disability Vignettes and Self-Reports


SHARE

Work limiting disabilities

Three domains: affect, pain, cardio-vascular disease.
One overall self-report on work-limiting disabilities.
Three vignettes per domain.

Response categories (for all questions; same as for health domains):
   1. None
   2. Mild
   3. Moderate
   4. Severe
   5. Extreme/Cannot Do

Self report:
Do you have any impairment or health problem that limits the kind or amount of work you can
do?

Introduction to vignettes:
We would now like to give you a number of examples of persons with some health problems.
We would like you to indicate the extent to which you think these people would be limited in the
kind or amount of work they can do. In terms of their age, their education, and their work
histories, you should imagine that these men or women are similar to yourself. Other than the
conditions explicitly mentioned, you should imagine the individual is in reasonably good health.
General form of vignette questions:
How much was [name of person] limited in the kind or amount of work he/she could do?

Affect Vignettes:
1. [Eva] feels worried all the time. She gets depressed once a week at work for a couple of days
   in a row, thinking about what could go wrong and that her boss will disapprove of her
   condition. But she is able to come out of this mood if she concentrates on something else.

2. [Tamara] has mood swings on the job. When she gets depressed, everything she does at
   work is an effort for her and she no longer enjoys her usual activities at work. These mood
   swings are not predictable and occur two or three times during a month.

3. [Henriette] generally enjoys her work. She gets depressed every 3 weeks for a day or two and
   loses interest in what she usually enjoys but is able to carry on with her day-to-day activities
   on the job.




                                                56
Pain Vignettes:

   1. [Yvonne] has almost constant pain in her back and this sometimes prevents her from
      doing her work.

   2. [Catherine] suffers from back pain that causes stiffness in her back especially at work but
      is relieved with low doses of medication. She does not have any pains other than this
      generalized discomfort.

   3. [Mark] has pain in his back and legs, and the pain is present almost all the time. It gets
      worse while he is working. Although medication helps, he feels uncomfortable when
      moving around, holding and lifting things at work

CVD Vignettes:
  1. [Norbert] has had heart problems in the past and he has been told to watch his cholesterol
     level. Sometimes if he feels stressed at work he feels pain in his chest and occasionally in
     his arms.

   2. [Tom] has been diagnosed with high blood pressure. His blood pressure goes up quickly
      if he feels under stress. Tom does not exercise much and is overweight.

   3. [Dan] has undergone triple bypass heart surgery. He is a heavy smoker and still
      experiences severe chest pain sometimes.


Randomization

All vignette questions are asked to all respondents. The only randomization concerns the names
of the vignette persons and the order of the vignette questions. The SHARE questionnaire had
two versions. Each has alternating male and female names on the vignettes, but where version 1
has a male name, version 2 has a female name, etc. Version 1 has the order of the questions as
given above. Version 2 reverses things: first work disability, then health; domains in reverse
order; vignettes in each domain in reverse order. The self-report always comes before the
vignettes.

HRS

Although the vignettes and self-reports in HRS are very similar to those in SHARE, there are a
few noticeable differences.

Self-report in 2004 leave-behind questionnaire:
1a. To what extent are you limited in the kind or amount of work you can do because of an
impairment or health problem?

Not at all limited, Mildly limited, Moderately limited, Severely limited, Cannot do any work




                                                57
Vignettes

HRS fielded the same vignettes as used in Kapteyn et al. (2007), with some slight changes in
formulation. The SHARE vignettes are a subset of these. Comparing the vignettes that are
common between HRS and SHARE, we find one difference. SHARE vignette CVD-2 above in
the HRS version reads:

Diane has been diagnosed with high blood pressure. Her blood pressure goes up quickly if she
feels under stress. Diane does not exercise much and is overweight. Life can sometimes be hectic
for her. She does not get along with her boss very well.
