   PUBLIC CONFIDENCE AND DEBT MANACEMENT: A MODEL AND A CASE STUDY OF ITALY


                                   ABSTRACT


     High debt countries may face the risk of self-fulfilling debt crises.  If
the public expects that in the future the government will be unable to roll
over the maturing debt, they may refuse to buy debt today and choose to hold
foreign assets. This lack of confidence may then be self-fulfilling. This
paper argues that under certain conditions, the occurrence of a confidence
crisia is more likely if the average maturity of the debt is short. On the
contrary, a long and evenly distributed maturity structure may reduce such a
risk. We consider the recent Italian experience from this perspective. In
particular we ask whether recent develnpmencs in che market for government debt
ahoy signa of unstable public confidence, and of a risk premium.

I.    Introduction
        With a public debt projected to remain close to 100% of CNP for several

years    in the future, the Italian authorities face two goals:        first, to keep

the cost    ofdebt service as   low as possible;   second,   to guarantee monetary and

financial stability while carrying out the financial liberalization required

by the EEC accords. This paper investigates the role of public debt

management in the achievement of these two goals.

        Section II of the paper briefly summarizes the debt management policies

followed in Italy during the l9BOs.       Even though in the first half of the

decade these policies were quite successful,       they may have planted the seeds

for the difficulties of the Summer of 1987, which marked a turning point.

Unlike in the pre—87 period,       the government has been unable to issue long—term

debt at low cost.     A difficult dilemma has arisen:        Should the government pay

a premium in order to prevent a shortening of the maturity of its debt?          And

hat     kind of debt instruments should be issued?

        The answers to these questions   depend on the nature of the risk premium

currently paid on long—term debt.        Section III asks whether the return on the

Italian public debt currently incorporates a premium against the risk of a

confidence crisis, or more generally of a government default. This is a

difficult question,    and any attempt to answer it must be regarded as tentative

and not conclusive.     However,   we do find some evidence that such a premium may

exist and may have been rising in recent years.

        Section IV analyzes a simple model that begins to address some of the

questions relating to debt management and confidence crises.           The central

result is that the maturity structure of public debt may influence the
likelihood of a confidence crisis on the debt:         The shorter and more

concentrated is the maturity, the more likely is a confidence crisis.

      Finally,   Section V concludes the paper with a discussion of some

implications of our model about debt management policies.



II.   Management in       Italy During the 198QA

      As shown in Figure 1, Italy approached the l980s with a short and
                                                                        rapidly
declining maturity of public debt:    In 1981, about 60% of the debt had a

maturity of less than a year; the average maturity of the whole debt

outstanding was less than one and a half years.        Virtually all of it was
nominal domestic debt.    Investors had suffered capital losses during the late

1970s, due to rising inflation and high nominal interest rates.        Afraid of

repeating the same mistakes, they were reluctant to hold long—term fixed

interest nominal debt (see Pagano <1988)).

      In order to lengthen the maturity of public debt, the authorities could

choose between three instruments:
                                     foreign currency debt, debt indexed to the

price level, or debt indexed to some short—term nominal interest rate.        The
fourth option, fixed nominal interest debt, would have demanded an
                                                                   excessively

high premium against the inflation risk.     The authorities opted heavily for

the third alternative. As indicated in Table 1, between 1982 and 1987
                                                                      they
increased   considerably the net issues of CCT (Treasury Credit Certificates),

medium—term notes whose coupons are indexed to the returns on 6—months or 1—

year Treasury Bills (TB).    As shown in Figure   1,   they succeeded in lengthening
the average maturity of government debt from a minimum of 14 months in 1982 to

a maximum of almost 4 years in the summer of 1987.

        The authorities preferred financial indexation to price     level indexation

on the grounds that the latter would have reduced the Treasury's incentives to

fiscal adjustment and it would have affected the credibility of their anti—

inflationary policy (an essential part of which was a reduction of wage

indexation).       These concerns are clearly indicated   in the 1981 "concluding

remarks' of the Governor of the Bank of Italy (see Banca d'Italia 1981).

        Other less compelling reasons have been suggested to explain this choice

in favor of CCT.       It has been argued that financial indexation is preferred by

the investor to price level      indexation or to foreign currency debt, and hence

demands a lower premium, because it protects against inflation risk as well as

against changes in the short—term real interest rate.         However, this cannot be

an argument for issuing           financially   indexed long—term debt.   An

additional explanation is the fear that issuing real or foreign currency debt

makes it impossible to reduce the burden of the debt by means of inflation or

of devaluation in case of an emergency.         However, the government still retains

other escape clauses, such as wealth taxation, forced consolidation,           or

outright repudiation.      We discuss this issue in Section V.

        The almost exclusive reliance on financial indexation had two negative

effects.     First, it magnified the repercussions    of monetary policy on the

government budget.      Any change in the short—term interest rate automatically

affected the interest payments on a large fraction of the government debt.

Thus,    one of the purposes of lengthening the maturity was defeated.

        Second,   the choice of the indexation parameter (the rate on Treasury

Bills) gave rise to a time—inconsistencyproblem.          The value of this

parameter is under the control of the authorities.        Thus they have a

temptation to keep it high at first, when the debt is issued, and to reduce it
                                              4

once the private sector is locked into an irreversible investment decision,

thereby inflicting a capital loss on the debt holders.            After 1985, perhaps

the authorities were succumbing to this temptation.            As indicated in Figi4re        2,

after 1985 the rate of return on the 1—year TBs (to which much of the debt was

indexed)     remained systematicallybelow that on the shorter—term Ths, right up

to   the   crisis of 1987.      At the same time, as shown in Figure    3,   the return on

the I—year TBs was also         generally below that or medium term    government bonds.
The positive differential between the 3—month (or 6—month) and the
                                                                   1—year TBs
is particularly striking in the first half of 1987, just prior to the crisis.

Presumably,    at that time the market was expecting higher nominal rates in the

future; and yet the authorities were not allowing the 1—year rate to bulge.

      As pointed out by Bencini—Tabellini         (1987) and Ministero del Tesoro

(1989), the perception of this time—inconsistency         was probably one of the

causes of the crisis in the Summer of 1987, even though other factors have

played an important role.1         In the few months after July 1987, the secondary

market price of CCT plummeted by more than 3 percentage points.              Since    then,

the market of this debt instrument        has not recovered,   and the authorities have

been unable to replace all of the CCT as they became due.            Since the summer of

1987, the sales of CCT to the public have never been fully subscribed.                 At

times the market bought even less than 50% of the amount offered.

      This crisis marked a turning point.         The previous strategy of financing

the deficit by issuing CCT had to be discontinued.          Perhaps,   a new debt

management strategy has not yet emerged.          As indicated in Table 1, in 1988 the

government had    to   resume   the old policy of issuing large amounts of      short—term

Treasury Bills, implying a fall of the average maturity of the debt.                 The

government also issued large amounts of medium—term fixed—nominal—interest

debt of a high interest rate.     Figure 4 compares the ex ante   real   rates of

return net of taxes on fixed—interest government bonds (BTF) and on 6—months

Treasury Bills.    Both rates display a common declining trend that reflects a

decrease in real interest rates throughout the world.       But since the summer of

1987, the BTP have paid almost 1 percentage point in real terms more than

Treasury Bills.    A   similar pattern emerges if one compares the real yield on

the CCT and on the 6—months Treasury Bills.2     Clearly,   the market is unwilling

to hold medium—long—term debt without a compensation.

     The critical question is:     what is the nature of this risk premium?         If

tne premium represents the expectation of forthcoming inflation      and our

measures of the ex ante real rates are wrong, then the course of action for

the government is clear.     Foreign currency and real (i.e., indexed) debt
should be issued in much larger amounts,     This policy has been advocated by a

committee uf Italian economists, established by the Treasury ministry in 1988

—— see Ministero del Tesoro (1989).     There is however a second possibility.

The high real interest rates currently paid on the Italian long—term debt may

represent   also a premium against a more general and vague risk of a financial

crisis.     In this second case, changing the nature of the debt instrument would

not reduce the risk premium.

     By financial crisis we do not mean that the government deliberately and

unexpectedly chooses to default on its debt.     This possibility seems very

remote.     In the current Italian situation it would probably have very high

political costs, by disrupting the system of financial intermediation and

causing arbitrary wealth redistributions.     What we have in mind instead is the

possibility of a crisis initiated by a reluctance of investors to roll over

the public debt.    In such an event, default or consolidation may be the only

way out.       But   the   realization that, in the event of a confidence crisis, the

government would be forced to a default, may be enough to trigger a crisis,                A
run on government debt could be self fulfilling, just like a bank run (see

also Bencini—Tabellini (1988)).             Figure 5 suggests that even disregarding the

primary deficits,          in the next few years the government is called to roll over

a large fraction of its outstanding debt.             The authorities may be able to

withstand a temporary crisis, as they did in 1982, when a large part of the

maturing debt was bought by the Bank of Italy, who then resold it to the

financial      markets in the form of repurchase agreements.        But would the system

be able to survive a more prolonged confidence crisis? And even if the answer

is positive,      would the public believe that the system can survive?        We now

turn to some evidence suggesting that private investors may already fear a

negative answer to these questions.



III.     Rates of Return on the Italian Public Debt

        This section asks what is the nature of the risk premium on the Italian

public debt.         We attempt to discriminate between to alternative sources of

risk,     a)   Inflation risk, due to the fact that most of the outstanding debt is

nominal.       b) Risk of a     financial   crisis leading up to public debt

consolidation or default.          To do so, we compare the returns on public debt to

those on equivalent private financial           instruments.   We always find that the

public debt pays a higher interest rate.             This suggests that it is the

identity of the debtor, and not the nature of the instrument,            that is feared

by the market.

        The only financial instrument similar to the Treasury Bills (TB) are the

Certificates of Deposit (CD) of corresponding maturity issued by banks.         The

differentials between the interest rates net of taxes paid on three— and

twelve—month TBs and the interest rates on CDs of corresponding maturity are

shown in Figures 6 and 7•3

        These figures are striking.   The TBs pay interest rates which are between

two and four points above the interest rates paid on CDs,        The differentials

relative to 12—month TBs indicate again an increasing trend starting in 1987.

It is also worth noting the peaks of March and April 1989, which reflect the

issue difficulties of those months accompanied by a one point        increase of the

official discount rate.     A very similar pattern is followed by the

differential between 6—month TBs and 6—month CDs.

        This differential between TBs and CD5 is high by international standards,

as shown in Table    2.   The high debt countries are those    in which the Treasury

Bills pay a higher rate, while in the low debt countries the relationship is

reversed.     We should note however that the size of the Italian differential

could also be attributed to the illiquidity of the secondary market for TBs

and to the possible existence     of informal repurchase   agreements for CDs

between banks and depositors, which would make the CD5 more liquid than the

TBs,     Since the Italian market for the CDs developed only recently,     it is


impossible to compute a differential before mid—1984.         In that period the

closer substitute of TB5 was the saving deposit.      Figure 8 shows the interest

differential between TBs and saving deposits for the period l978—l988.             The

differential is negatively correlated with the average maturity of government

debt.     This negative correlation is consistent with the predictions of our

theoretical model of debt runs.5

111.2 Interest Differentials on Medium/Long—TermDebt

       The possibility of a risk premium on the Italian government debt can also

be investigated by comparing the yield on ECU denominated government bonds

(CTE) with the average yield of ECU bonds of corresponding maturity (4—8

years).    Figure 9 indicates   that the yield net of taxes on the Italian bonds

was higher on average than the yield on ECU bonds.          The differential

diminished and almost disappeared in 1987; since 1988, however, we can note

again a premium on CTE.     This evidence is again consistent with the view that

the risk premium varies inversely with the average maturity of the debt.           Note

that the yield on CTE is net of taxes while that on ECU bonds is gross of

taxes, so that the after—tax differential should be even more favorable           to

CTE.

       Figure 10 shows the interest differential at issue between 2—3 years BTP

and 18—24 month certificates of deposit issued by special credit institutions.

The differential is always favorable to the BTPs with peaks in 1987 and in the

first months of 1989.     The differential       is even more remarkable if one

considers that 1988 was a boom year for the certificates of deposit of the

special credit institutions:      in spite of the differential,     this kind of CDs

increased by 41% with respect to 1987.

       Summarizing,   this evidence suggests that private investors may fear a

confidence crisis on the Italian public debt.          We now turn to a theoretical

model that analyzes how such a crisis might take place.

IV,     A Model of Debt Runs

        The basic result of this section is that a crisis of confidence in the

public debt can be self—fulfilling, like a bank run; but it is less likely to

occur if the public debt has a long and balanced maturity structure.



IV.l        Introduction and Review of the Literature

        The idea that there may be an analogy between a bank run and a run on

government debt has a long tradition, but the most recent treatment is in

Calvo (1988).       This author studies a two period model of a small open economy:

If the government repudiates its debt, it bears a cost proportional to the

amount repudiated.       Calvo shows that two equilibria exist:   a "good"

equilibrium in which the government honors its debt, and a "bad" equilibrium,

in which investors expect the government to partially repudiate and demand a

higher interest rate, and the government fulfills these expectations.          Calvo's

"bad" equilibrium is similar to the banking panic studied by Diamond and


Dybvig (1983); it reflects a coordination problem among investors making

simultaneous portfolio decisions.       If an investor expects all the other

investors      to demand a risk premium, he realizes that the government will be

forced to partially repudiate in the future; thus, his optimal response is

also to demand a risk premium.

        The confidence crisis that we study in this paper,   instead, reflects a

coordination problem among individuals making investment decisions         L
different dates.       We study an infinite horizon model in which the optimal

government policy is to roll over its debt for ever.       There are two

equilibria.       In one this optimal policy is expected by investors and carried

out    by   the government.   In the other current investors refuse to buy any
                                             10

 public debt, in the anticipation that future investors will do likewise,             and
 the government is forced to                     A second difference between Calvo's
                             repudiate.

 model and ours is in the specification of the Costs of default.            These
 differences imply that in our model, unlike in Calvo's, the
                                                             larger is the
 stock of debt maturing in a given period, the
                                               greater is the range of
parameter values for which a crisis can occur.           This feature of our model

provides a role for debt management.

        Giavazzi and Pagano (this volume) derive results related to ours.

However, in their paper, unlike in ours, the policy that gives rise to the

debt run is not derived from the government optimization
                                                         problem but is
postulated exogenously. In addition, they focus on repudiation by means of

exchange rate devaluation;       whereas, we consider outright repudiation.         Prati
(1989) models a confidence crisis along lines similar to this
                                                              paper, but
focuses on nominal debt and
                            disregards debt management.



V.2     The Model

      A   small open economy is inhabited by an
                                                infinitely lived representative
consumer,     maximizing:




(1)           u_ t—0
                       t()
where     c   denotes consumption and u(.)        is a well behaved concave utility

function.     In each period he receives one unit of non—storable
                                                                  output and pays
a distorting tax            to the government.    This tax is distorting:    in addition
to paying the tax, the consumer loses an amount
                                                f(rt)          every time the tax is
                                                   ii
collected,   where    f(O) — 0, f'(.) > 0,              f"() >   0.    Thus,   the consumer

disposable income in each period is



(2)        F(r)        1 —   r   —   f(r).

      This specification and, in particular, the convexity cf                     f(      captures in

a very simple way the well—known idea that "tax smoothirg is deairrils,.

Alternatively, one could introduce             labor SUPi'I           decision   with a

distortionary income tax.            Such a model, however, introduces subtle tire—

consistency problems which we want to abstract from (see Lucas and Stokey

(1983) and Persson and Tabellini (1989) on this point).

      Consumers     have access to perfect international               capital mdrkets      ir,   wkich

they can   borrow    or lend at      a risk free gross real interest rare eq..ci tc their

discount factor,       l/.       External tax—free assets held by the consumers                   ar rh0


beginning of period t are denoted            et.        The government only issues one            perid

discount debt and there is no domestic government debt held abroad.                          Pith ne

loss of generality,      there is no government spending,                In each period ccc

government decides how much tax revenue to raise and whether or rot cc                            hor.or


its outstanding debt obligations;            thus, policy commitments            are ruled out.

Debt repudiation is costly:            the first time some debt is repudiated,               the


economy bears a cost proportional to output (which is normalized to 1); that

is, output is reduced by a fraction            a    > 0     in the period in which repudiation

occurs for the first time.            This cost represents the economic disruptions that

may be brought about by a default on governmer.t debt, such as bankruptcies

financial markets, uncertainty, and disruption in the allocation of resources.
                                                                  12

With no change in the results, we could assume that this ccst affects

government utility rather than its budget constraint.

      Based on these assumptions,                       we can write the private sector and the

government interterporal               budget constraints respectively                 as:

      Within each period, the tiring of events ia as follows.                                First, the

government announces a price                       t   at which it stands ready to sell the debt, and

the maximum amount for sale.                       Then,     on the basis of that price, the private

sector chooaea how much debt to buy.                                      the government chooses the
                                                              Finally,

given the amount of debt outstanding, bt, and the debt just sold,
                                                                  bt±1.

        Alternatively,      the timing of events could be as follows.       First, the

government announces the maximum amount of debt for sale.               Then,   the private

sector chooses the price at which it is ready to buy the debt offered                  (,8    or

zero, corresponding to         8+l    0 or       —   1),   Finally   the government chotcs

the combination of            and Gt that satisfies the government budget constra:nt.

The two timings correspond to different          auction techniques.      The technique

used to auction TBs in Italy until March 1989 is very similar to the first

timing of events, since the government announced a minimum price and                 as.     amount

offered before the public made its bids.             Since March 1989, the technique used

to auction TEa corresponds         to the second timinr of events, since the

government announces              the amount offered       Botn timing assumptions

guarantee the separation betweer. the time at which the debt is offered ash the

time at which the public makes its bids,            that is cruccal for our results.

Section IV.5 discusses alternative timing assumptions.

        All private agents have the same (perfect) information as the government.

Thus,    a no—arbitrage condition between the returns on domestic and foreign

assets implies        (e   superscript denotes private expectations):

         Any equilibrium must have the following properties:         a)   Either      6..   —   C


or           1.   This is due to the lump sum nature of the costs of defaulting.7

(otherwise).        b)   If the government defaults, it always does it in period C.

Delaying the default does not reduce its coat, but it brings about more tax

distortions       while the debt is serviced.

         We now characterize the "good" equilibrium: by Property          (b)   we only need

to consider period        0.   If at time 0 the government defaults,      then the

ccnaumer's consolidated budget constraint from time 0 onward is:

That is, in every period consumption is equal to disposable income plus tLe

interest    payments on the initial foreign assets.

       In period      0,   the government will choose not to repudiate                        if and only if:

       to repudiate).       Using (8) and (10), condition (11) implies that

repudiation occurs if and only if it costs less than the present value of the

          A confidence crisis is triggered by the investors beliefs that in the

next period the government will                        be able to roll over the debt and will be

forced to default.                  Thus,   if a crisis occurs in period                 —    1;   investors

require imaediate              full repayment of the principal and invest in foreign

as,             For the moment we take these expectations as exogenous;                      we show below

urer       what conditions they are rational and self—fulfilling.                       Faced by a

confidence crisis, the government has two choices:8                        1)    to raise taxes and

repay the debt;               2)     to default immediately.        If the government chooses to

dsfault,        from then onward consumption is                cd   as defined in (8).         If the

goe'nment chooses to raise taxes, income falls by the amount of the tax

            is superior to defaulting if and only if

The crucial point is that if                             a       a        a       there are two equilibria,               with and

without default, depending upon the occurrence of a confidence crisis.

          The proof relies on the lump—sum nature of these repudiation costs, which

rules Out partial default.                             Suppose that the repudiation costs were linear in

the amount defaulted,                          and consisted of both a fixed and a variable component.

The good equilibrium with no default would still be described as in

Proposition 1.                   However, a confidence crisis could now take other forms in

addition to those described in that Proposition.                                                    In particulsr,       confidence

crisis similar to those of Calvo                        (1988) would also be possible,                 in which a

partial default occurs because investors fesr a fall in the demand for public

debt in the current period.

       Let    us   consider first under what conditions the government does not

default in the absence of a crisis.                        The discountedpresent value of the debt

outstanding at the beginning of period 0 is:



(17)           b           +          +   fi
                     1b0        2b0




Hence the optimal tax rate is:



                      (l—)b       r*,          t      0,1,...




Repeating the same argument illustrated in the previous subsection we cac

conclude that the government will not repudiate in the absence of a crisis if

the previous condition m                  a    holds, where         cx   is    defined as in (12), except

that now b         replaces     b0)°
       Consider now a confidence crisis in period                         t.    Suppose   first that the

private      sector followed on open—loop strategy, in the sense that the private

expectations       6,      i>0, do not depend on the aggregate history of the game in

previous periods.          If                  1,     i   > 0,   then in period      t    the government

can either default, in which case consumption from then onward is                               d   as in

(8), or it can repay the debt.                      In the latter case, since by hypothesis

private expectations are given and equal to                        1, taxes     have to be as follows:
                                                                20

If toe government chooses to repay, consumption from t                               onwarda    (CR) is:




(22)        — 1           a(l—$)        (l$)[f(01b0±2b )                +f(1bi)]          a     t




Froo (8) and (22) it follos that in the event of a crisis the governenc

chooses     to repay if and only if:




(23)         a            [f(                      +    fif(            s

        Aa in the previoua aubsection,                         it can be shown that, since no debt is

repaid between periods 0 and                       t,     a>a        for all   t.   Hence, if

a..   > a    a,       there exists an (open—loop)                    equilibrium in which a confidence

crisis occurs in period                  t       or earlier.11

        Clearly,          by (23),      a.       depends on the maturity structure        of public debt.



F.posijon2:                 If the private sector plays an open—loop strategy,                      the

equilibrium with a confidence crisis is least likely to exist if only long—

term debt is issued, and if the same ar,ounr of debt matures in each period.

to find the maturity structure that minimizes a*, for a given net—presant

Only two—period debt must be                   issued, in equal amounts        in each period.       Q.E.D.

        This result is due to the convexity of the tax collection costs.                            4'hen a


large    amount of debt falls due in a given period, the cost of repaying it in

the event of a confidence crisis is high.                        Hence,   the crisis is more likely to

result in a default.               By holding a long and balanced maturity structure,                 the

government reduces the cost of responding to a crisis by raising taxes, since

the tax burden is distributed over several periods.
                                                   22

      Proposition 2 can easily be generalized to a debt of more than two—

periods.     In the limit, if all debt is consols, a confidence crisis is ruled

out and a —     .       In   this limiting case, there is no need to roll over the

principal,     and taxes are raised just to pay interest in the debt.

      Near, consider the case in which the private aector plays a feedback

strategy.      Thus,      now       is allowed to depend on the aggregate   history up to

period t+i—l.           In particular,    in a sequentially rational Nash equilibrium,

      is a function of the stock of debt outstanding in the previous period,

            Suppose that             —   I.   If the government chooses not to repudiate

the debt,    in period t it has to raise taxes in the amount:




                   =       b +      b
               t        t—i r    t—2 t




But now, the total stock of debt outstanding next period is
                                                                        1bt+i.
Cecuscing    this debt or even repaying it all at once entails smaller tax

distortions.           Hence, the continuation of the confidence crisis beyond period t

is nou less likely.             If 01bt+1 is sufficiently small (so that    2>   (ribt+i)),
the continuation of the crisis past period t is ruled out                           Thus,
                                                          altogether.

when the private sector plays a feedback strategy, long—term public debt has

an additional advantage besides that discussed with reference to Proposition

2.   Namely,    it enables       the government to regain the confidence of investors by

partially repaying some of the debt outstanding.              This point is developed by

bars Svensson, in his comments to this paper.

IV.5    Extensions and Discussion

       IV.5.].   Government spending, or where does the initial debt come from?

       An alternative interpretation of our results is as follows.             Suppose      that

there is no initial debt, but the government needs to issue debt to                             a

temporarily high level of spending in period         0.     The optimal poiicy :5

issue   debt in period 0 and roll it over forever, so as to smooth tax

distortions over time,      If   a     is sufficiently high     (higher than a)        debt

can be issued regardless of 'confidence'; if          a <      debt cannot b      iued ad
no tax smoothing can be achieved.          In the ir.termediate case,          a <   a,    debt

can be issued only as long as confidence crises do not occur.             Thus,      the

possibility of confidence crises restricts the range of parameter valurs for

which optimal tax smoothing can be achieved by issuing debt.



IV.5.2 Debt Auctions

       The timing of events postulated in the previous pages corresponds to a

particular method for selling government debt.            Namely,   the government fixes

a base price and lets the market determine         the amount bought.     The nature of

the equilibrium,     and in particular the possibility of a confidente crisis,

depends critically on the features of this auction.            Suppose for instance that

government debt is sold through the following more sophisticated suction

method:    the government fixes a base price for short—term debt;           if any short—

term debt remains unsold, then the government sells the remaining debt as a

consol,   at whatever interest rate the market will require to absorb it.                  As

remarked above, if all debt was a consol, a confidence crisis would never

occur in this simple model,          Hence, in the event of a confidence crisis,           the


government would always be able to sell the consol with no risk premium.
                                                    24

Knowing that the government can tely on thia option rules out the bad

equilibrium with the confidence crisis, for any maturity of the debt

outatanding:          the maturity of the outstanding debt is completely irrelevant!

What matters is only that the government retains the 22                   jMlit    of selling

long—term debt.

       However,        in a more realistic     environment,     where long— and short—term

instrumenta    are not perfect substitutes from the point of view of the

investors,    this alternative auction method may not rule out completely the bad

equilibria.           But thia example auggeats that a careful selection of auction

rathods may contribute to ensure financial                stability   in a high debt economy.

4.   more careful study of this issue is an irportant task for future research.



IV.5.3    rerium
       Our model is deterministic,             thus it is impossible to address the issue of

the risk premium in a precise way.               More generally,      in a model with some

uncertainty a risk premium on government debt might be requested by the

investors.     Ciavazzi and Pagano (this volume) have analyzed this issue.                      ke

conjecture that the nature of their results would carry over to our optimizing
                  -

framework.

       Suppose that         a confidence crisis occurs in every period with probability

       exogenously given.            That is, in every period         64.] > 0   with

true value of          a    is unknown to the consumer,       who only assigns a probability

but if     +l — 1           the   probability of a default is equal to Prob(o<o) •         (o)
where a      has the same interpretation            as above.    Thus,   in every period   t,   the
                                            25

probability of default is                If a confidence crisis occurs and                a          a

the government repays the debt;     if a < a       the government defaults.          In either

case there is no debt left after the crisis.          Until a confidence crisis

occurs,    the government has to pay a risk premium or          its   liability to

compensate for the default risk,      As shown    above,    a     is lowest the    'mc'


balanced and the longest is the maturity structure of the debt.                 Thut,         tri.


risk premium can be reduced by lengthening and balancing the maturit

structure of government debt.



IV.5.4     Consolidation

        A third option, in addition to   repudiating      or raising taxet      is avc'il-le

to the government in the event of a confidence crisis:                to consolidate      the

debt.     'Consolidation"   is defined as a compulsory transformation of short—tero

debt due for maturity into long—term debt,          If the secondary market for public

debt is perfectly efficient, a consolidation would cause only a minor capital

loss on the current holders of the debt.          Thus,   if private investors       co.d            be

sure that the government would respond to the crisis by consolidating the debt

rather than by repudiating it, they would not "fear" the crisis.                But this             it.


turn would seem to make the occurrence of a crisis less likely.                Ir...eed,       it

can be shown that if the secondary market is perfectly efficient,               alloying the

government to consolidate      its debt in the event of a crisis eliminates the bad

equilibrium in which a crisis occurs.          This is similar to a suspension of

payments during a banking panic, as      itt   Diamond—Dybvi (1983).

        There are however two counterarguments,      at least in the Italian

situation.     First, even though the market is much more efficient now than it

used to be, it is interesting to recall what happened during the Italian
                                         26

forced consolidation of 1926.    At that time, the secondary market price of

government debt plummeted by about 30% (even though it later recovered, and

debt holders who did not liquidate the consolidated debt did not suffer high

losses      see Alesina (1988) and Confalonieri—Catti (1986)),   This suggests

thor consolidation is still likely to be very fearsome for private investors.

Seoond,   to the extent that the politiosl and economic costs of oonsolidation

srs smaller than those of outright repudiation,   the panic equilibrium may he

mode more (rather than less) likely by the option of consolidating the debt.

in terms of the model, the parameter o would drop, which in turn makes the

crisis more likely.



V.   Conolusions

     Our theoretical and empirical findings suggest a tentative explanation of

rho reoent difficulties in rolling over the Italian public debt:    the fear of

a confidence crisis on the debt.    If correct, this explanation has some novel

polio'1' implioations.   All of them enhante the chance of surviving a oonfidenoe

rrisis vithout defaulting on the debt.

     First of all, the quantity of debt coming due at eaoh date is more

important   than the composition of the debt by category of debt instrument.

Minimizing the stock of debt coming due at each date would diminish the

perceived likelihood of a confidence crisis.    This could be aohieved by

issuing debt of long maturity and evenly concentrated at all future dates.

Such a policy msy reduce the cost of seriioing the debt betsuse it would

reduoe the default risk premium required by the investors,   since a confidenoe

crisis would be less likely to occur.
                                                27

       Second,   like in the case of banking panics, there is a role for a lender

of last resort.       Here this role could be fulfilled by foreign governments or

international organizations,         through the promise of a credit line to the

country hit by the debt panic.           Gaining access to such a credit line would

increase the chances of surviving a crisis without defaulting, thereby neking

the occurrence of the crisis less likely.            A similar point    is raised   by
Grilli—Alesina (1990)         with reference to speculative attacks against         the
exchange   rate.

       There is a third option, often used in         the   pest:   to rely on financial

controls and monetary policy in order to artifically increase the derand for

public debt,       However,    the European accords will severely constrain the           ccc of
both   instruments.     This constraint is more likely to Dc a blessing than              a
drawback,    It is true that imposing financial          controls and monetizing part cf

the debt would make it         easier   to wjthatand a debt run,    but on the other hand,

resorting   to these instruments        too frequently   distorts the incentives of the

government by hiding the coats of deficit finance and creating               a   confusio"i of

responsibilities between budgetary policies and monetary policy.                 As often

argued in the Italian policy debate, these incentive effects could slow down

the process of debt stabilization and thus further undermine              the credibility

of the government.

1.   First, the lags in the indexation mechanism of CCI determined cspital

gains as long as inflation and interest rates were falling, but, when they

stsote4 to increase, the same lags determined capital losses and heavy

distnvestzents of banks and mutual funds.         Second, technical innovations in

the newly issued    CT   and a change in taxation contributed to the fall of the

market price of CCT in the secondary market.         Finally,   the unusually large

tedemptions    that the mutual funds were facing forced them to liquidate part of

thoit assets.

2.   -The   ex ante real returns have been computed by using a survey of inflation

anpectations published by Isco—Mondo Economico, which provides quarterly

expeoted inflation data for the current and following quarter.          Naturally, the

real return differential in Figure     5   should be interpreted with caution, sinte

we are using the same deflator for short— and long—term government debt (we

simply analyze the six months expeoted inflation from the survey)

3.   The time series of the differential relative to the 3—month CD starts only

in April 1988, since this kind of financial        instrument was first introduted at

that date.

4.   Note that the definition of saving deposits includes the CDs.         The

interest rate on saving deposits used to compute the differential in Fig. 8 is

a weighted average of the interest rate on CD5 and on other kind of saving

deposits (the CD component will evidently be relevant only since 1984).

5.   However, the movements of the differential between lBs end saving deposits

correspond quite closely to those of the nominal interest rate.          As a

oonsequenoe, part of the differential can also be attributed to the tax levied
                                                               29

on banks by means of the reserve requirement.                                This tax, in fact, varies

together with the nominal interest rate; as long as the banks transfer part of

the tax on depositors,                  the differential         with the TBs widens when the               r,orninal

interest rates increase and it shrinks when they decline.

6.    An equilibrium satisfying these two conditions is a sequertally ra.ora.

Nash Equilibrium,                as defined in Persson and Tabellir.i (1989).

7.     Suppose that the government chooses                          0   <       <    1.     Tien it inrura the

Costs of default as if                                — 1   and some remaining debt has to be rrvlced
                                            6t+l
with distortionary taxation.

8.     In principle a third option would be available:                                consolidation.        'e will

discuss        this option below, in Section IV.5,                          For the moment we rule it cut by

assuming that the cost                      z    applies to both default                  consolidation.         More

fundamentally,            this simple model with one period debt and no uncertainty is

not   well equipped to handle the issue of consolidation.

9.    In this deterministic model a multiplicity of equilibria cannot occur in

any period other than the first without violating a rationality condition.                                                In

fact if a confidence crisis had to occur at time                                 t   > 0,    nobody would        hold
debt of time             (t—l), (t—2)             and so on.     Thus,       the crisis would ravel backward

at time zero,             Thus, the critical assumption is that                              exists before the
                                                                                       b0

planning horizon begins.

10.       By (5), the cost of repudiation is borne only once.                                Thus, if      8,'
                                                                                                                 —   I,
then           — 1       also.

11.       If         >   ,       a <   t,       the   confidence crisis unravels to the period

immediately preceding that for which a5 >                                    for the first time.

12.       Remember that given our specification of the Costs of default, no value

of    8    c (0,1)        can be a rational expectation equilibrium.
