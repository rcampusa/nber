                                                ABSTRACT

From 1864 to 1972, the real price of oil fell by, on average, over one percent per year. This trend dramatically
broke when prices for crude increased by over 650 percent from 1972 to 1980. Policy makers adopted
several policies designed to keep oil prices in check and reduce consumption. Missing from these policies
were taxes on either oil or gasoline, prompting a long economics literature documenting the inefficiencies
of these alternative policies. In this paper, I review the policy discussion related to the transportation
sector that occurred during the time through the lens of the printed press. In doing so, I pay particular
attention to whether gasoline taxes were "on the table," as well as how consumers viewed the inefficient
set of policies that were ultimately adopted. The discussions at the time suggest that meaningful changes
in gasoline taxes were on the table; the public discussion seemed to be much greater than it is today.
Some in Congress and many presidential advisors in the Nixon, Ford, and, Carter administrations supported
and proposed gasoline taxes. The main roadblocks for taxes were Congress and the American people.
Polling evidence at the time suggests that consumers preferred price controls and rationing and vehicle
taxes over higher gasoline taxes or letting gasoline prices clear the market. Given the saliency of rationing
and vehicle taxes, it seems difficult to argue that these alternative polices were adopted because they
hide their true costs.

Rejecting a stiff (probably 30- or 40-cent) increase in the gasoline tax may have been the Pres-
ident’s most fateful energy decision. It relieved pressure on the automobile industry to break
radically with its past: to produce a basic, simple, fuel-efficient car. Shorn of many of today’s
common accessories, such a car would give good fuel mileage, but less power and comfort than
current automobiles. It would be intended primarily for transportation, not ego gratification,
sex appeal or even driving pleasure.

Can you imagine how much better off we’d be if President Ford had taken bold action (of
passing a gasoline tax)?

1     Introduction
By the end of 1972, things were great for oil. Prices were on a steady downward trend, falling
on average by over one percent per year from 1861 to 1972; coal was giving way to oil as a fuel
for electricity generation; and, vehicle ownership was expanding. Figure 1 shows oil prices
from 1861 to 1972. Real prices peaked in 1864 at $115.45 per barrel and trended downward
reaching a low point of $10.42 per barrel in 1970.
    The drop in real oil prices coincides with increases in US oil consumption. Figure 2 plots
consumption from 1875 to 2011. Consumption increased dramatically from 0.011 quadrillion
BTUs (quads) in 1875 to nearly 35 quads in 1973. The introduction of the Ford Model T
at the end of 1908 sparked a new use for petroleum. Vehicle ownership rose sharply until
the Great Depression, but then appears to have continued on the pre-Great Depression trend
after World War II (Figure 3). Concerns about local pollution in the 1960s prompted shifts
away from coal-fired electricity plants to oil-fired plants. The share of electricity generation
coming from oil increased from roughly six percent in 1960 to over 16 percent by 1973 (Figure
4). By the early 1970s, it was clear that the US was consuming more and more oil, but at
the same time, oil expenditures as a fraction of GDP were extremely low—hovering at levels
below two percent (Figure 6).
    The picture was very different by the end of 1973. In October of 1973 the members of
the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries announced a US oil embargo. The
embargo, partly in retaliation for the US support of Israel during the Yom Kippur war, lasted

through March of 1974. World oil prices rose sharply to an average of $52.85 (in 2011 dollars)
during 1974 and the US spent over $300 billion dollars on oil, nearly seven percent of GDP.
Expenditures on oil imports exceeded two percent of GDP.
   Prices stabilized at these higher levels until 1979 when a second oil shock occurred in
the wake of the Iranian Revolution. Protests in Iran hampered oil production and led to the
suspension of Iranian oil exports. With Iranian production accounting for roughly ten percent
of world oil production, these disruptions had a large effect on prices. This was followed by
the Iran-Iraq War which lowered production in both countries. Figure 5 shows production
for the top five oil producers in the region. Production in Iran fell from roughly six mmbd
prior to 1978 to below 1.5 mmbd during 1980 and 1981 (world production hovered around
60 mmbd during this time). Iraqi production fell below one mmbd in 1981 and 1982 from a
peak of nearly 3.5 mmbd in 1979.
   Oil prices peaked at over $100 per barrel in real terms (2011 dollars) in 1980; US oil outlays
exceeded ten percent of GDP in both 1979 and 1980 (Figure 6). Perhaps more importantly,
spending on oil imports exceeded 4.5 percent of US GDP in 1980.

      While prices began to fall after 1980, the events from 1973 to 1980 made it clear that oil
prices could be volatile and events in a single country, or a small group of organized countries,
could have huge consequences on prices and macroeconomic activity.
      Many pointed to the increases in oil imports as the major issue. Figure 7 plots consumption
and the share of consumption coming from imports from 1960 onward. The import share
began to rise rapidly in the late 1960s; US imports increased from 18.5 percent in 1960 to
over 36 percent in 1973.
      Oil imports drew the attention of policy markers even before the embargo. The Eisenhower
administration established the Mandatory Oil Import Quota program (MOIP) in 1959. MOIP
put limits on crude oil and refined product imports, and gave preferential treatment to oil
imports from Canada and Mexico.1 In April of 1972, Secretary of State John N. Irwin testified
in from of the House Interior Committee, stating: “Isn’t it self-evident that if the United
States is dependent on the two-third to three-fourths of the world oil supply (in Middle East
countries) we would be hard-pressed to resist their ultimatum that we keep hands off Israel?

      Not coincidentally, OPEC was formed in 1960.

It would be a problem.”2 Speaking in front of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee in
October of 1972, James Atkins, a State Department’s oil expert, said: “We believe that the
first priority of the United States is to limit its increasing reliance on imported supplies of
oil...We believe that the foreign policy pitfalls of an excessive reliance on important energy
are too serious to risk.”3 Indeed, the 1973 embargo was not the first embargo. In June of 1967
several Middle-East countries limited shipments to the US and UK, but only Syria stopped
all oil exports. Given the low cost of shipping oil, these actions had little influence on oil
prices.
      It isn’t completely clear that policy makers needed to react to the oil crises; the public
debate typically was not couched in terms of market failures such as externalities. But, given
the reliance of the US economy on oil consumption, one could argue that consumers did not

internalize the costs of oil consumption associated with its affect on macroeconomic activity
and energy security.4 There was little question that policy makers felt a need to react.
      The first response from these events was to strengthen price controls on oil, prompting the
need for rationing rules, but long gasoline lines and shortages still occurred. The speed limit
on highways was reduced to 55 miles per hour. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
Standards and Gas Guzzler taxes were subsequently adopted. To the chagrin of economists,
absent from these policies was a gasoline tax. Indeed, price controls on both oil and gasoline
pushed prices below equilibrium levels. The reliance on alternatives to Pigouvian taxes led to
a long literature in economics estimating the inefficiencies of these alternative policies. (See,
for example, Fischer, Harrington and Parry (1982), Jacobsen (2011), Holland, Hughes and
Knittel (2009), Holland et al. (2010).)

fuel consumption in the US with a large set of countries both before and after the shocks.

attention to whether gasoline taxes were “on the table,” as well as how consumers reacted to
the inefficient set of policies ultimately adopted.
      Discussions at the time suggest that meaningful changes in gasoline taxes as a way to
reduce consumption were on the table; the public discussion seemed to be much greater than
it is today. This is despite the fact that price controls were clearly working against such taxes.
Some in Congress and many presidential advisors in the Nixon, Ford, and, Carter administra-
tions supported and proposed gasoline taxes. Presidents Nixon and Carter supported higher
gasoline taxes, while President Ford did not. However, Ford was a staunch advocate of de-
controlling oil prices and therefore understood the incentives that higher prices would bring.5
The main roadblocks for taxes were Congress and the American people. Polling evidence at
the time suggests that consumers preferred price controls and rationing over higher gasoline
taxes. They also preferred taxes on low-fuel-economy vehicles over increases in gasoline prices.

potential for queueing, it seems difficult to argue that these alternative polices were adopted
because they hide their true costs. This would seem to suggest one of two possibilities, or
a combination of the two: (1) we tend to overstate the value of people’s time for activities
such as refueling, and (2) concerns about the regressivity of policies such as gasoline taxes
outweigh their efficiency gain.6


2       Policy responses
The US enacted a variety of policies designed to reduce consumption and limit price impacts.
The discussion at the time centered around a desire for policy makers to keep oil and gasoline
expenditures down and to limit “windfall” profits for domestic oil companies. In this section,
I discuss the policies adopted.
    6
    I freely admit that this runs counter to the results in Deacon and Sonstelie (1985) that find when faced
with a choice of a zero queue bundled with a high price for gasoline and waiting for a low price, consumers
seem to reveal a value of time that is inline with their wage rates.

2.1       Supply-side policies

Prior to the oil embargo, oil and gasoline markets were already stressed. The MOIP reduced
oil imports; and, President Nixon instituted price controls for oil beginning in 1971 as part of
a large program controlling prices. These actions led to oil shortages in 1971 and 1972 and
long lines for gasoline in 1972. The 1971 shortage and the expectation of a shortage in 1972
prompted Nixon to lift import controls for Canadian oil.
      The imposition of price controls, and their popularity, in 1971 likely laid the groundwork
for the policies adopted during the oil crises and policy makers’ resistance to taxes. While
firms and labor unions tended to oppose price (and wage) controls, they appeared to be
popular among consumers (and even some academic economists).7 A Harris poll in early
1972 found that respondents, by a 53 to 23 margin, believed Nixon’s price controls were doing
“more good than harm.”8 In fact, the description of the poll results point to concerns among
respondents that Nixon was being too flexible on prices.

      The time series of approval ratings for Nixon’s economic policies also points to the pop-
ularity of his price control policies. Table 1 shows a time series of a Harris poll asking: “Do
you feel the economic policies of the Nixon Administration are doing more good than harm
or more harm than good?” Nixon’s approval rating jump up right when price controls were
adopted and hovered near 50 percent, while tended to hover around 30 percent prior to the
controls.

      The oil embargo struck in October of 1973. In November of 1973, Nixon signed the
Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act which further regulated oil prices. The Act created a
two-tiered pricing system. “Old oil”—those wells drilled before 1973—had a price ceiling of
$5.25 a barrel ($19.44 in 2011 dollars). “New oil” was defined as oil from wells that began
operation after 1972, or production from old wells above the wells’ 1972 production levels.
The price of new oil could be as high as $11 per barrel ($40.74 per barrel in 2011 dollars), close
to the world price at the time of roughly $12 per barrel ($44.44).9 The Act also extended price
controls for refined products. The two-tiered pricing structure created large rent transfers.
Those refineries that had access to old oil were more profitable than those relying on imports
or new oil. In response to this, “old oil entitlements” were issued beginning in 1974 to equate
the benefits, more or less, of old oil across refineries. To do this, refineries that used more old
oil had to buy entitlements from refineries that consumed more imported oil.
      Shortages in 1974 led to a nation-wide odd-even rationing program. Vehicles with license
plates ending in an odd number could purchase gas on odd days; those with even-numbered
license plates could purchase fuel on even days. To even out access, everyone could purchase

gasoline on the 31st. Given the infrequency in which vehicles refuel, it isn’t clear whether
odd-even rationing reduced consumption.
       Ford entered office in August of 1974. Ford pushed for decontrol of oil prices, but Congress
rejected his proposals. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) of 1975 (Public law
94-163) was a compromise, of sorts. The Act, which lasted 40 months, reduced price controls
for domestic oil, reversed a $2 tariff on oil imports (discussed below), and created a maximum
average price for domestic oil. Under the Act, average oil prices would fall from their current
level of $8.75 a barrel to $7.66, and be allowed to grow up to ten percent per year, at the
discretion of the President, until February of 1977. After this date, Congress could stop any
increase in oil prices above the rate of inflation.10 The Act was later amended in September
of 1976 to allow prices to increase by ten percent a year for the entire 40-month period. The
Act also required decreases in crude prices be passed through, in their entirety, at “all levels
of distribution from the producer through the retail level...”
       Ford reluctantly signed the EPCA, stating: “This legislation is by no means perfect. It
does not provide all the essential measures that the Nation needs to achieve energy indepen-
dence as quickly as I would like. However, after balancing the inadequacies and the merits,
I have concluded that this bill is in the national interest and should be enacted into law.”
His reluctant support came from the fact that the Act gradually phased out price controls:
“The bill seeks to lower retail prices in the short term and runs the risk of creating a false
impression that we can have all the energy we want at cheaper prices. But over time, this
legislation removes controls and should give industry sufficient incentive to explore, develop,
and produce new fields in the Outer Continental Shelf, Alaska, and potential new reserves
in the lower 48 States. I fully intend to use the flexibility which is granted to me by this
legislation to expedite the decontrol of crude oil in order to increase domestic production. I
do not expect the Congress to stand in the way of such actions.”11
       The second oil crisis led to the large shortages of gasoline. Despite resistance from Congress
and consumer groups, Carter began phasing out price controls on oil as soon as EPCA al-
lowed (June of 1979).12 Carter also increased the allotted mark up for refining in early 1980,

    On a number of occasions House Democrats passed resolutions calling for the extension of price controls,


                                                    10
increasing gasoline prices independent of the change in crude prices.13
    Pressure from the Department of Energy (DOE) and the announcement that price controls
would be relaxed during 1979 may have exacerbated shortages. Verleger (1979) documents
that while the DOE called on refineries to build up inventories of gasoline at the beginning
of the year, they also called on refineries to build up inventories of distillate fuels in April,
leading to more crude oil being used to make fuel for winter heating. In addition, the price
control system may have led to an incentive to withhold gasoline, at least on the margin. The
price of gasoline was based on the previous month’s crude acquisition costs. Depending on
a refinery’s expectations about the price path of oil, this could have created an incentive to
store gasoline for the next month. Furthermore, because the phasing out of price controls was
announced, there was an addition incentive to withhold until prices were free to adjust.
    The effect of phasing out price controls on US production is unclear, but there is some
evidence that production increased. Figure 8 plots monthly domestic production and includes
vertical lines representing the EPCA’s passage which allowed crude prices to increase ten
percent per year and the phasing out of price controls. It also includes lowess smoothed line
for each of the three time periods. There was a clear downward trend in US production from
1974 to 1977, when price controls were at their strictest. While hardly conclusive, there is
some evidence that production initially increased in 1977, when EPCA allowed oil prices to
increase by ten percent per year. Production fell toward the end of 1978, possibly because oil
producers knew price controls would be phased out in 1979. Production then increased after
the phase out began, leveled off, but then fell with oil prices in 1986.

2.2     Demand-side policies

One of the first policies adopted to reduce consumption was a reduction in the speed limit to
55 miles per hour. On January 3, 1974 Nixon signed into law the Emergency Highway Energy
with some members believing the supply for domestic oil was perfectly inelastic. For example Representative
Bob Eckhardt, D-Texas, stated that decontrol of oil prices would cost consumers of $1 billion per month
and “won’t produce one additional barrel of oil.” (“House Democrats Strike a Blow at Carter’s Plan for
Phasing Out Oil Price Controls,” Wall Street Journal, May 23, 1979.) Kathleen O’Reilly, executive director
of Consumer Federation of America, called the decontrol of oil prices “the most inflationary, anti consumer
decision of the century.” Other consumer groups, such as the League of Women Voters, the Sierra Group, and
the National Audubon Society supported the decision. “Carter Weighs Fuel-Supply Suggestions After Talks
with Oil, Consumer Groups,” Wall Street Journal, June 4, 1979.

Conservation Act (Public Law 93-239) that gave states 60 days to reduce speed limits or lose
all federal highway funds. The Act also allotted $1.5 billion to finance a new rail system.14
      The EPCA of 1975, discussed above, also created Corporate Average Fuel Economy Stan-
dards (CAFE). The Act set company-level minimum average fuel economy levels for model
years starting in 1978, giving regulatory power to the Department of Transportation’s Na-
tional Highway Traffic Safety Administration. CAFE standards were actually a compromise.
Congress (and the Ford administration) initially considered taxes on “gas guzzlers.” Initial
values for the gas guzzler tax would have placed a tax of $1,000 on cars with fuel economy
below 13 miles per gallon. This was voted down by a 235 to 166 margin.15
      The standards under CAFE were viewed as much weaker than the proposed gas guzzler
taxes and were “not strenuously opposed by the automobile manufacturers.”16 The vote
was 306 to 86. A second reason suggested why labor unions and automobile manufacturers

supported CAFE standards (relative to the gas guzzler tax) was the two groups factored in the
history of postponing the implementation of tailpipe pollution standards when manufacturers
argued they were too costly.17 In fact, after oil prices fell in the mid-1980s, CAFE standards
were relaxed because manufacturers argued they were too costly.
      Unlike the price controls extended by the EPCA, and arguably unfortunately, CAFE
standards continue today. The 2011 standards were 30.2 mpg for cars and 24.1 mpg for
light-duty trucks and SUVs. Beginning in 2012, CAFE standards changed considerably in
the sense that they are now “footprint based.” That is, the standard is now vehicle specific;
larger vehicles, measured by the circumference of their wheels, face a lower standard. As a
result, it is difficult to know exactly how average fleet fuel economy will evolve, but the targets
for 2012 were 33.3 mpg for cars and 25.4 for light-duty trucks and SUVs.
      The Energy Tax Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-618) established gas guzzler taxes. These
were much lower than those considered in 1974. The tax began with 1980 model year vehicles
and was limited to cars that weighed below 6,000 pounds; light-trucks were exempt. Vehicles
that were subject to the tax and had a fuel economy between 14 and 15 mpg were taxed at
$200 ($474 in 2011 dollars), while those with fuel economies below 14 mpg were taxed at $550
($1304 in 2011 dollars). The Act called for these to eventually increase to $1,800 and $3,850,
respectively.18 The number of taxed vehicles was extremely low. In 1980, only 11 vehicles
were subject to the tax; this increased to 12 vehicles in 1981 and 20 in 1982.19
      Gas guzzler taxes remain today. The tax rates and fuel economy cut-offs have not changed
since 1991. Therefore, inflation and technological progress have eroded their effective tax
levels. That is, whether a vehicle is a “gas guzzler” is a relative term that depends on the the
level of technology. Table 2 lists the tax levels and cut-offs that were established in 1991. The
table also reports the “equivalent” tax levels and cut-offs for 2011. Specifically, I adjust the
tax levels to account for inflation. I also calculate the equivalent 1991 fuel economy cutoffs by
accounting for technological progress using a rate of two percent per year, which is broadly
consistent with Knittel (2011). For example, a modern-day vehicle whose fuel economy is
between 21.5 mpg and 22.5 would be in the same portion of the distribution for fuel economy

      A number of policies were also adopted implicitly or explicitly subsidizing alternative fuels.
The Energy Tax Act of 1978, besides creating the gas guzzler taxes, also had a provision that
exempted gasoline that was mixed with at least ten percent ethanol from the federal gasoline
tax (4 cents at the time). Later, the Alternative Motor Fuels Act of 1988 (Public Law 100-494)
gave credits under CAFE to vehicles capable of running on certain alternative fuels. Under
the Act, gasoline consumption of a vehicle, for CAFE purposes, is calculated assuming that
50 percent of the time the vehicle runs on pure gasoline, while the other 50 percent of the
time it runs on its alternative fuel. The Automotive Fuel Economy Manufacturing Incentives
for Alternative Fueled Vehicles Rule of 2004 extended these credits.
      Renewable Fuel Standards—requirements to buy a minimum amount of alternative fuels—
began with The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Public Law 109-58). The Act required sales of
alternative fuels which includes, amongst others, ethanol, methanol, and biodiesel. It required
7.5 billion gallons of alternative fuels to be sold in 2012. The Energy Independence and
Security Act (EISA) of 2007 (Public Law 110-140) extended the original Renewable Fuel
Standard, and differentiates fuels based on their lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions. The
RFS calls for minimum levels of a variety of “advanced” biofuels—biofuels that achieve large
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions relative to gasoline.20 Ultimately the current RFS
 20
      To date, however, the requirements for these advanced biofuels have been waived.

3        What happened to fuel consumption?
Figure 7 illustrates that oil consumption fell drastically during the oil shocks; not until 2000
did oil consumption reach its 1978 level on a per-capita basis. In this section, I compare
on-road transportation fuel consumer over time and across countries.
       Figure 9 plots fuel consumption for on-road use of gasoline and diesel, in gallons of oil
equivalent per capita, for a large set of countries over time. Consumption in US exceeded all
other countries prior to the oil shocks and continues to do so today. At least two patterns
emerge. First, Canada appears to have lagged the US in responding to the second oil price
shocks. Canada, a net exporter of oil, initially kept prices below those in the US. Second,
consumption in the European countries responded little to the second price shock. Some
European countries effectively smoothed the price shock by reducing fuel taxes.21 Both of
these points is illustrated in Table 3 for a subset of OECD countries. Canadian prices did not
respond much in 1978 and 1979, but did in 1980. UK prices fell in 1978 and didn’t increase
by nearly as much as prices in Italy, nor did prices in Germany and France. Because US
gasoline taxes were so low, changes in crude prices had a larger impact, in percentage terms,
on prices.
       I next normalize consumption at each country’s 1972 level and plot normalized consump-
tion in Figure 10. Both the US and Canada exhibited the slowest growth in consumption
since 1972. While one may take this as evidence that US and Canadian policies were most
effective, it is difficult to distinguish this from a level effect and differences in income growth.
The US and Canada had more room to reduce consumption because the fuel economy of their
vehicle stock was so much lower than in other countries. Countries also varied considerably
in their income growth over this time period. To control for changes in income, population
density, and average year effects, I regress the log of fuel consumption on the log of population
density, the log of GDP, and year- and country-fixed effects. I then normalize the residuals to
their 1972 levels. These are plotted in Figure 11.22 After controlling for changes in GDP and
population density, the increase in fuel consumption of the US (and Canada) is toward the
  21
       This would seem to be an advantage of higher taxes that is not typically discussed.

       Japan and Mexico exhibit large fluctuations over this time period. I omit these for visual ease.

4.1    The Nixon Administration

President Nixon was not against gas taxes. In fact, Nixon pushed for gasoline taxes even
before the oil embargo. In November of 1970, President Nixon proposed, to Congress, a
modest two to three cent per gallon tax (nine and 14 cents in 2011 dollars, respectively)
for leaded gas. The proposal was not in response to concerns about oil imports, but was
instead viewed as a revenue generator and a way to promote unleaded gasoline.23 The Nixon
administration again considered a gasoline tax in 1973. Prior to the embargo, gasoline prices
increased from 38.5 cents per gallon in May to over 55 cents in June. Gasoline taxes were
considered as a way to reduce the shortages generated from the price controls. It was reported
that in June of 1973 many of Nixon’s advisors supported a tax as high as ten cents per gallon

(40 cents in 2011 dollars).24 The regressivity of such a tax was frequently noted in newspaper
articles and op-eds of the time. For example, a June 6, 1973 New York Times Letter to
the Editors by Carl M. Selinger, Dean of Bard College, entitled “The Immorality of Raising
the Gasoline Tax,” compared a gasoline tax to a law where “it would be unlawful for any
worker with a large family, a low income and other heavy financial obligations to drive his
car to work...” Foreseeing the large economics literature that would develop as a result of not
imposing gasoline taxes, the op-ed did admit that alternatives “may give us a somewhat less
efficient society—but that is not an excessive price to pay to keep it a decently just one.”
       The embargo led to more discussions about the merits of a gas tax. A November 10 New
York Times article reports that the administration was considering a 40-cent gasoline tax
($1.61 in 2011 dollars), with the revenues refunded back to consumers. Nixon’s economic

    Cowans, Edward. “Politics, Economics and the ’Gas’ Tax; News Analysis,” New York Times June 2,
1973. The article discusses the political difficulties of such a tax. In particular, earmarking the revenues
would cause problems and that the tax would be regressive. One noted advantage of the tax is that it would
cool the economy during a time of economic boon.

advisors supported such a plan, but the Treasury Department opposed it because a refunded
tax would be difficult to administer. Such a large tax appears to have been abandoned by the
administration and reports from December of 1973, state that President Nixon pushed for a
ten cents per gallon gasoline tax.25 After this met resistance in Congress, the administration
then floated an idea of taxing “excess” gasoline consumption. According to the plan, families
would be allowed to purchase 14 gallons of gasoline tax-free for their first car and seven gallons
of gasoline tax-free for the second car, but this did not appear to gain traction.26

4.2       The Ford Administration

In contrast to Nixon and despite much support within his administration, President Ford was
staunchly against increasing gasoline taxes. He was not, however, against raising the price of
gasoline, as he supported tariffs on foreign oil and pushed to decontrol oil prices.
       Ford called for a reduction in US oil consumption of one million barrels per day by the
end of 1975—roughly a six-percent reduction from 1974 levels. Newspaper articles from
November and December of 1974 suggest that many of the President’s top energy advisors
pushed for a gas tax to meet this goal, despite the unpopularity of such a tax with the public.
Secretary of the Interior Rogers C.B. Morton was one of the main proponents, although it
was reported that four of Nixon’s senior advisors supported such a tax: Morton, Treasury
Secretary William E. Simon, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, CEA chair Alan Greenspan,
and Federal Energy Administrator John C. Sawhill.27 Morton vocally advocated for a 30-cent
per gallon tax ($1.01 in 2011 dollars) with most of the money refunded back to consumers
as early as late 1973.28 After Ford had publicly ruled out an increase in gasoline taxes, in
October of 1974, Sawhill appeared on a nationally televised show outlining a proposal to raise
the gasoline tax by ten to 30 cents with the revenue used to lower income taxes.29

   In November of 1974, Secretary Morton went on TV supporting a gasoline tax. The next
day, the President responded by saying “I thought that others in the executive branch got the
word, and I hope this word is conveyed to my good friend, the Secretary of the Interior. We
are not considering an increase in the gasoline tax.”30 It is widely believed that the public
support for a gas tax led to the firing of both Morton and Sawhill.31
   Ford suggested that his major concerns were the regressivity of such a tax and its large
incidence on rural communities.32 But, the President also seems to have viewed the idea of
taxing a product, but then refunding the revenues from that tax back to consumers, as a
logical inconsistency.33
   According to the Associated Press at the time, the White House was instead considering:
mileage standards; tax credits for efficient cars; weight and horsepower restrictions; rationing;
and, somewhat ironically, oil tariffs that could turn into taxes on all oil production.
   Besides Ford’s advisors, other policy makers of the time favored gas taxes. The bi-partisan
Joint Economic Committee recommended a 30-cent gasoline tax with the estimated $25 billion
refunded to consumers. To put this in perspective the federal gasoline tax at the time was a
mere four cents. Newspaper articles at the time appeared to actively debate the merits. For
example, Figures A.13 and A.14 is a debate, prompted by the Joint Economic Committee
recommendation, released on February 1, 1975.34 The arguments in favor of the tax note the
smaller transaction costs compared to rationing and equate it to coupon rationing program
with sale-able coupons (although changing who captures the rents). The arguments against
focus on regressivity of such a tax and its inflationary effect.
   By the end of 1974, President Ford may have left the door slightly open for increases in
gasoline taxes.35 The New York Times reported that President Ford had his main advisors
meet him in Colorado on December 26 to discuss energy policy. The article reports that the
President would entertain proposals for a higher gasoline tax. Why the shift? The need for

revenue. Congress called for a reduction in income tax rates to ease the recession and Ford
viewed a gasoline tax as a way to offset these revenue reductions.36 This shift is consistent
with Ford not understanding the merits of taxing a product to change marginal incentives
while returning the revenues from the tax to consumers.
       The door wasn’t open for long, as it slammed shut the next day when Ford said of a
gasoline tax: “That’s about as dead as any option I know...I think there are many better
choices.”37 Ford reiterated this view in his January 1975 State of the Union Address that
highlighted his energy plan, stating: “I want you to know that before deciding on my energy
conservation program, I considered rationing and higher gasoline taxes as alternatives. In my
judgment, neither would achieve the desired results and both would produce unacceptable
inequities.” In its place, Ford called for mileage standards.
       Somewhat counter to such strong opposition to gasoline taxes, in his State of the Union
Address, Ford also said that he would use his Presidential powers (specifically Section 232 of
the Trade Expansion Act of 1962) to impose a $1 per barrel tariff on imported oil beginning
on February 1, 1975 ($3.33 in 2011 dollars). The tariff would increase to $2 on March 1st and
$3 on April 1st. Ford also called for domestic crude prices to be decontrolled. He promised to
rescind the tariffs when “broader but necessary legislation is enacted.” He went on to say: “To
that end, I am requesting the Congress to act within 90 days on a more comprehensive energy
tax program. It includes: excise taxes and import fees totaling $2 per barrel on product
imports and on all crude oil; deregulation of new natural gas and enactment of a natural gas
excise tax.” Ford’s attempts to decontrol oil prices were killed by the House in July of 1975.38
       How receptive was Congress to a gasoline tax increase or oil taxes? Support for, and
opposition against, cut across political party; although Democrats, on average, appear to
have been more favorable. The Senate Democratic Leader, Mike Mansfield, stated he was
open to higher gasoline taxes:

         He would take another look at proposals to raise the Federal gasoline tax ‘by 10, 20, 25
         cents a gallon’ if such an increase were proposed by President Ford as part of a balanced
         package of energy conservation measures.

A number of other key Democrat senators supported gasoline taxes. For example, Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, proposed a gasoline tax, to be rebated back to consumers, that would
begin at five cents in 1976 and increase to 30 cents per gallon in four years.39 The House
Democrat’s Energy Plan for 1975 included an increase in the gas tax of 23 cents per gallon.40
       Other Democrats opposed gasoline taxes. One of the biggest opponents was the Demo-
cratic Chairman of the Ways and Means Wilbur D. Mills from Arkansas. In a August 1974
speech to the Southern Farmers Association, Mills stated that if the Ford Administration put
forth a ten-cent gas tax, “he (Ford) would know that as long as I am chairman of the Ways
and Means Committee it would not be enacted.”41 Senators Water Mondale, D-Minnesota
and Edmund Muskie, D-Maine were also publicly opposed. Opposition to tax increases ap-
peared to have been based, at least publicly, on the regressive nature of the tax. For example
Representative Peter Peyser, R-NY, and John Brademas, D-Indiana, circulated a letter ask-
ing their colleagues to oppose a tax on the grounds that it would “push the already strained
working man and working woman past the financial breaking point.”42

4.2.1      Key stakeholders response to gasoline taxes

While President Ford seemed to be against gasoline taxes, another Ford supported an increase
in gasoline taxes. Henry Ford II recommended a ten-cent gasoline tax in November of 1974.
His support for such a tax was driven by his desire to use the revenues to help the US auto
industry. General Motors and Chrysler initially opposed the idea, but less than a month
later, the newly appointed Chairman of General Motors, Thomas A. Murphy, stated: “If in
the judgment of the Administration it looks like a gasoline tax is necessary, I think we ought
to consider it.”43
       Roughly a month of reflection by the automobile industry led to even more support for in-
creased taxes, albeit for petroleum taxes rather than gasoline taxes. The automobile industry
understood that higher gasoline prices may carry some benefits because shortages adversely
affected sales. A petroleum tax would also broaden the scope of the price increases. The

light-duty industry only consumed 28 percent of US oil at this time, and much of the oil went
to heating and electricity generation.
       A December 23, 1974 New York Times article reports:

         The automobile industry is moving toward favoring some form of tax on petroleum in
         the hope of guaranteeing an unregulated and adequate supply of gasoline for its products
         in the future. The industry also believes that a tax on petroleum, although it would
         increase gasoline prices and therefore tend to cut car sales and accelerate the trend
         toward smaller cars, would be less painful than some of the energy conservation measures
         being considered by Congress and the Ford Administration.

While conventional wisdom, today, seems to be that CAFE standards were favored by US
automobile manufacturers at the time, it isn’t clear. The same article goes on to say:

         Elliott M. Estes, the president of the General Motors Corporation, for example, said in
         a recent interview that he would favor a tax on imported petroleum, which would lead
         to higher gasoline prices, rather than further Government regulations to improve fuel
         economy on cars.

         He was referring to legislation now before Congress that would put high taxes on heavy
         cars or require car makers to improve fuel economy by 50 per cent by 1980.

Henry Ford II also adjusted his position by stating that “another way to accomplish these
goals would be to level a general excise tax on petroleum. This might be more effective and
equitable and it would certainly generate more revenue.” The same article says that Chrysler
and AMC were expected to also support an excise tax, as well as eliminating price controls
on “old oil.”
       Another key group of stakeholders were farmers. While there is some indication that
farmers opposed an increase in the gasoline tax (e.g., Mills’ speech discussed above), their
opposition does not seem to be particularly vocal. Newspaper searches in Google’s New
Archive for “gas tax and farmer/farming/farm” are few. In addition, it is difficult to separate
out the farmer effect from the low income effect.
       The oil industry does not appear to have been very vocal regarding gasoline or oil taxes,
at least publicly. The oil industry was often vilified by the public and many policy makers
expressed concerns about windfall profits for domestic oil producers resulting from changes
in the world price for oil.44 Therefore, they may have consciously tried to stay out of public
  44
    Smith (1982) finds that the price control system led to large transfers from oil producers to refiners (often
the same company), but not to consumers.

                                                       23
forums. There is also evidence that the threat of further regulation put pressure on oil
companies, notably large oil companies, to keep prices for refined products down. (See, Erfle,
Pound and Kalt (1981) and Erfle and McMillan (1990).)
       Consumers seemed to have been the biggest opponents of gasoline taxes. Polling at the
time suggested that the public supported gas taxes only under certain, and unrealistic, cir-
cumstances.
       A Harris Survey asked 1,525 households a series of questions varying the size of the tax,
its impact on oil imports and the use of the revenue. Table 4 summarizes the results. The
poll asked consumers if they would support a ten- or 20-cent tax increase without any other
conditions. Consumers overwhelmingly opposed such a tax. Support increased if either con-
sumers received an income tax credit for the gasoline taxes or the ten-cent tax meant the US
would no longer import oil from the Middle East.45 Only if consumers were able to write-off
tax payments and a ten-cent tax would lead the US to be independent of Middle East oil did
a slight majority of those polled support a tax.

       Consumers appeared to have preferred other, less efficient, ways to reduce consumption.
When asked whether they would prefer a tax on gasoline or a tax on large inefficient cars
in order to limit gasoline consumption, 70 percent of those survey by ORC Public Opinion
Index in December of 1974 preferred a tax on large cars; only 13 percent favored a tax on
gasoline.46
       Consumers also preferred rationing over increases in fuel prices. When asked whether

they would prefer the country to conserve oil through mandatory gasoline rationing on an
odd-even basis or an 11-cent increase in gasoline prices as a result of an import tariff on oil, 60
percent of consumers preferred rationing, 25 percent preferred the tariff, with 15 percent were
undecided. This is a common theme. A similar survey in January of 1975 asked consumers if
they prefer Ford’s oil tariff (projected to increase gasoline prices by 11 cents) to a nationwide
rationing program with the understanding that consumers would not get all of the gasoline
they needed. 61 percent of those surveyed preferred rationing.47 A January 1974 New York
Times article said the Federal Energy Office was receiving over 2,000 letters and telegrams a
day on how to solve the energy crisis. About 90 percent of the letters preferred rationing.48
       Labor unions were also against gasoline taxes. On November 24, 1973, in response to
George P. Shultz, Nixon’s Secretary of Treasury, arguing in favor a gasoline tax, the AFL-
CIO asked Congress to block the Nixon administration from increasing gasoline taxes.49

4.3       Carter Administration

President Carter pushed for gasoline taxes and oil tariffs throughout his presidency. In his
1977 Energy Plan, Carter called for an increase in the federal gasoline tax and the decontrol
of oil and gasoline prices. Oil prices were still hovering at around $50 in real terms; they had
been roughly constant from 1974 to 1977. But, price controls on oil and concerns about the
level of imports continued efforts to incentivize conservation.
       Carter’s gasoline tax plan was based on whether the nation’s oil consumption exceeded
some baseline. Under the plan, if gasoline consumption exceeded the target in 1978, a five-cent
tax would be imposed. For every percentage point future consumption exceeded the target,
an additional five cents would be added to the tax. The entire tax was capped at 50 cents.50
The revenues from the tax would be given back to consumers in the way of tax credits on a
  47
     The exact question was: “There has been quite a lot of controversy regarding some of the President’s
(Ford’s) recommendations on the economy and the energy situation. Which plan do you personally favor for
cutting down on gasoline usage: President Ford’s plan to impose taxes that would result in higher gasoline
prices, or a nationwide rationing program, even if it meant you couldn’t get all of the gasoline you needed?”

per capita basis.51
   Carter’s proposal also called for replacing price controls on crude oil with a tax equal
to the difference between the price control and the world price. Again, one of, if not the,
main motivation behind price controls for domestic oil was concerns that allowing domestic
supplies to get the market price would result in windfall profits for oil companies. A tax
equal to the price differences also accomplished this, but because gasoline prices were based
on average acquisition costs, Carter’s plan would increase gasoline prices (and shift rents
away from refiners). According to the plan, all domestic prices would increase to the “new”
oil price of $11.28 a barrel (in nominal dollars), in 1979, and old oil would be taxed the
difference between the current price control ($2.25 per barrel) and $11.28. Domestic oil prices
for existing resources would continue to be subject to price controls of $2.25 and $11.28 per
barrel for oil and new oil. Newly discovered oil would be allowed to move to the market price
over a three-year period. New oil was defined as a well farther than 2.5 miles away from an
existing well or 1000 feet deeper than an existing well if it is within the 2.5 mile radius.
   Despite being Democratic-controlled, Congress blocked his attempts.52 The main opposi-
tion came from rural states and from labor groups. Shortly after his proposal the president
of the Building and Construction Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor
and Congress of Industrial Organization (AFL-CIO) said: “We must not hit hardest those
with the lowest incomes. High gasoline taxes would be a regressive tax on the poor, and
there’s little evidence that high gasoline prices would promote conservation.”53 The president
of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Frank E. Fitzsimmons, said that it would be
“awfully hard on the people who must commute some 20 and 30 miles to work.”54
   There was some initial optimism in Congress that such a tax could be passed. Representa-
tive Al Ullman, D-Oregon, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee said that: “There’s
always been strong opposition and always will be. That’s just automatic.” But, he went on

     From 1977 to 1979 the make up of the Senate was 61 Democrats, with 38 Republicans and one independent.

58 democrats in the Senate (41 republicans and one independent) and 277 Democrats in the House with 158
Republicans.

to say, “A gas tax, put together a certain way, with adequate rebates, would be passable.”55
Others were more skeptical. Senator William D. Hathaway, D-Maine, said, “The rural states
would have a particular problem adjusting to a gas tax increase...Past history would indicate
it would not have much of a chance of passage in Congress.”56 By now, many were convinced
that the US car culture rendered higher gas taxes a non-starter. Senator Henry M. Jack-
son, D-Washington, and chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, called
Carter’s gas tax, “just not do-able” going on to say: “Right or wrong, we have an automobile
culture. The truth is, people are going to continue to buy gasoline because they have to get
to work.” In 1977 there were 0.67 vehicles per capita compared to over 0.80 today.57
   Senator Jackson’s views seemed to represent those of consumers. A CBS/New York Times
survey, taken days after Carter’s Energy Plan was proposed, found that consumers opposed
higher gasoline prices by a 62 to 32 margin and higher oil prices by a 53 to 37 margin. The
survey also found that blue-collar families were less likely to favor gas taxes than white-collar
families. Similar to the current debate about climate change, one source of the lack of support
for taxes was that not everyone was convinced that an energy crisis existed. Small-car-driving
respondents agreed with Carter on the severity of the energy crisis by a 56 to 38 margin, but
only 38 percent of large-car-driving respondents agreed.58
   On June 9, 1977, the Ways and Means Committee voted 27 to ten against Carter’s “stand-
by” tax. It also voted 25 to 11 against a three-cent tax with the revenues financing public
transportation.59 There seemed to have been some optimism for the passage of the three-cent
tax, but members noted that the plan also called for oil taxes that would increase gasoline
prices (these were ultimately not adopted, however).60 There were a few attempts to revive
the gasoline tax over the next few months, but nothing came of them. Ultimately, there was
a tax placed on industrial oil use in cases where coal was an option, but no taxes that would
affect gasoline prices.

Oil prices began the year below $50 a barrel (in 2011 dollars), but began to inch up beginning
in May when prices hit $56 a barrel. On November 4, 1979, a group of Iranian student
revolutionaries took over the US Embassy in Tehran, holding more than 60 Americans hostage.
Carter responded by imposing an oil embargo against Iran. Further unrest in Iran shut down
oil exports. By the end of the year, prices were roughly $93 a barrel. By February of 1980,
the price was about $100 a barrel. Calls for higher gas taxes began to show up in op-ed. A
New York Times op-ed called for a revenue-neutral $1 per-gallon tax, but admitted that “The
American people, most politicians reckon, are less willing to accept a tax on auto power than
a tax on mother’s milk.”61 A month later Robert Stobaugh and Daniel Yergin called for a tax
of between 25 and 50 cents.62 In December, another op-ed in the New York Times called for
a 50-cent tax saying, “America can deploy an oil weapon of its own—a stiff tax that would
hold down the demand for gasoline, and whose revenues would be rebated to the public.”63
       The fate of a significant gasoline tax appeared to be sealed by 1980, however. Carter
officials commented in January of 1980 that Carter had rejected proposals within the White
House to increase the gasoline tax by 50 cents. The surprising defeat of Canadian Prime
Minister Joe Clark in the House of Commons after his party had tried to increase gasoline
taxes was yet another warning of the political ramifications of pushing for gasoline taxes.64
       In March of 1980, Carter used his Presidential powers, as Ford did before him, to impose
a $4.62 per barrel tariff on imported oil to begin on May 15 ($10.95 in 2011 dollars). The
tariff was projected to increase gasoline prices by ten cents (24 cents in 2011 dollars). Once
again Congress resisted. Both the House and Senate passed legislation to block the tariff.
Carter vetoed these attempt. What may have been the final nail in a gasoline-tax’ coffin, the
House overrode Carter’s veto by a vote of 335 to 34.65 The Senate voted the veto down by
68 to 10.66 This was the first time since 1952 that a President’s veto was overridden despite
his party controlling both houses.

       Once again the regressivity of the tax was cited. Senator Dale Bumpers, D-Arkansas, was
quoted as saying, “It’s an elitist policy that says, ‘the rich will ride and the poor will walk.’ ”
Others seemed to suggest that they may have supported the tariff if the revenues were used to
lower other taxes. Senator Sam Nunn, D-Georgia, who initially voted against the legislation
blocking it, but then voted to override the veto, cited no assurances from the White House
that they would lower other taxes as the reason for his change of heart.67
       Polling evidence from the time suggests that Congress was voting with the will of the
people; consumers continued to favor rationing over both gasoline taxes or allowing prices
to clear the market. A 1977 Cambridge Reports/Research International survey of 1,500
people found that 65 percent of people preferred rationing over allowing prices to adjust to $2
(nominal prices were roughly 60 cents) as a way of reducing a 25 percent shortage in gasoline;
only 15 percent preferred the market outcome.68 This was a steep increase from current prices
of roughly 60 cents; but, the $2 focal point does not appear to have driven these results. In
April of 1978, the Gallup Organization conducted a poll asking: “If the consumption of oil
and gas is reduced in the United States, which of these two ways would you prefer as a way
to achieve this: start a rationing program that would require drivers to reduce the miles they
drive by about one-fourth, or raise the tax on gasoline so that a gallon will cost 25 cents more
than it currently does?” 55 percent of those polled favored rationing, while only 25 percent
favored allowing prices to increase by 25 cents.69
       Just prior to the long gasoline lines that occurred in the summer of 1979, the LA Times
conducted a survey asking whether higher prices or rationing are the answer to oil and gasoline
shortages.70 42 percent of those polled preferred rationing, with 18 percent preferring “some

     The exact question was: “Some energy experts say that our nation has to cut its gasoline usage by 25%.
To do this we could either have rationing–in which case you would get three quarters of gasoline you now use–
or we could raise gasoline cost $2 per gallon, consumption would go down 25%. Which would you prefer if you
had to choose one or the other–rationing where you would get three-quarters of what you use now or gasoline
at a price of $2 per gallon?” Cambridge Reports/National Omnibus Survey, Oct, 1977. Retrieved Dec-20-

     The exact question was: “President Carter has announced that he will soon begin to remove price
controls from crude oil produced in the United States in order to stimulate oil exploration and to force
people to use less oil and gas. Do you think higher prices are the answer to oil and gas shortages,


                                                     29
other solution.” Only 28 percent preferred higher prices. Soon after the long lines, consumer
did not appear to have changed their opinion. An ABC News-Harris Poll of 1,192 people
taken in January of 1980 found that 80 percent of consumers were against a 50-cent gasoline
tax. In contrast, 70 percent of respondents favored odd-even gas rationing and 65 percent felt
Congress should pass tougher gasoline rationing legislation. A New York Times poll taken
around the same time suggests that there may not have been a strong urban-rural split on
this issue. Of the 502 New York City residents polled during December of 1979, 90 percent
opposed raising gasoline taxes as a way of reducing gasoline demand. Rationing was favored
by over 60 percent.71
    The comparison of similarly worded questions over time provide a way to measure by
how much consumers’ attitudes changed. Cambridge Reports/National Omnibus Survey con-
ducted a similar poll, in 1980, to their 1977 poll asking whether consumers would prefer
rationing to gasoline prices of $2. Two things changed between the polls. First, prices in-
creased to roughly $1.20. Second, the negatives of shortage were fresh in consumers’ minds.
Despite this, 49 percent of consumers continued to support rationing, compared to only 25
percent that support higher prices.72 This was a drop, however, from the 65 percent that
favored rationing in 1977.


5     Conclusions
The oil crises of the 1970s led to a number of policies. Some of these—price controls and
rationing programs—no longer exist. Other, such as CAFE standards, gas guzzler taxes, and
alternative fuel mandates, continue today. The economics literature is not short of papers
suggesting these policies may do more harm than good and are much less efficient than
Pigouvian taxes. In this paper, I reviewed the public discussions that took place on how to

      The exact wording was: “Some energy experts say that our nation has to cut its gasoline usage by 25%.
To do this, we could either have rationing–in which case you would get three-quarters of the gasoline you now
use–or we could raise gasoline prices enough to discourage consumption. Experts think if gasoline prices rose
to $2 per gallon, consumption would go down 25%. Which would you prefer if you had to choose one or the
other–rationing, where you would get three-quarters of what you use now, or gasoline at a price of $2 per
gallon?”

address high oil prices. Gasoline taxes were frequently discussed, even moreso than today.
Figure 12 shows that the number of New York Times articles containing the phrases “gasoline
tax” was much lower during the 2008 run up in gasoline prices, compared to those increases
of the 1970s.
   While gasoline taxes, and allowing prices to be decontrolled, appear to have been on the
table and actively discussed as an alternative to price controls, CAFE standards, and gas
guzzler taxes, public support for the efficient policy was lacking.
   A frequent argument for why CAFE standards and alternative fuel mandates exist is
that these policies hide their true cost. This argument is difficult to reconcile with the
public’s support for similarly inefficient policies such as price-controls-plus-rationing and gas
guzzler taxes. The costs associated with price-controls-plus-rationing and gas guzzler taxes
are certainly salient. Consumers at the time had experienced rationing and long gasoline lines
so would have understood the costs of these policies. Consumers also understood that prices
for fuel inefficient vehicles would increase under gas guzzler taxes. What can explain the
support? I don’t purport to answer this question. Perhaps, economists have overstated the
value of people’s time, or understate the psychic costs associated with the regressivity of high
energy prices. Admittedly, this runs counter to the results in Deacon and Sonstelie (1985)
that find when faced with a choice of a zero queue bundled with a high price for gasoline and
waiting for a low price, consumers seem to reveal a value of time that is inline with their wage
rates.
