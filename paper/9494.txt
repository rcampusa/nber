The present paper analyzes the budgetary impact of various Social Security reforms in the
Belgian institutional setting. Our approach relies on parameters that were derived in Dellis et
alii (2002) using a micro-modeling strategy. Focusing our attention on a hypothetical age
cohort, we illustrate the budgetary impact that the reforms considered might have on the
budget of the federal government.




    1. Introduction
The various Belgian social security schemes face an uncertain future. The general trend
towards demographic aging all across the developed world and large parts of the developing
world has not left Belgium unaffected. Demographic aging is the result of a combination of
two trends. First, there has been a substantial decrease in fertility rates of women over the last
few decades. Second, we have observed a strong increase in life expectancy across most
categories in the population. Unfortunately, these trends have a strongly negative financial
impact on a variety of social insurance and social protection programs, ranging from child
support payments, over the health care sector to the questions of retirement income and long-
term care arrangements. While the problem can be approached in a myriad of ways, we
approach the problem from the perspective of the social security system, thus largely leaving
aside the question of health and long-term care costs. While it is true that this focus inhibits a
truly global view of the financial consequences of aging for government budgets, it is also
true that introducing it would cause tremendous problems in terms of modeling the evolution
of health-care costs, as well as in ter ms of a loss of international comparability.

For the social security systems to survive this demographic process, higher contribution levels
and/or lower benefits will have to be introduced given the outright pay-as-you-go (PAYG)
nature of these systems. Indeed, a straight increase in the public debt financing of the
demographic transition is not truly an option in Belgium, as it would be totally incompatible
with the Maastricht criterion of the European Economic Monetary Union (EMU) relating to
the level of GDP.1 But even beyond this purely institutional limit, a further increase in public
debt levels is also financially unsustainable, as it would at short notice cause a snowball effect
such as the one observed in Belgium in the 1980's.

Leaving aside these purely demographic considerations, other factors are challenging the way
the Belgian social security institutions and systems are organized. First, there is the potential
for increase labor mobility. At present, mobility between jobs in the public sector, the private
sector and in self-employment is rather limited, at least partly because of the way the three
systems work. The needs of the labor market of the future with its increased degree of
flexibility may thus induce large changes in the way the three corresponding social security
systems work. International job mobility is also becoming more and more important,
particularly for a small open economy in the heart of Europe like Belgium. Jousten and
Pestieau (2000) argue that both levels of intra- and intergenerational redistribution will be
heavily affected by increased international labor mobility, even if the phenomenon is limited
to some subgroups of the population.

The second and biggest non-demographic challenge is the widespread use of a variety of early
retirement programs. In fact, Belgium excels in the use of these programs as the world-
leading low average retirement age of approximately 57 for men clearly illustrates.2
Originally these systems were motivated by several objectives. Faced with an environment of
industrial restructuring early retirement seemed to be the royal route out of the problem for all
partners involved. First it allowed companies to lay off old workers and if needed hire
cheaper young workers, while the government supported a large chunk of the costs. 3 Older
workers were also encouraged by the trade unions to leave to free up space for younger ones.
To the present day, many older workers believe that they take a decision beneficial to their
younger counterparts. Third, the successive governments since the 1970's were also political
gainers, though financial losers, in this consensus towards early retirement because it allowed
the government to show a better performance in terms of unemployment (particularly youth
unemployment) and guaranteed a social peace. Lately however, these early retirement
schemes have undergone some scrutiny. Not surprisingly, the beneficial labor market effects
have been rather modest, if not completely absent.4 Recent discussions and decisions at the
government level clearly move into the direction of lifting the effective early retirement age,
and hence also the sector-specific mandatory retirement ages. Financial costs of early
retirement programs to the federal government have been huge, both on the income
(contributions, taxes) as on the expenditure side (early retirement benefits).

The goal of the paper is to simulate the impact of reforms of retirement income systems. The
impact we are interested in resides on two levels. First, we consider the financial and
behavioral impact on individuals and families. Second, we consider the financial impact on
federal government budget. We do not restrict our attention to the budgetary impact on the
social security systems, but rather on all of the federal government's finances. Such reforms
will have both an automatic effect on fiscal contributions by changing contributions and

  The average age of retirement of 57,6 for men was estimated by Blöndal and Scarpetta (1998) on the
basis of Labor Force Surveys. In this study we estimated an average retirement age of 58.4 for men and
57.4 for women.

benefits for a given work history (the "mechanical" effect) and an additional effect through
labor supply responses to the reform (the "behavioral" effect). We will estimate the fiscal
implications of both the mechanical and the behavioral effect, using our retirement probit
models derived in Dellis et alii (2002) to predict labor supply responses. The result will be an
estimate of the steady-state impact of the reforms on the financial balance sheet of retirement
income systems.

The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the essential features of the
various public retirement and early retirement systems in Belgium. In section 3 we explain the
different components of our administrative dataset, as well as the key results of Dellis et alii
(2002) that we heavily rely upon. The following section describes the simulation
methodology used. The approach can be qualified as being of a "steady-state" type. Our
methodology implicitly assumes that there is a time-invariant social-security program and
time-invariant behavior, though this has obviously not been the case for the systems and the
people analyzed in our sample, where both behaviors and system characteristics have evolved
over time. Section 5 describes the simulation results obtained. Again, it is important to stress
that these results have to be interpreted with due diligence because of the limitations inherent
in our simulation approach. Though the results might be rather accurate for the cohort of 50
year-old workers, this might not be the case for the more general population at other ages or
for other cohorts. Section 6 is devoted to the conclusions.


       2. Social security schemes5
The Belgian retirement income system relies on three very unequal pillars. First of all, there
are the dominant public social security programs that represent the largest part of pension
income for a wide majority in the population. A second pillar consists of company pension
schemes, which only plays a minor role as a source of income for the average Belgian worker.
Essentially, they are currently confined to the higher-income individuals in the private sector
and to the self-employed, a finding which is at least in part due to their tax-treatment. A third
type of retirement income comes from individual retirement savings. These take multiple
forms: First, there are tax-favored individual pension savings accounts with a maximum
annual contribution of EUR 580 per person6 or under the form of more traditional savings
vehicles such as the tax-favored savings accounts, investments in trust funds, life insurance,
etc.

The first pillar, public retirement programs, essentially consists of four components. There are
three large sectoral social security programs, one for the public sector, one for the private
sector wage earners and one for the self -employed. Some special categories of workers, such
as coalmine workers and military personnel have special retirement systems that we will not
explicitly model in the present paper. A fourth large category of public retirement income
consists of the guaranteed minimum pension system, that operates on a means -tested basis.


Wage -earner’s scheme
The wage earner’s scheme is by far the largest one according to the number of people
affiliated with the program. The program allows for retirement starting at age 60, with a
normal retirement age fixed at 65. The choice of the retirement age does not induce any
actuarial adjustment under current rules.

However, in the case of most workers, the choice of the retirement age is not completely
neutral with respect to the benefit amount because a full earnings history consists of 45 years

of work for men, a condition that many people do not satisfy at the age of 60. For those
having more than 45 working years, a dropout year provision operates replacing low -income
years by higher ones. The situation has so far been slightly different for women who only
needed 40 years to complete a career. A transition (between 1997 and 2009) is under way to
progressively increase the complete career condition to 45 years of work. Hence, for most
women included in our dataset, a full career still consists of 40 years of work. Additional
years can be added to ones career by working, but also by spending additional time on other
social insurance programs such as unemployment insurance, disability insurance, workers
compensation or early retirement programs.

Benefits are computed based on the earnings during periods of affiliation. The benefit
formula, which is subject to floors and ceilings, can be represented as follows:

Benefit =n/N * average wage * k

where n represents the number of years of affiliation with the wage-earner’s scheme, N the
number of years required for a full career (in our case either 40 or 45) and k is a replacement
rate, which takes on the value of 0.6 and 0.75 depending on whether the social security
recipient claims benefits as a single or as a household. The variable “average wage”
corresponds to indexed average wages over the period of affiliation, with indexation on the
price index combined with additional discretionary adjustments for the evolution of growth. A
peculiar feature of the Belgian wage-earners scheme is that periods of the life spent on
replacement income (unemployment benefits, disability benefits, workers compensation…)
fully count as years worked in the computation of the average wage, and hence of the social
security benefit. For any such periods, fictive wages are inserted into the average wage
computation. In line with the general philosophy of the Belgian social insurance system that
any such spell on a replacement income system is purely involuntary, imputed wages are set
equal in real terms to those that the workers earned before entering these replacement income
programs.

Wage-earners pensions are shielded against inflation through an automatic consumer price
index (CPI) adjustment and are subject to an earnings test. Currently, the earnings limit is
approximately EUR 7,450 per year. For earnings above this limit, pension entitlement is
suspended. Benefits are also paid to surviving spouses, or more generally surviving
dependents of deceased wage earners.

The wage-earners system is essentially based on the PAYG principle, and financed through
payroll taxes that are levied both on the side of the employers and of the employees, with a
combined tax rate of 16.36 percent (no earnings limit). The system also receives a subsidy
from the Belgian federal government that is approximately equal to 11 percent of overall
benefits.

Next to the official wage-earner scheme, several forms of early retirement programs have
developed: mandatory collective retirement and individual early retirement. During the
1980’s and the 1990’s, an arsenal of mandatory early retirement schemes was put in place. All
of these arrangements were and are based on collective agreements, which are negotiated with
the active involvement of employees and employers, sometimes at the sector level, sometimes
at the level of an individual company or production site. For some companies in a difficult
economic position, mandatory retirement ages as low as 50 were introduced. Individual early
retirement differentiates itself from its collective counterpart by the fact that it is based on an
individual’s decision to retire from work. During the years analyzed in our sample, the most
prevalent way is to pass through the unemployment system in which unemployed aged fifty
or more are considered 'aged unemployed' and no longer subject to show up at the
unemployment office on a regular basis. Further, there is no control on availability to work,
nor are there benefit cuts due to long-term unemployment.78 Therefore, people unwilling to
continue to work can ask their employer to lay them off. Similarly, employers can use the
system to shed older more expensive workers. The latter is often willing to do so because of a
lack of experience rating in the unemployment insurance system. In the early years of the new
millennium, a new technique has even reinforced the use of the unemployment insurance
system as a retirement route. The technique, called "canadry dry" pensions, consists in a
lump-sum transfer from the employer at the time the company lays off its worker. This lump-
sum is formally not a retirement pension but clearly looks like one...

Public sector employees
Public sector pensions are paid out of the general federal budget and are officially considered
as deferred income rather than old-age insurance. The only official insurance element is a
coverage for survivor benefits, which is financed through a 7.5 percent payroll tax. No
spousal benefits are available. Civil servants face compulsory retirement at the latest at age 65
for both men and women. However, as for the private sector, there is a multitude of ways of
retiring earlier than this normal age of 65. 9 There is disability protection, which is a much
more plausible route to retirement than in the private sector system as the screening is
considered to be much less severe. Most importantly however, it is possible to opt for an
incomplete career and retire at 60. For some particular categories of workers, the normal
retirement age is lower than 65, and early retirement provisions are sometimes extremely
generous (military servicemen, teachers...). Public sector pensions are based on the income
earned by an individual during the last 5 years before retirement. Benefits are computed
according to a rather complicated formula but can never exceed 75 percent of the average
wages over the last five years. The benefit formula can be represented as follows:

Benefit = average wage over last five years * min [fract ; 0.75]

Where fract is a fraction with a numerator consisting of the number of years the person
worked in the public service, and the denominator being a benefit accrual factor. This latter
benefit accrual factor, also called “tantième”, depends on the rank the person occupied in the
hierarchy. This denominator ranges from 30 to 60, taking the value of 30 for the highest-
ranking civil servants (high court judges, university professors...) and 60 for the lowest ranks.
As in the private sector wage earner's scheme, the system is earnings-tested. The system also
applies floors and ceilings which are however much more generous than for private sector
retirement benefits. Most notably, higher income individuals get a much better deal in the
public sector than in the private sector. This finding is even reinforced once we consider
indexation rules, as public sector pensions are indexed on average wages (“péréquation”).
Public servants therefore enjoy the benefits of productivity increases in the economy even
beyond the moment when they actively contribute to them as workers.


Self-employed
The self-employed retirement scheme is the latest one to have been introduced, as it only
exists since 1956. It is also the least generous of the three big social security systems with
retirement benefits close to the level of the guaranteed minimum income (see below). It does
Self-employed are not entitled to unemployment benefits, nor to early retirement benefits.

7
  The system of the "aged unemployed" was reformed in July 2002. The rules were tightened for new
entrants to the unemployment system, with grandfathering rules applicable to those already in the
system. The minimum age for a full waiver of obligations under the unemployment insurance system
was raised to 56. A new system of "mini-waiver" was introduced on the periodic visits to the
unemployment insurance as of age 50, but the person still needs to ready to accept a job.
8
   Disability is not a major route towards early retirement due to rather stringent qualifying conditions
and rather advanced screening.
9
  Currently, less than 15 per cent of civil servants retire at the age of 65.
Disability benefits exist, but both qualifying conditions and financial characteristics of the
system make it a most unlikely exit route to retirement. For a very long time, old -age
pensions have been independent of earnings levels. However, since 1984, the system is
progressively being transformed to allow for a stronger link between contributions and
benefits. Additional earnings past 1984 enter the pension computation formula at their correct
value, instead of some fictive amount. Full benefits are available at age 65 for men with a
complete earnings history of 45 years. However, anticipated retirement is possible as early as
age 60 with an actuarial reduction of 5 percent per year of anticipation. As for the wage
earners scheme, women are in a transitory phase, with the complete career requirement
shifting from 40 years of work to 45, and normal retirement age from 60 to 65.

The social security system of the self-employed is financed through two broad categories of
income. First, there are direct social insurance contributions levied under the form of a tax of
16.7 percent on the first EUR 46,035 of income, and 12.27 percent on the income in the
bracket between EUR 46,035 and EUR 67,352. Income above the latter threshold is not
subject to social insurance taxation. More than 75 percent of the contributions raised using
this social insurance taxation are used for the pension system of the self-employed, the
remainder serves to cover health-care and other social insurance benefits for the self-
employed. Second, the federal government pays a large subsidy to the system that
corresponds to approximately 37 percent of benefits.


Guaranteed minimum income
The guaranteed minimum income pensions are fully paid for by general government revenue,
and are means -tested. This type of pension is only available after the legal retirement age.


        3. The model
We opt for an approach of micro-simulation relying on the data and estimates already used in
Dellis et alii (2002). The underlying data stem from five different sources, most of which are
of administrative origin. The different data were merged using the national ID number that is
the Belgian equivalent to the US Social Security number.

The first component of the data is the SFR (Fiscal Revenue Statistics) file, which are
collected by the Finance Ministry, and then processed by the INS (National Statistics Office).
We use the SFR files for the years 1989 to 1996 to extract all the information relevant for the
computation of individual’s tax liabilities. Variables available include wage income and
income from other professional activities, household size and type, number of dependents in
the household, age and income of spous e, social insurance transfers and private pension
receipt, house ownership status (owner, renter), taxable real estate income, contributions to
second and third pillar pensions… The second component is the CIP (Individual Pension
Account) that includes all career information relevant for the wage earner pension
computation: gross wages, days of work, days on social insurance programs, etc. The third
and fourth components are the equivalent datasets for the self-employed and the civil
servants, both of which files are less detailed than the one for the wage earners. Finally,
information from the Census (1991) is merged in to determine education levels so as to be
able to use survival tables that are education-level specific.

Dellis et alii (2002) used a multi-step sample selection procedure to obtain a sample of
households where at least one member of the household is in the 50-64 age bracket and has
not yet retired. A total of 21,818 households were used to analyze retirement decisions of men
and women separately. Using the data, the authors estimated the parameters of retirement
probit models. Among the explanatory variables in the estimation the authors paid a particular
attention to financial incentive measures. To measure the impact of the social security
systems incentives we use several different indicators. A first one is the concept of household
social security wealth (SSW), which is the present discounted value of all future benefit flows
from a given social security system. Discounting is done allowing both for time preference
and mortality adjustments. Further, SSW also has to allow for the possibility of people being
subject to different retirement income systems. The authors apply the official rules that exist
for cumulating benefits from the three main public systems. Hence, the total SSW is the
weighted sum of the different pathways to retirement available to the individual or the couple.
The weights on the early retirement and the unemployment/disability routes correspond to the
sum of observed frequencies of these routes among all people of any given age up to age 65,
the public retirement system takes the residual weight. For wage earners, we add the
unemployment insurance and disability insurance paths as the two systems produce very
similar benefit structures. Doing so, we give an upper bound on incentives for people to retire
as we render all of disability voluntary. Given the lack of information for the public sector,
we consider as early retirees all people retiring before the age of 60.

The next two incentive indicators are forward-looking measures. “Peak value” represents the
difference between SSW at its peak and SSW today. The second forward-looking measure is
the concept of “option value” such as defined by Stock and Wise (1990) that is based on a
utility maximization framework. The utility function Vt underlying the computation of the
option value process can be summarized by the following mathematical expression:

            r −1                 S
Vt ( r) = ∑ β s −t Ysγ + ∑ β s −t (kBs (r ) )
                                            γ

            s =t                s =r
where the first expression on the right hand side represents the utility derived from labor
income Y, and the second expression represents utility derived from retirement income
 B s (r ) ; β is the time preference rate which we assume to be approximately 0.97, which
corresponds to a discount rate of 3 percent, γ corresponds to a parameter of concavity and is
set to γ=0.75. Finally, k=1.5 expresses the relative weight of utility of retirement income as
compared to wage-income. It reflects the fact that the income without effort generates more
utility than income with effort.

The concept of option value G t ( r * ) is then defined as the difference in utility terms between
retiring at the best point in the future (r * ) and now (t).

G t ( r * ) = Vt ( r * ) − Vt ( t )

The key estimates of the authors are summarized in the following tables.

          4. Simulation methodology

For our simulations purposes, we restrict our attention to a sub sample of the previously
discussed dataset. We use a cross-section of individuals instead of the entire age range 50-64.
More specifically, we consider pre-retirement age workers (male and female) aged 50 and
then age them forward. We also include their spouses in the analysis. More specifically, we
select all 50 year-old men and 50 year-old single females of the sample. Married 50 year-old
females are excluded from the sample to avoid double counting, as our sample will account
for the fiscal impact of all married females. This way, the cohort can be defined as a
representative sample of the Belgian 50 year -old workers and their spouses. To ensure a
sufficient sample size, we use a synthetic age 50 cohort made up of individuals aged 50 in
1993, 1994 or 1995. This gives us a total sample size of 4927 individuals, 2515 men, 2020
dependent women and 392 working women.

We first estimate the probability that each worker will exit the labor force via death or
retirement at each future age. Exit probabilities are computed using the estimates of table 1
under the baseline setting with regards to all variables, including the SSW and peak and
option value indicators. Spouses are supposed to retire at the early retirement age of the
corresponding retirement scheme. In a second step, all these probabilities then serve as
weights in the computation of the present discounted value (PDV) of the in - and outflows
from the government budget. The financial flows considered are all flows from age 50 up
until death. 10 This marks a difference with respect to Dellis et alii (2002) as we consider the
full budgetary costs and benefits of the synthetic cohort as it ages. The total m      i pact of
individuals on the government's budget is measured as the difference between the outflows
from the budget as measured by the flow of social security and other social insurance program
benefits (unemployment and early retirement) and the inflows as measured by payroll, income
and consumption taxes. Payroll taxes include health, retirement, unemployment, disability,
professional sickness and workers compensation contributions.

Next to the abovementioned payroll taxes, we include income taxes on labor and pension
income as well as indirect taxes under the form of VAT. We incorporate direct taxes in
accordance with the Belgian Personal Income Tax Code IPP (Personal Income Tax), thus also
including the favorable tax treatment of pension income. However, to render the computation
feasible, we have fully individualized the tax accounts of husbands and wives while the tax
code only allows a partial splitting of incomes of spouses. Further, we decided to ignore some
other tax code provisions. For example, we left aside the possibility to itemize deductions in
favor of the standard flat-rate deduction, and we ignore taxation of private annuity income.
The likely impact of these simplifications is difficult to sign as these omissions are to some
degree offsetting. As for the VAT part, we rely on consumption data by income quartiles from
the Household Budget Survey of the INS. Using the expenditure shares of different products
in the typical household consumption basket by income quartile and weighting the
corresponding VAT rates accordingly, the INS data imply an average VAT rate by income of
10,65 percent for the lowest income quartile, 10,60 for the second, 10,04 for the third and
9,14 for the top income quartile. We apply these average rates for all age groups in a uniform
way.

The concept of PDV is the basis for comparison among different policy reform scenarios. We
do so by re-estimating the exit probabilities, benefits, contributions and taxes under several
reforms proposals for both spouses to obtain new PDV estimates. We even break down the

variables back to the age of 55 using a 3 percent real discount rate.
total effect of a reform on the PDV into its components: the mechanical budgetary effect
(with unchanged retirement probabilities with respect to the pre-reform situation) and the
fiscal implications of the behavioral effect. We use the terminology "fiscal implications of the
behavioral effect" to measure the budgetary impact of the labor supply reactions (which is
properly speaking the change in the behavior of the individual). Indeed, this distinction is
rather important, as it is quite imaginable to have a strong labor supply reaction, while at the
same time having a very limited budgetary impact thereof due to a high degree of actuarial
neutrality.

            5. Simulation results

We consider four different reforms. The first three reforms share the common feature that
they are not intended as policy recommendations, but rather to allow international
comparisons. The fourth simulation is an interesting country-specific reform of the retirement
system, whose only aim is to illustrate the impact of a partial reform within the Belgian
institutional setting. None of the four reforms however pursues an objective of budget
neutrality with respect to the baseline, which corresponds to the current institutional setting
and hence not necessarily to one that is viable in the long-run. Nor does any of these reforms
aim at establishing a balanced and viable budget in the long-run.11 The first two reforms have
already been explored in Dellis et alii (2002) with respect to their impact on the SSW and
accrual variables. However, the present exercise distinguishes itself clearly from the previous
results as it incorporates a complete analysis of all budgetary implications of a retirement
system change.

The first reform is called the "plus three years" reform and consists in a simple increase by
three years of all key parameters in all retirement and early retirement systems in the country.
Thus, the early and the normal entitlement ages are increased by 3 years, as is the length of a
normal career from 45 to 48 years. All other system characteristics remain unchanged.
Implicitly, this approach includes the rather implausible condition that unemployment
benefits are totally absent from the landscape between the ages of 50 and 53.

The second reform, the so-called "common reform", creates a system that is identical across
all countries. The common system has a benefit equal to 60 percent of average real lifetime
earnings at normal retirement age (NRA) that is defined to be at age 65. Past wages are
deflated using real wage indexing. Average lifetime earnings are supposed to correspond to
the highest 40 years of indexed earnings during an individual's working life. In case a worker
has less than 40 years of earnings, zeros are averaged in, while a career longer than 40 years
has an impact on the real average lifetime wage through a dropout year provision. Early
retirement is available as of the age of 60 (ERA), with an actuarial adjustment of 6 percent
per year of anticipation. Benefits thus defined are capped at the 90th percentile of the wage
distribution for men. Benefits are subject to income taxation under the same rules as in the
pre-reform world. Survivor benefits are paid out at a rate of 100 percent of workers benefits,
but are reduced one for one for every euro of own benefits the recipients receives on his/her
own earnings history. No other benefits are available, which thus represents a rather dramatic
change in benefit availability before the age of 60 in a country like Belgium.

The third reform is called the "actuarial adjustment reform". The approach can be located
midway between the previous two reforms and hence its results will be presented in second
place in the Tables and Figures that follow. The reform keeps the structure of the sec toral
social security schemes unchanged with respect to the present, including eligibility ages,
minimum contribution periods, as well as formulae for the computation of the basic benefits.
However, the reform introduces an actuarial adjustment factor to vary the benefit flow as a

11

function of the exit age of the labor force, or expressed differently the entry age into
retirement. The linear adjustment factor is of 6 percent per year of deviation from the normal
retirement age, which is currently 65 under all 3 major Belgian sectoral pension schemes.
Means-tested programs as well as survivor and spousal benefits are kept unchanged in their
generosity with respect to the baseline situation, unless they are directly linked to the worker's
own benefits. The age dependent nature of workers' retirement benefits thus implies a relative
increase in the attractiveness of means-tested programs for younger retirees.

The last reform considered is a "Belgian-specific" reform. We consider a reform where the
government reforms the current wage-earner scheme by no longer crediting years spent on all
kinds of social insurance programs such as unemployment insurance, disability insurance and
early retirement in the individuals pension record. All other system characteristics are
supposed to remain unchanged, thus leaving the early retirement and unemployment paths
into retirement intact. Thus people will be confronted with incomplete careers at the end of
their working life. There is thus a smaller buffering effect against income shocks on a lifetime
basis. Another way of looking at the problem is to notice that the reform introduces a stronger
link between contributions and benefits, and hence reinforces the pure insurance aspect of the
system.

For evaluating the results of the first three simulations, we use simulation methods S1, S2 and
S3 of Dellis et alii (2002). Method S1 relies on the estimates with a linear age trend, which is
unchanged by the reform. It adjusts the eligibility probabilities for unemployment or early
retirement benefit receipt and applies the post-reform incentive and PDV measures. Method
S2 is based on the age dummy model without a shift of the dummies. It is essentially the same
as S1. However, the age dummy effects are far from linear and hence it is possible that these
dummies better pick up the non-linearities in the various retirement and early retirement
systems, or alternatively that tastes for leisure are not a linear function of age. Method S3 is
based on the age dummy models and considers a shift of dummies to perform the simulations
in a specific way for each one of the reforms. For the first reform, all age dummies are shifted
upwards by three years. This also applies to those dummies at ages lower than the earliest
eligibility age so that the entire retirement hazard shifts forward. For the common reform we
proceed in a similar way, but the impact of age dummies is modify in a different way. On the
one hand, given that in this policy simulation alternative retirement pathways are assumed
out, we apply the age 51 dummy to all ages up to the age 59, just prior to the early retirement
age, and this both for men and women. On the other hand, we keep the effect of age 60 and 65
dummies unchanged assuming that the common reform will not affect individual behavior at
these particular ages. Finally, using these two dummy values we imputed the values of the
intermediary dummies, from age 61 to age 64, assuming a smooth path trend. As for the
actuarial adjustment reform and the Belgian reform, methods S2 and S3 are equivalent, as
there is no change in the key early and normal retirement ages from the baseline scenario to
the reform situation.

A first noticeable finding is that the PDV of benefits minus taxes is negative in all cases
considered in Table 3, thus the results tell us that our cohort is a net contributor (benefits
minus taxes and contributions) to the public finances. At first sight, this result looks rather
surprising as it is contrary to intuition and contrary to the finding we can observe when purely
focusing on the social security system. However, several factors help explain it. First, it is
important to note that direct taxation is extremely heavy in Belgium. Second, discounting
plays an important role in the results. While taxes are essentially front-loaded in the Belgian
tax and social insurance system, benefits are rather back-loaded from a life-cycle perspective.
Third, and last it is important to notice that we consider only a single outflow of the
government budget, while we consider a large array of inflows into the budget. For example,

we consider all tax revenues even though only part of them help towards financing goods and
services for the elderly while some public subsidies to the old (more generous reimbursement
of health expenditures, nursing home care, long-term care, public transportation, ...) do not
appear on the outflow sid e.

When measuring the impact of the various reforms on the different components reported in
Table 3 as a proportion of the baseline benefits, we find that the common reform is the most
powerful one in terms of the change in the PDV of benefits, followed by the actuarial
adjustment reform. This finding is not too surprising given the fact that Belgians leave the
workforce rather early in their life-cycle, and hence are fully hit by the actuarial adjustments
(actuarial adjustment and common reforms) and the reduced availability of benefits before the
early retirement age of the social security system (common reform). The same lack of
availability of benefits before the age of 60 is also the main cause of the drop in income tax
receipt under the common reform, with a drop of 5 percent in all but the PV S3 simulation
methodology. Overall, it is fair to say that the impact as measured using the PV and OV
estimates are rather similar.

As for the Belgian reform, it only displays a rather modest effect in terms of its impact on the
value of the PDV of benefits, while its likely cost in terms of redistribution is rather heavy.
Several reasons help explain this result. First, of all, the reform only affects the wage-earners
schemes, which casts the order of magnitude of the change in a different light. Further, the
effect of the changes only affects one particular form of retirement income, and does not
affect payments either through the unemployment or the early retirement systems. Hence, the
changes only affect people retiring early through the change of the benefits they receive
starting at age 65, as the latter remains the age at which people are switched into the
retirement system. Therefore, for a person aged 50, the effect of the changes only apply on
income he starts receiving in 15 years time, and this with a 3 percent real discount factor per
year. For a person aged 65, nothing much changes in terms of benefit receipt, unless
obviously the person had experienced a longer spell on a social insurance program in the past.
Finally, the reform is somewhat buffered against by the availability of means-tested minimum
benefits, which increasingly become interesting substitutes for people with incomplete
earnings histories due to sickness, unemployment, disability, ...

To illustrate the distinction between behavioral and mechanical effects of a reform, let us
focus on the net benefits an individual receives in a world of absolute certainty with respect to
the life span. We denote them as b and they depend on a policy parameter x and on the age of
retirement z, itself a function of x. We thus have

        b(x,z(x))

A reform consists of a change from x to x'. The effect (Diff) of such a reform is:

        Diff = b(x',z(x')) - b(x,z(x))

We can decompose Diff into two parts Diffm and Diffb corresponding to the mechanical and
behavioral effects with

        Diff m= b(x',z(x)) - b(x,z(x))
        Diff b = b(x',z(x')) - b(x',z(x))

and Diff m+ Diff b= Diff

Table 4 displays a strong behavioral effect for all scenarios. This is particularly true when
considering the first reform using simulation technique S3 where the net behavioral effect of
benefits minus contributions as a proportion of base benefits is anyway the most powerful
(more than a quarter of base benefits). Table 4 shows that the behavioral response for both

OV and PV estimations of the latter scenario imply a fiscal impact of the behavioral response
that represents more than 50 percent of the total effect, essentially because of the outright
shift by 3 years of all dummies. At first sight it might be curious to have a fiscal implication
of the behavioral effect that is negative, i.e. that the cohort's contribution to the government
budget increases as a reaction to the change in its behavior. However, the finding is less
surprising when we notice that another important variable has changed as a consequence of
this change in behavior, notably the length of the working life. Hence, the "loss" of the cohort
in terms of net benefits minus taxes has to be seen as a tradeoff for the "gain" in income due
to a higher average working life.

Another puzzling point from Table 4 is the indetermination in the sign of the behavioral effect
on the PDV of benefits. It is positive in most cases except for the Belgian Reform, as well as
for the case of simulation methodology S2 in the Option Value model. Table 5 illustrates the
decomposition by age of retirement of the fiscal implication of the behavioral effect on
benefits for a median household facing the actuarial adjustment reform. It appears that the
behavioral effect is negative until age 60 and then turns positive, the sign coming from the
sign of the probability change. Even with the negative probability changes larger than the
positive ones in absolute value, as is the case in our example, we can observe that the total
behavioral effect for this household is positive. The structure of the post-reform PDV of
benefits by age of exit of the labor force helps explain this finding. As the actuarial
adjustment reform is much less penalizing in the age range 61-70 than between the ages of 50
and 60, the PDV of benefits is steeply increasing as a function of age of labor force exit and
hence leads to a positive behavioral effect when aggregating up over all possible exit ages.
The same reasoning can be applied to the common reform and to a certain level to the Belgian
reform. In this case, as the structure of the post-reform PDV of benefits does not change a lot
from the base case, the negative probability changes, which extend typically from 50 to 56,
create a larger behavioral effect than the positive one on the age range 57-70. As to the “Plus
3 years” reform, the probability changes are so erratic that no typical rules can be found.

Figures A1 to A7 in the appendix illustrate the effects of the "three-year-increase" reform
along several different margins. Figure A1 displays the PDV of benefits per worker at any
given age of retirement, as well as the impact thereon by the reform. Figure A2 summarizes
the total of taxes paid by age of labor force exit. This graph again illustrates the fact that the
elderly are still important contributors to the federal budget. This is particularly true for those
working till relatively late in their life cycle, as the fiscal pressure on the productive factor
labor is relatively high compared to the pressure on pension benefits. Figure A3 and A5
display the simulated patterns of labor force exit over the age range 50-70, which follows a
rather smooth pattern for the S1 simulation methodology, and a more erratic one for
simulation methodology S3. The role of the shift in the age dummies becomes evident in
figure A5. Figures A4 and A6 display the age-specific impact of the reform, with a rather
modest net change (PDV of benefits minus taxes) at all ages, whereas the change of the PDV
of benefits is of varying sign and characterized by larger swings in magnitude. Clearly, the tax
system (payroll, income and consumption) plays an important role in the determination of the
sign and magnitude of the net contribution to the federal budget at all possible exit ages.
Figure A7 illustrates the power of these fiscal implications as a proportion of GDP. The figure
shows that the mechanical effects are approximately of the same size for all possible
simulation methodologies, but that the difference between these reforms stems from the
behavioral effect.

Figures B1-B3-B7, C1-C3-C7 and D1-D3-D7 in the appendix illustrate the key results for the
other three reforms in terms of the changes in the PDV of benefits and in the retirement
probabilities at the different ages, as well as the fiscal implications as a proportion of GDP.
The latter indicator allows a comparison of the total budgetary effect of the various reforms in
terms of a common measure. It appears that – budgetarily speaking – the actuarial adjustment
reform is the most powerful reform in all cases excluding those relying on the S3
methodology. Even if it is the common reform that has the strongest impact on the level of
benefits because of its inherent ineligibility to retirement benefits before the age 60, it is the
actuarial adjustment reform that creates the strongest incentives for individuals to work
longer. Indeed, a comparison of Figure C3 with Figure B3 shows that the retirement rate is
lower for the actuarial adjustment reform before age 60 and a bit higher after this age.

         6. Distributional analysis

Table 6 and Table 7 display the distributional implications of the reforms when splitting the
population into 5 income categories. A common feature of the first three reforms is that the
three middle earnings quintiles, hence the middle classes, bear the brunt of the reform. This is
particularly true for the common reform, where the impact on the two extreme income
quintiles is much less pronounced. The results are less extreme for the case of the plus -three-
year reform, where the changes of all income quintiles are relatively close to one another as
expressed in these relative terms. The actuarial adjustment reform again is the middle ground.
Only the lowest income quintile loses less in relative terms under this reform proposal.

The Belgian reform on the other hand has a very different redistributive pattern. While
income quintiles 3 and 4 again face the largest proportional change as displayed in tables Z, it
is now the lowest income quintile that loses out more than the first and second income
quintiles. The reasons for this finding are multiple. First, they are due to the way the reform
only affects those that are on the wage-earner scheme. Hence it does not affect civil servants
who have relatively high life-cycle earnings, hence making them relatively more numerous in
the upper income quintiles. Second, the reform only touches those with incomplete careers,
and hence essentially touches two categories of people. First, it affects those with unstable

it changes incentives for those choosing to retire early. Hence, the reform is less important for
higher income white collars who face lower probabilities of layoff, accident, sickness and
invalidity.


        7. Conclusions

The analysis shows the large potential budgetary impact of various hypothetical reforms.
These reforms, though clearly selected for comparative and illustrative purposes, illustrate the
importance of behavioral effects that the citizens display when faced with a varying landscape
in terms of the social insurance architecture. Different real-life reform alternatives are
imaginable in the Belgian context. Any such real-life alternative will have to include – at least
to some degree – some elements analyzed in our stylized scenarios, for example, changes in
the key retirement ages, the use of actuarial adjustment factors and a convergence between the
three main retirement systems, while at the same time not forgetting the labor demand side.
The common reform admittedly looks somewhat unrealistic. In that sense, our "Belgian
reform" is a first step in the direction of getting these hypothetical simulations closer to the
field. By eliminating one particular aspect of our largely Bismarckian system, namely an
aspect that is not insurance based, we reestablish a clearer link between contributions and
benefits. The results indicate that even such a partial reform might have important
consequences, not only in levels but also on the distributional side. The results of the present
distributional analysis also illustrate the need to refine the analysis in future research.

However, we would like to insist on the fact that the analysis heavily relies on some
assumptions we made, most notably the limitation to the cohort of 50 year olds and the steady
state assumption, which both clearly limit the generality with which one can apply the above
results to real-world proposals. Hence there is a clear need for further research to get the
reform proposals closer in line with politically feasible and economically viable alternatives
over the long run, as well as to check the robustness of our simulation approach.

The present paper shows that the social security system at large (i.e. including unemployment
and disability insurance as well as early retirement schemes) induces Belgian workers to retire
earlier than they ought to. Most reforms contemplated imply that we bring this comprehensive
social security package closer to actuarial fairness. We realize that this is questionable and
ought to be viewed as a first step towards a more complete analysis of reforms. Assume
indeed that a fraction of these early retirees who draw benefits from disability benefits are
truly disabled and a fraction of those drawing benefits from unemployment insurance are truly
involuntarily unemployed. A good reform should attempt to identify these workers and let
them benefit from social insurance. This may imply improving the audit and control
procedures, particularly for unemployment. Then for the remaining early voluntary early
retirees we would apply our alternative actuarial reforms.
