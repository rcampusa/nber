                                  ABSTRACT

     working definition, first formulated in the 1920's by Mitchell and

revised in the 1940s, has been in use at the National Bureau for over fifty

years and is still employed to identify and date business cycles. The NBER

historical chronologies for england, France, and Germany as well as the United

States have been intensively in economic research and are widely accepted. The

u.s. chronology, which is being updated as promptly as the data allow, also has

the important practical function of aiding the analysis of current business

conditions and forecasting near-term cyclical developments.   This paper

discusses the main aspects of the NB concept of business cycles; the early

views and developments bearing on the construction of the chronologies; the

problems and procedures involved; the characteristics and dependability of the

historical reference dates; and the National ureau's work in this field since

World War II. Some recent uses of the U.S. dates to measure the duration,

amplitudes, and diffusion of business expansions and contractions are

illustrated. Finally, we show and discuss chronologies of "growth cycles,"

i.e., trend—adjusted business cycles, for 13 countries in the post—World War IT

period.

                          I.   Defining Business Cycles

      Business cycles consist of recurrent sequences of expansions, downturns,

 contractions, and upturns in a great number of diverse economic activities.

 These movements are both sufficiently diffused and sufficiently synchronized to

 create major fluctuations in comprehensive aggregates of employment, produc—

 tion, real income, and real sales. They are as a rule asymmetric in that

expansions typically exceed contractions in size and duration. (In earlier

history, however, the differences in duration were relatively small and irreg-

ular, as will he shown below.) Of course, in any secularly growing economy,

expansions must necessarily be on the average larger than contractions. it is

a rare business cycle that does not contain a visible element of growth.

     Persistent and pervasive fluctuations of this type are characteristic of

the course of industrial economies with large sectors of private enterprise and

markets relatively unconstrained by qovernments. They have accompanied the de-

velopment of modern capitalism in the Western world. First systematic accounts

are over a hundred years old (Juglar, 1862). Authoritative studies date the

phenomenon back at least to the late eighteenth century.

     As a rule, several years are required for the cumulative processes of bus-

iness expansion and contraction to complete a round from peak to peak or from

trough to trough. But business cycles, although recurrent, are in their dir-

ectly observable manifestations nonperiodic, unlike the cycles of the seasons.1

Indeed, they vary considerably in duration and as well as in intensity and

scope, and do so in ways that appear to he largely unsystematic and

unpredictable.
     Seasonal movements, which are periodic but often quite variable in

amplitude and incidence over the calendar year, may obscure the cyclical deve-

lopments to an observer of current changes in individual time series. In addi-

tion, short erratic movements are likewise continually present in most economic

indicators, and they too frequently impede the contemporaneous reading of busi-

ness cycle signals. Historically, however, and looking across data represent-

ing many different variables, business cycles can be clearly distinguished from

the other fluctuations in that they are usually larger, longer, arid more widely

dif fused. Seasonal movements typically run their course within a year; most

isolated random events also have repercussions of similar or shorter duration.

Thus it is business cycles that usually dominate changes in the economy over

spans of several years, just as seasonal and other shorter variations dominate

many changes over spans of a few weeks or a few months. The developments

across decades are, to he sure, primarily the work of forces of secular growth—

-rising population, labor force, and physical capital, as well as gains in

productivity attributable to technological, educational, and organizational

improvements. However, business cycles and long trends can and do interact in

varied and subtle ways (about which more later).

       succinct definition of business cycles, first formulated in the 1920s,

and revised in the 1940s, runs as follows:



       Fusiness cycles are a type of fluctuation found in the ag-
       gregate economic activity of nations that organize their
       work mainly in business enterprises: a cycle consists of
       expansions occuring at about the same time in many economic
       activities, followed by similarly general recessions,
       contractions, and revivals which merge into the expansion
       phase of the next cycle; the sequence of changes is recur-
       rent hut not oeriodic; in duration business cycles vary
       from more than one year to ten or twelve years; they are
       not divisible into shorter cycles of similar character with
       amplitudes approximating their own.2
                                        —3—




  This working definition, in substantially its present form, has been in use at

  the National Bureau of Economic Research for over fifty years, and is currently

 employed by the NBER to identify and date the U. S. business cycle. These

 dates are widely accepted by government, academic, and business analysts. The

 definition served as the basis for the National Bureau's pre—Worid War II

 business cycle chronologies for England, France, and Germany as well as the

 United States. With a modest adjustment, namely to allow activity to be

 measured relative to its long—run trend, the definition has been used to

 develop "growth cycle" chronologies for many countries. it has surely passed a

 severe test of time, considering all the far—reaching changes in the structure

 of modern industrialized economies and the character of contemporary business

 cycles.

      The concept of "aggregate economic activity" is purposely vague, yielding

to the recognition that what matters is the evolution over time of a vector of

many diverse activities which are not readily reducible to any single aggre-

gate.3 The reasons are in part economic: for example, in times past when

prices fluctuated cyclically around a relatively stable level, GNP in current

dollars was often a more sensitive indicator than GN? in constant dollars, was

often in the recent era of long persisting inflation the opposite is qenerally

the case. Business cycles involve multidimensional processes, in which

quantities and prices, stocks and flows, outputs and inputs, real, monetary,

and financial variables all tend to participate, albeit with many timing and

amplitude differentials and at varying rates. The definition properly stresses

that the expansions and contractions occur with rough synchronism in "many

economic activities" (and, we would add, in a fair number of activities

generally regarded as "noneconomic" as well). The high cyclical conformity or

coherence of numerous variables, that is, the wide diffusion or pervasiveness
                                           —4—



of business cycles was and remains their common and salient characteristic.

          Statistical considerations are also important in this context. It is

simply a fact that no single comprehensive measure of the nation's economic ac-

tivity is available monthly or quarterly for a long historical period. Whether

the aggregates refer to output, income, expenditures, or employment, they

individually lack sufficient comparability of coverage and sufficient solidity

of estimation over long stretches of time. It seems best therefore to rely on

the evidence from a number of comprehensive indicators rather than any single

one. Particular attention needs to be paid to the comovement of the economic

variables, taking account of any systematic timing differences among them.

This also helps to reduce the risk of drawing erroneous inferences from data

containing measurement errors and biases due to changes in the quality of the

information.

          In addition to being pervasive, business cycles are also persistent, i.e.,

the expansions and contractions are congeries of serially correlated as well as

cross—correlated movements in many activities. The requirement that business

cycles not be "divided into shorter cycles of similar character with amplitudes

approximating their own" has in practice meant that no rise or decline in

aqgreqate output, employment, etc., is recognized as a cyclical movement unless

it   is    at least as large as the smallest expansion or contraction in the histor-

ical record. Beyond that, no quantitative specifications are imposed upon

either the amplitude or the scope of the cycles.

          The only numerical limits mentioned refer to the duration of a full cycle

(expansion and contraction) and they are broad: more than a year to ten or

twelve years. Thus the range of admissible fluctuations is wide, accommodating

short and long, weak and strong cycles. There is no recoqnition of any

systematic distinctions in these respects: unlike some other contemporary
                                        —5—




 scholars (Schumpeter, 1939; Hansen, 1941, 1951; R. A. Gordon, 1952), Burns and

 Mitchell (1946, chs. 10 and 11) found no cogent reasons to differentiate a

 priori between "minor" and "major" or between "Kitchin" and "Juglar" cycles.

 However, 'this is a case of suspended judgment, not a definitive conclusion.

 Important differences clearly exist, e.g., inventory investment plays a central

 role in the short "Kitchiri" cycles, whereas fixed capital investment is more

 instrumental in the longer "Juglar" cycles. But such distinctions, and more

 generally all considerations of causality, are viewed as matters to he treated

 in further research, not as parts of a tentatively accepted definition. The

 long waves of fifty to Sixty years hypothesized by Kondratjeff in 1926 are

quite different phenomena whose precise nature, and even existence, has not yet

been widely accepted. Schuinpeter's 1935 hypothesis that each such long wave

contains six Juglar cycles of from nine to ten years duration, while every

Juglar is divisible into three Kitchin cycles of roughly forty months each, has

also failed to be validated.

     Burns and Mitchell make it clear that by their definition a mere slowing

down or cessation of growth is not enough to qualify as a business cycle

contraction: what is required is an absolute fall in "aggregate economic

activity." Note, however, that this requirement has been modified in the

recent work on "growth cycles." The rise and fall is not restricted to some

limited measure of economic activity, e.g.,, production in manufacturing or

corporate profits, sufficient to define a business cycle: the latter must be

clearly reflected in economy—wide aggregates of output and employment.

Moreover, contractions as well as expansions are taken to be cumulative

movements, which implies that they cannot be very short. Historical evidence

indicates, for example, that a decline of less than six months could not reach

the dimensions that would qualify it as a cyclical contraction, in particular a
                                          —6—



 state in which a majority of industries experience falling demand (new orders

 or sales), production, and employment.


                        II. Early Views and Developments

      Business cycles must be strictly distinguished from the various "crises"

 associated with foreign and civil wars, epidemics, bad harvests, earthquakes,

 isolated and transient monetary disorders, speculative "manias," and other epi-

 sodic or random disturbances. Such events, whether due to acts of nature or of

 man, can disrupt the ordinary rhythm of economic life and cause much distress

 at any time, and they did so for ages under all forms of social organization.

 In contrast, business cycles, as defined above, "are found only in modern

 nations where economic activities are organized mainly through business enter-

prises and where individuals enjoy considerable freedom in producing, pricing,

trading, and saving or investing" (Burns, 196R, p. 22).

     In the early literature on the subject, business cycles have often been

viewed as the natural way growth takes in modern capitalist economies. The

latter have achieved historically unprecedented records of long—term develop-

ment, e.g., approximately fivefold gains in output per capita in the United

States, France, and Germany.4 Private enterprise thrived on and fostered

advances in science and technology by seeking higher profits in surges of

innovative investment. There was increasing division and specialization of

labor as new techniques were introduced, new markets opened, new products dis-

covered. Inevitably, this was associated with various frictions, difficult

adjustments, and costly resource transfers in response to the (in large part

unanticipated) shifts in demands and supplies.

     Over decades, fairly smooth rising trends in population and labor force

and much faster growth in the stock of reproducible capital can he broadly

ocumented.5 Improvements from the progress of    knowledqe,   new technologies,
                                       —7.-




 and new skills kept raising the quality and marginal productivity of human and

 tanqible capital. This was sufficient to prevent a downward trend in the

 profitability of new investment, which would otherwise have resulted, under the

 law of diminishing marginal returns, from the growing abundance of physical

 capital relative to labor and the norireproducible natural resources.6 Over

 shorter periods, however, profit totals, margins, and rates were continually

 undergoing large fluctuations induced by movements in sales, in product prices

 relative to wages and costs of materials and finance, in investment, and in the

demand and supply of credit. In turn, the rise and fall of profits, cash flow,

and rates of return caused parallel movements in expectations of future

profitability and hence in business decisions concerning production, employ—

ment, and investment. Changes in money and credit interacted with these general

changes in economic expectations and activity.

     To be sure, this is merely a brief, rough sketch of some trends in the

classic era of industrialization, economic growth, and business cycles that ori-

ginated about 200 years ago in ritain and spread worldwide in the past century.

Some observers placed more stress on real factors: cyclical innovations and

growth spurts, recurrent overjnvestment, imbalances between production of

capital and consumer goods, intersectoral shifts, Others emphasized monetary

processes: changes in the supply of bank credit, discrepancies between market

and equilibrium interest rates. Still others paid special attention to the role

of uncertainty and failure of foresight, interdependent expectations and waves

of errors of optimism and pessimism. Finally, the focus on cyclical changes in

relative prices and profits is also compatible with important roles being played

by other real forces as well as monetary and expectational variables, But it is

generally correct to see the early theories of business cycles as mainly endo—

genous, i.e., concentrating on the internal relations of the economic system
                                          —8—



rather than on the effects of external shocks; multicausal, i.e., concerned with

interactions of the real, monetary, and expectational factors; and dynamic,

i.e., incorporating elements of long—term growth into the analysis of short-term

instability .'

     The historical setting of business cycle phenomena suggests that they deve-

loped gradually along with the growing interdependence within and among the

modern capitalist economies. The processes and institutions that mark this evo-

lution include the buildup of fixed capital in progressively mechanized pro-

duction requiring new sources of labor, energy, and materials; lessening of

barriers to trade through advances in transportation and communications; and the

spread of money transactions, banking and credit and investment finance. s

these factors moved the market economies of the Western world onto higher levels

of economic interdependence, strongly diffused and persistent business

fluctuations emerged where previously disjointed acts of nature and man—made

disturbances held sway. Since Juglar, 1862, it was widely recognized that the

acute financial crises that happened from time to time are merely transitory

events that cannot he well understood in isolation from the major problem of

recurrent sequences of general expansions and contractions. Between 1894 and

1927, most of the leading scholars in the field (Tugan—Baranovskii, Aftalion,

Mitchell, Spiethoff, S.chumpeter) strongly endorsed and elaborated the conception

of business cycles as a characteristic motion of the development of modern

capital—creating, money—exchange, market-oriented economies.

     The dating of the earliest business cycles is imprecise and impeded by

severe limitations of the available data. Schumpeter (1939, vol. I, ch. VI.B,

esp. pp. 223—224, 248—252) argued that capitalism goes "as far hack as the ele-

ment of credit creation" and that "there must have been also prosperities and

depressions of the cyclical type"   in   the seventeenth and eiqhteenth century.
                                        —9—



But he concedes to the critics of this view that wars, poor harvests, and other

"noncyclical catastrophies" played a much greater role in the preindustrializa—

tion era than in the cycles of the later period.8

     A reference chronology of cyclical turning points for eighteenth century

England has been compiled from fragmentary but carefully assembled and explained

chronicles and data by T. S. Ashton, and some of his results are summed up in

Table 1 •   Bad harvests occured frequently, causing shortages for small farmers

who produced qrain mainly for themselves and their livestock and depressing real

wages of industrial workers, the demand for textiles and other manufactured

products, and output of commodities subject to excise duties. Government reven-

ue would fall at the same time as the costs of provisions for the navy and army

rose. The resulting deficits tended to raise the costs of borrowing and to

decrease public confidence. More grain had to be imported at high prices,

adversely affecting the balance of payments and the domestic supply of credit.

Large farmers may have henefitted from higher grain prices but overall the bad

consequences prevailed.

     Althouqh Britain fought her wars on the seas or on alien soil, they were

recurrent, protracted, and often associated with other disasters such as epidem-

ics and famines. They had large but mixed effects on overall economic activity,

since the extent to which they curtailed civilian consumption or increased pro-

duction varied greatly, as did the extent to which they were financed by

taxation vs. loans. The periods of decline, as dated by Ashton lasted loriqer,

on average, than the periods of growth.

     In sum, weather and wars seem to account for much of the fluctuation in

economic fortunes before the industrial revolution in Britain of the 1780s.

But endogenous economic and financial processes played an increasingly impor-

tant role as well. Bank notes and commercial paper provided an elastic supply
                                        —10—




 of means of payment. Speculation in commodities and securities spread in pros-

 perous times and financial crises accompanied or followed most of the peak

 dates (Ashton, ch. 5). Longer building cycles also persisted (op. cit., ch. 4,

 and John P. Lewis, 1965). Rostow (1980, pp. 37—38) compares the effects of bad

 harvests on real incomes and the balance of payments to the effects of oil price

 rises in 1973—74 and 1979 and the associated "supply—side recessions" in the

 United States and elsewhere. It is interesting to note that the Ashton dates

 suggest a sequence of sixteen "cycles" with durations concentrated heavily

 between 3 and 6 years and averaging about 5 years (whether measured from trough

 to trough or from peak to peak). This is very close to the average length of

 the 28 cycles identified in Great Britain in the NBER chronology for 1792—1932

 (59 or 60 months, see Burns and Mitchell, 1946, p. 371).


           III. Business Annals, Historical Statistics, and Reference Dates

     The first step taken by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER)

toward identifying historical business cycles shortly after its founding in

1920, was to compile comprehensive chronological records of chanqes in qeneral

economic conditions in the United States and England (1790—1925), France (1840—

1925), Germany (1853—1925), Austria (1867—1925), and twelve other countries

(1890—1925). These "business annals" were based on detailed studies of a large

collection of official documents, reports by contemporary observers and students

of economic history, periodicals, pamphlets, and books. The resulting volume

by Willard Thorp (1926) lists several hundred sources. This was a major effort

to extract year—by—year information on the spread, timing, duration, and inten-

sity of past business fluctuations in the "great commercial nations," both old

and new.

     A second NBER project, also started in the early 1920s, was to collect sta—

tistical time series data on a variety of pertinent aspects of modern economies,

and to subject them to a systematic analysis. These materials are more massive
                                          —11•—




 yet, and they are obviously necessary as a basis for more precise quantitative

 results as well as to check the inferences from the business annals. However,

 it is also useful to check the inferences from the statistical data with the aid

 of the reports of contemporary observers and other documents underlying the

 annals. In short, the two collections of materials provide evidence that is to

 a large extent complementary.

     The time series cover shorter periods than the annals, and are limited to

 four countries: the United States, England, France and Germany. The available

 statistical record shrinks rapidly as one goes back into the iSOOs, and the

series extending to the earliest decades covered by the British and U. S.

business annals are very scanty. The early data are predominantly annual and

their coverage and quality leave much to be desired. This makes the business

annals indispensable for the study of the more distant past. Their materials

enabled Thorp and the NBER staff to characterize each successive year covered

according to the business conditions that prevailed. They called the generally

good and bad times "prosperity" and "depression," respectively, the generally

shorter upper and lower transition periods "recessions" and "revivals," often

attaching to these terms such adjectives as "brief," "slow," "rapid," "mild,"

"moderate," or "severe." Frequently, the recessions and revivals were dated

more closely within a year by such designations as "early" or "late," or even

by months or seasons. Thus a single year would be occasionally classified into

more than one of the four basic cycle phases.9

     Although business annals and indexes of qeneral economic activity may dif-

fer with respect to the mix of the processes covered, measurement errors, etc.,

Mitchell (1926, pp. 20—31) presents evidence of a generally close agreement

between the two approaches on the fluctuations in the United States, 1875—192

and in Fnqland 1855—1914. Even   for   the earlier cycles, back to 1796, there is
                                      —12—




a fairly good correspondence between the recession dates based on the annals

and those based on statistical series (mainly wholesale commodity prices).0

     Table 2 compares the annual reference dates for the British and U. S. bus-

iness cycles between 1790 and 1858, as estimated by Thorp from annals (U. S.

through 1833) and by Burns and Mitchell from annals and time—series studies. k

close correspondence between the cycles in the two countries is indicated.

Eight of the peak and three of the trough dates coincide. The degree of syn-

chronization is particularly high for the (more precisely determined) dates of

financial crises, in 1815, 1825, 1836—37, 1847, and 1857. The business annals

for other countries available for the later period reinforce the finding that

many cycles had an international sweep, as do the more recent and statistically

firmer NBER chronologies for the U. S., England, France, and Germany (see below).

This again applies especially to the major cycles, which were often accompanied

by financial crises or panics as in 1873, 1893, 1907, and 1929.

     according to the annual chronologies in Table 2, the durations of business

cycles in this era comprising seven decades of the rise of modern capitalism

and industrialization averaged about 4 1/2 years in both Great Britain and the

United States, whether measured from trouqh to trough or from peak to peak.

The standard deviations of these estimates are close to 2 years. Most contrac-

tions did not exceed one or two years. 'jve of the fourteen identified cycles

in either country fall into the early turbulent period of almost continuous

wars that ended in 1815.


      IV. 4onth1y Business Cycle Chronologies: Problems and Procedures

     For the United States and Britain since 1854, for France since 1865, and

for Germany since 1879, sufficient evidence could he assembled by the National

Bureau to permit estimation of monthly, as well as quarterly and annual, refer-

ence chronologies of business cycles. The work involved a painstaking
                                      —1 3—




collective effort. Burns and Mitchell (1946, p. 80) credit Kuznets for taking

"a leading part in the preparation of the oriqinal set of reference dates" and

Abramovitz, Moore, Shiskin, Garvy, and Walt Rostow, among others, for help in

extending, revising, or criticizing the dates.

     Before presenting and discussing the results (in the next section), we

need to consider the main problems encountered in this research and the methods

adopted to overcome them. The lack of a single sufficiently long and consis-

tent measure of aggregate economic activity was already noted. There is no

doubt that no time series exists to fill this role for any country. This ap-

plies even to the recent periods covered by the quarterly data on national

income and product accounts, as will he argued later. For the years before

World War II, these series are anyway fragmentary and not very dependable.

     In constructing their "reference scales" of business cycles after World

War I, the NBER team could draw on monthly series of production in manufact-

uring and mining, and of the number of factory employees. Before World War I,

however, these data have a slender sampling basis and leave much to be desired.

The series on bank clearings, wholesale prices, and interest rates are much

longer. Historically, their cyclical sensitivity tended to be high, and the

researchers found them on the whole very useful. Much reliance was placed,

too, on a variety of indexes of business conditions, mostly in physical terms.

     In sum, the historical records decrease both in volume and reliability

when pushed back into the past. In general, they are more satisfactory for the

United States than for the foreign countries, but the reverse is true in a few

cases involving the data for unemployment and interest rates (Burns and

Mitchell, 1946, pp. 73—76).

     Civen the limitations of the individual indicators, the task of identif y—

ing and dating the historical business cycles required the analysis of both the
                                        —14—




 voluminous business annals and numerous time series covering diverse activities.

 Before deciding when a peak (trough) occurred, it is necessary to determine

 whether the expansion (contraction) is of cyclical dimensions. To ascertain

 the critical characteristics of the scope and size of the economy's movement,

 there was no alternative to the laborious procedure of extracting common sig-.

 nals from the noisy indications of fallible data on a whole range of economic

 processes. This remains true even today when much better and more comprehen—

 sive cyclical indicator statistics are available, because the diffusion aspect

 of business cycles is as important as ever. It is still true as well, despite

 the great improvement in the data, that measurement errors are mostly unknown

hut often large. A careful comparative analysis of interrelated but indepen-

dently derived time series can help reduce the effects of such errors on a

business cycle chronology.

       The working definition of business cycles cited above implies that peaks

and troughs of time series representing a broad array of economic processes are

not randomly interspersed but form alternating clusters. The clusters of peaks

and troughs typically extend over many months, but it is also true that they

show as a rule rather definite points of concentration (see, e.g., Moore, 1961,

Chart 7—3 and text, pp. 196—202). These dates, around which most of the series

reach their highest (lowest) local levels, indicate roughly the timing of the

peaks (troughs) in the otherwise not observable aggregate economic activity."

       Of course, some series deserve more attention than others because they are

more comprehensive, more significant economically, more adequate statistically,

or more reliable with respect to their cyclical timing and conformity charac-

teristics. Some series such as unemployment tend to rise in contractions and

fall   in expansions, hence they must he used in inverted form. Some series such
as new orders for capital goods and construction contracts rise and fall early;
                                      —15--




others such as the volumes of business inventories and loans typically move

late; still others move early at peaks and late at troughs, or vice versa.

These systematic differences in behavior, once known, can and should be taken

into account in identifying and dating the generalized expansions and

contractions——often by excluding them from the sample of series used in the

procedure.

     It should be clear that the monthly or quarterly dates of business cycle

turns are of necessity uncertain estimates. No high degree of precision is

generally possible here; the best achievable result is a chronology that is

well supported by the most pertinent evidence one can obtain. But this is also

a major result and worth much effort. P well—designed and well—tested chronol-

ogy is a valuable tool in the analysis and understanding of business cycle phe-

nomena, some of which at least are of prime interest to macroeconomic theory

and policy. A common reference scale has many practical uses, one of them

being to confer the advantage of economies of scale on the handling of large

numbers of contemporaneous time series. As Burns and Mitchell said (1946, pp.

70—71), "If our analysis were restricted to a few time series, it would be sim—

pie to compare their specific cycles directly, But when the analysis covers

hundreds of series, it is clumsy and wasteful to compare the timing of each

series with every other; indeed, as clumsy and wasteful as it would he to ex-

press the exchange value of each commodity in terms of every other commodity."

Other analytical uses of the business cycle chronologies, for international

comparisons and the measurement of relative durations, amplitudes, and spread

of cyclical movementss are illustrated below (Chart 1 and Tables 4, 6, and 7).

             V. The NBER Business Cycle Chronologies for 1854-1938

     Table 3 shows the monthly, quarterly, arid annual lists of reference dates

compiled by the National Bureau for the periods before World War II. The hulk
                                          —16—



of this information comes from Burns and Mitchell, as cited. Only a few of the

dates, all referring to the U. S. cycles in 1919—38, were subsequently changed

in light of additional and revised data. The resulting shifts were small. Two

dates were shifted by one month and two were shifted by two months.

        The quarterly and annual dates are necessary for working with time series

cast in the corresponding time units, in particular where monthly data are not

available, but the monthly dates are basic since only they permit observation

of cyclical behavior in the essential detail (Burns and Mitchell, 1946, pp. 80—

81). Hence the monthly dates control the others and should be given preference

and used wherever possible.

        If the monthly choice falls in the mid-month of the quarter, that quarter

is always taken as the quarterly reference date. If it falls on the first or

third month, the quarterly turn is placed either in the quarter in which the

reference month is located or in the quarter adjacent to that month, according

to the indications of a sample of important economic series measured by

quarters (including monthly data converted to quarterly).

        Annual records alone are a poor guide to dating, since they obscure some

mild and short business cycles. Phases of 12 months or less that overlap two

calendar years (mostly contractions) have been frequent, particularly in the

United States since the 1870g. Independent annual dating can miss the short

business cycles and combine two or even three of them into one, while producing

only a rough oneto—one correspondence with the longer cycles in the monthly

chronology. There is ample statistical evidence that this is a serious meas-

urement problem (Burns and Mitchell, ch. 6, esp. p. 262). Hence the adopted

procedure is to set monthly reference dates first and then make the annual ones

match    them as   well as possible. However, the annual turns are intended to

identify the years in which the overall activity in the economy reached a high
                                           —17—




 or a low point, and these years need not always coincide with those in which

 the corresponding monthly peaks or troughs fall. When the monthly date occurs

 early in the year t, the annual date may well he the year t—1; similarly, when

 the monthly turn is late, the annual one will often be the year t+1

        According to these chronologies, business cycles have indeed been recur-

 rent but not periodic in each of the countries covered. Contractions ranged

 from 7 to 65 months in the United States, 6 to 81 months in Britain, 8 to 68

months in France, and 12 to 61 months in Germany. The corresponding ranges for

expansion are 10 to 50, 8 to 64, 8 to 62, and 16 to 61 months. The shortest

full—cycle durations (measured from peak to peak or from trough to trough) are

 17 months for the United States and Great Britain, 24 months for France, and 34

months for Germany; the longest are 101, 135, 110, and 122 months, respectively.

        However, these measures are based on rare outliers; there is considerably

more of a central tendency among      business    cycles than they suggest. For example,

declines lasting from 10 months to 2 years account for 67 percent (43 out of 64)

of the business contractions recorded in Table 3. Expansions lasting 1 1/ to 3

1/2   years   represent 66 percent (42 out of 64) of all observations in this cate-

gory. Full      cycles   lasting 21/2 to 51/2 years account for 64 percent (41 out of

64) of all cycles measured from trough to trough. These ranges contain half or

more of the corresponding listings for each of the four countries covered.

        It is important to note that business cycles have tended to be shorter in

the United States than in the foreign countries. Thus the period 1854-1938

witnessed 21 U. S. cycles averaging four years and only 16 British cycles

averaging 5—1/3 years. For 1879—1938, the comparison is as follows:

Chart 1 uses a schematic form to compare the timing of business cycle peaks

degree of correspondence between the chronologies, as shown by the following

     A closer look at the diagram makes it clear that much of the time, not-

ably during the four decades 1879-1919, the conformity between the business

cycles in the three European countries was very close, while the United States

followed a different pattern of shorter and more frequent fluctuations. In

the earlier years, the movements were generally less synchronized, in part

because of the annual dating for France and Germany. In the 1920s and 1930s,

the European countries were much less in phase with each other than in the

oreceeding forty years, hut the degree of conformity between their cycles and

those in the United States increased.11

               VI. On The Dependability of       Historical   Reference Dates
        In the early   U. S. business cycles, the average length of contractions

  was close to that of expansions, whereas more recently expansions have become

  much longer. This is clearly so according to the following measures of mean

  duration of the cyclical phases dated by the N1ER.



                            1834—55   1857—82       1885—99     1900—18   1919—37     1948—82

        Fluctuations   of trend-adjusted aggregates in the post-World War II period

  show alternating phases of high and low growth that have similar durations (e.g.,

  in 1948—75 for the U. S., these phases lasted on the average 20 and 18 months,

  respectively). In such "growth cycles" (see section VIII below)          the near
  symmetry is persistent and understandable because the fluctuations are measured
  from a long—run upward trend laid flat, as it were; that is, the growth element

  is eliminated. In contrast, the secular trend is retained in the measurement of

  business   cycles as defined by the NBER, so that stages of less than average hut
  positive   growth are included in expansions and only the periods of sufficiently

  large and broad absolute decline qualify as contractions.

        Accordingly, one might expect business cycle expansions to be signifi-

  cantly longer than contractions on the average over long periods of economic

  development. If so, one might also be somewhat surprised by, and suspicious

  of,   the near equality of the early          and C measures listed above.
        These views are not compelling conceivably, the averages could reflect
                                      —20--




 the dominance of lengthy periods of slow decline among the contractions and of

short periods of rapid growth among the expansions. But it is also possible

that some of the historical reference dates refer to growth cycles rather than

business cycles, i.e., that some of the phases designated as actual declines

in the overall economic activity represent merely phases of low (less than the

trend) growth rates. The limitations of data available for the identification

of the early cycles, and the consequent reliance on business annals and sel-

ected indexes of business conditions, might well have produced a certain bias

in this direction. This applies in particular to the period 1834—52, the seg-

ment of the NBER reference cycle chronology for which there are no comprehen—

sive measures or indexes of economic activity without trend adjustments.

     p. partial reappraisal of the evidence for the United States confirms that

generally the contractions in NBER chronology do represent cyclical declines in

either real income and output, or money income and spending, or both the real

and the nominal aggregates (Zarnowitz, 1981). It is important to note that,

historically, both groups of variables deserve a thorough consideration. In the

recent era of inflation, the cycles are mainly in the real aggregates, but in

the past, when the price level fluctuated and long periods of deflation

occurred, the cycles were often more pronounced in the nominal aggregates.

     Nevertheless, a few episodes are doubtful. All of these go back to the

19th century. (The 1918—19 and 1926—27 contractions have been questioned by

some investigators but there is sufficient evidence in favor of their

inclusion.12) The most dubious is the 1845—46 phase, but 1869—70, 1887-97, and

1899—1900 are also uncertain. Given the limited information on hand, it seems

impossible to refute the hypothesis that these were periods of below—averaqe

growth rather than actual delines. Fewer doubts attach to some other minor

contractions (Zarnowitz, 1981, pp. 494—505).
                                            —21—




         If the four periods just listed were treated as growth cycle slowdowns

  instead of business cycle contractions, the differences between the ! and             ?

  duration   measures would be substantially increased. The tabulation below

  illustrates these effects.

         Comparisons of the NBER and other chronologies disclose very few discrep-
  ancies and provide no good reasons for revisions (see references in note 14).

  Comparisons with indexes of business activity (both trend—adjusted and, after

  1882, unadjusted) also point to a very high degree of correspondence between

  the cycles identified by the National Bureau and the consensus of fluctuations

  revealed by the best available information from time—series data. Indeed, in

  most cases there is a one-to-one agreement between the NBER dates and the

  cyclical turning points in these indexes.13

         Table 4 provides some evidence on how well the U. S. chronology fits the

  cyclical movements in business activities phase by phase. It shows the per-

  centages of series rising during each expansion and falling during each con-

  traction for 18 indicators of commercial arid industrial activity (production,

  trade, orders, bank clearings) and 28 indicators of prices and financial

  activity (commodity and security prices, interest rates, bonds and shares

  traded, business failures). The series that tend to move countercyclically
                                      —22—



are inverted and allowance is made for fixed leads or lags——the timing charac—

teristics of the indicators. The diffusion measures are predominantly high:

about half of the phase percentages in columns 1—3 exceed 90, three quarters

exceed 80, and practically all exceed 50. However, the percentages tend to he

higher for the series that rise during expansions than for those that decline

during contractions (compare the entries in lines 1—20 and 30—49). The over-

all averages range from 80 to 97 percent (lines 25 and 54). Thus the repre-

sented variables are shown to have participated with substantial regularity in

the successive business cycle expansions and contractions dated by the

National Bureau, exhibiting a generally high level of cyclical conformity.

     The diffusion ought to be positively correlated with the amplitude of cyc-

lical fluctuations, that is, those movements which are more widely spread among

the various sectors, industries, and processes of the economy would also be ex-

pected to he larger in terms of the most comprehensive measures of economic

activity that are available. Table 4 provides.some evidence that this is in-

deed so. Here amplitudes are measured by the average of three trend—adjusted

indexes of business activity which cover the entire period 1854—1933 (column 4)

and by the average of four indexes without trend adjustments which begin in the

1870s or later (column 5). For either set of measures, the phases that rank

higher according to the amplitudes tend to have larger diffusion, i.e., higher

proportions of series conforming with respect to the direction of the economy's

movement (see the sections on "veraqes," lines 21-29 and 50—58, in the table).

    we conclude that the NBR   historical   reference dates of U. S. business

cycles receive strong support from the phase-by—phase behavior of both the in—

dividual indicators and the weighted combinations of various time series

(indexes of business activity). However, it is important to keep in mind the

obvious fact that the chronologies cannot be made more reliable than the avai].
                                      —23—




able information permits. The true cyclical movements in the economy at large

cannot be observed directly without comprehensive, nonduplicative measures of

aqqregate economic activity, but it is only for the most recent decades that

the required statistical data exist. The series used as proxies for such rneas—

ures could either underestimate or overestimate the true movements. Perhaps

the greater risk is that of overestimation because the data appear to represent

the cyclically sensitive sectors of the economy, notably manufacturing, better

than they do the other sectors. Still, the NBER—designated phases provide

about as good approximations to the historical incidence of business expansions

and contractions as the data allow. On the other hand, considerable uncertain-

ty attaches to the precise dates of some of the early reference turns.

     In comparison with the U. S. dates, Burns and Mitchell (1946, p. 113)

assessed the NBER chronologies for the foreign countries as being "at least

tolerable, if not equally good, approximations," while listing a few particular

doubts and difficulties.14 Independent compilations of turning points show on

the whole good agreement on the identification of the cycles; some more serious

discrepancies arise because of differences in how the cycles are defined and

divided into phases.15


             VII. The U.S. Business Cycle Chronology Since 1933

     Since World War II the National Bureau's work in this field has been

directed towards (1) maintaining the U.S. business cycle chronology along the

lines previously established and (2) developing the concept of a growth cycle

chronology and applying it to the U.S. and other major industrial countries.

In this section we discuss the chronology of the recent U.S. business cycles,

while the following section is devoted to growth cycles.

     Table 5 gives the monthly, quarterly and annual business cycle dates for

the United States from 1933 to 1982, together with the durations of contrac—
                                        —24—




 tions,   expansions and full cycles.16 Ten cycles have occurred in the past 49

 years, or about one every five years. In the preceding 143 years, from 1790

 to 1933, there were 34 cycles, or about one every four years. Hence the fre-

quency of cycles has diminished somewhat. But the higqest change that the

chronology reveals is the shift in the length of contractions compared to

expansions. In the period for which only annual dates are available, 1790 to

1855, contractions averaged about 24 months, expansions 31 months. Then from

1854 to 1933, when monthly dates are available, the average durations are 22

and 25 months respectively. But since 1933 the average contraction has lasted

only 11 months while expansions have averaged 49 months (27 months when the

wartime expansions are excluded).

     In other words, since the depression of the early 1930's, the contraction

phase of the business cycle has been reduced by about a year, while the expan-

sion phase has been extended by two years. Before 1933, recessions lasted

almost as long as expansions. Since then, expansions have been more than four

times as long as recessions: the economy has been in recession less than

twenty percent of the time.

     Recessions have not only become shorter but also much more uniform in

length. Using the standard deviation as a measure, the variability among con-

tractions in 1790—1855 was 18 months; in 1854—1933, 14 months; while in 1933—

82 it was only 3 months. In this sense, recessions have become more predict—

able. On the other hand, expansions have become less uniform in length. Be-

tween 1790 and 1855 the standard deviation of durations of expansions was 18

months, the same as for the contractions. From 1854 to 1933, the standard

deviation of expansions was 9 months. But from 1933 to 1983, it was 27

months. Fxpansions have become nine times as variable as contractions.

     It is not our purpose here to investigate the reasons for this shift in
                                       —25—




variability, or for the shift in the length of expansions relative to contrac-

tions. The latter appears to be connected with the rising trend of prices

since the 1930's which in turn may be related to the stronger effort of

government to control recessions (See Moore, 1983, Ch. 15). But this is a

worthy subject for further study.

      The length of a period of rise or fall in aggregate economic activity is

one of the criteria considered in establishing the business cycle chronology.

The size and scope of the movement are also considered. Measures of these

1imensions, for all the expansions between 1949 and 1982 are given in Table 6,

.ihile all the contractions since 1920 are covered in Table 7, Measures sirni—

lar   to these, hut somewhat more extensive, have been used by the National

Bureau staff in deciding what intervals should be classified as expansions or

contractions and what the peak and trough dates should be.17

      Study of the tables will reveal one development that led to a shift in

this procedure during the 1960's. During the three expansions 1949—60 and

during the five recessions 1923—38 and 1948—49, GNP in current dollars moved

in wider swings than did GNP in constant dollars, Prices moved up and down

with the business cycle, enhancing the current dollar swings, Since 1960,

apart from a small one—quarter decline in 1982, current dollar GNP has not

declined at all. Whereas before 1960 the current dollar aggregates for GNP,

sales and income had figured iinportantly in the determination of the business

cycle chronology, since the 1960's they have played no role at all. As long

as the rate of inflation remains persistently positive, this practice is

likely to continue.

       The tables make it clear that not only have recessions become shorter,

hut that they have become milder as well. None of the recessions since 1948

have approached the Great Depression in depth, nor have they come close to the
                                        —26—




 major depressions of 1920—21 or 1937—38. All have been in a class either with

 the fairly sharp recession of 1923—24 or the mild recession of 1926—27. The

 tables record considerable "progress toward economic stability" (Burns, 1960).

      A word should be said about the problem of identifying business cycles

 contemporaneously. How soon a peak or trough can be recognized depends partly

 upon how rapidly the economy descends from the peak or rises from the trough.

 It also depends upon one's ability and willingness to make forecasts, for

 example, that a decline in the several measures of aggregate activity will

 last as long and go as deep as in previously recognized recessions, and that

 the declines will be widespread. Since the National Bureea&s decisions on

dates have not depended on forecasts, turns in the business cycle have been

recognized only with a lag. For example, the trough date for the most recent

recession, November 1982, was determined by the National Bureau of Economic

Research in July 1983. Even that involved a presumption that the recovery

then underway would continue and ultimately develop the characteristics of a

business cycle expansion.

     iDrie way to reduce this recognition lag has recently been developed by the

authors in a paper on sequential signals of recession and recovery (Zarnowitz

and Moore, 1982). The signals are based upon smoothed short-run growth rates

in the composite leading and coincident indexes published by the Department of

Commerce. When these growth rates reach certain pre—determined levels, a pre-

liminary signal of a peak or trough occurs. If and when they reach another

set of levels, a second signal is passed, and so on with a third and final

signal. Safeguards against false signals are built into the system. Histori-

cal tests have shown that the signals would have identified each of the U.S.

business cycle peaks and troughs since 1949 without undue delays or false

signals. One of the potential uses for the system is to activate or

deactivate counter—cyclical policies.

                          viii.   Growth Cycle Chronologies

       A modification of the concept of business cycles employed in the chrono-

logies discussed above was developed by Miritz at the National Bureau in the

1960s (Mintz, 1969, 1974). The growth cycle represents a fluctuation around

the long—run growth trend of a nation's economy, i.e., a trend—adjusted busi-

ness cycle. Chronologies based upon this concept, using the classical bus-

iness cycle definition cited above but applying it to data from which long—run

trends have been eliminated, are shown in Table 8 and Chart 2. The dates mark

the approximate time when aggregate economic activity was farthest above its

long—run trend level (peak) or farthest below its long—run trend level

(trough).

      The specific procedures used to establish these chronologies, initiated

by Moore and Klein at the NBER in 1973, are as follows:

      1. Measures of aggregate economic activity such as industrial produc-

tion, gross national product, personal income, employment, unemployment and

sales of goods and services are expressed in physical units or in constant

prices, seasonally adjusted, and their long—run trend removed, The trend—

fitting procedure, called the phase-average trend, provides a fairly flexible

growth    trend that is substantially free of the shorter—term cyclical movements
in   the series (Boschan and Ebanks, 1978).

      2. For each of the above series computer—selected peaks and troughs are

derived   from the deviations of the seasonally adjusted data from the growth
trend.    The program for turning point selection is described in Bry and

Boschan, 1971.

      3. These turning points are visually inspected and sometimes altered by

shifting the date, omitting the turn, or adding another turn. These changes

are relatively rare, affecting perhaps five percent of the turning points.
                                       —28—




     4. Median dates in the clusters of peaks and troughs formed by all the

series mentioned above are computed.

     5. A composite index based on the above series prior to their adjustment

for trend is constructed, the growth trend is removed from the index, and

turning points are selected in the deviations from trend.

     6. The clusters of dates, the median dates and the composite index dates

are inspected and a decision is made on which monthly date best represents the

consensus. These dates are the growth cycle peaks and troughs.

     Comparisons of growth cycle and business cycle chronologies show that the

number of growth cycles during a given period usually exceeds the number of

business cycles, because slowdowns that sometimes occur during long business

cycle expansions become actual contractions in the trend—adjusted figures. n

the United States, for example, such slowdowns occured in 1951—52, 1962—64 and

1966—67, interrupting the long business cycle expansions from 1949 to 1953 and

from 1961 to 1969. Hence growth cycles are, on average, shorter than business

cycles. Another difference is that peaks in the growth cycle usually occur

some months before the corresponding peaks in the business cycle, because

activity usually slows before a business cycle peak is reached. Growth cycle

and business cycle trouqhs tend to he more nearly simultaneous. As a result

of these differences, expansions and contractions are more nearly symmetrical,

in both duration and amplitude, in growth cycles than in business cycles.

Also, the variability in duration and in amplitude is more nearly uniform as

between expansions and contractions of growth cycles. The international

connections among growth cycles since World War II seem to be about as

pervasive as those among business cycles prior to the war (compare Charts 1

and 2).
                                     —29—




     The continuing public concern with slowdowns in growth, some of which

turn into declines in aggregate economic activity and some of which do not,

justifies further attention to this concept of the business cycle. So also

does the growing concern with the international spread of economic fluctua-

tions, since slowdowns in one country may become substantial declines in

another. The widening use of both business cycle and growth cycle chronolo-

gies in many countries testifies to the value of this well—tested tool for

research and public understanding.

        1The term "cycles" is often applied to measurable and recurrent but non—

periodic fluctuations in sciences other than economics, as noted by Wesley

Mitchell who refers to sun—spot cycles which "varied in length from 7 to 17

years since 1788" (see his "Introduction" to Willard L. Thorp, 1926, pp. 32—

33).

        2Burns and Mitchell, 1946, p. 1; for the earlier version, see Mitchell,

1927, p. 468.

        3me term itself entered the definition in 1946; in Mitchell, 1913 and

1927, there is less apparent emphasis on overall aggregates and more on the

collective concept of "a species of fluctuations in the economic activities of

organized communities" or in "activities which are systematically conducted on

a commercial basis" (1927, P. 488). The development of the national income

and product accounts between 1927 and 1946 is of cource highly relevant here.

        41n periods 1834—43 to 1963—67, 1831—40 to 1963—66, and 1850—59 to

1963—67, respectively. In the older developed countries of Europe and in

Japan, population almost tripled and total output increased by a factor of at

least fifteen over a century. These growth rates are far greater than those

which can reasonably he assigned to earlier eras. See Kuznets, 1971, pp. 10—

33 and 303—305; also, U. S. Department of Commerce, ureau of the Census,

1973.

        5For the United States between 1869 and 1955, for example, the net

capital stock per member of labor force is estimated to have grown at least 14

percent per decade, according to Kuznets, 1971, pp. 64—67. (This covers not

only the very large component of business plant and equipment, but also

housing, inventories, and claims aqainst foreign countries.)

           6For a discerning discussion of the nature and working of this process,

see Felirier, 1956, esp. chs, 4 and 8.

           7me above characterizations apply broadly to most of the principal con-

tributors to the literature on business cycles in the period between the 1890s

and the 1930s: Pugan—Baranovskii, Bouniatian, talion, Pigou, Hawtrey,

Robertson, Mitchell, Spiethoff, Schumpeter, and Hayek. For a review and

references, see Haberler, 1937 (new fifth edition, 1964).

           8Schumpeter (1939, vol. I, pp. 224—225) refers to Mitchell and Spiethoff

as havinq a !strong aversion to admitting that we may speak of cycles

before the end of the eiqhteenth century, while others, historians among them,

do not hesitate to go far beyond that.

          91n addition to these aggregate characteristics, the annals also provide

brief references to conditions in the main industries, markets, or sectors of

each economy in year.

          12Eckler, 1933, and Gilbert, 1933, omit the 1918—19 contraction; Axe—
Houghton, 1931; Hubbard, 1936; and Ayres, 1939, omit the 1926—27 contraction.
See Burns and Mitchell, 1947, Table 27 and text, pp. 107—110, for a comparison

of the NBER with these and two other independently compiled chronologies

(Kitchin, 1923, and Persons, 1931). The available data indicate that 1918—19

is appropriately viewed as a sui generis end—of—the—war recession along with

the similar short 1945 episode. The 1926—27 recession is marginal but also

supported by the preponderance of the evidence. See also Zarnowitz, 1981, p.

504.

      3See Burns and Mitchell, 1946, Chart 10 and text, pp 111—113, for the

check provided by the "standard pattern of short—term fluctuations in Pinerican

business activity" from Frickey, 1942. Also see Zarnowitz, 1981, Tables 3 and

4 and text, pp. 494—504, for comparisons with several indexes of trade and

industrial activity and deflated bank clearings.

     14The German contraction 8/1903—2/1905 is acknowledged to be "dubious,"

the French dates in the 1860s and 1870s, and also after 1932, to be in need of

careful reexamination.

     15Matthews (1959, pp. 215—226) stresses the longer cycles of 7—10 years'

duration, especially for Great Britain. Friedman and Schwartz (1982, p. 74)

omit the 1901 trough and the 1903 peak recognized in the NBER chronology for

Britain. In his German chronology published in 1955, Spiethoff, 1955, skips

the contraction of 1903—04 about which Burns and Mitchell had some doubts of

their own (on German chronologies, see Bry, 1960, App. B, pp. 474—480). These

authors concentrate on the characterization of annual data.

     16The pre—World War II monthly NBER chronoloqies presented in Table 3

include the cycles through the 1938 troughs, for the United States and other

countries. But a new epoch in the U.S. economic history and policy opened after

the traumatic experience of the Great Contraction in 1929—33, and we find it

instructive to cover in Table 5 all subsequent reference dates and durations.

(Note that, therefore, the individual dates for the 1933—37-38 cycle are

included in both tables.)

     17The National Bureau sources for the successive U. S. reference dates in

the post—World War II period are: Moore, 1961, vol. I, pp. 104—105 (through

1958)' NBER Annual Reports for 1961 (Moore, pp. 38—41), and 1962 (Moore, pp. 65—

66); supplement to National Bureau Report 8, May 1971 (Fabricant); NBER Annual

developments, which shows in detail how the chronology for this period was

United States are identified by the National Bureau's Committee on Businss Cycle

 Zarnowitz, 1981, Table 4, p. 500, based on NBER files. Number of series
 covered: Column 1, 17—18 (before 1879, 8 or fewer); column 2, 15—28 (before
 1879, 11 or fewer); column 3, 32—46 (before 1879, 19 or fewer).

      aldentified by years of turning points in the NBER monthly reference
 chronology (Table 3).

     blncludes 10 indexes of general business activity, 4 series on orders for
investment goods, 2 on production, and 2 on foreign trade. For detail, see
Burns and Mitchell, 1946, Table 21, pp. 98—99.

     Clncludes 9 indexes of general or wholesale prices, 6 series on wholesale
•prices for individual commodities, 9 series on volume of trade, prices, and
yields in money and security markets, and 4 series on business failures. See
ibid.

        dlncludes the 46 series in the groups in notes b and c.

     esince 1879, the figures are averages based on three seasonally and trend—
adjusted indexes: xnerican Telephone and Telegraph Company index of business
activity, index of industrial production and trade constructed by Warren M.
Persons and continued by the Barron's Publishing Company, and Ayres' index of
business activity compiled by the Cleveland Trust Company. Before 1879, the
entries are for Ayres' index alone. The rise from the specific cycle trough to
specific cycle peak in each index is taken as a percentage of the average level
of the index during the full specific cycle (trough to trough), and the fall
from specific peak to specific trough is taken as a percentage of the same
base. The amplitude measures are ranked from smallest (1) to largest (20).
Because the indexes are trend—adjusted, the contraction amplitudes are
approximately the same, on average, as the expansion amplitudes.

     The indexes, adjusted for seasonal variations but not for trends, are:
(1) Bank clearings (1875—1918) and bank debits (1919—30). NBER     data (Macaulay,
1938, Table 30, pp. A289—A296) deflated by     Carl Snyder's index of general price
level; (2) Axe—Houqhton index of trade and     industrial activity (1879—1929) furn-
ished by P. W. Axe and Co., New York; (3) Babson index of physical volume of
business activity (1889—1929) furnished by Babson's Reports Inc.; (4) American
Telephone & Telegraph Co. (1899—1929), Chief Statistician's Division (a
confidential release, Sept. 6, 1944). 'or details, see Zarnowitz, 1981, pp.
499—502.

            expansions and contractions are divided into four groups according
to the ranks recorded in column 4: the mildest ones (ranks 1—5), the most
vigorous or severe (ranks 16—20), and two intermediate groups. The entries are
simple arithmetic means of the corresponding figures in the columns above.

     hThese expansions and contractions are divided into three groups according
to the ranks recorded in column 5: the mildest ones (ranks 1—5), the intermed-
iate (ranks 6—10), and the most vigorous or severe (ranks 11—15 for expansions,
11—14 for contractions). The entries are simple arithmetic means of the corre-
sponding figures in the columns above.

For each country, the lines connect the dates of business cycle peaks (upper turning points) and
troughs (lower turning points). Thus the upward-sloping segments of each country line represent
expansions; the downward-sloping segments, contractions. The dashed links ( ) between the
country lines connect the matched peaks or troughs for two or more countries. The sign "x"
denotes an unmatched turn.

     For France before 1865 and for Germany before 1879, the reference dates are annual. They
are plotted at mid—point of the given calendar year and connected with (—.-.)   lines.   All other
reference dates are monthly and they are connected with solid(   ) lines.

     German annual turning points 1855-1963 estimated from Waither G. Hoffman, 1965, by W. W.
Rostow, 1980, pp. 38—39. All other dates are from Burns and Mitchell, 1946, pp. 78—79.
