                                        ABSTRACT

We provide levels of, compositions of, and inequalities in household augmented wealth – defined
as the sum of net worth and pension wealth – for two countries: the United States and Germany.
Pension wealth makes up a considerable portion of household wealth: about 48% in the United
States and 61%in Germany. The higher share in Germany narrows the wealth gap between the
two countries: While average net worth in the United States (US$337,000 in 2013) is about 1.8
times higher than in Germany, augmented wealth (US$651,000) is only 1.4 times higher. Further,
the inclusion of pension wealth in household wealth reduces the Gini coefficient from 0.892 to
0.701 in the United States and from 0.765 to 0.511 in Germany.

1 Introduction
Economists argue that the recent rise in inequality in many advanced economies is one of the
most serious problems facing the world today (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012, Ostry et al. 2014,
Stiglitz 2012). This is for economic, societal, as well as political reasons. Economically, high
inequality may harm the economy because credit rationing prevents the poor from investing in
education and weakens innovations. Societally, high inequality may reduce social cohesion
because people are less likely to trust each other and, therefore, reduce their community
involvement. Politically, high inequality may lead to the emergence of economic elites who use
their power to (re)shape the political system and engage in rent-seeking activities, further
widening the economic and social disparities.
Most of the academic, political, and public debates have focused on inequalities in income,
addressing the inter-temporal evolution of income inequality, differences across countries, the
redistributive effects of tax-benefit systems, income concentration at the top of the
distribution, the causes and driving forces behind income inequalities, and related issues.
Wealth inequalities, on the other hand, have received much less attention, and rigorous cross-
country comparisons based on comparable data are scarce. 1 This is not for lack of interest:
what is lacking are data. A recent data initiative by the European Central Bank aims at closing
the data gap with its Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS; see Eurosystem (2009,
2013) for an introduction), which has opened up new opportunities for empirical research. 2
Most empirical analyses of wealth inequalities to date focus on four wealth aggregates: real
assets, financial assets, debts, and the difference between assets and debts, net worth.
Differences in levels of and inequalities in these aggregates miss an important component of
household wealth positions: pension wealth, the discounted expected present value of future
entitlements from public, occupational, and private pension schemes. Considering pension
wealth is important because households in different countries make private savings decisions
conditional on the country-specific characteristics of pension institutions: their coverage,

  Recent HFCS-based comparative wealth studies are Kaas et al. (2015) and Cowell et al. (2016).

                                                        2
generosity, (expected future) financial stability, etc. In particular, many empirical studies find
that (public) pension wealth serves as a substitute for other forms of private savings. 3 Higher
net worth in a country A than in country B may indicate higher propensities to consume in the
former. Yet if pension institutions are more generous in the latter, the opposite may be true.
A comprehensive measure that considers pension wealth in addition to real and financial assets
is augmented wealth (Wolff, 2015a, Wolff, 2015b; Bönke et al., 2016). Pension wealth is a
substitute for other assets, as it a source of future income but not a perfect substitute: It is not
under the direct control of the insurant and cannot be marketed directly (see Wolff, 2015b).
As far as we are aware, this study represents the first systematic “head-to-head” comparison of
household net worth, pension wealth (including survivor pensions), and augmented wealth for
two countries, the United States and Germany. The comparison relies on a harmonized
database constructed from recent waves of the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and the
Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP), 4 and encompasses both the retired and non-retired population.
Our empirical analysis addresses the following dimensions: (a) wealth levels and composition;
(b) wealth inequalities (including an inequality comparison by sources); and (c) age trajectories
of wealth accumulation.
Our results are as follows: The inclusion of pension wealth adds about 48% to average net
worth in the United States and 61% in Germany. This reduces the wealth gap between the two
countries: While the ratio of average net worth is about 1.8 in favor of the United States
(average for United States: US$337,000; Germany: US$182,000), it is considerably lower, 1.4,
for augmented wealth (average for United States: US$651,000; Germany: US$473,000). The
addition of pension wealth also reduces measured wealth inequalities: In the United States, the
Gini coefficient drops from 0.892 for net worth to 0.701 for augmented wealth; in Germany
from 0.765 to 0.511.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief review of the
empirical literature on augmented wealth. Section 3 discusses relevant aspects of the pension

  The crucial challenge of such a comparison is the lack of information on (public) pension wealth in standard
wealth databases as the Luxembourg Wealth Study (see Sierminska et al., 2006) or the European Central Bank
(Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey, HFCS).

the empirical analysis. Section 5 presents comparative results on German and US wealth
distributions. Concluding remarks are given in Section 6.



2 Literature review on studies of augmented wealth
The role of social security systems in individual and household decisions has received
considerable attention in economic research focusing on the interplay between social security
and private wealth (e.g., levels and compositions of individual and household wealth
portfolios), wealth accumulation (crowding-in or crowding-out effects of social security), and
retirement decisions. Case studies that explicitly address social security wealth in analyses of
private wealth and portfolio compositions, all for the United States, are Moffitt (1984),
Gustman et al. (1997), Gustman et al. (2011) and Wolff (2014). The role of social security in
private savings decisions and wealth accumulation has been addressed empirically, for
example, in Boyle and Murray (1979) and Dicks-Mireaux and King (1984) for Canada, Leimer
and Lesnoy (1982), Gullason et al. (1993) and Kennickel and Suden (1997) for the United States,
and Börsch-Supan et al. (2008) for Germany.
The empirical literature on wealth inequalities that explicitly addresses social security wealth in
a broad concept of (augmented) wealth is very limited, and cross-country comparisons based
on harmonized data are scarce. The first study in this vein, by Wolff and Marley (1989), uses
data from 1962 to 1983 to study inter-temporal changes in the level of concentration at the top
of the US wealth distribution, thus explicitly investigating the role of expected social security
wealth. Since their pioneering work, wealth inequalities and the role of social security wealth
have been empirically addressed in a number of case studies. For the United States, Jianakoplos
and Menchnik (1997) study the evolution of wealth mobility at a mean age of 45-49 by looking
at transitions across quintiles using data from 1966 and 1981. Wolff (2005) focuses on the
inequality-reducing effect if retirement wealth is considered as another component of
household wealth (in addition to net worth wealth) before and after a major retirement reform
in the United States that meant a considerable decline in traditional defined benefit pension
plans and rise in defined contribution pensions. Wolff (2014) investigates wealth trends from

                                                4
1989 to 2010 by comparing wealth levels, and inequality for different wealth aggregates,
namely net worth, private pension wealth, social security pension wealth, and finally
augmented wealth.
For Canada, Shamsuddin (2001) shows that social security wealth constitutes 47% of
augmented wealth and that its inclusion in household wealth leads to a marked decline in
wealth inequalities. Mazzaferro and Toso (2005) use six cross-sections of the Bank of Italy
Survey of Income and Wealth to investigate the composition and distribution of augmented
wealth in Italy over the period 1991 to 2002. Roine and Waldenström (2009) study the wealth
concentration in Sweden over 130 years up to the present using estate and wealth tax data,
foreign and domestic family firm wealth, and pension wealth estimates since 1978.
Using Finnish survey and pension register data from 2004, Maunu (2010) studies how the
inclusion of pension wealth alters the wealth distribution, considering the non-retired
population over 44 years of age. Comparable papers for Germany that also combine survey and
administrative data and address the inequality-reducing effect of including pension wealth in
standard wealth measures are Frick and Grabka (2010) and (2013).
Perhaps the closest paper to ours is that of Bönke et al. (2016), who quantify levels and
distributions of net worth and an augmented wealth concept that also considers individual
pension entitlements from the three pillars of the German pension system (social security,
occupational, and private pensions). In contrast to Frick and Grabka (2010, 2013), Bönke et al.
(2016) rely exclusively on survey data – the German SOEP – to show that pension wealth is an
important component of individual wealth in Germany and that its inclusion in the individual
wealth distribution implies a sizeable reduction in measured inequality.
We build on the methods outlined in Bönke et al. (2016), which built on the previous literature
by providing: (a) a nationwide analysis of wealth inequalities that is not restricted to particular
sub-populations (e.g., the retired or married couples); (b) a comprehensive analysis of
household portfolios and an inequality decomposition of augmented wealth by wealth
aggregates; (c) the computation of pension wealth using the accrual value. The accrual method
is advantageous to the ongoing concern treatment as it requires less information on future




                                                5
labor force participation, income levels, and retirement decisions, and, like net worth, reflects
the current (not future potential) level of material well-being.
The present paper differs from Bönke et al. (2016) in several respects. First, our paper is
comparative: Building on harmonized data and comparable wealth concepts, we investigate
standard and augmented wealth distributions for two countries with rather different social
security systems: Germany and the United States. To our knowledge, only two papers to date
have provided a comparative analysis of augmented wealth: Wolff (1996) for the United States5
and Canada, and Frick and Headey (2009) for Australia and Germany. 6 Second, Bönke et al.
(2016) provide wealth figures at the individual level, whereas we provide these figures at the
household level. The household-level concept reflects that households usually pool resources. 7
Measuring a household's expected pension entitlements requires the assumption that the
household members do not separate their resources later in life.
Third, our pension wealth measure is broader than that in Bönke et al. (2016), as we also
incorporate actual and expected survivor pension entitlements. To our knowledge, this is a
unique feature of the present work compared to all previous studies on wealth inequalities.



3 Pension institutions in the United States and Germany
Both pension systems in the United States and Germany are comprised of a social security, an
occupational (including a government employee pension scheme), and a private component.
Beyond this common feature, the two countries’ systems differ markedly with respect to
generosity, coverage, attainment of entitlements, type of financing, etc. Below we provide a
short description of the pension institutions in both countries.

  Wolff (1996) gives empirical estimates of the share of augmented wealth in the United States and United
Kingdom for the richest 1% at three points in time (1972, 1976, 1981), but not a description of the entire wealth
distribution.

  The study by Frick and Headey (2009) considers the retired population only.

  For a discussion of the comparative advantages of wealth measurement at the household and individual level,
see also Bönke et al. (2016). In the Survey of Consumer Finances, the observation unit is the household, and
individual-level wealth holdings are not reported.

3.1 Pensions in the United States
3.1.1 Social security pensions

Social security pensions in the United States are strictly earnings-related and mandatory for
employees. The retirement (or “old age”) benefit is determined by formula. The system has the
following three key features: First, coverage is assigned based on whether the individual
expects to receive a social security pension and on whether the individual was salaried or self-
employed. In 2013, 98% of all workers were eligible for a social security pension. Second, the
person’s Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) is computed on the basis of his or her
earnings history. Rules in 2013 stipulated that for eligibility, a worker must work a minimum of
40 quarters at a minimum earnings level in a covered job. The worker’s AIME is then based on
the highest 140 quarters of earnings over the lifetime of the worker. Third, the person’s Primary
Insurance Amount (PIA) is derived from AIME.
In contrast to Germany, the formula is redistributive in that lower-earning workers receive a
higher percentage of their AIME in the computation of their PIA than higher-earning workers.
For example, for 2014, the PIA is calculated by taking 90% of AIME under US$816, 32% of AIME
between US$816 and US$4,917, and 15% of AIME greater than US$4,917.8
The survivor benefit applies only to married couples. This is determined by the higher of two
values: (1) the deceased spouse’s PIA and (2) the individual’s own PIA. The spousal benefit
likewise applies only to married couples. It is determined by the higher of (1) 50% of the
spouse’s PIA and (2) the individual’s own PIA. For the survivor benefit, there are three
possibilities:
1. One spouse (say the husband) worked over his lifetime but the wife did not. Then, the
    survivor benefit for the wife is equal to the husband’s benefit.
2. Both spouses worked but the wife earned less than the husband. When the husband dies,
    the wife’s survivor benefit is set equal to the husband’s benefit. If there were no survivor
    benefit, the wife would be entitled to her own PIA. So the true value of the survivor benefit

8
  There is a minimum social security pension benefit established by law. The disability benefit is determined in
exactly the same way as the social security pension retirement benefit. The worker’s AIME is computed up to the
time of disability and this value is then converted into the corresponding PIA amount using the same formula as for
the retirement benefit.

                                                        7
    in this case (and the one we use) is equal to the difference between the husband’s benefit
    and the wife’s own PIA.
3. Both spouses work but the wife has a higher PIA than the husband. When the husband dies,
    the wife effectively receives no survivor benefit since she is already entitled to her own PIA.

3.1.2 Occupational and private pension schemes

Occupational pension plans are either defined benefit (DB) or defined contribution pension
schemes (DC). Pensions for government employees (federal, state, or local) are in principle a
special form of occupational pensions. 9
Defined contribution plans are the dominant form of occupational pension plans in the private
sector. In 2010, almost 60% of those between 47 and 64 years of age held DC pension plans as
opposed to 30% DB pension plans (Wolff 2014). They are employer-sponsored with an individual
account for each participant, and contributions may stem from employee salary deferrals,
employer contributions, or employer matching contributions (Internal Revenue Code Section
414/415). Examples of occupational pension plans are employer-sponsored 401(k) and profit-
sharing plans, most of which enjoy tax-favored treatment.
Defined benefit plans define the payment received upon retirement and encompass all pension
plans that are not defined contribution and therefore do not have individual accounts (hence
including hybrid pension plans such as cash balance plans and pension equity plans). Typically,
DB plans offered by large employers are final average pay plans. In this case, the monthly benefit
is equal to the number of years worked multiplied by the member's salary at retirement
multiplied by a factor known as the accrual rate. For unmarried participants, benefits are usually
payable as a Single Life Annuity (SLA); married participants receive a Qualified Joint and Survivor
Annuity (QJSA).
Pure private pension plans may be either DC or DB pension plans. Typical examples are Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs), Keogh or HR10 plans, solo 401(k) plans and Roth IRAs. These are



9
 Government employees are usually eligible for civil servant pensions (also known as Public Employee Retirement
Systems, PERS). The majority of these are defined benefit pension plans, but some local governments offer defined
contribution pension plans. Entitlement calculation in principle follows the basic rules used for occupational DB
pension schemes.

                                                       8
retirement plans mainly for the self-employed or small businesses. As it is the case for IRAs or
401(k) plans, the funds can be invested in stocks, bonds, mutual fund, etc.

3.2.3 Generosity of pensions in the United States

Table 1a shows a breakdown of the number of recipients and median pension amounts in 2014
for individuals aged 65 and older. According to the US Social Security Administration, almost 46
million individuals receive social security benefits with a median monthly pension of US$1,480.10
Employer pensions also play an important role. Roughly 44% of the elderly receive employer
pensions. Here, one can differentiate between government employee pensions and private
pensions. More than 5.3 million individuals receive the former, and the median monthly amount
is US$1,453. More than 15% of the elderly have pension claims from a government pension
scheme. Roughly 13 million receive private pensions and annuities with a median monthly
amount of US$833. However, these figures are not divided into DC and DB pension plans.11

3.2 Pensions in Germany
3.2.1 Statutory social security pensions

Mandatory statutory pension scheme for dependent employees
In 2014, about 78% (or 36.1 million) of the German working-age population (20-65 years) are
insured through the social security pension scheme, the “statutory pension insurance”
(Gesetzliche Rentenversicherung) (DRV-Bund 2015). An individual is vested in their pension plan
after having contributed for five years, or 60 months. 12 Most importantly for the determination
of statutory pension entitlements is the “equivalence principle,” which establishes a close
relation between the sum of earnings subject to compulsory insurance during working life and
pension entitlement after retirement.13 Several types of statutory pensions are granted to
insurants, with regular old-age pensions and pensions for the long-term insured being the most
frequent types.14
Besides the pension of the insurant, survivor pensions are granted to widows, widowers, and
orphans. 15 The level of a widow(er) pension depends on the actual pension of the deceased
partner as well as the financial situation of the widow(er). 16 Widow(er) pensions in the
statutory pension scheme for dependent employees are determined based on the following
basic rules:

12
     The legal framework is Book 6 of the Social Security Code (SSC VI). According to §§ 50-53 SSC VI, the social
security pension scheme encompasses several specific sub-schemes for special occupational groups, including the
miners’ association (Knappschaft), seamen’s insurance association (Seekasse), and the agriculture pension scheme
(Landwirtschaftliche Alterskasse).
13
     The actual pension entitlement is defined by the “pension formula” detailed in SSC VI, Section 4. Pension
entitlements may also be accrued during non-contribution periods: (i) sickness, rehabilitation, studies or higher
education, etc. (Anrechnungszeiten); (ii) military service or detention due to political reasons (Ersatzzeiten); and
(iii) child-raising or care for family members (Beruecksichtigungszeiten).
14
     Other pension types include reduced-earnings capacity pensions, pensions for the long-term unemployed,
disability pensions, and special pensions for women. For further details on the statutory pension insurance in
Germany, see Bönke et al. (2016).
15
    In 2012, about 4.78 million widow pensions and 0.574 million widower pensions were granted (BMAS 2012a).
16
     We assume that the surviving partner is entitled to a “large” widow(er) pension (see above). The widow(er)
pension is reduced if the surviving partner has his or her own income. If her/his net income exceeds a monthly
basic allowance of € 803.88 in Germany’s “old” (former West German) and € 756.62 in its “new” (former East
German) states in 2016, the survivor pension is reduced by 40% of the difference between the net income of the
surviving partner and the allowance.

1. The marriage must have lasted for at least 12 months.
2. A widow(er) pension is granted if the deceased partner was insured for at least five years.
3. A “large” widower pension is granted if the widow(er) is age 47 or above, has a reduced
     earnings capacity, or if children below age 18 are living in the household. A “small”
     widow(er) pension is a temporary transfer for a widow(er) of working age.

Entitlements from compulsory pension schemes of liberal professional associations
The liberal professions 17 are not covered by the mandatory statutory pension scheme for
dependent employees but by 85 independent pension schemes, each of which have their own,
highly individual rules. In 2014, about 1.4 million persons had entitlements from the liberal
professions pension scheme (ABV 2016). Like the mandatory statutory pension scheme, this
scheme provides old-age pensions, disability benefits, and survivors’ benefits.

3.2.2 Occupational and private pension schemes

Occupational pension schemes are granted by a company to its employees, and comprise both
DB and DC pensions, with highly individual contributions and benefit rules. 18 About 56% (14.1
out of 25 million) of compulsorily insured employees aged 25 to 65 in 2011 were covered under
these schemes (BMAS 2012b). The basic regulations pertaining to survivor pensions in
occupational pension plans 19 are very similar to those in the statutory pension plans for
employees. In line with the rules of the statutory pension system for employees, the widow(er)
pension is reduced if the surviving partner has his or her own income.
The mandatory pension scheme for civil servants is unique to the German system. Civil servant
pensions fall into the category of DB schemes, and for consistency with the US pension system,
we assign them to the category of occupational pension plans. In the spirit of the equivalence
principle, civil servant pensions primarily depend on the overall tenure and average salaries in
the last position that a civil servant held for at least two years. In 2011, roughly 2.9 million

17
   Members of special professional associations (Berufskammern) are, e.g., architects, chartered accountants,
dentists, lawyers, notaries, pharmacists, physicians, and psychological psychotherapists.
18
   There exist at least five different company pension plans in Germany, starting with direct benefit plans, support
funds (Unterstützungskasse), direct insurance (Direktversicherung), staff pension funds (Pensionskasse), and
pension funds (Pensionsfonds), each with slightly different financing rules and benefit levels.
19
   Due to data limitations and for reasons of consistency, we again refrain from modeling orphan pensions.

                                                        11
persons had entitlements from the civil servant pension scheme. For each year of full-time
service, a civil servant collects 0.0179375 replacement points, with the regular maximum
replacement rate being limited to 0.7175. The annual pension entitlement for civil servants is
the product of the replacement rate times the average annual salary. 20 Survivor pensions by
and large follow the basic rules for social security pensions (for further details, see appendix).
Private pension savings plans in Germany are comprised not only of standard non-subsidized
life insurance and related types of financial products but most importantly of subsidized private
pension plans. For the latter, financial aid and tax subsidies are granted to encourage private
saving for retirement purposes. In 2002, the “Riester” and 2005 the “Rürup” pension saving
programs were introduced, which in principle follow the same logic as the IRA or 401k in the
United States. About 15 million people have signed a Riester pension contract, and another
approximately 2 million a Rürup pension contract.

3.2.3 Generosity of the German pension system

For the retired population aged 65 or older, average monthly pensions vary widely in Germany.
By far the most important scheme is the statutory pension insurance, which covers 90% of the
retired population and grants, on average, a gross monthly payment of US$1,197 (Table 1). In
contrast, only 5% of the population is entitled to civil servant pensions, with a mean value of
US$3,649. One key reason for the higher average pension levels of civil servants is that they
usually have a fairly uninterrupted work history, without unemployment spells, as well as
higher educational qualifications. Additionally, the replacement rates under the civil servant
pension scheme are more generous than under the statutory pension scheme. Retirees who are
covered by one of the liberal profession schemes also enjoy a relatively high monthly pension,
about US$2,877 on average. Company pensions are employer-dependent and complement the
statutory pensions. Thus, company pensions are, on average, considerably smaller than
pensions in the other schemes. One can differentiate between company pensions in the private
and public sector. In the private sector, the mean pension amounts to about US$660, and 15%



20
  If an individual receives a civil servant pension in addition to a statutory pension, particular deduction rules
apply.

                                                       12
of the retired population have an entitlement; in the public sector, the respective share is 10%
and the monthly pension amounts to US$424.
Table 1b also provides information about survivor pensions for females 65 years and older.
Again, the majority of female survivor pensioners receive pension from the statutory pension
insurance, with a mean gross amount of US$949/month. Similarly to the above findings, the
highest pension is granted under the civil servant pension system to survivors, with a mean
pension of US$1,916. The incidence and average level of survivor pensions from the other
systems are noticeably lower.

4 Data and definitions of wealth aggregates

4.1 German and US data sources
The database used in the present study for Germany is the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) study.
SOEP is an ongoing longitudinal survey of approximately 21,000 adult respondents, conducted
annually since 1984 (see Wagner et al., 2007). SOEP consists of a number of sub-samples,
including several random samples (drawn in different survey years) and also migrant and high-
income samples. Information about private wealth was surveyed four times, in 1988, 2002, 2007,

                                                      13
and 2012. 21 In contrast to other wealth surveys, the SOEP asks each adult respondent to provide
information about her/his individual assets and debts. 22 However, the individual wealth
information is aggregated in the present study at the household level to obtain information
comparable to that surveyed in the SCF. 23
Our computations rely on SOEP respondents in private households who participated in the 2012
and 2013 waves and who were aged 18 or older in 2013. The two-year participation restriction is
imposed because standard wealth variables are collected every five years, most recently in the
2012 wave (with asset values for the interview month), while current pension entitlements were
collected in 2013 (retrospectively for the previous year). We exclude observations lacking valid
information. 24 This leaves a sample of 8,546 households, representing a total weighted number
of about 38.7 million households.


The data source for the United States is the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) conducted
by the Federal Reserve Board. Each survey consists of a core representative household sample
combined with a high-income supplement (for more information about the sampling process,
see Kennickell, 2008). The population used in the analysis consists of individuals at least 18
years of age in 2013, and all wealth information refers to 2013.

4.2 Comparability of data sources
An important difference between the SCF and SOEP is the over-sampling of top wealth holders
in SCF and high-income households in SOEP. Since net income does not correlate perfectly with
wealth, and the income threshold is relatively low, we would expect that the SCF better
describes the wealth distribution at the very top.

21
   Real and financial assets include property wealth, financial assets, business assets, private pension entitlements,
building-loan contracts, collectables, and outstanding debt (from property or consumer credits). See, for
documentation of the SOEP wealth information, Grabka and Westermeier (2015).
22
    A potential benefit of surveying wealth information at the individual level is higher accuracy compared to
surveys that rely exclusively on the answers of the reference person. This is particularly true for multi-person
households. A potential drawback of the individual approach is the higher probability of non-response.
23
   Wealth held by children is not surveyed in SOEP, but it can be assumed that this has only a negligible impact on
overall wealth levels and inequality.
24
   In particular, we exclude Sample M (the migration sample) and Sample K, as respondents in these samples did
not provide information on wealth in 2012. Additionally, we exclude all observations with individual weighting
factors of zero. An appropriate weighting scheme is available in SOEP to account for these exclusions.

                                                         14
In contrast to SOEP, the SCF makes use of specially edited individual income tax returns
developed by the Statistics of Income Division (SOI) to over-sample wealthy households. This is
known as the “list sample”. In a first stage, observations in areas selected for the first stage of
the area probability sample are selected, while in a second stage, the remaining cases are
stratified using a model of wealth conditional on the variables in the SOI data. As a result, about
98% of the entire SCF sample with at least US$5 million of net worth in 2004 consists of
observations from the list sample (see Kennickell, 2008).
The different oversampling strategies have implications for the composition of the two samples
at the very top of the wealth distribution. There was no household observed in SOEP in 2012
beyond a threshold of US$50 million. However, billionaires also live in Germany, as
documented by the Forbes List. In SCF, 216 households hold more than 50 million US$, and the
wealthiest household holds a net worth of more than US$1.3 billion. This evidence supports our
expectation above that SCF better describes the top wealth percentiles than SOEP. This might
contribute to higher measured levels of and inequalities in wealth in the United States
compared to Germany.
To get an impression of what the different sampling strategies imply for our results, Figure 1
shows the sensitivity of the inequality indices, the Gini and the half-squared coefficient of
variation (GE2), to different trimming thresholds for net worth. The thresholds range from the
99.9th to the 99.0th percentile. For the Gini coefficient, the effects of different trimming
thresholds are minor. For GE2, which is sensitive to changes at the top, particularly the
trimming at the 99.9th percentile has a strong downward effect in the United States. At lower
thresholds, the effect disappears. Irrespective of the threshold, observed inequalities are
always higher in the United States. Based on this evidence, we decided to apply a trimming
threshold of the 99.9th percentile based on the country-specific distributions of net worth (see
also Figure A1 for the effect of trimming on mean and maxima of net worth).

4.3 Definitions of wealth aggregates
Our empirical analysis focuses mainly on four wealth aggregates: net worth, social security
pension wealth, private pension wealth (occupational, civil servant, and private pensions), and
augmented wealth.
We define net worth (w10) as the current value of all marketable or fungible assets (total gross
wealth) excluding the value of private pension plans minus current value of debts and without
private pension plans. Private pension wealth is considered separately. Total gross wealth (w6)
is the sum of owner-occupied property (w1); other real estate (w2); tangible assets (w3);
business assets (w4); financial assets plus building society savings agreements (w5). Total debt
is the sum of: mortgage debts for owner-occupied property (w7) or other real estate (w8); and
consumer debts (w9). 25 Pension wealth (w14) is the sum of social security pension wealth
(w12), and occupational pensions (including civil servant pensions)26 and the value of private
pension wealth (w13). Finally, augmented wealth (w15) is the sum of net worth and pension
wealth. Table 2 provides a summary of the definitions.

25
  Credit card debts and educational loans are not explicitly surveyed in the German SOEP but are in the SCF.
26
  Unlike the SOEP, the SCF does not distinguish between defined benefit plans for public employees and those for
private employees, so the two groups are aggregated into a single group in the computation of defined benefit
pension wealth.

                                                                 16
In the empirical analysis, wealth is measured at the household level (no equalization by means
of an equivalence scale or by capita in the households) in 2013-US$and is PPP-adjusted (factor
0.7773 as provided by OECD). 27

 Note: This also includes equity in trust funds in the United States case, as well as the cash value of whole
 life insurance plus the cash value of annuities (in response to the survey question “How much would you
                                             2
 receive if you cashed in these annuities?”). The accounting scheme differs in two ways from Wolff (2015):
 First, net worth here excludes DC pension plans (the comparable variable in Wolff, 2015, is NWX). Second,
 the term “pension wealth” here refers to the sum of DB pension wealth, DC pension wealth, and also
 public pensions.




4.5 Derivation of pension wealth
Pension wealth is defined as the sum of social security pension wealth, civil servant pension
wealth, company pension wealth, and private insurance contracts, including any survivor
benefits. For particular pension components, the surrender value can be taken directly from the
data. In Germany, this is the case for private insurance contracts, in the United States, for
defined contribution (DC) plans, including Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), 401(K) plans,


27
     SOEP data from 2012 are converted to prices in 2013 with a consumer price index of 1.0015.

                                                         17
and the like. If the surrender value is not provided, we take the gross present value of future
expected pension entitlements accumulated until 2012.28 Gross means that pension
entitlements are considered before taxes and social security contributions. 29
All present values, 𝑃𝑉 𝑝 , of future pensions from a particular pension scheme, 𝑝 =
𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑦, 𝑐𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑙 𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑎𝑛𝑡, 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑦 𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠, are adjusted for real interest rates and survival
probabilities. 30 The present value is defined as,

28
   The SCF questionnaire indicates how many pension plans husband and wife hold and what the expected (or
current) pension benefit is. The SCF questionnaire also indicates whether the pension benefits remain fixed in
nominal terms over time for a particular beneficiary or are indexed for inflation. A separate computation of private
pension wealth is performed for each pension plan. For current workers, the procedure is more complex. The SCF
provides detailed information on pension coverage among current workers, including the type of plan, the
expected benefit at retirement or the formula used to determine the benefit amount (for example, a fixed
percentage of the average of the last five year’s earnings), the expected retirement age when the benefits are
effective, the likely retirement age of the worker, and vesting requirements. Information is provided not only for
each spouse’s current job (or jobs) but for up to five past jobs as well. The respondent is also asked to indicate
what his (or her) pension benefit will be, based on his or her work history to date. The accrual value of private
pension wealth is then computed for each job stated by the respondent.
29
    Augmented wealth is an aggregate of several wealth components. For the interpretation of the level and
distribution of augmented wealth, three aspects should be noted. First, financial wealth in the form of standard
monetary deposits is not subject to taxes and social security contributions in Germany. However, when converting
assets or real wealth into money, taxes may arise. The tax burden then depends on many unobserved tax-relevant
characteristics (e.g., acquisition value, speculation and holding periods). Second, the current and the liquidation
value of an insurance contract (e.g., of a life-risk insurance or private pension) may differ. This is due, for instance,
to insurance fees or repayment of tax relief or allowances (i.e., subsidized private pension plans). Third, if a wealth
aggregate is determined by the present value of a future income stream (e.g., statutory or company pension), the
future incomes are subject to social security contributions and/or taxes. We refrain from an approximation of net
present values, given that it requires numerous assumptions about the future income composition, future family
status, etc. Thus, augmented wealth is comprised of wealth components that differ with respect to tax- and social-
security burdens. This implies that, de facto, the convertibility of the different components is limited, an issue
which, for the aforementioned reasons, is not reflected in the subsequent analysis.
30
   In the case of the United States, official survival probabilities are provided by the US Center for Disease Control
(CDC) up to and including age 99. The CDC provides survival probabilities by age, gender, and race (white versus
African-American). African-American survival rates are systematically lower than the corresponding rates for
whites. We use the racial breakdown in our calculation of US pension wealth. For Germany, the mortality rates
differ by sex only. Due to lack of comparable data we only differentiate mortality rates by gender, birth year (and
region of origin).
Few papers also empirically estimate differential mortality with respect to economic variables such as income or
wealth. For studies dealing with the United States, see Chetty et al. (2016) or Attanasio and Hoynes (2000); for
Germany see von Gaudecker and Scholz (2007). These studies rely on different methods and are not comparable.
Delavande and Rohwedder (2011) undertake a comparison for both countries, but it relies on subjective
assessments of survival probabilities.

         There are important differences between the United States and Germany in widow(er)
pensions. In Germany, a widow(er) pension is granted to the surviving married partner. 32 The
central function of a widow(er) pension is to provide for the surviving partner in old age after
the death of a partner, while orphans’ pensions act as child support. In the United States, the
insurant’s partner may be eligible for his or her own pension depending on the partner’s
entitlements from retirement age onward, but no additional widow(er) pension is granted. This
has implications for the computation of expected pension values. In the United States in
general and for non-married individuals in Germany, the expected value of a type 𝑝 pension in
period 𝑡 is,
                                                  𝐼
                                           𝑝           𝑝             𝑝
                                          𝐸𝑡   = � 𝑑𝑡,𝑖 × 𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑡,𝑖 × 𝜎𝑡,𝑖,𝑔,𝑐 .                          (2)
                                                 𝑖=1
          𝑝
Here, 𝑑𝑡,𝑖 is a dummy variable with value 1 if person 𝑖 is eligible for the pension in period 𝑡,
           𝑝
𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑡,𝑖 is her pension entitlement, and 𝜎𝑡,𝑖,𝑐 is the probability that the person (gender 𝑔
from birth cohort, 𝑐) is still alive in 𝑡 (survival probability) up to age 99.
In Germany, because of widower pensions, we must differentiate the following states for
married couples: 33
1. Both partners are alive in 𝑡. Then each partner receives his/her own individual pension. The
     probability of the first state is the joint survival probability of the male (𝑚) and female
     partner (𝑓), 𝜎𝑡,𝑖,𝑚,𝑐 × 𝜎𝑡,𝑖,𝑓,𝑐 .

31
   For the impact of alternative interest rates on substantive findings, see Bönke et al. (2016), Table A1.
32
   Orphan pensions are also granted. However, our analysis deals with old-age pension entitlements, while orphan
pensions act as temporary social assistance during education.
33
   Exemplary household survival rates for Germany are provided in Figure A1.

2. The male partner is deceased but the female partner is alive. Then the male partner’s
     pension entitlements are zero and the female partner receives her own pensions plus a
     widow pension (if eligible). The probability of the second state is, (1 − 𝜎𝑡,𝑖,𝑚,𝑐 ) × 𝜎𝑡,𝑖,𝑓,𝑐 .
3. The female partner is deceased but the male partner is alive. Then the female partner’s
     pension entitlements are zero and the male partner receives his own pensions plus a
     widower pension (if eligible). The probability of the third state is, 𝜎𝑡,𝑖,𝑚,𝑐 × �1 − 𝜎𝑡,𝑖,𝑓,𝑐 �.

The above procedure for determining the present value of current pension entitlements 34 is
based on the “accrual method” (see Wolff 2015). 35 When interpreting the present values, it
should be noted that entitlements from the liberal professions pension scheme are not
included in present values for the non-retired population, but only for the retired.



5 Empirical findings
The subsequent comparative empirical analysis for the United States and Germany addresses
three aspects: the level and composition of household wealth, wealth inequalities, and age-
wealth profiles.

5.1 Wealth levels in the United States versus Germany
Table 3 provides information on different wealth aggregates for the United States and
Germany. At first glance, wealth levels differ substantially between the two countries. For net
worth, the mean value of about US$183,000 in Germany is only 54% of the mean value in the
United States, about US$337,000. The gap for median net worth, however, is much smaller, and
the median is even slightly higher in Germany: almost US$50,000 compared to US$40,000 in
the United States. For the 75th percentile, we find a similar result: a small difference in favor of
German households (about US$231,000 versus US$200,000 in the United States). In both

34
   Current entitlements are based on the biography until today. They do not include projected entitlements
credited for employment periods in the future.
35
   The figures reported in Wolff (2015) rely mainly on the conventional “on-going concern” treatment. It is
assumed in this that employees continue to work at their place of employment until their expected date of
retirement. The value of pension wealth is estimated as of the date of expected retirement.


                                                     20
countries, net worth for the 25th percentile is zero. These numbers suggest that net worth in
the United States is more concentrated at the top of the distribution. It is not entirely clear to
what extent the higher concentration is driven by the oversampling of top wealth holders in the
SCF and/or the underrepresentation of high net worth individuals in SOEP (see Westermeier
and Grabka, 2015).
We decompose pension wealth into two components: social security and the sum of
occupational and private pension wealth. Due to the compulsory nature of social security
pension contributions in both countries, about 95% of the total population holds social security
pension wealth. In Germany, average social security pension wealth amounts to about
US$200,000, which is 25% higher than the value in the United States, about US$161,000. Social
security wealth can be divided further into own entitlements and wealth from survivor benefits.
As expected, in both countries, about 90% of total social security wealth comes from own
entitlements.
In both countries, about 60% of the population has entitlements from occupational and private
pension schemes. However, mean values are 1.7 times higher in the United States, at
US$153,000 compared to only US$90,000 in Germany.
There is also a substantial gap in levels for augmented wealth: The average US household
possesses about US$650,000, and thus 1.4 times the wealth of an average German household
(about US$473,000). This difference is mainly driven by the higher net worth of US households
that belong to the top of the augmented wealth distribution. Up to the 75th percentile,
households in Germany possess larger assets. For example, the 25th percentile value of
augmented wealth is about US$149,000 versus US$86,000 in the United States.36




Table 3. Basic descriptive statistics by wealth aggregate

36
   There is no standard convention for whether wealth should be measured using equivalent weights. In this study,
we implicitly assume an equivalence weight of 0. However, an alternative procedure is to apply an equivalence
weight of 1 (= household size). Basic descriptive statistics and inequality figures by wealth aggregate are provided
in Table A3 and Table A4.

Details on household portfolios including different kinds of debt are detailed in Table 4. The
table is subdivided into three panels. The top panel provides the composition of household
total gross wealth. The second panel provides the composition of household debt. The third
panel provides debt-to-wealth and debt-to-income ratios.
        With regard to the composition of household total gross wealth, the most important
difference between the two countries pertains to owner-occupied property. In Germany, this


                                                   22
wealth component contributes nearly 60% to total gross wealth, and only about 40% in the
United States. Important differences also relate to the relative contributions of business assets
and also to financial assets and building society savings agreements. Business assets contribute
only about 7% to total gross wealth in Germany and almost 19% in the United States. For
financial assets and building society savings agreements, the respective numbers are 28% in the
United States and 17% in Germany.
       Concerning debt, total household debts in the United States is, at about US$91,000 on
average, 2.5 times higher than in Germany (US$36,000). Mortgage debt on owner-occupied
property makes up the largest relative portion in both countries: 74% in the United States and
61% in Germany. Debt ratios in the United States are also higher than in Germany, with respect
to both income and net worth (see panel 3 of Table 4). While the total debt-to-net-worth ratio
is seven percentage points higher in the United States, the total debt-to-income ratio for the
United States exceeds Germany’s ratio by almost 75%. Thus, indebtedness is higher in the
United States across all age groups (Table A2b) and all wealth and income classes (Tables A3b
and A4b). In the United States, the lower quintiles of the income and wealth distribution in
particular have much higher debt ratios. While in Germany, it is middle-aged households (in the
34 to 45-year-old age range) that exhibit the highest debt ratios (typically due to the purchase
of real estate), in the United States it is the young, who typically have high consumer credits
and/or student loans. The willingness to go into debt is much more common in the United
States, and access to credit markets (probably with fewer constraints) appears to be easier
there than in Germany.

Table 5 provides the distribution of wealth aggregates by net worth deciles (columns 1-4): net
worth, occupational and private and social security pension wealth, as well as augmented
wealth. Further, columns 5-7 provide the relative contributions of the respective wealth
components to augmented wealth in the respective net worth decile.
Regarding net worth, the table confirms and sheds further light on the higher wealth
concentration among households in the United States: Up to the eighth decile, net worth is
slightly higher in Germany than in the United States. For the top decile, however, mean wealth
is markedly higher in the United States: US$2.6 million versus US$1 million in Germany.

to the ninth decile social security pension wealth is US$30,000 to US$60,000 higher in Germany
than in the US, indicating the higher generosity of the pension scheme in Germany at least for
the majority of the population. Only for the top decile does social security pension wealth in the
US outperform the one in Germany.


The mean values for occupational and private pension wealth are rather similar in the two
countries for the lower half of the net worth distribution. Beginning with the sixth net worth
decile differences are starting to rise in favor of the United States. The difference is most
pronounced in the top decile where it amounts to US$380.000. Finally, with regard to
augmented wealth, the pattern over the distribution is similar to the one of net worth. In the
lower eight deciles German households possess more wealth than US households, while the
opposite holds for the top two deciles. The absolute difference for the lower eight deciles vary
between US$10,000 for the eighth decile to US$80,000 in the fourth decile. In the top decile the
between-country difference amounts to roughly US$2 million in favor of US households.
With regard to the relative contributions of net worth and pension wealth to augmented
wealth along the deciles of net worth (column 5-7 in table 5), we find some quite similar
patterns in both countries: For the bottom deciles, social security pension wealth makes up the
largest relative portion of augmented wealth, but this portion declines over the net worth
distribution. For example, in the United States (Germany) it falls from about 84% (90%) in the
second to 50% (58%) in the sixth to 8% (17%) in the tenth decile. At the same time, in both
countries the portion of net worth increases over the deciles: from about -8% (0%) in the
second to 19% (22%) in the sixth to 74% (67%) in the tenth decile. The relative contributions of
occupational and private pension wealth, however, show rather similar patterns for both
countries. In the US, the share decreases from the first to the third decile. It then rises again up
to the fifth decile and stays at this level up to the ninth decile. In Germany it starts with 26% in
the first decile and also decreases to 10 % in the second and third decile and then also rises
again to around 20% and stays at this level up to the tenth decile.

5.2 Wealth inequality in the United States versus Germany
We measure wealth inequalities by means of two indices: the Gini index and the half-squared
coefficient of variation (GE2). The GE2 belongs to the generalized entropy class of inequality
indices, and is particularly sensitive to changes at the top of a distribution, whereas the Gini is
more responsive to changes in the middle and bottom of the distribution.




                                                      26
QQ plots in Figure 2 provide information on the correlation between different wealth
aggregates and net worth. In both countries, the gap between augmented wealth (solid line)
and net worth (grey line) continuously widens over the quantiles of net worth. This is primarily
due to the increasing role of occupational and private pension wealth (dotted line), which plays
a negligible role in the bottom quantiles. In contrast, the consideration of social security
pension wealth (dashed line) is of utmost relevance for lower levels of net worth, and,
thereafter increases only slightly. That is, starting at US$100,000, the level of social security
pension wealth remains approximately constant. As a result, social security pension wealth is
higher than occupational and private pension wealth up to a level of net worth of about
US$300,000 in the United States, whereas this threshold is about US$600,000 in Germany.

Figure 2. QQ plots for different wealth aggregates


Table 6 presents Gini coefficients for the different wealth aggregates in the two countries.
Because indices are difficult to interpret if the distribution entails observations that hold
negative wealth, we have additionally re-done the analysis for the total population with a
bottom-coding of the wealth component at zero. Finally, to shed light on the inequalities
among households that actually hold positive wealth, we have also derived all indices when
excluding all households with zero or negative wealth. All results are detailed in Table 6. We

                                                                            27
first comment on the results for the overall population. Pertaining to net worth, our results
confirm the previous finding of markedly higher inequality in the United States. The Gini index
(see for the GE2 table A1) is 0.892 as opposed to 0.765 in Germany. Adding social security
pensions without survivor benefits to net worth reduces inequality. For example, the Gini index
drops by about 20% (to 0.712) in the United States. In Germany, the reduction is even larger
(31% to 0.525) due to the greater importance of social security pension wealth. Adding social
security pensions from survivor benefits further reduces inequality, but to a smaller extent. For
the United States, for instance, the decrease is 0.008 Gini points.
When adding occupational and private pension wealth to net worth, the magnitude of the
inequality-reducing effect is smaller compared to social security pension wealth. In both
countries, the Gini index declines by about 7%. From all five of the wealth aggregates
considered here, inequality in augmented wealth is the smallest: the derived Gini index for US
households shrinks by 21% to 0.701. It is even greater in Germany, decreasing by 33% to 0.511.
Bottom-coding at zero has a quite minor effect on measured inequalities. Excluding households
with zero or negative wealth yields markedly lower inequality indices. None of the two
adjustments change the aforementioned general findings.
We complete the inequality analysis with a factor decomposition suited to studying the
contribution of each wealth component to the inequality of augmented wealth. To keep the
empirical analysis tractable and for more intuitive interpretation, we restrict our attention to
the Gini index. Following Lerman and Yitzhaki (1985), the Gini index of country 𝑘 ∈
{𝑈𝑆, 𝐺𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑦} can be decomposed as follows:
                             𝐹                         𝐹              𝐹

                    𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑘 = � 𝑟𝑓,𝑘 × 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑓,𝑘 × 𝑠𝑓,𝑘 = � 𝐶𝑓,𝑘 × 𝑠𝑓,𝑘 = � 𝑂𝑓,𝑘 .               (4)
                            𝑓=1                       𝑓=1             𝑓=1




Here, 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑘 denotes the Gini index of augmented wealth in a country; 𝑟𝑓,𝑘 the Gini correlation
between wealth component 𝑤𝑓,𝑘 (with 𝑓 = 1, … , 𝐹 ) and augmented wealth; 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖�𝑤𝑓,𝑘 � =
𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑓,𝑘 the Gini index for wealth component 𝑓; and 𝑠�𝑤𝑓,𝑘 � = 𝑠𝑓,𝑘 the share of component 𝑓 in

augmented wealth. The Gini correlation 𝑟�𝑤𝑓,𝑘 � = 𝑟𝑓,𝑘 measures the dependence between two
random variables. Its properties are a mixture of Pearson’s and Spearman’s correlations. For


                                                28
any given marginal distribution, the range of the Gini correlation is [−1, 1] (see Schröder et al.,
2014). The concentration coefficient of a wealth component, 𝐶�𝑤𝑓,𝑘 � = 𝐶𝑓,𝑘 , (= 𝑟𝑓,𝑘 × 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑓,𝑘 ),
builds on the distribution sorted by augmented wealth. 37 A smaller concentration coefficient of
a given wealth component compared to the concentration coefficient of augmented wealth
indicates that this wealth component is more prominent in the lower part of the distribution
and vice versa. The product 𝑂𝑓,𝑘 = 𝑟𝑓,𝑘 × 𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑓,𝑘 × 𝑠𝑓,𝑘 can be interpreted as the overall absolute
contribution of a particular wealth aggregate to overall inequality in augmented wealth, while
           𝑂𝑓,𝑘
𝑜𝑓,𝑘 =
          𝐺𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑘
                  gives the relative contribution.

     The concentration coefficient for augmented wealth is identical to its Gini coefficient.

We also compute how the Gini coefficient of augmented wealth changes (∆𝐺𝑘 ) due to an equi-
proportional marginal 1% increase of a particular wealth component, holding all other wealth
components constant.
Table 7 summarizes the results from the factor composition. As pointed out above, net worth is
the key driver of augmented wealth inequality. Its relative contribution (𝑜𝑓 ) is about 63% in the
United States and 52% in Germany. In the United States, the second most important driver is
occupational and private pensions at almost 25%, followed by social security pensions without
survivor benefits at 11%. In Germany, social security pensions without survivor benefits and


                                                       30
occupational and private pensions are of similar magnitude with relative contributions of 22%
and 23%, respectively. In both countries, social security pensions from survivor benefits make
only a small relative contribution of 1% in the United States and 3% in Germany.
The wealth-component-specific inequalities have already been addressed in Table 6. Of
interest, however, are the Gini correlations. The correlation is highest for net worth – exceeding
0.9 in both countries – indicating a rather strong statistical dependence between net worth and
augmented wealth. Gini correlations for social security pension wealth without survivor
benefits are lower, at 0.784 in the United States and 0.646 in Germany. Correlations for
occupational and private pension wealth differ in a similar fashion: The correlation is 0.901 in
the United States and 0.778 in Germany, suggesting that the statistical association between
occupational and private pensions and augmented wealth is lower in Germany. A potential
explanation for the lower correlation in Germany might be Riester pensions, a subsidized
voluntary private saving scheme for retirement that is designed to facilitate savings for low-
income parents, who usually do not hold significant net worth (see Corneo et al. 2015). There is
also evidence that the Riester scheme crowds out savings in non-subsidized savings schemes
(see Corneo et al., 2009 and 2010). Other potential explanations are differences between
wealthy and non-wealthy households in risk and time preferences, financial literacy, or access
to financial products. The lowest Gini correlation can be found for social security pensions from
survivor benefits, whose value is 0.573 in the United States and 0.365 in Germany. In neither
country is the Gini correlation negative. Hence, none of the three wealth components is
negatively associated with augmented wealth.38 Finally, the concentration coefficient for net
worth and occupational and private pension wealth is higher than that for augmented wealth in
both countries, i.e., both wealth components are more relevant in the upper part of the
augmented wealth distribution.

The last column of table 7 shows how the Gini coefficient of augmented wealth changes due to
an equi-proportional marginal 1% increase of a wealth component (all other components held
constant). We find similar patterns in the two countries. While a marginal increase in net worth
leads to a surge in augmented wealth inequality (0.114 Gini points in the United States vs.
0.133 in Germany), the opposite is true for social security pension wealth. A marginal change in
occupational and private pension wealth, however, has only a minor inequality-enhancing




                                                        32
effect on augmented wealth. The magnitude for social security pension wealth from survivor
benefits is also small, although survivor benefits tend to decrease inequality.
The results from the decomposition can be used to derive counterfactual distributions by
swapping coefficients between countries. We study two counterfactuals:
1. The first counterfactual seeks to investigate how between-country differences in wealth
   shares alter overall inequality (share effect). The share effect is estimated by replacing the
   wealth shares in country 𝑘 with the shares from country 𝑘′ is 𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑘 = ∑𝐹𝑓=1 𝐶𝑓,𝑘 ×
   𝑠𝑓,𝑘′ − ∑𝐹𝑓=1 𝐶𝑓,𝑘 × 𝑠𝑓,𝑘 .
2. The second counterfactual seeks to investigate how the difference in two countries’
   concentration coefficients for a particular wealth component alters overall inequality
   (concentration effect). For component 𝑤𝑓,𝑘 , the effect is: 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑓,𝑘 =

   �𝐶𝑓,𝑘 ′ − 𝐶𝑓,𝑘 � × 𝑠𝑓,𝑘 . The total concentration effect is the sum of all wealth components`
   concentration coefficient: ∑𝐹𝑓=1 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑓,𝑘

Table 8 summarizes the share and concentration effects. In the case of the United States, the
share effect is negative: If the wealth shares in the United States were the same as in Germany,
this would lead to a 0.087 (about 11.8%) reduction of the Gini coefficient in the augmented
wealth distribution in the United States. In Germany, the share effect has the inverse sign and is
smaller in absolute terms (12.6% increase). The country-specific total concentration effects over
all wealth aggregates, in absolute terms, are larger than the share effects, meaning that the
inequality gap between the United States and Germany, as measured by the Gini difference, is
mainly driven by cross-country differences in wealth-aggregate-specific inequalities. The overall
concentration effect results from differences in inequalities of net worth in both countries (-
0.087 in the US versus 0.065 in Germany). Besides this, the concentration effect for each wealth
aggregate is, in all cases, rather small and negative (positive) for the US (Germany).

5.3 Age-wealth profiles
According to the life-cycle hypothesis, wealth increases up to retirement age and decreases
smoothly thereafter, implying a hump-shaped age-wealth profile (Ando and Modigliani, 1963).
With simple cross-sectional data at hand, we are not able to distinguish among age, period, and
cohort effects. Thus, we provide estimates of wealth profiles using variation over age in the
2013 cross-section.
        For both countries, we estimate age-wealth profiles on the basis of age of the
household head. The age-wealth profiles are presented for four wealth aggregates – namely,
net worth, social security and occupational and private pensions, and augmented wealth (see
Figure 3). Predictions of wealth-age profiles rely on OLS regressions for multiple imputed data,
the specification is:
                                                                        2       3
                  𝑤𝑓,ℎ,𝑘 = 𝛼𝑘 + 𝛽𝑘 × 𝑎𝑔𝑒ℎ,𝑘 + 𝛾𝑘 × �𝑎𝑔𝑒ℎ,𝑘 � + 𝛿𝑘 × �𝑎𝑔𝑒ℎ,𝑘 � + 𝜀ℎ,𝑘        (5)

with 𝑤𝑓,ℎ,𝑘 denoting wealth aggregate owned by household ℎ of wealth aggregate 𝑓 in country
𝑘, 𝑎𝑔𝑒ℎ,𝑘 the age of the household head in years, and 𝜀ℎ,𝑘 the error term. Age is considered
with a quadratic term, which considers the typical dissaving effect after retirement, while the
polynomial of the third order is used for robustness purposes.



                                                          34
For the graphical presentation in Figure 3, we normalized the estimated wealth profiles in each
country by the respective mean value at the age of 45 to ease the comparisons by controlling
for the substantial difference in wealth levels in Germany and the United States. 39
The general message from Figure 3 is that all estimated age-wealth profiles support the life-
cycle hypothesis, exhibiting the expected hump-shaped profile. It is also interesting to note that
for both countries, the shapes of net worth profiles and augmented wealth are very similar up
to the age of 60. For higher ages, in Germany there is a somewhat stronger dissaving effect
than in the United States, also starting at earlier ages. One potential explanation for the lower
dissaving rate among elderly Americans compared to Germans is the greater need of the
former to put aside precautionary savings to pay for future medical expenses in old age. In
Germany, the majority of medical expenses are covered by the national health plan or nursing
home and elderly care insurance. In the United States, in contrast, elderly Americans are
subject to considerably greater out-of-pocket medical expenses. Moreover, elderly care
insurance is much more limited in the United States, with regard to both the dollar level of
coverage and the term of coverage (the typical policy covers the insured for a maximum of five
years). As a result, older American must continue to save (or, at least, not dis-save as much) to
provide for this possible contingency. 40 Besides medical expenses, savings in the United States
might also represent reserves to finance education for dependents. Additionally, owners of
property wealth can profit from a rise in values. Given that the share of property owners is
higher in the United States compared to Germany, this may also explain why older Americans
still show increases in net worth.
For social security pension wealth, we find a steeper profile in Germany than in the United
States before retirement. One possible explanation is the tighter relationship between earnings
and pension entitlements in Germany, the principle of equivalence. This principle implies that
the age profile for social security pension wealth closely tracks the earnings profile. In the

39
   Additionally, Figure A3 in the Appendix provides age-wealth profiles for three aggregates: (a) net worth plus
public pensions without survivor benefits; (b) net worth plus public pensions from survivor benefits; (c) net worth
plus private pensions; (d) total pension wealth.
40
   Some corroboration is provided in a recent study by Banks et al. (2016) investigating consumption patterns at
older ages in the United States and the United Kingdom. They find that the greater need for precautionary savings
for future medical expenses in the United States almost fully explains the steeper decline in non-durable
consumption in the United Kingdom compared to the United States in old age.

                                                        35
United States, replacement rates decrease in earnings, meaning that age profiles for earnings
and social security pension wealth are less strongly linked.
For occupational and private pension wealth, the age profile is markedly steeper in the United
States compared to Germany. In the United States, mean wealth increases by a factor of 3.6
between 45 and 65, while in Germany, the respective pension wealth at 65 is 2.6 times that at
45. For higher ages, the gap between the profiles declines.

6 Conclusion
We find that in 2013 average net worth in the United States is US$337,000, about twice as high
as in Germany, while up to the eighth decile net worth is higher in Germany than in the United


                                                      36
States. We also find that pension wealth makes up a sizeable portion of household wealth –
48% on average of augmented wealth in the United States and 61% in Germany. Average social
security pension wealth in dollar terms is higher in Germany than the United States –
US$200,000 versus US$161,000 – but the reverse is true for occupational and private pension
wealth – US$90,000 versus US$153,000. Average total pension wealth is therefore higher in the
United States – US$315,000 versus US$291,000. Including pension wealth also alters the
relative positions in average and median wealth in the two countries. At US$651,000, average
augmented wealth in the United States is 1.4 times higher than in Germany but the median is
higher in Germany: US$327,000 versus US$247,000, which underlines the relative importance
of pension wealth in Germany.
       In both countries, the incorporation of pension wealth in the household portfolio
positions reduces measured wealth inequalities, but wealth inequality is reduced more in
Germany through the addition of pension wealth than in the United States. With regard to net
worth, our results confirm the previous finding of markedly higher inequalities in the United
States. The Gini index is 0.892 in contrast to 0.765 in Germany. Adding social security pension
wealth to net worth reduces inequality. The Gini index drops by 21% (to 0.704) in the United
States, while in Germany, the reduction is even greater (33% to 0.512) due to the higher
importance of social security pension wealth. Adding occupational and private pension wealth
to net worth also reduces inequality, but the magnitude of the effect is smaller. In both
countries, the Gini index declines by about seven percent. Adding social security and
occupational and private pension wealth to net worth, we obtain augmented wealth. The
respective Gini index in United States shrinks by 0.191 points, from 0.892 to 0.701, and by 0.254
points (33% reduction) in Germany to 0.511. The redistributive impact of pension wealth is
therefore greater in Germany. The primary effect is from social security pension wealth, which
reflects the higher magnitude of social security pension wealth in Germany in both dollar and
relative terms.
       Putting the results in a broader perspective, we would have expected the wider social
safety net in Germany relative to the United States would imply that middle-class and poor
Germans need to save less for job loss, sickness, and old age than corresponding Americans.


                                               37
We would expect this primarily because of the higher social security pensions in Germany than
in the United States. Also, university education is free in Germany, which means that unlike
Americans, Germans have no need to save for university tuition. In general, one would think
that a wider social safety net would mean less need for precautionary savings. However, net
worth is actually higher in Germany than in the United States up to the eighth decile. Future
research about net worth and augmented wealth in the two countries should therefore seek to
explain this rather surprising finding and should investigate how differences in institutional
settings such as the social safety net, incentives for wealth accumulation, and potential cultural
differences play a role.
         Finally, our research has shown that a cross-country comparison of wealth is sensitive to
the choice of the wealth aggregate. Augmented wealth may give a more accurate picture of the
welfare positions of households in different countries then net worth. Nevertheless,
interpretations should be made with caution because of the restricted convertibility of social
security pension wealth.41




41
   The OECD guidelines for Micro Statistics on Household Wealth (OECD 2013: 71) state that “The exclusion of
entitlements in social security schemes, as recommended here for micro statistics on household wealth, is primarily
for practical reasons and to maintain consistency with the SNA’s definition of financial assets. It reflects the view
that reliable estimates of pension entitlements in social security schemes may not be readily available in many
countries, especially for individual households, and that the case for departing from the SNA on this issue is not
strong at this time.” However, data providers may modify their questionnaires or find other ways to estimate
public pension wealth to provide a more precise picture of wealth levels and wealth inequality across countries.

Basic rules for the determination of survivor civil servant pensions


The living basis for bereaved partner 42 of a civil servant is determined based on the following
basic rules: 43
1. The marriage must have lasted for at least 12 months for marriages after Dec. 31, 2001 -
     otherwise for three months. If the civil servant was above age 65 at the beginning of the
     marriage and the marriage was childless, no survivor pension is granted.
2. A widow(er) pension is granted if the deceased partner was a civil servant for at least five
     years.
3. The widow(er) pension amounts to 60% (55%) of the pension of the deceased partner for
     survivors born before (after) Dec. 31, 1961.
4. The level of the widow(er) pension depends on the income situation of the widow(er) with
     particular deduction rules applying. 44




42
   A widow(er) pension was received by about 311,000 individuals age 65 and older (BMAS 2012a). Due to data
limitations and consistency, again we refrain from modeling orphan pensions.

   Two cases must be distinguished: Case 1: widow(er) is retired and receives a statutory PAYG pension: According
to § 55 (3) 2 of Germany's Civil Service Benefits Act (Beamtenversorgungsgesetz, BeamtVG), the full widow(er)
pension is granted. Case 2: widow(er) is retired and receives a civil servant pension: According to § 55 (2) 2 the
complete widow(er) pension is granted, but the own civil servant pension is reduced. The deduction of the own
pension is the sum of the widow(er)’s own pension plus her widower pension minus the maximum pension
entitlement of the deceased person. The maximum entitlement of the deceased person is 0.75 times her pay
grade.
