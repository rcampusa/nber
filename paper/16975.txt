                                             ABSTRACT

We estimate the elasticity of exports to credit using matched customs and firm-level bank credit data
from Peru. To account for non-credit determinants of exports, we compare changes in exports of the
same product and to the same destination by firms borrowing from banks differentially affected by
capital-flow reversals during the 2008 financial crisis. We find that credit shocks affect the intensive
margin of exports, but have no significant impact on entry or exit of firms to new product and destination
markets. Our results suggest that credit shortages reduce exports through raising the variable cost of
production, rather than the cost of financing sunk entry investments.

1       Introduction
The role of banks in the amplification of real economic fluctuations has been debated by
policymakers and academics since the Great Depression (Friedman and Schwarz (1963),
Bernanke (1983)). The basic premise is that funding shocks to banks during economic
downturns increase the real cost of financial intermediation and reduce borrowers’ access
to credit and output. Through this channel, international commercial banks have been
shown to represent an important source of contagion during periods of international capital
reversals.1 Although there is now a large body of evidence suggesting that negative bank
credit shocks may affect economic activity, the magnitude of the sensitivity of output to
bank funding shocks is unknown, and the underlying economic mechanisms behind this
sensitivity are less understood.2
    In this paper, we study the effect of bank credit shocks on the export behavior of
Peruvian firms during the 2008 financial crisis. The reversal of capital flows during the
crisis negatively affected the foreign funding of banks operating in Peru. Using this
funding shortage as a source of variation for credit supply, we document that banks that
relied heavily on foreign funding before the financial crisis significantly reduced the supply
of credit when capital flows reversed in 2008. Then, we exploit the disaggregated nature
of the export data to compare the export growth of the same product and to the same
destination across firms that borrowed from banks that were differentially affected by
funding shocks. Comparing exports within narrowly defined markets is key to overcoming
concerns that unobserved export demand and input market shocks might be correlated
with the credit supply shock.
    Our main result is that negative shocks to credit reduce the volume of exports for
firms that continue exporting to a given product-destination market (i.e., the intensive
margin) and has no impact on the probability that a firm exits or enters new product
and destination markets. This result provides new insights into the relationship between
exporters’ production function and their use of credit. Consider, for example, the bench-
mark model of trade with sunk entry costs.3 In such a framework, a negative credit shock
affects the entry margin, but once the initial investment is paid, credit fluctuations do not
affect the intensive margin of exports. Yet, we find positive elasticities on the intensive
margin, suggesting that credit shocks affect the variable cost of exporting. This would be
the case, for example, if banks financed exporters’ working capital, as in Feenstra et al.
(2014) and Manova (2013). By increasing the unit cost of production, adverse credit
conditions reduce the equilibrium size and profitability of exports.
    The novelty of our empirical estimation relies on the uniqueness of the data. First,

et al. (2014), and Jimenez et al. (2011).

Motivated by the important fixed costs involved in entering a new market—i.e. setting up distribution
networks, marketing– Chaney (2005) develops a model where firms are liquidity constrained and must
pay an export entry cost. Participation in the export market is, as a result, suboptimal.

                                                 2
we observe outstanding credit for all Peruvian firms with each bank, as well as detailed
banks’ balance sheets. Then, rather than simply relying on the firm’s outstanding credit
level—which is an equilibrium outcome also determined by demand—we use a bank’s
dependence on foreign funding interacted with firms’ debt composition across banks to
construct an instrumental variable for firms’ exposure to credit supply shocks. And, sec-
ond, we use customs data, which include information on the identity of the exporting firm,
product, destination, mode of transportation, volume, price, and date of each shipment.
Using this information, we estimate regressions with a full set of product-destination-time
dummies to control for non-credit shocks, such as time-varying export demand, changes
in international prices, and input cost fluctuations. We find that both of these features
of our estimation approach are crucial: a naive estimation, without instrumenting for
credit supply and without accounting for non-credit shocks at the product-destination
level, results in substantial estimation bias that may lead to erroneous conclusions, both
qualitatively and quantitatively.
    Our data and empirical approach allow us to obtain point-estimates of the elasticity of
different dimensions of the export activity to credit. On the intensive margin, we find that
a 10% reduction in the supply of credit reduces the volume of exports in the year after the
shock by 1.95%. We further show that firms adjust the intensive margin of exports in two
ways—by changing the frequency of shipments of a given product to a given destination
(with an elasticity of 0.10); and by adjusting the size of each shipment, with an elasticity
of 0.9 and 0.11 when size is measured by volume and value, respectively. On the extensive
margin, we find that credit shocks do not significantly affect the probability that a firm
exits or enters a given export market. We also find that the credit arrangements between
the exporter and the importer react to funding shocks to the exporting firm: after bank
credit supply declines, exporting firms firms partially substitute towards trade credit with
the importer. The magnitude of the effect is economically small: A 10% reduction in bank
lending triggers an increase of 0.2% in the fraction of the shipment paid in advanced by
the importer.4
    This paper is related to a growing empirical literature that analyzes the role of credit
in export activities. One strand of this literature focuses on the link between access to
credit and the steady-state patterns of international trade and comparative advantages.5
Our paper focuses not on the static patterns of exports, but on the effect of a credit
shock on firms’ export performance. Our results are more closely related to the work that
analyzes the effects of credit disruptions on trade during the Great Trade Collapse of 2008
(see, for example, Bricongne et al. (2012), Bolton et al. (2011), Chor and Manova (2012),
and Levchenko et al. (2010)). Most of the studies are based on the comparison of exports

   4
     This is consistent with the findings of Antras and Foley (2014), who also document stickiness in the
terms of the trade credit contracts between established trade partners during the 2008 financial crisis.
   5
     Beck (2002) and Manova (2013), for example, look at cross-country differences in financial conditions
and the resulting patterns of exports across industries. And, related to static models of trade with
heterogeneous firms and credit constraints, as in Chaney (2005), recent empirical literature has used
cross-sectional firm-level data to analyze the effect of credit constraints on firms’ participation in export
markets. See, for example, Manova et al. (2014), Minetti and Zhu (2011), Muûls (2012) and Berman and
Hericourt (2010).

                                                     3
across industries presumed to differ in their sensitivity to credit. We can use our setting
to test whether industry-level indicators, such as the Rajan and Zingales (1998) external
dependence index, are correlated with the sensitivity of exports to credit shocks. We
find no evidence in our setting to support the common assumption that sectors with high
dependence on external finance have a higher export elasticity to credit supply shocks.
Most likely, these measures capture exporters’ long-term need for outside financing.
    The paper is closely related to the recent literature on the real effects of the bank
lending channel that uses firm-level instruments for credit shocks (see, for example, Amiti
and Weinstein (2011), Carvalho et al. (2014), Chodorow-Reich (2014), Iyer et al. (2014),
Jimenez et al. (2011), Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2010), and Muûls (2012)). This litera-
ture compares firm-level outcomes —such as total sales, total exports, employment or
investment— across firms affected differently by a credit shock. Comparing total ex-
ports across firms does not account for non-credit shocks to their different markets of
operation, which, as we show in our setting, results in substantial estimation bias. For
example, the point-estimate of the export elasticity to credit is biased downwards and
not statistically different from zero when product-destination shocks are unaccounted for.
Moreover, accounting for product-destination shocks crucially alters the cross-sectional
correlation between the export sensitivity to credit and the variables typically used in
the literature as a proxy for trade-specific financing demand (distance to destination, the
mode of transportation (air vs. sea or ground), or whether the importer paid for exported
goods in advance).6 In particular, the correlation between the export elasticity to credit
and these proxies disappears when we control for product-destination shocks.
    Our results highlight the importance of non-credit factors during the Great Trade Col-
lapse.7 Indeed, in the case of Peru, our estimates suggest that while bank credit appears
to have a first-order effect on exports, the bulk of the decline in exports is explained by
the drop in international demand for Peruvian goods. Peruvian export volume growth
was -9.6% during the year following July 2008, almost 13 percentage points lower than in
the previous year. Assuming that only banks with above-average foreign funding reduced
their supply of credit, our estimates imply that the shock to bank funding accounts for
only 8% of the missing volume of exports.
    The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the economic environ-
ment and the data. Section 3 discusses the empirical strategy. Section 4 presents the
results on the elasticity of exports to credit. Section 5 tests the validity of several key
assumptions in existing empirical work aimed at measuring the effect of credit shocks on
real economic activity. Section 6 concludes and performs a back of the envelope calculation
of the contribution of finance to the overall export decline during the the 2008 crisis.

2       Background and Data Description
This section describes the environment and the data. We first briefly describe the Peruvian
economy—with an emphasis on the banking and export sectors—during the 2008 financial
crisis. We then present the multiple data sets used in the empirical exercise.


2.1     Background
The 2008 financial crisis affected Peru through two main channels. The first was through
the decline in the demand for Peruvian exports. Peruvian exports, which had been grow-
ing steadily over the decade prior to the 2008 financial crisis, suffered a sharp drop after
2008. Figure 2a shows the monthly (log) exports between 2007 and 2009. Peak to trough,
monthly exports dropped by around 60% in value (40% in volume) during the 2008 fi-
nancial crisis.8 The second channel was through the decline of portfolio capital inflows to
Peru, which had been growing prior to the crisis. These flows stopped suddenly in mid
2008. As shown in Figure 2b, the decline in portfolio flows led to a dramatic decline in
foreign funding to Peruvian banks.
    Peru’s GDP yearly growth declined from 11.7% in the second quarter of 2008 to -
1.2% in the second quarter of 2009. Bank lending followed a similar trend: total bank
loan growth dropped from 2.4% between March and September 2008, to 1.6% during the
following six months.9 This decline was concentrated in dollar-denominated loans, while
lending in domestic currency (Soles) remained stable.
    The drop in the volume of credit occurred concurrently with an increase in the cost
of debt: the spread between dollar-denominated lending and deposit rates increased from
6.7% to 9.6% between March and December 2008; and the U.S. dollar appreciated more
than 10% with respect to the domestic currency.10 Although a decline in demand —due to
the drop in export and import activities— may be partly to blame for the drop in credit,
the rate increase highlights the importance of credit supply factors. Foreign funding to
Peruvian banking sector decreased sharply. This, in turn, reduced the banking sector’s
loanable funds, especially for banks with a high share of foreign funding.


2.2     Data Description
We use three data sets: bank-level data on Peruvian banks; loan-level data on credit in
the domestic banking sector; and customs data for Peruvian firms.
   We collect the customs data from the website of the Peruvian tax agency (Superin-
tendence of Tax Administration, or SUNAT). Collecting the export data involves using a
    8
     The timing and magnitude of this decline aligns closely with the sharp collapse of world trade during
the last quarter of 2008.
   9
     The account of the 2008 financial crisis described in this subsection draws heavily on the ”Report on
Financial Stability,” Banco Central de Reserva del Peru (2009).
  10
     During the same period, due to active intervention by the Central Bank of Peru, the spread be-
tween active and passive Soles-denominated interest rates dropped from 21.7% to 17.2%. These figures
correspond to the average rates of commercial banks on lending and deposit (weighted).

web crawler to download each individual export document. To validate the consistency
of the data collection process, we compare the sum of the monthly total exports from our
data, with the total monthly exports reported by the tax authority. On average, exports
from the collected data add up to 99.98% of the exports reported by SUNAT.
    The bank and loan data are from the Peruvian bank regulator, Superintendence of
Banking, Insurance, and Pension Funds (SBS). The bank data consist of monthly financial
statements for all of Peru’s commercial banks from January 2007 to December 2009.
Columns 1 to 3 in Table 1 provide descriptive statistics for the 41 financial institutions
operating in Peru during this period. Most credit to exporting firms is concentrated
among 13 commercial banks, described in columns 4 to 9, depending on their fraction of
foreign funding relative to total assets. The remaining 28 banks are Savings and Loans
(S&L) institutions with limited exposure to foreign funding (columns 10 to 12). The loan
data are a monthly panel of the outstanding debt of every firm with each bank operating
in Peru. We match the loan data to export data using a unique firm identifier assigned
by SUNAT for tax collection purposes.
    Peruvian exports in 2009 totaled almost $27bn, approximately 20% of Peru’s GDP.
North America and Asia are the main destinations of Peruvian exports; in particular,
United States and China jointly account for approximately 30% of total exports. The
main exports result from extractive activities: goods derived from gold and copper account
for approximately 40% of Peruvian exports. Other important sectors are food products
(coffee, asparagus, and fish) and textiles.
    Panel 1 in Table 2 provides descriptive statistics of Peruvian exporters. Our data cover
the universe of exporters—all firms with at least one export shipment between July 2007
and June 2009 (columns 1 and 2). The descriptive statistics correspond to the period
July 2007-June 2008, prior to the capital flow reversal caused by the 2008 crisis. The
average bank debt among the universe of exporters as of December 2007 is $1.01 million,
and the average level of exports is $3.3 million FOB (Free On Board). The average firm
exports to 2.7 destinations, out of a total of 198. The average firm exports 5.3 four-digit
products (out of a total of 1,103 products with positive exports in the data). Our empirical
analysis in Sections 4 and 5 is based on exporting firms with positive debt in the domestic
banking sector, both, before and after the negative credit supply shock (columns 3 and
4). Firms in this subsample have larger debt, and their exports are more concentrated
in a smaller number of products (Table 2, column 5). The empirical identification of the
credit supply shock in Subsection 4.1 relies on the subsample of firms with two or more
banking relationships (columns 7 and 8). These firms are even larger, in terms of both
total exports and debt, than the baseline subsample in columns 3 and 4.
    The unit of observation in our baseline regressions is a firm-product-destination annual
export flow. Panel 2 in Table 2 provides the descriptive statistics for the universe of 53,690
export flows (columns 1 and 2) and for the 47,810 observations that correspond to the
subsample of exporters with positive bank debt (columns 3 and 4). The average annual
export flow in our sample is US$184,800 FOB (446,400 kg), and is distributed into 2.17
shipments. Importers pay for more than 40% of these export flows in advance. About
40% are shipped by air, while the rest are transported by sea or ground. To estimate


                                              6
the effect of credit on the intensive margin of exports, the sample is restricted to around
16,500 firm-product-destination export flows that are positive (at least one shipment) both
before and after the beginning of the capital flow reversal. The effect on the extensive
margin is estimated using either the set of firm-product-destination export flows that a
firm may enter after the capital flow reversal (entry margin) or those active before the
capital flow reversal (exit margin).


3      Empirical Strategy
This section describes our approach to identifying the causal effect of credit supply on
exports. Consider the following general characterization of the level of exports by firm i
of product p to destination country d at time t, Xipdt :

                                    Xipdt = Xipdt (Hipdt , Cit ).                                (1)

The first argument, Hipdt , represents determinants of exports other than credit supply—
i.e., demand for product p in country d; financial conditions in country d; the cost of
inputs for producing product p; the productivity of firm i, etc. The second argument, Cit ,
represents the amount of credit taken by the firm.
                                                                              ∂X     Cit
     We are interested in estimating the elasticity of exports to credit: η = ∂Cipdt
                                                                                 it Xipdt
                                                                                          . The
identification problem is that the amount of credit, Cit , is an equilibrium outcome that
depends on the supply of credit faced by the firm, Sit , and the firm’s demand for credit,
which may be given by the same factors, Hipdt , affecting the level of exports:

                                     Cit = Cit (Hipdt , ..., Sit ).                              (2)

Our empirical strategy to address this problem is based on two pillars. First, we instru-
ment for the supply of credit, using shocks to the balance sheet of the banks lending to
firm i. This empirical approach obtains unbiased parameters if banks and firms are ran-
domly matched. However, if banks specialize in firms’ product or destination markets, the
instrument may be correlated with factors that affect exports though channels other than
the credit supply. For example, suppose that firms that export Men’s Cotton Overcoats
to the U.S. tend to borrow from banks that suffer a negative balance sheet shock during
the crisis. If the demand for men’s cotton overcoats in the U.S. drops disproportionately
during the crisis, we would erroneously attribute this decline in exports to the credit
supply shock.
    To avoid potential bias due to non-random matching of firms and banks, a second pillar
of our empirical strategy involves controlling for all unobserved heterogeneity in the cross-
section with firm-product-destination fixed effects, and for shocks to the cost of inputs
and demand of exports with product-country-time dummies.11 As a result, our estimation
compares variation in exports within product-destinations instead of comparing variation
  11
   Subsection 5.1 shows that the impact of the credit shock on export is severely misestimated if the
model does not control for heterogeneity of non-credit factors across product and destinations.

                                                   7
in total exports across firms. In the example above, our estimation procedure compares
the change in men’s cotton overcoat exports to the U.S. by a firm that is linked to a
negatively affected bank with the corresponding change in a firm whose lender is not
affected.
    The identification assumption is that factors other than bank credit that may affect
the exports of men’s cotton overcoats to the U.S. differently across these two firms are
not related to the debt composition of banks from which the two firms borrow. Note
that this assumption is much weaker than the one required for estimation using total
exports at the firm level, which does not control for shocks in firms’ export or input
markets. The identification assumption is violated if a firm’s bank affiliation is correlated
with: 1) demand heterogeneity within a product-destination (e.g., product quality), or 2)
other non-credit firm-level shocks (e.g., firm’s direct dependence on foreign funding, not
mediated by banks). We discuss and test the validity of these assumptions in Subsection
4.6, where we show that the elasticity point estimates are unchanged when we allow the
effect of credit to exports to vary across firms that export products of different quality;
firms that have different currency composition of their funding; single- and multi-product
firms; and small and large firms measured both by volume of exports and by number of
destinations. This robustness provides strong support for our identification assumption.
    Formally, we estimate η I , the elasticity of the intensive margin of exports to credit,
using the following empirical model:

                        ln(Xipdt ) = η I · ln(Cit ) + δipd + αpdt + εipdt ,              (3)

where, as in equation (1) above, Xipdt represents the exports by firm i of product p
to destination country d at time t, and Cit is the the sum of all outstanding credit
from the banking sector to firm i at time t. The right-hand side includes two sets of
dummy variables: δipd accounts for the unobserved heterogeneity of product p exported
to destination d by firm i, and αpdt accounts for product-destination-time shocks. The first
component captures, for example, the managerial ability in firm i, or the firm’s knowledge
of the market for product p in destination d. The second component captures changes
in the cost of production of good p, variations in the transport cost for product p to
destination d, or any fluctuation in the demand for product p at destination d.
    To measure the extensive margin elasticity —the change in the probability that firm i
starts/stops exporting product p to destination d— we use the following linear probability
model:
                            Eipdt = η E · ln(Cit ) + δi + αpdt + ε.ipdt ,                (4)
We are interested in measuring separately the elasticity of entry and exit to a credit
shock, so we estimate two specifications: in the entry specification, Eipdt is an indicator
variable for whether exports by firm i of product p to destination d is positive at time t,
conditioning on exports being zero in the previous period. In the exit specification, Eipdt
is equal to one if firm i does not export product p to destination d at time t, conditioning
on exports being positive in the previous period.
    Note a key difference between the extensive margin specification (4) and the intensive
margin specification (3): the extensive margin contains only firm fixed-effects, instead of

                                                8
firm-product-destination fixed-effects. This is by construction, since a firm that enters
(exits) a product-destination market cannot enter (exit) in the same product-destination
market the following period. Thus, η E can be interpreted as a firm-level semi-elasticity: it
measures the change in the probability that a firm enters/exits a new product-destination
market that is induced by a one-percentage-point change in credit supply.
     We estimate equations 3 and 4 using shocks to the financial conditions of the banks
lending to firm i as an instrument for the amount of credit received by firm i at time t,
Cit . We next explain the economic rationale behind the instrument and further discuss
the identification hypothesis behind the instrumental variable (IV) estimation.


3.1     Capital Flow Reversals, Bank Foreign Funding and Credit
        Supply
The hypothesis behind the instrumental variable approach is that the contraction in credit
supply after the capital flow reversal was larger for banks that relied more on foreign
funding before the crisis. In this subsection, we present the within-firm estimation strategy
to disentangle credit supply from changes in the demand for credit, and we then test our
assumption.12
    We first document that the share of foreign funding was heterogeneous across banks
before the crisis. Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the 41 banks in our sample, 13
commercial banks and 28 S&Ls at year-end 2006. The average foreign funding as a fraction
of assets is 5.5%, and the median is 0.2%. The skewness in the cross-sectional distribution
of foreign funding is due mainly to the large number of small S&Ls that use low amounts
of foreign funding. Excluding S&Ls, the average foreign funding for Commercial Banks is
about 10% and also exhibits substantial heterogeneity. Foreign funding represents close
to 20% of the assets of the four commercial banks with above-average foreign exposure,
but only 5% of the assets of banks with below-average exposure (Table 1, columns 4 and
7).13
    The within-firm estimator compares the change in the amount of lending by banks
with different dependence on foreign funding to the same firm, before and after the capital
flow reversal. Based on the evolution of total foreign lending to Peruvian banks in Figure
2b, we set July 2008 as the starting date for the capital reversals. This leads to the
following empirical model:

                        ln (Cibt ) = θib + µit + β · f (F Db ) × P ostt + νibt .                   (5)

Cibt is the average outstanding debt of firm i with bank b during the intervals t =
{P re, P ost}, where the P re and P ost periods correspond to the 12 months before and
after July 2008. f (F Db ) is an increasing function of the share of foreign funding of bank
  12
     This procedure has been used in Gan (2007), Khwaja and Mian (2008), Paravisini (2008), Iyer et al.
(2014), Iyer and Peydro (2011), Schnabl (2012), Jimenez et al. (2011) and Jimenez et al. (2012).
  13
     For example, the foreign funding of HSBC and Banco Santander, two foreign-owned banks operating
in Peru, were 17.7% and 2.2% of assets, respectively, in 2006.

                                                   9
b before the capital flow reversal, which may be non-linear, and P ostt is a dummy equal
to one when t = P ost.
    The regression includes firm-bank fixed-effects, θib , which control for all (time-invariant)
unobserved heterogeneity in the demand and supply of credit. It also includes a full set
of firm-time dummies, µit , that control for the firm-specific evolution in overall credit de-
mand during the period under analysis. As long as changes in a firm’s demand for credit
are equally spread across different lenders in expectation, the coefficient β measures how
credit supply by commercial banks changes with foreign funding.

3.2     Instrument
We construct the firm-level instrument for estimating specifications (3) and (4) in two
steps. First, we calculate each firm’s exposure to the credit supply shock. We assume
(and later test) whether firms that were more exposed to banks with high foreign funding
experienced a larger decline in credit supply after the capital flow reversals. We use the
average foreign dependence of the firm’s bank, weighted by the fraction of credit from
each bank, as an instrument for the firm’s exposure to the credit supply shock:

                                                X
                                       Fi =           ωib f (F Db ),                                   (6)
                                                  b

where ωib is the share of bank b in total credit of firm i, and f (F Db ) is the dependence on
foreign funding from specification (5), which is a function of the bank’s share of foreign
funding, F Db . Both ωib and F Db are measured at year-end 2006.
    The second step is interacting the measure of firms’ exposure with a time indicator of
the capital flow reversal:
                                      Fit = Fi · P ostt ,                                  (7)
where P ostt is an indicator variable that turns to one after July 2008, when the decline
in foreign funding started.
    The cross-sectional variation in Fi comes from two sources: the firm-specific amount
of credit that it receives from each bank in 2006; and the heterogeneous dependence
on foreign capital across banks. The classification of banks and firms in 2006 reduces
the likelihood that bank foreign dependence and firm-bank matching were endogenously
chosen in anticipation of the crisis. The time series variation in Fit is given by the
aggregate decline of foreign bank funding in the Peruvian economy.
    We consider different parametrizations of the functional form f (.). In Subsection
4.1, we analyze non-parametrically the relationship between bank foreign funding and
credit supply. And, in Subsection 4.2, we use the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection
Operator (LASSO) method in Belloni et al. (2012) to select the optimal parametrization
of the instrument and to avoid choosing the functional form of the instrument in an ad hoc
manner.14 We test the robustness of the results to alternative definitions of the instrument
  14
    The LASSO estimator augments the error minimization problem of the first-stage regression with a
kinked penalty function on each non-zero parameter of f (.) that induces the solution to the first-stage to
have many zeroes.

in Subsection 4.6.


4     Effect of Credit Supply Shock on Exports
In this section, we use the methodology described above to, first, corroborate that the
bank’s share of capital funded with foreign capital predicts a negative credit supply shock
to its borrowers during the P ost period; and, second, to estimate the elasticity of exports
to credit on the intensive and extensive margins.
    Since our empirical strategy relies crucially on accounting for shocks to export demand
and input cost, we define the margin of exports at the product-destination level. The
intensive margin corresponds to firm exports of a given product to a given destination
that are positive in both the P re and P ost periods. The extensive margin corresponds
to the probability that an exporting firm enters or exits a product-destination market.
In the baseline specifications, we define products at the 4-digit level according to the
Harmonized System (HS). As a result, our estimations are obtained from exports variation
within about 6,000 product-destinations.


4.1    Identification of the Credit Supply Shock
This subsection formally tests the identification assumption. We estimate specification
(5) after first differencing to eliminate the firm-bank time-invariant fixed-effects, θib . The
resulting estimation equation is:

                      ln (CibP ost ) − ln (CibP re ) = µ0i + β · f (F Db ) + νib           (8)

The firm dummies µ0i absorb all changes in credit demand by the firm, µ0i = µiP ost − µiP re
in equation (5).
    We inspect non-parametrically the relationship between a bank’s share of foreign fund-
ing and the change in credit to exporting firms during the crisis (left-hand side of equation
(8)). Figure 3a plots smoothed local polynomial regressions of the change in (log) credit
by bank b to firm i between the P re and P ost periods, ln (CibP ost ) − ln (CibP re ), on the
fraction of assets funded with foreign debt, F Db . The plot indicates that banks with a low
exposure to foreign funding expanded total lending after the crisis, while banks with high
exposure reduced total lending. To explore the relationship between banks’ credit supply
and foreign funding we replicate Figure 3a plotting in the vertical axis the residuals of a
regression of changes in (log) credit by bank b to firm i on a full set of firm fixed-effects,
which account for changes in demand of credit by the firms. A similar pattern appears:
banks with high levels of foreign funding reduce supply of credit relative to banks with
low levels of exposure. Credit supply does not change with foreign funding at relatively
low exposures (below 7% foreign funding) and declines sharply at higher exposure levels
(between 7% and 10%). To account for the potential non-linearities observed in the plot
we present estimates of equation (5) using two alternative assumptions for the functional
form of exposure: (i) a linear function of the bank’s share of foreign debt, f (F Db ) = F Db ,

                                                 11
and (ii) an indicator function equal to one if the bank’s share of foreign funding is above
10%, the mean amongst commercial banks, f (F Db ) = D(F Bb > F B).
    Table 3 shows the estimates of β from equation (8), with standard errors clustered
at the bank level. We find that, indeed, banks with a higher fraction of foreign funding
reduced credit supply more after the capital flow reversal. The point estimate on the linear
functional form for bank exposure (f (F Db ) = F Db ) is −1.88 (column 1), which implies
that a one-percentage-point increase in the fraction of foreign funding before the crisis
predicts a 1.88-percentage-point additional decline in credit supply. The point estimate
on the indicator of exposure if bank-b’s share of foreign funding was higher than 10% in
December 2006 (f (F Db ) = D(F Db > F D)) is −0.168, which implies that banks with an
above-average share of foreign funding reduced the credit supply by 17% relative to banks
with a below-average share of foreign funding. The t-statistic on the binary definition
of exposure (3.65) is substantially larger than that on the linear definition (1.86). This
suggests that a simple binary classification of banks in two categories, exposed and not-
exposed to a foreign funding shock, provides an accurate characterization of how the
change in credit supply varied across banks during the crisis.

4.2    First Stage and Instrumental Variable Choice
The results in Table 3 demonstrate that a bank’s foreign funding was negatively correlated
with its change in supply of credit during the crisis. This does not necessarily imply that
firms that borrowed from these banks experienced a shortage of credit because firms may
have been able to offset a credit supply shock to one of their lenders by borrowing from
another lender. Hence, we need to test whether the bank credit supply shock affected
the total credit obtained by firms. This corresponds to the first-stage regression of the
Two-Stage-Least-Squares estimator of (3). The first stage tests whether the instrument
is correlated with the total amount of credit received by the borrowers of exposed banks.
Taking first-differences to eliminate the firm-bank fixed-effects, the first stage is:
                                                         0
                           ln(CiP ost ) − ln(CiP re ) = γpd + α Fi + i                     (9)
                     0
where the dummy γpd    = γpdP ost −γpdP re controls for factors affecting the product-destination
supplied by the firm. The firm-level instrument Fi is defined in equation (7).
    Table 4 presents the results of first-stage specifications for different functional forms
of the instrument. In column 1 the firm-level instrument is defined based on the binary
measure of bank foreign dependence: the share       P of credit received from banks with an
above-average share of foreign funding, Fi = b ωib D(F Db > F D). In column 2, the
instrumental variable is defined based on a linear measure of bank exposure: the average
of the foreign P
               funding of the lenders to a firm, weighted by the fraction of credit from each
lender, Fi = b ωib F Db . The coefficient on the instrument is negative and statistically
significant at the 1% level in both specifications, indicating that firms that borrowed from
exposed banks did experience a decline in total credit during the crisis. Both definitions
of the instrument imply a strong first stage with F-statistics of 155.5 (binary) and 20.5
(linear).

                                               12
    To select the functional form of the instrumental variable, we perform the LASSO
estimation of the first stage including as instruments: (1) a binary measure of banks’
foreign dependence, f (F Db ) = D(F Db > F D); and (2) an eighth-degree polynomial of
banks’ foreign funding, f (F Db ) = a1 F Db + a2 F Db2 + ... + a8 F Db8 . LASSO selects the
binary measure of banks’ foreign dependence as the optimal instrument.15 Therefore, for
the baseline estimation, we use the following functional form of the instrumental variable
defined in (7):                     X
                               Fi =      ωib D(F Db > 10%).                            (10)
                                             b

    To test the robustness of the results to alternative functional forms of the instrument,
we perform LASSO on the first stage excluding the binary instrument. In this case,
LASSO selects the instruments based on a third-degree polynomial of the lenders’ shares
of foreign funding. We show the first-stage estimates using the third-degree polynomial
instrument in Table (4), column 3, and we use this third-degree polynomial as an in-
strument to perform robustness tests of the instrumental variable results in subsection
4.6.

4.3     Intensive Margin of Exports
This subsection analyzes the effect of a credit supply shock on the intensive margin of
exports. A key advantage of our estimation approach that compares exports within
product-destination markets is that one can measure real exports in volume, rather than
by value. By construction, this eliminates from the estimation any potential confounding
effect of changes in international prices during the crisis. Thus, our baseline specifications
are all estimated using exports measured in volume, and we show in subsection 4.6 that
the results are robust to the alternative measure.
     Export data are highly seasonal, so we collapse the panel into one-year periods before
and after the capital flow reversal to avoid estimation bias due to serial correlation and
seasonality. The P re and P ost periods correspond to the 12 months before and after
July 2008. Thus, exports, Xipdt , corresponds to the sum of the volume of exports (in
kilograms) of product p to destination d by firm i in the period t for those firm-product-
destination export flows that are active in the two periods, t = {P re, P ost}. And credit,
Cit , corresponds to the average outstanding credit balance (in local currency) of firm i in
period t.
     We estimate equation (3) by first-differencing to eliminate the firm-product-destination
time-invariant fixed-effects, δipd . The resulting estimation equation is:
                                                0
            ln (XipdP ost ) − ln (XipdP re ) = αpd + η I · [ln (CiP ost ) − ln (CiP re )] + ε0ipd .   (11)
                                  0
The product-destination dummies, αpd = αpdP ost − αpdP re in equation (3), absorb all
  15
    We use the LASSO and Post-LASSO shooting code provided on Christian Hansen’s University of
Chicago web page: http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/christian.hansen/research/. The LASSO point esti-
mate of the coefficient on the selected instrument is -.752, close to the first-stage estimate of -0.991 in
Table 4—the Post-LASSO estimate.

                                                     13
demand fluctuations of product p in destination d. The supply of credit to firm i is
instrumented with Fi , defined in (10).
    The results of the Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and the Instrumental Variable (IV)
estimations of the export elasticity to credit supply in specification (11) are presented
in presented in Table 5, columns 1 and 2. When the credit shock to the firm is not
instrumented, the OLS estimate of the elasticity is 0.025 (column 1). When the credit
supply shock to the firm is instrumented using the funding shock to the lending bank,
the IV estimate of the elasticity is 0.195 (column 2). The point estimate implies that a
10% reduction in the stock of credit results in a decline of 1.95% in the volume of yearly
export flows.

4.3.1       OLS Bias: Credit Demand and Supply
The IV estimate of the export elasticity to finance is 7.8 times larger than the OLS
estimate. The IV estimate corresponds to the change in exports due to changes in the
credit supply —demand variation is absorbed by the product-destination dummies, αpd .
The OLS estimate, however, corresponds to a regression of changes in exports on total
credit variation, induced by credit demand and supply factors. In the simplest scenario,
where credit demand and supply shocks are uncorrelated, credit demand variation is
equivalent to measurement error, and the OLS estimate is biased towards zero due to
classical attenuation bias.
    We can use the magnitude of the OLS bias to back out the relative importance of de-
mand and supply determinants of credit. In our setting, the magnitude of the attenuation
bias increases with the fraction of the total credit variation that is explained by credit
demand factors. First-differencing further increases the magnitude of the attenuation bias
when the independent variable (i.e., the supply of credit) exhibits serial correlation (see
Arellano (2003)).
    With no serial correlation in credit supply, demand variation must explain around
                                                            β
87% of the total variation in credit to obtain a bias of βOLS  above 7.16 In Monte-Carlo
simulations—shown in the Internet Appendix—where we add serial correlation in credit
supply through unobserved firm heterogeneity, we find that the OLS bias can be seven to
ten times the IV estimate when demand explains 60% of the variation in total credit.17
Thus, the magnitude of the OLS bias indicates that supply-side factors explain less than
half of the variation in total credit during the crisis.

4.3.2       Heterogeneity across Export Flows
The intensive margin elasticity is estimated for firm-product-destination flows active in
the P re and P ost periods. Thus, our intensive margin estimate is a Local Average
Treatment Effect (LATE) for export flows that continue to be active during the crisis.
                                                                         2
  16                                                         β          σdemand         .87
       Using the classic measurement error bias formula,   βOLS   =1+     2
                                                                        σsupply
                                                                                  =1+   .13   = 7.69.
  17         2
    The R of the within-firm specification (8) including only the product-destination dummies is 62%.
This is our best approximation of the minimum amount of variation in total credit that can be explained
by demand factors.

                                                    14
In this subsection, we address the question of whether the estimated intensive margin
elasticity is representative of export flows that were discontinued during the crisis. In
other words, we assess whether the LATE estimate is an upper or a lower bound for the
Average Treatment Effect for the population.
    We follow the approach in Mulligan and Rubinstein (2008) and document the het-
erogeneity of the intensive margin elasticity for export flows with different probabilities
of continuation. We first estimate the probability that a firm-product-destination ex-
port flow that is active in the Pre period continues to be active in the Post period
(Pb(XipdP ost > 0|XipdP re > 0)). For this estimate, we use a Probit model with the follow-
ing explanatory variables: the size of the export flow in the Pre period (ln Xipd ); the size
of the firm’s total exports (ln Xi ); the overall stock on credit (ln Ci ); and the measure of
exposure, Fi , defined in equation (10). The parameters of the Probit regression reported
in column 1 of Table 5 indicate that larger export flows, as well as flows by larger firms
with more credit, are more likely to continue during the crisis. Once firm credit is included
in the regression, the instrument for credit supply shock (Fi ) does not significantly affect
the probability that an existing export flow remains active. This is consistent with the
exclusion restriction of the instrumental variable estimation of the extensive margin of
exports (next subsection), as it indicates that the instrument affects the exit margin only
through credit.
    Based on the probit estimates of the probability of continuation for each flow, we
estimate the intensive margin elasticity on subsamples that include only the export flows
above the 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th percentiles n     of the continuation probability distri-
                                                                                        o
bution. That is, subsamples defined by: ipd | P (XipdP ost > 0|XipdP re > 0) ≥ α for
                                                        b
α = 0.42, 0.56, 0.68, 0.79.
    The results are reported in columns 3 to 6 of Table 5 and are shown graphically in
Figure 3. For comparison, the table also includes the sample defined by α = 0, which
corresponds to the full sample used in column 2. The point estimates of the intensive
margin elasticity to credit are similar across export flows with different probability of
continuation. As is clear from Figure 3, the standard errors increase as we restrict the
data to a higher cutoff for the continuation probability, which is likely caused by the
smaller sample size. Most importantly, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the estimates
are similar across the different samples, which indicates that our LATE estimate of the
intensive margin elasticity is representative of the entire population.


4.4     Extensive Margin of Exports
We analyze the effect of a credit supply shock on the probability that an exporting firm
abandons or enters a product-destination export market using estimating equation (4).18
As in the previous subsection, we collapse the time series into two periods, P re and P ost,
which correspond to the 12 months before and after July 2008. The sample contains a
large number of intermittent export flows; thus, we consider a firm-product-destination
  18
    In an earlier version of this paper, we computed the effect of the credit shock on the number of firms
entering and exiting product-destination markets. The results were qualitatively similar.

                                                   15
flow to be active at time t if it registered positive exports at any time during those 12
months.
     The definition of the sample of export flows at risk of exit is straightforward: it includes
all firm-product-destination flows active in the P re period. The definition of the potential
entrants is less straightforward because, in principle, any firm operating in Peru that is
currently not exporting is a potential entrant to any of the product-destinations in the
unrestricted universe of potential markets. Computational limitations do not permit us to
consider any firm as a potential entrant to any market because the number of observations
in the data set would be measured in hundreds of millions. We adopt a narrower definition
of potential entrants and entry markets by imposing the following restrictions: 1) we
consider only firms that are already exporting to any product-destination in the P re
period, which implies that the probability of entry is measured as the probability that
an exporter enters a new product-destination market; and 2) we restrict the universe
of potential new products to those 4-digit HS categories within the set of 2-digit HS
industries exported to by the firm in the P re period.19 The resulting number of potential
new firm-product-destinations is 4,161,451. Despite the restrictions, this number is large
relative to the actual new entries: in the P re period, the probability of entering a new
market is 0.5% (i.e., the fraction of potential new firm-product-destinations in the year
before the P re period in which an entry occurs).
     Since entry and exit represent changes in the exporting status at the firm-product-
destination level, we cannot first-difference equation (4) to eliminate the firm fixed-effect,
δi . Therefore, we estimate the equation in levels, including the firm dummies that control
for any time-invariant characteristic of the firm and product-destination-time dummies,
αpdt , that control for changes in demand, international prices, etc. Credit supply to firm
i is instrumented with Fi × P ostt , defined in equation (10).
     The results are presented in Table 6. Changes in credit supply do not significantly
affect the extensive margin. This finding holds for both exit and entry and for both IV
and OLS estimation.


4.5     Effect on Freight Characteristics and Trade Credit
Firms may adjust other dimensions of their export activity when subject to a negative
credit shock. In this subsection, we explore the effect of a decline in credit supply on freight
policies and the trade credit conditions with the importer. We estimate specifications
based on (11), using the following left-hand-side variables: (i) change in frequency of
shipments for a firm-product-destination export flow, ∆ ln(ShipF reqipd ); (ii) change in
the average size of shipments (in volume) for a given export flow, ∆ ln(ShipV olipd ); (iii)
change in the average shipment value ($FOB) for a given flow ∆ ln(ShipV alipd ); (iv)
change in the fraction of the annual flow (value FOB) transported by air, as opposed to
sea and ground, ∆ ln(F racAiripd ); and (v) change in the fraction of the annual flow (value
FOB) paid in advance by the importer ∆ ln(F racCashipd ).
  19
    The universe of products and destinations considered here corresponds to any 4-digit HS category or
country ever exported to by a Peruvian firm during our sample period.

                                                  16
    Table 7 shows the results. A negative shock to credit supply is found to reduce the
frequency of shipments, with elasticity 0.11, significant at the 1% level (column 1). Firms
also react by reducing the size of the shipment, both in value and in volume, with elasticity
0.085 and 0.106, respectively (columns 2 and 3).
    Holding the product and the destination constant, firms do not increase the share
of exports shipped by air (as opposed to sea or ground) after a negative credit supply
shock (column 4). Finally, the fraction of the transaction value paid in advance by the
importer is sensitive to the decline in credit supply (column 5). However, the magnitude
of the effect is economically small: A 10% reduction in bank lending triggers an increase
of 0.24% in the fraction of the shipment paid in advanced by the importer. This result is
consistent with the findings in Antras and Foley (2014), who document stickiness in the
terms of the trade credit contracts between established trade partners during the 2008
financial crisis.


4.6    Identification and Robustness Tests
As mentioned in Section 3, the elasticity estimates are biased if firms associated with
banks with high foreign funding experience a disproportionate negative shock to exports,
relative to other firms exporting to the same product-destination for reasons other than
bank credit. This could occur, for example, if firms that borrow from exposed banks
export products of a higher quality (within the same 4-digit HS code), and the demand
for higher-quality products dropped more during the crisis. It could also occur if firms
with high foreign-currency-denominated funding borrow from banks with high foreign
funding, and the capital flow reversals affect the balance sheet of firms directly and not
through bank lending. In this section, we perform identification tests to account for
potential shocks correlated with bank affiliation.
    In the first identification test, we estimate the elasticity of the intensive margin, mea-
suring exports in dollar FOB values. If the identification assumption is violated because
there are demand or input price changes within product-destination markets that are
correlated with bank affiliation, these changes should be reflected in prices, and, as a
result, the elasticities measured in export volumes should be different than the elastic-
ities measured in values. On the contrary, if firms exporting to the same market face
price changes that are orthogonal to their bank affiliation, then the product-destination
dummies should absorb these effects, resulting in the same estimates of export elasticities
whether measured in volume or value. The result in Panel 1 of Table 8 confirms that
the volume and value elasticities are of the same order of magnitude and statistically
indistinguishable.
    Next, we test whether narrowing the definition of an export market or whether consid-
ering only homogeneous goods changes our elasticity estimates. Panel 2 shows the export
elasticity to credit when products are aggregated at the HS 6-digit level. This speci-
fication controls for shocks in 8,568 distinct product-destination markets, reducing the
scope of quality difference within each market. We find that our estimates are effectively
unchanged.

                                             17
    In Panel 3, we restrict the sample to export flows of homogeneous goods only, according
to the product classification in Rauch (1999). These goods are considered to be less
differentiated in terms of quality and other potential unobservable characteristics. We
find that the elasticities of the intensive and extensive margins are statistically identical
to those in the baseline regression.
    An alternative way to test for unaccounted shocks correlated with bank affiliation is
to explicitly control for them. In the fourth identification test, we augment equations (11)
and (4) using a set of observable firm and export flow characteristics in the P re period as
control variables: average unit price of exports at the firm-product-destination level; aver-
age fraction of debt denominated in foreign currency; total exports; number of products;
and number of destinations at the firm level. Including these pre-determined variables
in the first differenced specification (11) is equivalent to including them interacted with
time dummies in the panel specification in levels. Thus, this augmented specification
controls for heterogeneity in the evolution of exports after the crisis along the dimensions
of product quality (high unit price within a 4-digit HS classification), firm external expo-
sure, and firm size. The elasticity of the intensive margin and of the extensive margin are
statistically indistinguishable from the baseline regressions. (Panel 4, Table 8).
    In Panel 5, we expand the P ost-period to include 24 months after the capital flow
reversal in July 2008. The result on the intensive margin is not significantly different from
the baseline regression. The probability of entering a new product-destination market, on
the other hand, is significantly affected by the credit shock when the period of analysis
is extended to two years after the shock. Evaluated at the average probability of entry
in the P re period, 0.5%, a 10% drop in credit supply reduces the probability of entry by
only 0.01 percentage points, to 0.49%.
    In Panels 6 and 7, we test the robustness of the results to the definition of the instru-
ment. We verify that the results are not sensitive to the date at which we measure the
share of foreign funding of the banks or the firm composition of credit across banks. In
our baseline regressions, we define this measure according to figures from December 2006,
prior to the reversal of capital flows. In Panel 6, the instrument is defined according to
bank and firm figures from December 2007, at the peak of the foreign capital inflows. In
Panel 7, we alter the functional form of the instrumental variable. Credit is instrumented
with a 3-degree polynomial on the average
                                        P foreign funding of the firm’s lenders, weighted
by the firm’s outstanding debt: Fi = b ωib F Db (the first stage is shown in Table 4, col-
umn 3). In all cases, the elasticities are statistically undistinguishable from the baseline
results in Tables 5 and 6. In Panel 7, the elasticity of the exit margin is different from
zero at the 10% level.
    Finally, we explore the possibility that firms associated with exposed banks were sim-
ply on a different export and borrowing growth path before the crisis. If this was, in
fact, the case, our estimates could be capturing such pre-existing differences across the
two groups of firms and not the effect of the credit shock. We perform the following
placebo test: we estimate equations (11) and (4) lagging the debt and export measures
one year, as if the capital flow reversals had occurred in 2007 instead of 2008. That is,
for t = {P re − 1, P re}, where P re is, as above, the period July 2007-July 2008, and


                                             18
P re − 1 corresponds to the previous 12 months. The elasticities of both the intensive
and extensive margins of exports, reported in Panel 8 of Table 8, are not statistically
different from zero. This confirms that firms borrowing from banks with a high share of
foreign funding as of December 2006 did not face any differential credit supply prior to
the crisis. And, correspondingly, their exports’ performance was not different from that
of firms linked to banks with a low share of foreign funding.
    Overall, the results in in this section suggest that our empirical approach obtains
unbiased estimates of the elasticity of exports to credit. In other words, after conditioning
on product-destination shocks to exports, a firm’s affiliation to a bank with a high share
of foreign funding is orthogonal to other non-credit determinants of exports.


4.7    Discussion of the Results
Our results are consistent with models of heterogeneous firms —as in Melitz (2003)—
expanded to allow for multi-product output and exports, as in Bernard et al. (2011) and
Nocke and Yeaple (2014). A firm decides to export a product to a destination if the
corresponding flow of profits covers an initial entry cost. In this class of models, a shock
that affects the variable cost of production can generate a drop in the intensive margin
of exports in all those firm-product-destination flows that remain active. In other words,
our results are consistent with credit shocks affecting the variable cost of production, as
modeled in Feenstra et al. (2014) and Manova (2013). This is the case, for example, if
the credit shock implies an increase in the cost of external finance needed to pay inputs
in advance of receiving the revenues from production. Then, a deterioration in credit
conditions lowers the equilibrium size and profitability of each export flow, which, in
turn, may reduce the probability of entering new markets—as we find when the period of
analysis is extended to two years (Table 8, Panel 5). Similar results can also arise if the
credit shock affects the variable cost of exporting beyond that of production; however, we
show in Subsection 5.2 that we do not find evidence supporting this interpretation.
    Our results are not consistent with models in which credit is used to pay only the
entry or fixed cost of exporting, as in Chaney (2005) and Caggese and Cuñat (2012), or
the fixed capital investment, as in Brooks and Dovis (2012) and Leibovici (2013). In those
models, credit shocks affect the entry decision but not the intensive margin of exports.
Needless to say, our results do not imply that those credit motives are not present. They
point to two different usages of credit, the finance of working capital of production and
the funding of physical investment.
    The fact that credit conditions affect the variable cost of production, rather than only
the fixed investment or entry cost, implies that short-lived credit shocks can have large
real economic consequences. First, if credit conditions affected only fixed investment or
entry cost, the real consequences would be small because capital is a stock variable and
it does not substantially vary with short-lived shocks. Second, shocks to entry costs
can hardly affect aggregate exports, which are accounted for mainly by existing large
exporters (marginal export flows due to the exit or entry of firms into export markets
are typically small). In contrast, shocks to the variable cost of production immediately

                                             19
affect the production and export decisions of both large and small firms. This is why
macroeconomic models aimed at studying the dynamic consequences of financial shocks
often include working capital in the production function (see, for example, Neumeyer and
Perri (2005)).


5      Assessment of Alternative Empirical Approaches
Our empirical strategy requires detailed and disaggregated data typically not available
in the literature that measures the effect of credit shocks on real economic activity. In
the absence of such data, researchers have relied on theory-motivated identification as-
sumptions that have not been tested empirically. The data and empirical strategy in this
paper allow us to test several of the key assumptions in existing empirical work. First,
we estimate the bias that would arise in our environment if we could not account for the
selection of firms to banks in terms of their mix of products and destinations. Second, we
analyze whether those variables typically used as proxy for export-specific funding needs
are, indeed, predictors of the elasticity of exports to credit. And, finally, we explore the
validity of the measure of external finance dependence—an industry-level indicator often
used in this literature—as a proxy for sensitivity of output to credit.


5.1     Firm-Bank Selection
Most of the work studying real effects of the bank transmission channel is constrained
to the analysis of firm-level outcomes, such as total sales, total exports, employment or
investment.20 The typical empirical strategy compares outcomes of firms related to banks
that are differentially affected by the crisis, and it implicitly assumes that banks and firms
are randomly matched. If, however, firms related to exposed banks specialize in certain
products or markets that are particularly affected by the crisis, then estimates based on
comparing the outcomes of firms related to exposed and non-exposed banks confound the
effect of the lending channel with the heterogeneous impact of the crisis across markets.
    We compute the bias that arises in our setting when we do not account for shocks at the
product-destination level. Column 1 of Table 9, presents the naive estimation of the elas-
ticity of exports (intensive margin) to credit, without including the product-destination
dummies. The naive estimator is off by a factor of two relative to the benchmark regres-
sion (our baseline estimate is shown in column 2 for comparison). This implies that firms
and banks are not randomly matched. In particular, in this case, firms borrowing from
exposed banks specialize in products and destinations less affected by the international cri-
sis.21 Thus, when non-finance shocks at the product-destination level are unaccounted for,
the overall importance of credit shocks in explaining output fluctuations can be severely
  20
     See, for example, Amiti and Weinstein (2011), Chodorow-Reich (2014), Carvalho et al. (2014), Iyer
et al. (2014), Jimenez et al. (2011), Kalemli-Ozcan et al. (2010), and Muûls (2012).
  21
     The bias is largest when there are no controls for changes in export demand across destination markets
(not shown).

                                                    20
misevaluated. In the present case, the bias would lead to the erroneous conclusion that
the negative credit shocks did not contribute to the Peruvian exports decline.


5.2    Export-Specific Funding Needs
Substantial fixed exporting costs can make exports more sensitive to credit than domes-
tic sales are, as changes in the exporter’s availability of credit may trigger discontinuous
changes in exports. Furthermore, international trade is characterized by longer freight
times and, thus, longer cash cycles than domestic sales. Based on this intuition, the em-
pirical literature uses distance to destination and freight speed (ground and sea versus
air) as indicators of export-specific working capital.22 In order to estimate export-specific
credit sensitivity, this approach compares the impact of credit on exports across destina-
tions of heterogeneous distance or across products typically shipped by different modes
of transportation.
    The results in the previous subsection already call for caution when deriving con-
clusions regarding the importance of credit in explaining output fluctuations based on
comparisons across sectors or destinations. This is so because products and countries are
subject to different non-credit disturbances. This empirical strategy confounds export-
specific sensitivity to credit with non-credit shocks disproportionately affecting certain
products or destinations. To further characterize the potential biases in such comparisons,
we present in Table 9, columns 3 through 8, cross-sectional differences in the estimated
elasticities by distance to the export destination market (Distd ); the share of the export
flow shipped by air, as opposed to ground and sea (Airipd ); and the share of the export
flow paid in advance by the importer (Cashipd ), with and without accounting for product-
destination shocks. The variables Distd , Airipd , and Cashipd are standardized P re period
values such that the interaction coefficients can be interpreted as changes in the elasticity
for a one-standard-deviation change in distance to destination, fraction of air freight and
fraction of cash in advance, respectively.
    Two main observations can be drawn from this exercise. First, the elasticity estimates
accounting for product-destination shocks do not vary in the cross-section by distance,
freight method, or method of payment (columns 4, 6, and 8). This indicates that the
difference in working-capital requirements induced by heterogeneity along these export
dimensions does not have a first-order effect on the export elasticity to credit. Since we
do not have data on domestic sales, we cannot conclusively compare the credit elasticity
of exports and local sales. Still, we can confirm that the sensitivity of exports to credit
shocks does not vary significantly with variables that typically proxy for export-specific
financial needs in our setting.
    The second observation is that when product-destination shocks are not accounted
for, the interaction terms for method of payment and freight method become statistically
significant (the interaction with distance remains insignificant). Hence, the estimates
would erroneously suggest that the sensitivity of exports to credit shocks increases if
 22
    See, for example, Amiti and Weinstein (2011), Leibovici and Waugh (2013), and Berman et al.
(2012)).

                                              21
the export flow is shipped primarily by air (column 5), and decreases if the importer
pays for the export flow in advance (column 7). This analysis confirms that empirical
approaches based on cross-destination and cross-sector comparisons may lead to incorrect
inferences about the real effects of credit shocks when demand factors are unaccounted
for. Moreover, the bias of the naive cross-sectional comparisons highlights that the modes
of payment and transportation are intimately linked with the nature of the exported good.
For example, products typically shipped by Air are presumably more expensive, and their
demand may have suffered disproportionately more during the crisis.


5.3       Sectoral Heterogeneity in Credit Intensity
Since the seminal work by Rajan and Zingales (1998), heterogeneity in the degree of
external finance dependence across sectors has been widely used to identify the effect
of credit constraints on long-term growth and the cross-country pattern of international
trade.23 It remains to be shown whether the same factors that affect the sensitivity of
exports to long-term finance can also predict the effect of short-term credit shocks. This
subsection explores that question.
    We analyze how our estimates of the export elasticities to credit shocks vary across
sectors with different external finance dependence. Our measure of external finance de-
pendence follows Chor and Manova (2012); it corresponds to the fraction of total capital
expenditures not financed by internal cash flows, according to cross-sectoral data on U.S.
firms. This measure is considered to represent technological characteristics of the sec-
tor that the firm belongs to. For example, according to this measure, textile mills that
transform basic fibers into fabric, intensively require external finance, while apparel man-
ufacturing firms that process that fabric into the final piece of clothing are considered less
dependent.
    We report in Table 10 the results of estimating the elasticity of exports to credit on the
intensive and extensive margins in equations (11) and (4), augmented with an interaction
with the (standardized) product’s external financial dependence. The elasticities of the
intensive and extensive margins do not vary with this measure.
    Our results suggest that the elasticities to short-term and long-term changes in fi-
nancial conditions capture different aspects of the firm’s use of credit. The measure of
external finance dependence may indicate the firm’s sensitivity to long-term credit condi-
tions, which is potentially related to the presence of important fixed investments or entry
costs. The elasticity of the intensive margin of exports to credit shocks, on the other
hand, appears to be related to the short-term needs of working capital.


6       Conclusions
This paper computes the elasticity of the intensive and extensive margins of export to
credit supply shocks. We find that changes in credit conditions affect the intensive margin
 23
      See, for example, Bricongne et al. (2012), Chor and Manova (2012), and Levchenko et al. (2010).

                                                   22
of exports, but do not significantly affect the extensive margin. They do have an effect
on the entry margin when the period is expanded to two years after the shock. These
results imply that short-lived credit shocks can have large real economic consequences.
This is because aggregate exports are hardly affected by the exit or entry of firms into
export markets, as these marginal export flows are typically relatively small. However,
variations in the intensive margin have first-order implications for aggregate figures.
    We use the estimated elasticities to perform a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the
contribution of finance to the overall export decline during the the 2008 crisis. Our
estimates are obtained from changes in credit according to the level of foreign funding of
commercial banks. Thus, to obtain a back-of-the-envelope calculation of the overall effect
of the credit shock to firms on the decline in exports, we must make an assumption about
the change in credit supply of non-exposed banks —i.e., banks with a share of foreign
funding below 10%. We make the simplifying assumption that the credit supply of non-
exposed banks is constant throughout the analysis period. This assumption produces
conservative estimates of the overall effect of credit if non-exposed banks also reduced
credit supply during the crisis. The opposite occurs if non-exposed banks expanded
credit supply to substitute for the unfulfilled demand by banks with higher share of
foreign funding.
    The estimates in Table 3 imply that banks with foreign funding above 10% reduced
credit supply by 16.8% relative to not-affected banks. They account for 30% of the total
credit to exporters during the 12 months before July 2008 (see Table 2). Given the above
assumption, these estimates imply that the total credit supply dropped by 5.1%. Using
the estimated intensive margin elasticities of 0.195 (see column 2, Table 5), this drop in
credit resulted in an average decrease in the volume of exports of 1%. Compared to the
total drop in the annual growth rate of the volume of exports between the P re and P ost
periods, 12.8 percentage points, this estimate implies that the credit shock can account
for approximately 8% of the missing volume of exports.
    Overall, the results in this paper show that credit has a first-order effect on the volume
of exports for firms that continued exporting to a given product and destination market.
However, the largest determinant of the Peruvian exports collapse during the 2008 crisis
is related to non-credit factors (e.g., international demand and prices). In our context,
failure to control for determinants of exports other than bank credit at the product-
destination level leads to severely biased estimates when studying the effect of a credit
contraction on exports. Our results suggest that estimates that rely on more-aggregated
data (e.g., outcomes at the firm or sector levels) should be interpreted with caution during
crisis episodes, which have potentially large and heterogeneous real effects across sectors
and countries.

Source: Export data are collected from the Peruvian tax agency. Data on foreign liabilities of the banking
sector are derived from bank balance sheets, which were collected from the Peruvian bank regulator.
Total bank foreign liabilities are defined as bank liabilities with institutions outside Peru. The vertical
line signals the P re and P ost periods, which correspond to the 12 months before and after July 2008.

In panel (b) is the residual of a regression of change in (log) credit on a full set of firm fixed-effects:
ln CibP ost − ln CibP re = θi + ib . In both cases, the graph is a weighted local second-degree polynomial
smoothing of the share of banks’ foreign funding as of December 2006. The observations are weighted
using an Epanechnikov kernel with a bandwidth of 0.03.
