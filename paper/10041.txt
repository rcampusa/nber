A Model of R&D Valuation and the Design of Research Incentives

JEL No. G31, O32

                                           ABSTRACT

We develop a real options model of R&D valuation, which takes into account the uncertainty in the
quality of the research output, the time and cost to completion, and the market demand for the R&D
output. The model is then applied to study the problem of pharmaceutical under-investment in R&D
for vaccines to treat diseases affecting the developing regions of the world. To address this issue,
world organizations and private foundations are willing to sponsor vaccine R&D, but there is no
consensus on how to administer the sponsorship effectively. Different research incentive contracts
are examined using our valuation model. Their effectiveness is measured in the following four
dimensions: cost to the sponsor, the probability of development success, the consumer surplus
generated and the expected cost per person successfully vaccinated. We find that, in general,
purchase commitment plans (pull subsidies) are more effective than cost subsidy plans (push
subsidies), while extending patent protection is completely ineffective. Specifically, we find that a
hybrid subsidy constructed from a purchase commitment combined with a sponsor co-payment
feature produces the best results in all four dimensions of the effectiveness measure.

I. Introduction

There are three diseases, which kill more than five million people in the developing

regions of the world. They are malaria, tuberculosis and African strains of AIDS.

Multinational pharmaceutical companies have not devoted sufficient resources to develop

vaccines for these diseases.1 The reason is simple: those who need the vaccines most

cannot pay for them. As a result, pharmaceutical companies cannot justify undertaking

expensive drug research for these small markets. Aware of this problem, international

organizations and private foundations have expressed willingness to provide funding to

support vaccine research. There are various ways in which sponsor organizations can

provide for these funds. The literature on pharmaceutical R&D has provided qualitative

discussions and anecdotal evidences on the effectiveness of different sponsorship

methods.2 In particular, sponsorship arrangements, which involve subsidizing 1. the cost

of R&D investments (push) and 2. the income of the R&D output (pull) have received

most of the attention

        However, currently, there is no analytical framework available for analyzing the

advantages and disadvantages of the different research sponsorship programs.3 To fill

this gap, we develop, in this paper, an R&D valuation model, which allows us to study in

a more quantitative manner, the effectiveness of different research sponsorship programs.

        R&D investments lend naturally to valuation by the real options method. Pindyck

(1993) provides a model for valuing projects with uncertain cost to completion. The

innovation is the realization that the firm can learn about the difficulty of the research

project as it invests. Learning, in this setting, occurs through undertaking the R&D and

incurring research expenses. Consequently, the research effort provides double benefits.

On one hand, it produces intermediate R&D outputs; on the other hand, it helps the firm

determine the difficulty of completing the research project (the expected remaining time

and cost to completion), allowing the firm to optimally abandon the effort if necessary.

The learning and the option to abandon make the valuation problem different from

standard valuation analysis. Schwartz and Moon (2000) extend the analysis to include

uncertainty in project revenue and the possibility of catastrophic events, which disrupt the

research effort. Miltersen and Schwartz (2002) further introduce strategic competition in

a duopolistic market to the valuation framework.

       One crucial feature of the R&D process, the quality of the research output, has,

however, been ignored thus far in the literature. Traditionally, the literature abstracts

from the quality variable to model, instead, an exogenous revenue process for the R&D

output. While the revenue from the R&D is certainly related to the quality of the R&D

output, it is also predicated on the firm’s pricing strategy, which depends on the

competitive structure of the product marketplace and the revenue subsidy or tax incentive

offered. Therefore, an exogenous revenue specification prevents the analysis of firm

responses to different research incentives. We address this issue by modeling the quality

variable explicitly. The revenue arising from the sales of the R&D output is then a

function of the firm’s pricing strategy given the market demand and the subsidy program

in place.




                                             3
       We apply our valuation framework to analyze several incentive programs,

reviewed in Kremer (2002b,c), for encouraging pharmaceutical R&D in diseases

affecting the developing countries. Using realistic parameters, we find that the small

market problem is so severe that the granting of extremely favorable patent protection

could not stimulate vaccine R&D.

       Push subsidy programs, which subsidize research investment cost, can induce

research activities with low expected cost to the sponsor. Full discretionary research

grants can induce research at very low sponsor costs; however, they do not encourage

high R&D intensity, resulting in disappointingly low probabilities of successful vaccine

development.   Sponsor co-payment contracts, which require higher sponsor costs to

induce research, produce significantly higher probabilities of successful vaccine

development; co-payments represent the most cost effective contracts, studied in this

paper, for increasing research output. However, because the pharmaceutical firm retains

the right to the developed vaccine under a push subsidy, the quantity supplied is lower

than what is socially optimal, which results in low consumer surplus generated.

       Pull subsidy programs, which commit to paying high prices for the developed

vaccine, are comparably more expensive methods for stimulating research. However, the

pharmaceutical company can be contracted to supply the socially efficient quantities.

This feature greatly increases the benefit delivered per dollar cost to the sponsor.

Moreover, a hybrid subsidy combining both a purchase commitment subsidy and a co-

payment subsidy delivers better results than either subsidy program can independently.

       Measured in the dimensions of sponsor cost, vaccine development probability,

consumer surplus, and cost per individual successfully vaccinated, we find hybrid




                                            4
subsidy contracts slightly outperform pure purchase commitment contracts, which in turn,

significantly outperform sponsor co-payment contracts. In addition, full discretionary

research grants are largely ineffective, while patent extensions are completely ineffective.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follow. Section II introduces the R&D

valuation framework and the technique required for solving the valuation problem.

Section III discusses the problem of pharmaceutical under-investment in research on

diseases, which primarily affect the developing countries and illustrates this problem

explicitly with our valuation model.      Section IV analyzes different types of R&D

incentive programs that have been proposed in the literature.           Finally, section V

concludes the paper.

II. A Model for Valuing R&D Projects

In this section we develop a model for valuing general research and development

projects. We offer first a description of the R&D process that we have in mind. This is

then made precise when we formalize the model in the subsequent sections.

Overview of the Firm’s R&D Valuation Problem

We consider a firm with either a single R&D project or a portfolio of on-going R&D

projects and R&D opportunities. If the firm in consideration owns a portfolio of R&D

projects, we assume that the externalities created by one project on the rest of the R&D

portfolio is sufficiently insignificant to allow for the valuation of each R&D project

independently. Prior to engaging in the project, the firm assesses the expected quality of

the final output of the R&D as well as the revenue associated with marketing the product.

In addition, it assesses the expenses that will be incurred from the R&D and the




                                             5
production of the product. The firm then decides whether to undertake the new R&D

project or not.

        The firm’s investment decision rule, however, is complicated by its option to

abandon the project at any stage of the development. As the firm commits its resources

to research and develop the product, it also learns about its ability to successfully

complete the R&D and to produce a quality and profitable product. Specifically, at

different stages of the development, the firm revises its expectation on the time required

(and therefore the cost required) to complete the R&D, the quality of the final research

output, and the revenue from bringing the product to market. Based on the updated

expectations, if continuing the R&D is unlikely to lead to profit, the firm abandons the

project and cut its losses.

        The firm’s R&D valuation problem is, therefore, a “real options” problem. The

optimal abandonment policy in our model, which is not possible to solve for in closed-

form, is approximated very efficiently through the application of the least square

procedure developed by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001).           Once the optimal policy

function is solved for, the valuation of the R&D project is straightforward.

        We now introduce the model formally. We present the timeline of the model in

Figure 1 to help the reader visualize the firm’s R&D process.            For simplicity of

exposition, we assume that the project is divided into 3 distinct phases. Phase I and

Phase II represent preliminary and advanced stages of research and development

respectively, while Phase III is the sales and marketing phase. The generalization to M

phases is straightforward.    In addition, the firm is assumed to make abandonment

decision only at the beginning of each phase with the information acquired from the




                                             6
completion of the previous phase. This assumption is not crucial and can again be easily

extended to accommodate less discrete abandonment policies.

Rate of Investment

For Phase I and II of the R&D, the firm is assumed to commit a constant rate of

investment of I1 and I2, respectively, to the research effort. In some cases, the firm may

wish to change its rate of R&D investment as it learns more about the prospect of the

project; however, for simplicity, we assume that I1 and I2 are exogenously determined and

fixed through each R&D phase.          Under our current assumption, I1 and I2 are

parameterized from the observed research investment intensities common for the type of

project in question. For example, if we wish to value a pharmaceutical vaccine project

(which we do later in this section), we would estimate the rate of R&D expenditure for

Phase I and Phase II by examining the industry average expenditures devoted to the bio-

chemical compound development and the subsequent stages of clinical trials respectively.

Expected Time and Costs to Completion

We now introduce the variables associated with the cost and the time for completing each

phase of the R&D. Let

       τ 1 = the total (random) time needed for completing Phase I R&D,

       τ 2 = the total (random) time needed for completing Phase II R&D,

       τ = τ 1 + τ 2 = the total (random) time needed for completing the entire R&D

       project.

Further we define

       K1 (t ) = time t conditional expected remaining cost for completing Phase I R&D,

       K 2 (t ) = time t conditional expected remaining cost for completing Phase II R&D,


                                            7
        K (t ) = K1 (t ) + K 2 (t ) = time t conditional expected remaining cost for completing

       the entire R&D project.

Since the rates of investment are constant, the R&D cost and the R&D time are one-to-

one mappings of each other; we can choose to characterize either K1 and K 2 or τ 1 and

τ 2 . We choose to model the stochastic processes of the conditional expectations K1 and

K 2 , which is more natural in our context.

       We follow, in spirit, the modeling of cost uncertainty in irreversible investment

projects described in Pindyck (1993).            The dynamics of the conditional expected

remaining costs to completion are:

                       dK1 (t ) = − I1 dt + σ 1 dW1 (t ) , for 0 < t < τ 1 ,           (1)

                       dK 2 (t ) = σ 2 dW2 (t ) , for 0 < t < τ 1 ,                    (2)

and

                       dK 2 (t ) = − I 2 dt + σ 2 dW2 (t ) , for τ 1 < t < τ ,         (3)

where dW1 and dW2 are Brownian motions and are assumed to be uncorrelated with the

market portfolio returns, such that the true and the risk-adjusted process are the same. In

addition, the instantaneous correlation between dW1 and dW2 over 0 < t < τ 1 is ρ dt .

       The interpretation for equation (1) and (3) is straightforward.           As the firm

continues to invest in the R&D, the expected remaining cost to completion decreases.

However, the firm also learns more about its ability to complete the project on time and

on budget. Prior to the beginning of Phase I, the firm expects that the total cost to

complete the Phase I research to be K1(0). Negative shocks to the R&D delay the Phase I




                                                  8
completion and increase the total development cost for the phase, while positive shocks

shorten development time and reduces the development cost.

           Equation (2), on the other hand, captures the idea that revisions in the firm’s

expectation on the cost for completing Phase I research also brings about revisions in the

Phase II expected cost to completion. Unexpected delays in Phase I suggest that the

firm’s resources in place may not be as suited for the development of the product as is

previously anticipated. This indicates that subsequent delays in Phase II are likely, thus

raising the conditional expected Phase II cost K2(t). Therefore K1 and K 2 are modeled

as joint diffusions over 0 < t < τ 1 with an instantaneous correlation of ρ dt .

           We note that the firm makes decision to abandon or continue the project only at

the beginning of each phase. Therefore, we only need to characterize the conditional

expected remaining costs at these discrete points in time—namely at times 0, τ 1 , and τ .

However, since K1 (0) and K 2 (0) are exogenously specified and K1 (τ 1 ) = 0 and K 2 (τ ) =

0 trivially, we need only to characterize K 2 (τ 1 ) .

           By definition, K1 (τ 1 ) = 0, therefore, τ 1 is the first time the diffusion K1 reaches

zero. The first hitting time density (which is not normal) of an arithmetic Brownian

motion with drift –I1 and volatility σ 1 starting at K1 (0) and reaching 0 is: 4

        Since the firm invests with a constant intensity, the total realized research

expenditure for Phase I R&D is I1τ 1 . The unexpected Phase I research cost is defined as:

                                     X 1 = K1 ( 0 ) − I1τ 1 ,                                                 (8)

which can be expressed as:

                                              τ1
                                     X 1 = ∫ σ 1 dW1 .                                                        (9)
                                              0


Similarly, the revision in the expected research cost for Phase II is defined as:

                                     X 2 = K 2 ( 0 ) − K 2 (τ 1 ) ,                                           (10)

which can also be expressed as:

                                               τ1
                                     X 2 = ∫ σ 2 dW2 .                                                        (11)
                                               0


Since dW1 and dW2 are correlated, we can decompose dW2 into two orthogonal Brownian

motions and rewrite (11) as:


        X2 = σ2 ∫
                  0
                    τ1

where dW1 and dZ2 are orthogonal, and Z2( τ 1 ) is a normal random variable with mean

zero and variance τ 1 . Rearranging (10) and substituting (8) and (12), we have:

variance (1 − ρ 2 ) ⋅ σ 2 2 ⋅ τ 1 .

Quality of Research Output

We now introduce the variables that characterize the quality of the final research output.

We define:

          Q(τ ) = the quality of the final product at the completion of the entire R&D

          project.5

We then define:

          Q(t ) = Et [Q(τ ) ] = time t conditional expected quality of the final product.

Again, it is only necessary to characterize Q (t ) at times 0, τ 1 , and τ . This time we do

not model the stochastic process of Q(t ) ; instead, we conveniently model Q(t ) as draws

from a Beta distribution, which has support over [0,1]. This maps naturally into the

standard intuition of product quality (and certainly seems more appropriate than

unbounded distributions—for situations in our analyses). A developed product, which

falls miserably short of the specifications of the development objective, would have a

quality index near 0. While a product, which meets most of the specifications, would

have a quality index near 1. For a pharmaceutical vaccine development project, Q(τ )

could be interpreted as the efficacy of the developed vaccine. A vaccine, which is

effective for 90% of the subjects being immunized, would have Q(τ ) = 0.9.

 We assume that this quality variable, being a technical factor, is also uncorrelated with the market
portfolio and therefore the true distribution and the risk-adjusted distributions are the same.


                                                     11
        As mentioned before, unexpected delays in the R&D implies that the firm’s

resources in place and its particular approach toward development may not be as suited as

is initially anticipated—thus leading to an increase in the subsequent expected research

expenditure. The delay could also lead to a similar revision in the expected quality of the

final product. Therefore the mean of the distribution for Q(τ 1 ) and Q(τ ) could depend

negatively on the shock delays occurring in Phase I and Phase II R&D respectively.

Furthermore, the variance of the distribution could also depend on the amount of learning

that can occur during the R&D. If the firm does not learn much about its R&D prospect

in the current phase, it cannot revise its expectation on the quality of the final output.

        The probability distribution of product quality can then be represented by the Beta

density function:

                 ϕ (Q ) = c ( a, b ) Q a −1 (1 − Q )
                                                       b −1
                                                              ,   0 < Q < 1, 0 < a , 0 < b   (14)

             Γ (a + b)
where c =                    , and Γ ( ⋅) is the gamma function. The mean and variance of the
            Γ ( a ) Γ (b )

beta distribution is:

                                                          a
                                               µQ =                                          (15)
                                                         a+b

and:

                                                            ab
                                    σ Q2 =                              .                    (16)
                                             ( a + b ) ( a + b + 1)
                                                        2




However, the Beta distribution, due to the boundedness of it support, cannot admit any

arbitrary pair of mean and variance. Expressing the parameters a and b in terms of the

distribution’s mean and variance we have:




                                                         12

                                    µQ (1 − µQ ) − σ Q2 > 0 .                                (19)

Therefore the dependence of the mean and variance on the other parameters of the model

needs to be specified carefully to avoid non-admissible Beta distribution parameters.

        To allow for the probability distribution of product quality to depend on the

realized cost (or time) of a given phase, we parameterize its mean and variance to be

functions of the time to completion. The specific parameterization for the mean of the

expected quality variable we adopt is:

                                                                           ηµ ,i

where Q(τ i −1 ) is the expected final product quality prior to the start of phase i, and ηµ ,i is

the response parameter to the unexpected delay in research time.

        Note that, for ηµ ,i > 0, the mean, µQ (τ i ) , of the quality variable is decreasing in

the unexpected delay in research time, (τ i − Eτ i −1 [τ i ] ). When the realized Phase i research

time τ i is equal to the ex ante expected research time, Eτ i −1 [τ i ] , µQ (τ i ) is equal to the ex

ante expectation Q(τ i −1 ) . However when τ i > Eτ i −1 [τ i ] , we have µQ (τ i ) < Q(τ i −1 ) and

vice versa. Finally, we note that µQ (τ i ) is bounded between 0 and 1.

variable if there is no unexpected R&D delay, and ησ ,i is the response parameter to the

unexpected delay in research time. Note, σ Q2 (τ i ) is defined as a fraction of the maximum

admissible variance.

         Consistent with the notion that the more time available for learning about the

project the larger is the variance of the distribution of Q(τ i ) , the variance σ Q 2 (τ i ) of the

quality variable is increasing in the research time τ i . When the phase i research time τ i

is equal to the ex ante expected research time Eτ i −1 [τ i ] , the variance of the new expected

quality µQ (τ i ) is equal to the ex ante variance µQ (τ i ) (1 − µQ (τ i ) ) ⋅ s(τ i −1 ) . However, for

ησ ,i < 0 , when τ i > Eτ [τ i ] , σ Q 2 (τ i ) > µQ (τ i ) (1 − µQ (τ i ) ) ⋅ s(τ i −1 ) and vice versa.

Finally note that σ Q 2 (τ i ) is bounded between 0 and the maximum allowable variance

value µQ (τ i ) (1 − µQ (τ i ) ) .

Revenue from Sales of Product

When the R&D is completed the firm must assess whether to bring the product to market.

The revenue from the sales of the product will depend on the market demand for the

product given the quality and the firm’s pricing strategy. The firm, which is assumed to


                                                        14
have monopoly market power in this newly developed product through patent protection,

would set the monopoly price associated with the market demand. The firm is assumed

to own the patent for the product for a duration T; after which the patent expires and the

product marketplace becomes perfectly competitive, and the firm earns zero profit. Other

characterizations of the patent process such as the one described in Schwartz (2002) can

also be incorporated in our current framework.

           Since our model can accommodate any reasonable market inverse-demand

function, we do not restrict ourselves to a particular form here. A specific demand

function, however, will be assumed in the later section to illustrate our valuation

framework. For the moment we assume only that the inverse-demand function, P ( Q, q ) ,

is a function of the quantity supplied per unit time, q, and the quality of the product, Q.

In addition, we assume a unit production cost function c ( Q, q ) . The firm’s maximizing

behavior leads to the following (monopoly) condition:

                                     ∂ ( ( P − c) ⋅ q )
                                                          = 0.                         (22)
                                            ∂q

With the monopoly condition and the market inverse-demand function, we can solve for

the monopoly price PM and quantity qM . The profit rate is then ( PM − c ) ⋅ qM .

           It would be straightforward to add a demand shock to this framework. A

multiplicative demand shock following a geometrical Brownian motion would make the

inverse-demand function stochastic.6               Since demand shocks are correlated with the

market portfolio, this state variable would have a risk premium associated with it and the




6
    See for example Miltersen and Schwartz (2002).


                                                          15
true and risk neutral distributions would not be equal. To simplify our presentation we

will not include demand shocks in our model.

Catastrophic Events

Finally, we introduce the possibility of a catastrophic event occurring during the lifecycle

of the product, which discontinues the R&D effort or forces the product to be withdrawn

from the market. Catastrophic events may include 1. firm financial distress, which causes

the project to be abandoned, 2. the departure of the lead scientists in the R&D effort, 3.

the introduction of a superior product by a competitor, or 4. safety hazards created by the

product which causes the product to be withdrawn from the product market.

       We model these events as Poisson processes with possibly different intensities,

λ1 , λ2 , and λm , in the different phases. As shown by Brennan and Schwartz (1985), if

these processes are independent from each other and uncorrelated with the market (no

risk premium associated to them) they simply enter into the analysis through increasing

the discount rates. Consequently, the effects of these Poisson events only show up in the

discounting of the cash flows through inflating the discount rate by the hazard rate.

Discount Rates

For simplicity, we assume that the risk free rate, r, is constant. As is usual in the real

option literature, we discount risk-adjusted cash flows at r instead of physical cash flows

at the risk-adjusted discount rate. We have assumed that the R&D expenditure and the

product quality processes described before are uncorrelated with the market portfolio and

therefore have no risk premiums attached to them and therefore do not require risk

adjustment. A stochastic market demand function (which is necessarily correlated with

the market portfolio) can be incorporated without much difficulty. We need simply



                                            16
adjust the λ1 , λ2 , and λm to reflect the appropriate risk premium associated with the

revenue.

Valuation and Abandonment at Time τ = τ 1 + τ 2

With the model now fully specified, we are ready to solve the firm’s optimal

abandonment policy and the R&D valuation problem. We start solving the model from

the firm’s last decision node, which occurs at the end of Phase II (time τ ). At the end of

Phase II, the firm evaluates the time τ discounted expected profit, v(τ ) , from bringing

the product to market. The required inputs for evaluating v(τ ) are the patent life of the

product and the firm’s forecasted monopoly rate of profit, associated with the forecasted

market inverse-demand function P(Q, q ) and the unit cost function c(Q, q) . Since the

market demand function and the unit cost of production are assumed exogenous in our

model, v(τ ) depends entirely on the quality parameter Q(τ ) and can be computed by:

                       v (τ ) = ∫       ( PM   − c ) ⋅ qM ⋅ e − ( r + λm ) t dt ,
                                    T
                                                                                    (23)
                                0


where, again, the subscript M indicates the monopoly solution to the firm’s profit

maximizing problem characterized by (22).

       Here, the firm’s optimal abandonment policy is simple. If v(τ ) is positive, the

product is brought to market; otherwise the product is abandoned. Note, that the firm

chooses the quantity supplied optimally. Therefore, we do not need to additionally

characterize the abandonment policy since it is contained in the firm’s choice variable

qM . That is, the time τ present value of the R&D project given the option to abandon is:

                      V (τ ) = 1{v(τ ) > 0} ⋅ v(τ ) = v(τ ) ,                       (24)




                                                          17
where 1{v(τ ) > 0} is the firm’s policy function (an indicator function) which takes on the

value 1 when v(τ ) > 0 , and 0 otherwise.

Valuation and Abandonment at Time τ 1

Moving backward one decision node, at the end of Phase I (time τ 1 ), the firm decides

whether to commence Phase II R&D. Based on the progress made in Phase I, the firm

now has a new expectation Q(τ 1 ) on the final quality of the product and hence an

expectation of the profit from the sales of the product.                                   The firm also has a new

expectation K2( τ 1 ) on the additional R&D expense from Phase II development. The firm

would continue with the R&D if the time τ 1 discounted expected profit v(τ 1 ) (profits

from sales minus the Phase II R&D cost), for continuing is positive. We compute v(τ 1 )

by:

                v (τ 1 ) = E ⎡V (τ ) ⋅ e − ( r + λ2 )τ 2 − ∫ I 2 e − ( r + λ2 ) t dt Q(τ 1 ), K 2 (τ 1 ) ⎤ .
                                                            τ2
                                                                                                                 (25)
                             ⎢⎣                             0                                            ⎥⎦

The firm’s policy function is to abandon the project at the end of Phase I R&D if

v(τ 1 ) ≤ 0 and to continue with Phase II R&D if v(τ 1 ) > 0 . The present value of the

project at time τ 1 is then:

                                       V (τ 1 ) = 1{v(τ 1 ) > 0} ⋅ v(τ 1 ) ,                                     (26)

where 1{v(τ 1 ) > 0} is the firm’s policy function which takes on the value 1 when

v(τ 1 ) > 0 , and 0 otherwise.

        However, unlike v(τ ) , the conditional expectation v(τ 1 ) , which is a function of

the state variables Q(τ 1 ) and K 2 (τ 1 ) , cannot be computed in closed-form.                                Using the




                                                             18
Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) least-square numerical technique we can estimate an

approximate function for v(τ 1 ) very simply and rapidly. With the approximated v(τ 1 ) ,

we can then solve the time τ 1 R&D present value function defined in equation (26). The

additional benefit of applying a numerical solution is the flexibility it allows in the

modeling of the market demand function, the unit cost function, the distribution of the

conditional expected quality variable, and the stochastic process of the conditional

expected cost variables. All of the above functions and processes can be modified from

what is assumed in this paper to model other R&D processes, and the numerical

technique developed here applies regardless.                       We describe the numerical solution

technique in greater detail in the Solution Procedure section that follows.

Valuation and Abandonment at Time 0

At time 0, prior to beginning Phase I R&D, the firm bases it decision to commence R&D

on its priors on the quality, Q(0) , of the eventual product and the expected research costs

K1(0) and K2(0). The time 0 discount expected profit, v(0) , can be computed as:

The firm gains v(0) in present value if it undertakes the project. However, since the firm

rationally foregoes the R&D when v(0) < 0, the value of the project to the firm is:

                                    V ( 0 ) = max[v(0), 0] .                                                 (28)

Unlike the time τ 1 conditional expectation v(τ 1 ) , which is a random function of the state

variables Q(τ 1 ) and K 2 (τ 1 ) , the time 0 conditional expectation v(0) is a constant and

can be computed simply by evaluating the expectation.

Longstaff and Schwartz Least-Squares Solution Procedure

We apply the least-squares technique developed by Longstaff and Schwartz (2001) to

estimate the conditional expectation functions described in equation (25).                                  These

conditional expectations functions are needed to characterize the firm’s abandonment

policy functions, which are required to evaluate the R&D project.

         To proceed, we first simulate N independent paths (or evolutions) of the model

state variables. Specifically, each path j has three nodes labeled by time 0, τ 1 j , and τ j ,

with the associated state vector { Q(0) , K1 (0) , K 2 (0) }, { Q j (τ 1 j ) , K 2j (τ 1 j ) , τ 1 j }, and

{ Q j (τ j ) , τ j }.7 Recall that τ 1 j and τ j can be simulated using the distribution defined in

(5) and (7); K 2j (τ 1 j ) can be simulated using the conditional normal distribution defined

in (13); and Q j (τ 1 j ) and Q j (τ j ) can be simulated using the conditional Beta distribution

with mean and variance defined in (20) and (21).

         In the sections below, we solve first for the firm’s policy functions. After the

policy function at each decision node is determined, the valuation problem simplifies to

an exercise in taking simulated sample averages. Throughout, we use v(t) to denote the

present value of the project without the option to abandon at time t and V(t) to denote the

value when the option to abandon exists.

         After the state variables are simulated, we work backward and examine, first, the

present value of the R&D at time τ j for each of the N paths. As we mentioned before,

the time τ j present value V (τ j ) can be computed using (24) and (23) without any

complication. After computing V (τ j ) for each path j, we then proceed to compute:

7
 Note that at the first node, all paths have the identical set of state variables { Q(0) , K1 (0) , K 2 (0) }; since
no time has elapsed for the state variables to evolve.

The v% ( Q(τ j ),τ 2 j ) ’s are then projected onto our chosen basis functions to construct an

approximate function for the conditional expectation. Note that these basis functions

f1 ( Q(τ 1 j ), K 2 (τ 1 j ) ) ,L , f k ( Q(τ 1 j ), K 2 (τ 1 j ) )    may                include             higher   moments,     cross

moments, logs and exponentials of the state variables.                                                  The larger the set of basis

functions we use, and the more judiciously we select the basis functions, the more

accurate is the approximation. To determine the coefficients on the basis functions

selected, we regress the N (simulated) realized v% ( Q(τ j ),τ 2 j ) ’s onto these basis functions.

The fitted value from the regression equation vˆ(Q(τ 1 ), K 2 (τ 1 )) = X (Q(τ 1 ), K 2 (τ 1 )) ' β

(where X is the vector of the basis functions and β is the vector of estimated OLS

coefficients) provides a direct estimate of the conditional expectation v(τ 1 j ) . The time τ 1

policy function is then approximated by:

                                                             {
                                  1{v(τ 1 j ) > 0} ≈ 1 vˆ ( Q(τ 1 j ), K 2 (τ 1 j ) ) > 0 ,               }                       (31)

and the time τ 1 present value of the project is:


                                      {                                        }
                      Vˆ (τ 1 j ) = 1 vˆ ( Q(τ 1 j ), K 2 (τ 1 j ) ) > 0 ⋅ vˆ ( Q(τ 1 j ), K 2 (τ 1 j ) )                         (32)

          To compute the time 0 policy function we need to compute first the point

estimates for v(0):



                                                                      21
                        v% ( Q(τ 1 j ), K 2 (τ 1 j ),τ 1 j ) = Vˆ (τ 1 j ) ⋅ e − ( r + λ1 )τ1 − ∫ I1e − ( r + λ1 )t dt .
                                                                                             j   τ1 j

                                                                                                                              (33)
                                                                                                0


The same least-square projection technique is again applied to approximate the

conditional expectation from a set of basis functions of the state variables. However, we

note that at time 0, the values of the state variables do not vary across the N paths; no

time has elapsed for the state variables to evolve. Therefore the regression trivially

regresses the (simulated) realized v% ( Q(τ 1 j ), K 2 (τ 1 j ),τ 1 j , Q(τ 2 j ),τ 2 j ) ’s onto a constant.

Consequently, the expected discounted present value at time 0 is just the mean of the N

v% ( Q(τ 1 j ), K 2 (τ 1 j ),τ 1 j ) ’s:


                                                                 ⋅ ∑ v% ( Q(τ 1 j ), K 2 (τ 1 j ),τ 1 j ) .
                                                                1 N
                        vˆ ( Q(0), K1 (0), K 2 (0) ) =                                                                        (34)
                                                                N j =1

The time 0 policy function is then approximated by:

                                    1{v(0) > 0} ≈ 1{vˆ ( Q(0), K1 (0), K 2 (0) ) > 0} .                                       (35)

With the firm’s abandonment policy functions solved, we can evaluate the time 0 value

of the R&D project by Monte Carlo. Since we have created N simulated paths already,

the Monte Carlo approach can be executed with almost no additional effort:

            V ( Q(0), K1 (0), K 2 (0) )
                                                                                                                              (36)
            = 1{vˆ ( Q(0), K1 (0), K 2 (0) ) > 0} ⋅ v% ( Q(τ 1 j ), K 2 (τ 1 j ),τ 1 j , Q(τ j ),τ 2 j ) ,

        We have assumed throughout the discussion only three phases in the project

lifecycle. However, the extension to a more general case with M phases is quite natural.

The time 0 and τ valuation and abandonment would remain identical to the procedures

described above. For the intermediate τ i valuation and abandonment, where i = 1 to M-

1, we then apply the same procedure described above for the time τ 1 valuation and

optimal abandonment.

Illustrative Example

In this section we illustrate our model by valuing a pharmaceutical vaccine R&D project.

We simulate 50,000 independent evolutions of the state vector. The parameters of the

model are calibrated to demonstrate a realistic and interesting vaccine R&D in our fairly

simplistic setting. The model is certainly capable of accommodating more sophisticated

assumptions, however, we refrain from extensions for the clarity of exposition.

        We interpret the Phase I vaccine R&D as the bio-chemical compound

development stage, where the pharmaceutical company develops bio-chemical

compounds, which immunize against a particular infection. Phase II R&D would be the

clinical trials stage, where the vaccine is tested on human subjects to determine its

efficacy and side effects and to ultimately obtain FDA approval. We assume that the

patent life of the vaccine is 15 years and is granted upon obtaining FDA approval.8


8
  We have also computed the project assuming that the patent life begins at the time of the patent
application, which occurs just prior to the clinical phase for pharmaceutical products. This patent process
adds additional uncertainty to the revenue from the project, since the clinical phase may take significantly
more time than anticipated. However, this complication turns out to matter very little in the valuation of
the R&D project.


                                                             23
       For this example, the firm starts with a prior that its developed vaccine will be

75% effective ( Q(0) =0.75). Further, the expected Phase I development time is 2.5 years

with an annual research investment I1 = 20 million dollars, and the expected Phase II

development time is 4 years with an annual research investment I2 = 25 million dollars,

implying K1 (0) = 50 and K 2 (0) = 100 .       We note that the investment intensity for

medical R&D is often limited by how clinical trials can be conducted. Applying greater

R&D expenditure during the clinical phase would not materially improve the speed or

result of the clinical trials required for FDA approval.

       The volatilities of the expected cost to completion process for Phase I and II are 5

and 10 million dollars respectively.       We plot the sample density for the Phase I

development time τ 1 and for Phase II development time τ 2 in Figure 2 and 3. We note

that the distributions for τ 1 and τ 2 show some right skewness, which is sensible since

development time is bounded below at zero and unbounded above.

       The parameters, characterizing the evolution of the mean and variance of the Beta

distribution for the expected quality variables, Q(τ 1 ) and Q(τ ) , are selected to provide

reasonable distributions for the vaccine R&D project. The particular parameters for our

example are ηµ ,1 = 0.2 and ηµ ,2 = 0.05 (which control the sensitivity of the changes in the

mean of the quality variable to delays in the R&D time τ 1 and τ 2 ) ησ ,1 = -0.2 and ησ ,2 = -

0.05 (which control the sensitivity of the changes in the variance of the quality variable to

delays in the R&D time) and s1 =0.05 and s2 =0.02 (which control the level of the average

variance of the quality variable as a proportion of the maximum allowable variance). We

plot the time τ 1 Beta distribution for the quality parameter for the median, the 90



                                              24
percentile, and the 10 percentile path in Figure 4; and similarly for the time τ 2 Beta

distribution in Figure 5. Observe that the conditional mean of the quality distribution

diverges as time evolves, which captures the learning of the project quality over time. In

addition, the conditional variance decreases, which captures that the additional learning

in Phase II R&D is less than what can be learned in Phase I R&D. To further illustrate

the evolution of the quality variable, we plot the corresponding unconditional sample

density for Q(τ 1 ) and Q(τ ) in Figure 6 and 7. We observe that the unconditional density

of Q(τ ) has a greater variance than Q(τ 1 ) , which is intuitive since more is learned about

the project at time τ than at time τ 1 . In addition, we also observe that both densities

show strong left skewness, which is also intuitive since the support of the quality variable

is between [0,1] and the unconditional mean is set at 0.75.

       We assume the following market inverse demand function:

                       P = α ⋅ max(Q − Qmin , 0) 2 ⋅ q −1/ γ ,                       (40)

with α =1500, Qmin =0.7, and the demand elasticity γ =1.2. The market demand function

indicates that the consumers are unwilling to pay for a vaccine with efficacy lower than

70%. Further, we note that the price response to efficacy improvement is quadratic,

indicating a marginal willingness to pay that is increasing in the efficacy of the vaccine.

This strong preference for a single effective vaccine may be realistic when we consider,

for example, the cost and the inconvenience of requiring several less effective vaccine

injections administered over a span of time to achieve the same immunization efficacy.

       We illustrate the elasticity of the inverse demand function with respect to the

quality variable and the price variable jointly in Figure 8. We observe that at high

quantities, the market’s willingness to pay for improved vaccine efficacy is lower than at


                                                 25
low quantities. At 18 million units supplied, the marginal consumer is only willing to

pay an additional $2 per unit for the vaccine for a 5% improvement in efficacy (from

80% to 85%). However, at 4 million units supplied, the marginal consumer is willing to

pay an additional $5.5 per unit for the same 5% improvement in efficacy. The marginal

consumer in the first case is presumably less able to pay for the vaccine than the marginal

consumer in the latter case. Therefore, our inverse-demand function suggests that people

with less absolute wealth allocated for medical expenditures are also less able (or willing)

to pay for higher quality medical treatments. This is consistent with the health care

expenditure behavior reported in Kremer (2002a,b).

       Finally, to completely specify the firm’s problem, we assume a constant unit cost

of vaccine production, c = $1. This assumption is consistent with the observation that the

variable cost of production for medical vaccines is usually very low.

       We now compute the profits arising from the sales of firm’s vaccine (conditional

on a successful development). From monopoly condition specified in equation (22), the

firm’s pricing strategy is:

                                  γ
                        PM = c          = 6, (γ =1.2, c =1) , for Q > 0.7 ,            (41)
                                 γ −1

so the price of the vaccine, if it is marketed, would be $6 per unit, regardless of the

efficacy; the efficacy of the vaccine affects only the quantity demanded:
                                          γ
                     ⎡ α ⋅ (Q − Qmin ) 2 ⎤                     2 1.2
                qM = ⎢                   ⎥ = ⎡⎣ 250 ⋅ (Q − 0.7) ⎤⎦ , for Q > 0.7 .     (42)
                     ⎣       PM          ⎦

We then solve for the present value of the R&D project at time τ 1 ( V (τ 1 ) ). The set of

basis functions that we employ in this example include polynomials up to the third degree

of the two state variables K 2 (τ 1 ) and Q(τ 1 ) . We plot the surface diagram for V (τ 1 ) in


                                                 26
the Figure 9. The abandonment region for the parameters ( Q(τ 1 ) , K 2 (τ 1 ) ) is the region

where V (τ 1 ) takes on the value 0.

       We examine the impact of the abandonment decision on the probability of

successful vaccine development as well as the distribution of the quality parameter in the

following plots. From the probability density functions presented in Figure 10.1 and

Figure 10.2, roughly 53% of all R&D projects would be abandoned at the end of Phase I.

From the PDF’s presented in Figure 10.3 and figure 10.4, we find for the projects that are

continued into Phase II, only an additional 1.5% of them are expected to be abandoned.

       In our particular example, the firm expects to produce and sell 8.97 million

vaccines worldwide per year. The expected efficacy of the marketed vaccine is 83.97%.

The present value of the R&D project is 2.16 million dollars.

       It is interesting to note that given our inverse demand function, a vaccine with an

expected efficacy near 75%, at time τ 1 , would not be profitable; observe in Figure 10.2,

the minimum Q(τ 1 ) that is not abandoned appears to be just above 75%. Why then does

the firm undertake the project, considering the expected quality of its vaccine at time 0 is

only 75% efficacy? More surprisingly, why is the project positive present value? We

begin by pointing out that the marketed vaccine has an efficacy substantially higher than

what the firm, at time 0, expects to be able to achieve and substantially higher than the

minimum efficacy required by the market.           The twin observations should not be

surprising if we realize that the firm has the option to discontinue the project prior to

completion when the prospect of success is low. Therefore the R&D is only continued if

the expected efficacy is above a threshold, which in our case is substantially higher than

the minimum vaccine efficacy demanded by consumers. In the table below, we show the


                                             27
probability of the R&D project advancing to Phase II R&D and entering production as

well as the expected qualities.

          _________________________________________________________
              Probability of advancing to Phase II R&D = 46.75%

                 Probability of developing a successful vaccine = 45.19%

              Expected final efficacy (Q) of a successful vaccine = 83.97%
          _________________________________________________________

We see that 53.25% of all the commenced vaccine projects are abandoned after Phase I

results have been ascertained. The average efficacy of the continued project is 83.4 %.

After Phase II R&D, only an additional 1.56% of the projects are abandoned, while the

rest goes into production.

III. The Market for Vaccines

Malaria, tuberculosis, and African strains of AIDS are reported to kill almost five million

people each year. However, pharmaceutical companies have devoted few resources to

research vaccines for these diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports in

1996 that 50 percent of the global health R&D is undertaken by private pharmaceutical

firms.9 However, less than five percent of the total private heath R&D is geared toward

diseases, which specifically affect the under-developed and thus poorer regions of the

world. Pecoul, Chirac, Trouiller and Pinel (1999) report that less than 0.4% of the

licensed drugs in the last quarter century are for tropical diseases which affect primarily

the African, Latin American and South East Asian countries.

        The lack of private pharmaceutical R&D for diseases affecting under-developed

countries arise from the difficulty of marketing drugs profitably in these poorer regions of


9
 The government-sponsored research are usually basic research that are not expected to produce consumer
market health care products.


                                                  28
the world, where the per capita income is often less than 1/100th of the U.S. per capita

income and where the per capita annual heath care expenditure is $18 compared to more

than $4000 for the U.S. Kremer (2000) reports that a $250 million annual market is

needed to justify pharmaceutical firms to undertake research to develop cures, under the

current patent regulation. These revenues are simply not attainable from drugs targeted at

diseases specific to poor countries.

       We illustrate this problem explicitly in the valuation framework we developed in

Section II. Using model parameters identical to the example given in Section II, we

consider the value of a pharmaceutical R&D project with the following inverse-demand

function:

                       P = 200 ⋅ max(Q − 0.7,0)2 ⋅ q −1/1.8                       (43)

Namely, we increase the market’s demand elasticity γ (from 1.2 to 1.8) and shift the

demand downward (by reducing the constant scalar from 1500 to 200) to capture the

observation that people living in the developing regions of the world are simply unable or

unwilling to pay for vaccines at a price, which would make the vaccine R&D profitable

to the pharmaceutical company. Applying the valuation method developed in Section II

to a calibrated example of vaccine R&D, we find that undertaking the vaccine research

would result in significant losses for the pharmaceutical company.

       World organizations are interested in solving the pharmaceutical under-

investment problem described above. The World Bank announced in 2000 plans to

establish a $1 billion fund to subsidize the purchases of vaccines for developing

countries. The U.S. budget plan for 2000 included a ten year $1 billion tax credit

incentive program for pharmaceutical companies supplying vaccines to developing



                                              29
countries. However, the effectiveness of these subsidy programs has been questioned.

Kremer (2002a,b) documents spectacular failures of numerous sponsored R&D projects.

Moral hazard and adverse selection problems are prevalent, sometimes rendering subsidy

programs completely ineffective. How to effectively administer the subsidy and monitor

the progress of the R&D effort are important questions to be answered. However, the

difficulty in creating the right subsidy program may lie at an even more fundamental

level. There is in fact an absence of a convenient framework to contrast the effectiveness

of the different types of subsidy programs and to determine the required level of subsidy

to produce the desired level of R&D activity. We address the latter issue explicitly in the

next section by studying different popular incentive programs within our valuation

framework. We refrain largely from analyzing the issues of moral hazard and adverse

selection and only comments briefly on their impact when the analysis permits.

IV. Research Incentive Designs

In this section we compare different R&D incentive designs. Specifically, the study

focuses on two main categories of incentive programs that have been proposed in the

policymaking arena to encourage pharmaceutical vaccine research. The two types of

incentives programs, the push and the pull incentive programs, are analyzed below to

determine their costs to the sponsors and their contribution to social welfare.

       The push incentive program spurs vaccine development by reducing the cost of

the R&D to the developer. The cost subsidy may take on the form of full or partial

discretionary research grants or awards, where funds are awarded to the developer to

reimburse expenses, or as co-payments plans, where the sponsor pays for a fixed fraction

of the firm’s total R&D expenditure. The pull incentive program spurs research by




                                             30
increasing the revenue generated by the developed vaccine. The revenue subsidy can

occur as price (and quantity) commitments from the sponsor, where the sponsor and the

developer agree to a price schedule for the vaccine prior to development, or as special

patent extensions, where the developer is granted patent protection beyond the usual

length of time for pharmaceutical vaccines.

       We limit our analysis of the push program to the full discretionary award, where

the money is disbursed upfront immediately, and the co-payment plan. For the pull

program, we consider separately the patent extension plan and the purchase commitment

plan. We also consider, in addition, hybrid plans which combine revenue subsidy with

sponsor co-payment. Throughout the analysis, we seek to answer four critical questions.

1. What is the expected total cost of the incentive program to the sponsor? 2. What is the

probability that a viable vaccine will be developed? 3. What is the expected consumer

surplus generated? 4. What is the expected cost per individual successfully vaccinated?

In particular, in answering the last question, we develop a new summarizing measure

CPISV which addresses simultaneously the cost and benefit of a given subsidy program:

                                        PV (sponsor cost)
                              CPISV =                        ,                     (44)
                                         E [Q (τ ) ⋅ q ⋅ T ]

where again, Q (τ ) is the efficacy of the developed vaccine, q is the units of vaccination

supplied per year, and T is the number of years that the subsidy contract is in effect. The

CPISV measure allows us to compare across subsidy plans that have different expected

sponsor costs since it quantifies cost per unit of benefit delivered. More importantly, it

defines vaccine benefit differently from consumer surplus. Note that consumer surplus

measures benefit (or welfare) by the consumer’s dollar valuation of his consumption; this

measure ignores the large positive externality created by a successful vaccination. In


                                              31
contrast, CPISV measures vaccine benefit as the expected number of successful

vaccination, which assumes tacitly that each life saved is equally valuable and that each

successful vaccination provides identical external benefit to the society in terms of

stemming the infectious disease.

       In the analysis we abstract from agency problems arising from asymmetric

information between the vaccine developer and the sponsor. For example, we assume

that subsidies are actually invested in the vaccine project and not diverted to other use.

We also abstract from contracting issues, such as enforceability and renegotiation, related

to purchase commitment plans.

       We begin by introducing the exogenous environment.            We continue with the

example presented in section III, which is used to illustrate under-investment in

pharmaceutical R&D for diseases specific to poorer countries. In our specific example,

engaging in the proposed vaccine research would imply an expected loss in present value

to the firm. A sponsored subsidy program would therefore be needed to induce the

vaccine R&D.

       To help us contrast the different subsidy programs clearly, we assume throughout

that the firm retains the right to the developed vaccine. The firm is also allowed to

abandon the R&D project when it determines that further development would not be

profitable even with the agreed subsidy. We do not consider subsidy programs, which

transfer the ownership of the vaccine and the vaccine development process to the

sponsor, because, in general, public agencies lack the expertise to own, manage, and

distribute pharmaceutical resources effectively. Our aim is to solve the pharmaceutical

market failure in the poor countries by offering the proper level of incentives.




                                             32
       In the sections that follow, we first describe the specifics of each subsidy contract

considered in our analysis. We then characterize the pharmaceutical research outputs

induced by these subsidy contracts.

Push subsidy programs

a. Full discretionary award

We first consider the most simple-minded cost subsidy contract—the full discretionary

award. Under this contract, the sponsor awards a research grant to offset the firm’s cost

in the initial phase of the R&D. The vaccine developer, however, could abandon the

R&D effort after Phase I if further investment in the project would not lead to profit. Full

discretionary research grants are not unusual despite their potential for abuse.         In

particular, government sponsored research grants are often of this nature.

b. Investment cost co-payment plan

We then introduce the sponsor co-payment plan. The plan assumes that the sponsor pays

for X fraction of the firm’s per period research investment cost. That is, the firm incurs

only (1-X) I1 and (1-X) I2 in research cost per period in Phase I and II respectively,

instead of I1 and I2. Again, the firm is free to abandon the research effort when and if it

sees fit. Similar to the full discretionary award, the sponsor co-payment plan encourages

innovation in vaccine development by reducing the cost of research.

Pull subsidy programs

Kremer (2002b) concludes that pull subsidy programs would be more effective because it

largely eliminates the agency issues between the sponsor and the vaccine developer. We

illustrate in the analysis below that pull subsidy programs have many other advantageous




                                            33
attributes over push subsidy programs. However, not all pull subsidy programs can be

effective, and different contract designs can achieve different sponsor objectives.

c. Patent extension program

The patent extension program is the most widely used pull subsidy for encouraging

innovations in general.     Some economists and policy activists have argued that

strengthening patent protections or extending patent lives for pharmaceutical products in

under-developed countries would improve firms’ incentive to conduct research on

diseases specific to the developing countries (Kremer 2002b). There is little doubt that

better patent protection and longer patent life would improve the firm’s expected revenue

from the developed vaccine. However, does this mechanism deliver enough incentives?

We analyze the patent extension program in this section. Specifically, we assume that the

sponsor can grant the pharmaceutical company extra patent protection beyond what is

allowed under the current international patent agreement.          The increase in patent

protection allows the firm to enjoy monopoly power for an additional period of time,

leading to increased revenue from the R&D project.

d. Purchase commitment plan

Next, we analyze the purchase commitment plan. We assume that the sponsor commits

to a quantity-price purchase schedule with the vaccine developer. Under this price

subsidy plan, the cost side of the vaccine R&D to the pharmaceutical firm remains

unaffected, while the revenue side is altered by the purchase commitment.

       Under the purchase commitment plan, the sponsor observes the quality of the

firm’s developed vaccine at time τ . It then determines the socially optimal units of

vaccine to purchase from the pharmaceutical firm; the quantity that the pharmaceutical




                                            34
company is contracted to deliver is then only dependent on Q (τ ) . Lastly, it supplies the

vaccine to the target countries at the pharmaceutical firm’s unit cost of production c10.

The sponsor must design and commit to a price contract to induce the pharmaceutical

firm to engage in research. In the sections that follow, we study how different price

contracts can lead to different firm behaviors and outcomes. We limit our analysis to a

few types of price contracts. Extending the contract space beyond what is presented here

would be easy to do, but would not contribute to our understanding of the salient features

of the purchase commitment plan.

        The distinguishing feature of the purchase commitment plan is that the sponsor is

able to dictate the supply of the developed vaccine. With the discretionary award or co-

payment plan, the firm chooses to supply the monopoly quantity associated with the

measured market inverse-demand function:
                                            γ
                       ⎡ α ⋅ (Q − Qmin ) 2 ⎤
                  qM = ⎢                   ⎥ , for Q > Qmin = 0.7 , γ =1.8, α = 200.              (45)
                       ⎣       PM          ⎦

          Under a purchase commitment subsidy, however, the firm gives up its right to

extract monopoly rent in exchange for a purchase commitment at above market prices.

The firm is contracted to supply the socially efficient quantity qc , which is characterized

by the quantity such that the market-clearing price is equal to the marginal unit cost of

production (P = c):

                                            γ
                        ⎡α ⋅ (Q − Qmin ) 2 ⎤
                   qc = ⎢                  ⎥ , for Q > Qmin = 0.7 , γ =1.8, α = 200.              (46)
                        ⎣       c          ⎦




10
  For concreteness, here we assume that the sponsor sells the vaccine at the marginal cost c. The analysis
extends to any other sale price (or price schedule) including a price of 0.


                                                    35
d.1. Purchase commitment with a constant price schedule

We first analyze the simplest price contract—the constant price constract. Here the

sponsor is assumed to offer a fixed price P for any vaccine with an efficacy above the

minimum efficacy demanded by the market (70%). The revenue per year received by the

developer is therefore equal to P ⋅ qc , where qc is defined in (46). Since, the sponsor is

assumed to supply the vaccine to developing countries at the marginal cost of production

for the vaccine, it incurs a loss of (P - c) per unit of vaccine supplied. However, in the

event that the vaccine research is unsuccessful, the sponsor would incur no expenses.

       As we noted above, the constant price contract does not reward the developer

directly for the efficacy of the vaccine. However, the firm is rewarded indirectly with a

larger vaccine order, since the competitive quantity qc defined in (46) does depend on the

efficacy. As a result, the profit for the firm increases with the efficacy of the developed

vaccine.

d.2. Purchase commitment with a variable price schedule

We further consider a more complicated purchase commitment contract, where the price

offered to the firm depends on the efficacy of the vaccine supplied. One possible variable

purchase contract is specified below:

                               P = c + w ⋅ max ( Q − Qmin , 0 ) ,
                                                             δ
                                                                                     (47)

where w is a constant parameter specified ex ante by the sponsor to target expected cost,

δ is a parameter that describes the price sensitivity to the efficacy of the vaccine, and the

constant c is added to ensure that a viable vaccine receives a price greater than the

marginal cost of production. For the analysis presented below, we use a sensitivity




                                              36
parameter of 0.25. We note that the price schedule specified is chosen ad hoc; the

analysis, of course, can be performed in conjunction with other specifications.

Analysis of the Subsidy programs

We use the valuation model developed to help us characterize the research output

induced under different sponsorship contracts.       The more interesting statistics are

summarized in Table 1 and Table 2. In Table 1, the different push and pull contracts are

specified such that the pharmaceutical company is just willing to undertake the vaccine

R&D under the proposed subsidy program. Table 1 helps us assess the cost of inducing

research under each subsidy contract.      In Table 2, the push and pull contracts are

specified such that the expected cost to the sponsor is 80 million USD. Table 2 is helpful

for comparing the benefits created by the different subsidy contracts per expected dollar

expenditure.

       We do not report the results for the patent extension plan because it is completely

ineffective at solving the small market problem on hand.         Applying our valuation

technique we find that extending the patent protection to 1000 years does little to improve

the value of the vaccine R&D; even under the most favorable patent protection, no

developer would undertake this vaccine R&D. While increasing patent protection might

be the cheapest way (in a fiscal sense only) for the sponsor to provide incentives for

vaccine R&D, it is also completely effective method at solving this pharmaceutical

under-investment problem.

Cost to the Sponsor—From the Sponsor PV Cost reported in Table 1, we see that the full

discretionary award is the cheapest subsidy for spurring vaccine R&D, followed by the

co-payment plan and then by the constant price purchase commitment plan and finally by




                                            37
the variable price purchase commitment plan. The cost subsidy programs appear to

provide the fiscally cheaper solution to the under-investment problem than the price

subsidy programs.           In particular, a full discretionary award represents the cheapest

solution. However, from the Probability of Successful Development reported in Table 1,

we also see that a full discretionary award does not encourage high research intensity,

leading to very little R&D output (only 3.46% chance of developing a successful

vaccine). Upon further inspection we find that the benefits produced by the subsidy

contracts, in terms of consumer surplus and vaccine quantities supplied are increasing in

the expected sponsor costs. This makes contract comparison difficult, when both fiscal

and social considerations are important. We look instead, then, at Table 2, which holds

the cost to the sponsor constant, to help us compare the effectiveness of the subsidy

contracts.

Probability of Successful Vaccine Development—From Table 2, we see that the co-

payment plan produces the greatest probability for producing a viable vaccine, followed

by the variable price and the fixed price purchase commitment plan. As alluded to

before, the full discretionary award produces the lowest probability for producing a

successful vaccine. Under the co-payment plan the pharmaceutical company has the

incentive, at time τ 1 , to continue an R&D project that has a low expected final quality

Q (τ 1 ) , because it does not fully internalize the cost of Phase II R&D11; not surprisingly

the co-payment plan reports the highest probability (58.56%) of entering Phase II

development. Ultimately, this leads to significantly higher probability of developing a

successful vaccine. On the other hand, under the full discretionary award, the firm must


11
     The developer, under this plan, pays only 3.48% of the total R&D cost.


                                                      38
internalize the entire Phase II R&D cost. Therefore, it continues with R&D only if Q (τ 1 )

is very high, resulting in a probability of only 3.47% that the research is continued into

Phase II development.

       Under a purchase commitment plan, the pharmaceutical company must internalize

the full cost of the R&D also. However, the firm chooses to bear the cost of Phase II

R&D even when Q (τ 1 ) is low because the potential payoff from a viable vaccine is large

due to the price subsidy. The two purchase commitment contracts, nonetheless, elicit

different behaviors from the vaccine developer.       Under the variable price purchase

commitment plan, a high efficacy vaccine is rewarded with a higher price. By contrast,

the constant price purchase commitment plan offers the same price for vaccines, which

exceed the 70% minimum efficacy requirement. Therefore, under the variable price

contract, there is a substantially higher upside if the firm can produce a high quality

vaccine. The higher upside makes the firm more willing to continue with a lower quality

project, resulting in a higher probability of the R&D entering Phase II and therefore a

greater probability of eventually developing a successful vaccine.

Number of People Vaccinated—From Table 2 we find that the variable price purchase

commitment produces the largest expected units of vaccine supplied, followed by the

constant price purchase commitment, the co-payment plan, and finally the full

discretionary award.    The difference in the quantity supplied under a cost subsidy

contract and a price subsidy contract is intuitive.     Recall that the vaccine quantity

supplied, under a cost subsidy program, is the monopoly quantity; while the quantity

supplied, under a price subsidy program, is the competitive quantity. The difference in

the average quantity supplied for the full discretionary award and the co-payment plan is



                                            39
due only to the probability of developing a successful vaccine. This is similarly true for

the variable price vs. the constant price purchase commitment plan.

Consumer Surplus and Cost Per Successful Immunization—The consumer surplus is

increasing with the average quantity of the vaccine supplied in both Table 1 and 2. This

result is intuitive and suggests that contracts designed to increase the probability of

successful vaccine development and the quantity sold when a successful vaccine is

developed would produce greater consumer surplus. A direct implication from Table 2 is

that incentive plans designed to encourage R&D through granting monopoly rights would

not be favorable when consumer surplus is an important consideration.

       The cost per individual successfully vaccinated (CPISV) provides another useful

statistic for measuring the benefit provided by the subsidy relative to the cost. Different

from the computation of consumer surplus, the individual’s valuation of the vaccine is

ignored in the CPISV computation. Instead the statistic focuses on the efficacy of the

vaccine and the number of people who receive the vaccination. This statistic is useful

and may be more useful than the consumer surplus statistic because of the large positive

externality produced by each successful vaccination. Price subsidy contracts produce

lower CPISVs due to the larger vaccine productions they induce relative to cost subsidy

contracts.

Project Present Value—The present value of the project to the firm is essentially the

transfer to the vaccine developer from the sponsor.       From Table 2, under the full

discretionary award, of the expected 80 million dollars in subsidy to the developer only

43.75 million dollars are expected to be used by the firm to finance the R&D, while the

remainder 36.25 million dollars become profit. By comparison, under the variable price




                                            40
purchase commitment, the developer spends 73.11 million dollars of the 80 million

dollars in expected subsidy on average to fund research, leaving only 6.89 million dollars

as profit from accepting the R&D contract.

Refinement of the Variable Price Purchase Commitment Plan

From the contract analysis results reported in Table 2, the variable price purchase

commitment plan appears to be the most effective subsidy program. It is more attractive

in all dimensions than other contracts except in the probability of successful vaccine

development where the co-payment contract produces a higher probability. In this section

we refine the variable price contract structure further.

Variable Price Purchase Commitment Contract with Higher Sensitivity

The variable price purchase commitment contract we studied before has a price

sensitivity of δ = 0.25 . We now explore the contract characteristics under different

sensitivity values. We report the results in Table 3. We see that by increasing the

sensitivity, the consumer surplus decreases while the CPISV increases, suggesting that

increasing the contract sensitivity is uniformly unattractive. The increase in sensitivity

skews the price schedule in favor of high efficacy vaccines, which results in lower

revenue for borderline projects. As a result, these borderline projects are abandoned at

the end of Phase I R&D.

Hybrid Subsidy Contracts

We combine the variable price purchase commitment contract with the cost co-payment

contract. Under these hybrid subsidy contracts, the vaccine developer receives funding to

offset a portion of their R&D expenditure as well as a purchase commitment on the

developed vaccine. We report the results for hybrid contracts in Table 4.




                                             41
       We see that by increasing the sponsor co-payment ratio of the hybrid subsidy the

R&D activity increases, resulting in a higher probability of vaccine development. This

arises because co-payment directly offsets the cost of the R&D expenditure. For every

R&D investment dollar spent, the developer receives a rebate of X, regardless of the

ultimate outcome of the research. The purchase commitment, on the other hand, only

covers the developer’s cost indirectly through price guarantees for a successful vaccine.

The two mechanisms for offsetting R&D costs are clearly distinct in an important way

even in our framework where risk sharing is not a motive! The mechanism through

which the firm is subsidized in a co-payment scheme is more effective at encouraging

R&D activities. Unfortunately, it is ineffective at encouraging an efficient quantity

supplied once a successful vaccine is developed.       However, the latter problem is

alleviated when we combine a co-payment subsidy with a purchase commitment subsidy

into a hybrid contract.

       Reading across Table 4, we see that the performance of the contract in the

dimensions of consumer surplus, CPISV, expected quantity supplied, as well as the

probability of development is monotonically increasing in the co-payment ratio. The

improvements over the standard variable price contract, while not large, are significant.

Overall, we find the hybrid contracts most attractive, followed by the variable and fixed

price contracts, and followed by the co-payment contract. We find full discretionary

awards largely ineffective at encouraging adequate R&D activities and find patent

extensions completely ineffective at inducing any R&D effort.

Summary and Conclusions

In this article, we develop an R&D valuation model and apply it to analyze research

incentive contracts for sponsored pharmaceutical R&D’s.          We find that extending

additional patent protection, which is usually effective in stimulating R&D’s in most

environments and situations, is unlikely to induce vaccine R&D on diseases affecting the

poor developing countries.     The small market problem is simply too severe.          Full

discretionary research grants, which are common for basic research conducted at

university laboratories, can spur vaccine R&D at a lower cost to the sponsor than the

other subsidy plans analyzed in this paper. However, the probability for developing a

marketable vaccine is low under this subsidy program. A more sophisticated cost subsidy

program, where the sponsor co-pays part of the R&D investment cost, is very effective at

encouraging R&D activities and produces a higher probability of developing a successful

vaccine. However, it performs poorly in supplying the vaccine in quantities once a

successful development results.

       Price subsidy, in the form of a purchase commitment, is comparably less effective

at encouraging high amount of R&D activities, thus resulting in a lower probability of

successful development. However, the sponsor can contract the purchase commitment to

induce a socially optimal quantity to be supplied, in the event that a successful vaccine is

developed. These effects combined lead to a higher consumer surplus as well as lower

cost per individual successfully vaccinated.

       Refining the variable price contract further with the incorporation of sponsor co-

payment, we find the hybrid contracts to deliver even more desirable outcomes.

Specifically, the hybrid contract with the highest co-payment ratio outperforms all other




                                               43
hybrid contracts; it also outperforms other non-hybrid contracts in all the effectiveness

measures except for one. We are therefore led to conclude that hybrid contracts and

purchase commitment contracts are preferred to co-payment contracts. Additionally, we

find full discretionary awards largely ineffective at encouraging adequate R&D activities

and find patent extensions completely ineffective at inducing any R&D effort.

       In this paper, we have assumed specific demand functions and stochastic

processes. However, the valuation framework we have developed and the numerical

solutions we have implemented are quite general. We could allow for any reasonable

demand function and joint stochastic processes describing the conditional expected cost

to completion and quality of the R&D output. More R&D phases can also be considered

without much complication.      In our analysis of the pharmaceutical R&D incentive

designs, we have used specific functions and parameters, but we believe that the

qualitative implications of the analysis are more general.

       There are important issues that we do not consider in our analysis. Specifically,

we do not model the interesting and complicated issues of moral hazard and information

asymmetry between the vaccine developer and the research sponsor. However, it does

appear intuitive to us that the inclusion of moral hazard would make cost subsidy

programs such as full discretionary research grants and sponsor co-payments less

effective relative to the purchase commitment program in producing the desired level of

R&D activity in the targeted vaccine.

       Another issue of interest is the analysis of competition in the development of

vaccines. What is the impact on the expected cost to the research sponsor and the

probability of vaccine development under the different incentive programs when more




                                            44
than one firm engages in the same vaccine R&D? How should the incentive contracts be

modified to target sponsor cost and/or the probability of success? Answers to these

questions will further aid world organizations to effectively solve the health care crises in

the developing countries.

Figure 1. At time 0, the firm forms expectations on the cost to complete Phase I R&D,

Phase II R&D, and the quality of the R&D output. When Phase I R&D is completed, the

firm learns (partially) about its ability to develop the product profitably. With this

knowledge, it revises its expectation on the cost to complete Phase II R&D and the

quality of the R&D output. The decision to continue is then formed based on these new

expectations. If the R&D is continued into Phase II, upon its completion, the firm

observes the exact quality of the R&D output. Income from bringing the product to

market is forecasted, and the firm makes decision to shelf or to commence production.

while the variance depends positively on τ 1 . The 90 percentile τ 1 , which indicates a

significantly shorter R&D completion time for Phase I, would have a tighter distribution

as well as a higher expected quality than the median and the bottom 10 percentile

completion time.

τ 2 . However, the effect from τ 2 is small in comparison to Q( τ 1 ). The 90 percentile

Q( τ 1 ) naturally has a higher expected quality than the median and the bottom 10

percentile. However, it also has a slightly lower variance as a consequence of the

bounded support of the Beta distribution.

prices given the same quantity. In addition, note that the market is willing to pay

significantly more for better quality products. At a quantity of 20 million units supplied,

the marginal consumer is only willing to pay $2 additional for an increase in quality from

80% to 85%. However, he is willing to pay $3 additional for an increase in quality from

90% to 95%.

However, the firm must incur additional expenditure in Phase II R&D. Therefore, if a

vaccine project is barely more effective than the minimum efficacy, it will be rejected at

the end of Phase I R&D.
