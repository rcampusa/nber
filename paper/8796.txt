                                             ABSTRACT

         This paper models investment/entry decisions in a competitive industry that is subject to a
quantity control on an input for production. The quantity control is implemented by auctioning licenses
for the restricted input. The paper shows that liberalizing the quantity control could reduce investment
in the industry under certain circumstances. Furthermore, the level of investment is quite different when
licenses are tradable than when they are not. Key factors in the comparison include the elasticity of
demand for the final good and the degree of input substitutability. Two examples are computed to
illustrate the results.

                                       I. INTRODUCTION



       Quantity controls on production inputs are commonly used throughout the world. In

transition countries, input rationing is still prevalent in many industries. In some developing

countries, import licensing and foreign exchange controls may restrict the quantity of inputs

available to domestic firms. In industrial countries, input quantity controls are often used to

regulate natural resource industries such as timber and fishing; they have also been imposed

in response to supply shocks such as those experienced with petroleum or electricity, and for

environmental reasons such as pollution reduction.

       Input rationing is usually implemented by issuing licenses or permits for the restricted

factor. In this regard, for analytical purposes, there is a close similarity between input quotas

and output quotas: in the latter case, a license is required in order to produce a certain amount

of output, so the license can be thought of as a restricted input that is necessary for

production.

       The initial allocation of licenses may be based upon certain criteria, such as firms’

historical performance, or by auction. In some cases, these licenses are tradable; in other

cases, they are not. This is a particularly important issue in agricultural and natural resource

economics, where production controls are most likely to be implemented. For example, in

fisheries management, some countries—notably Iceland and New Zealand—have introduced

a system of individual transferable quotas (ITQ) whereby an annual quota for a particular

species (the total allowable catch) is distributed among individual firms by means of licenses

that are tradable; other countries—such as the United States and the United Kingdom—are

still weighing the merits of this system vis-à-vis alternative measures such as nontransferable
                                            -4-




individual fishing quotas. Similarly, in the dairy and poultry industry, there is an ongoing

discussion within the United States and the European Union on the advantages of a supply

management system like Canada’s, where farmers have to purchase a tradable permit to

produce a specified amount of output.

       Although they are widely used, quantity controls and input rationing have not been

widely studied. Squires (1994) estimates the effect of an input quantity control on factor

demand, output supply, and capacity utilization by a competitive multiproduct firm in a

certain environment, using data on wet rice production in Indonesia. However, there has been

little work on the effect of input rationing on entry and investment in the affected industries

under production uncertainty. This paper considers the investment/entry decision in a

competitive industry with no fixed costs which is subject to input rationing such that licenses

or permits are required for production. The objective is to compare the level of investment in

the industry under two scenarios: when the licenses are transferable and when the licenses are

nontransferable. A similar problem is analyzed in Spencer (1997), which considers the

effects of a licensing requirement on imported capital equipment, comparing the outcome

under an exogenous bureaucratic allocation (nontransferable quota licenses) with that under a

market allocation (transferable licenses). Unlike Spencer (1997), however, the analysis used

in this paper draws on the model(s) developed in Krishna and Tan (1999), which compares

the endogenous outcomes from transferable and nontransferable regimes of quota licenses.

They show that—contrary to the common belief that transferable licenses are always worth

more than nontransferable licenses and always yield more efficient outcomes—the price of

transferable licenses can fall below the price of nontransferable licenses if the quota is

sufficiently large and that nontransferability could result in higher welfare if license revenue
                                             -5-




is heavily weighted in the overall welfare function. To the extent that license possession

enables a firm to produce the final product, the license market will be closely linked to the

market for the final product. This paper thus extends the analysis in Krishna and Tan (1999)

by explicitly modeling the product market as well. In this paper, the demand for licenses

(i.e., the restricted input) is modeled as a derived demand arising from production in a final

output market. It is assumed that each firm has to utilize a certain number of licenses in order

to produce a unit of output.

        It is necessary to introduce an element of uncertainty into the model in order to make

a meaningful comparison between transferable and nontransferable licenses. After all, as

explained in Krishna and Tan (1999), if every economic agent knows with full certainty his

or her valuation of a license at all times, and if the initial allocation of licenses is determined

endogenously (reflecting the voluntary choice of each agent), then there will be no scope for

resale and transferability will confer no benefit (or equivalently, nontransferability will imply

no cost). 1 Furthermore, this uncertainty has to be at the individual rather than the aggregate

level: if all agents faced a common shock then, again, there will be no scope for resale and no

benefit from transferability. In this paper, uncertainty is modeled as a firm-specific

productivity shock which affects the efficiency of final good production. Firms have to

purchase licenses for production before this productivity shock is realized; in the transferable


1
  In many practical applications, the initial allocation of licenses is not endogenous. For
example, the initial allocation of tradable fishing quotas in New Zealand and Iceland were
not effected by auction but by free distribution to existing firms based primarily on historical
catch (see OECD (1999)). However, such schemes are generally considered inferior to
market-based mechanisms such as allocation by auction, on efficiency and equity grounds
(see Morgan (1997), for example.)
                                             -6-




regime, they may (re-)trade (buy or sell) their licenses after the uncertainty is resolved but in

the nontransferable regime, they may not.

       There are several papers that analyze a competitive industry with free entry under

uncertainty. (See, Sandmo (1971), Batra and Ullah (1974), Hartman (1976), Appelbaum and

Katz (1986), and Haruna (1992), for example.) However, this literature focuses on the effect

of uncertainty on output, entry, and factor demand under different assumptions regarding the

degree of firms’ risk aversion; it does not address input constraints or license transferability.

There is also an existing literature on the effect of uncertainty on investment in a competitive

industry. (See Caballero (1991) and Pindyck (1993), for example.) However, the focus of this

literature is on investment irreversibility and not on license transferability. Also, in almost all

cases, the uncertainty modeled takes the form of industry-wide uncertainty (e.g., market

demand or price uncertainty) rather than idiosyncratic (firm- level) uncertainty.

       The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II sets up the basic model to be

used for the analysis. Section III solves the model for the level of investment under

transferability. Section IV does the same for nontransferability and compares the results with

those obtained in Section III. Section V presents two examples using a Cobb-Douglas

production function and a fixed coefficients production function. Section VI concludes.



                                        II. THE M ODEL



       The analysis that follows makes use of a partial equilibrium setting which focuses on

the market for licenses and the related market for the final good that is produced using the

licenses. As mentioned earlier, the demand for licenses is essentially a derived demand for an
                                             -7-




input, hence it is important to model the license market as a secondary market that is linked

to the product market where the primary activity of the firms takes place. It is assumed that

both markets are perfectly competitive.

        The timing of events is as follows. In Period 1, firms decide whether to enter the

industry (invest a unit of capital, K) at a cost of r per unit of capital. Upon entry, they buy

licenses (Z) which are needed for production later. In Period 2, they realize their actual

productivity and produce output. If the licenses are transferable, they may also buy and sell

licenses at this point; if the licenses are nontransferable, they cannot use more than what they

purchased in Period 1.

        Assume that the final good is produced using a constant returns to scale production

function F(K, Z), using capital and licenses as inputs. The usual Inada conditions are

assumed to be satisfied, i.e., the marginal product of an input is decreasing, tends to zero as

the input tends to infinity, and tends to infinity as the input tends to zero. Firms differ

according to productivity, indexed by β, where β is a random variable distributed as h(β).

One may consider, for example, a competitive agricultural industry that faces a quantity

restriction on farm equipment or agrochemical inputs: all farms utilize the same technology

but their output (harvest) may differ due to random effects such as weather and soil

conditions.

        Since the production function is characterized by constant returns to scale, K can be

interpreted as the total number of firms in the industry, with K = 1 for each firm. Hence K

denotes both the level of investment as well as the level of entry. In what follows, the terms

“investment” and “entry” will be used interchangeably.

        The output of any given firm is:
                                                -8-




                                       q = β F (1, z ) = β f ( z ),
                                                                                                  (1)
                                       f z ( z ) > 0, f zz ( z ) < 0

where z denotes the firm’s license input, f(z) is the intensive form of F(1, z), and subscripts

denote partial derivatives. This form is equivalent to random Hicks- neutral technical change.

Firms with high realizations of β have a higher total factor productivity than firms with low

realizations of β. In the agricultural example given above, farms with low realizations of

β will have poor harvests; those with high realizations of β will have good harvests.

          The ex ante distribution of β is the same for all firms, although their ex post

realizations will not be the same. Since there is a continuum of firms, and assuming that β is

independently and identically distributed, the ex ante distribution of β for each firm can be

interpreted as being the same as the ex post distribution of realizations of β across all firms in

the industry. 2

          Demand for the final product is denoted by D(P), where DP(P) < 0. The number of

licenses available for sale (i.e., the quota level for the restricted input) is assumed to be

exogenously set by the government. This is denoted by Z . In the case of input quotas,

possession of a license gives a firm the right to use a specified amount of the restricted input;

in the case of output quotas, possession of a license gives a firm the right to produce a

specified amount of the restricted output.

    Judd (1985) points out some technical issues in deriving this result.

                                III. TRANSFERABLE LICENSES



       Consider first the case of transferable licenses. This means that although the firms

must purchase licenses from the government before knowing β, they may freely trade their

licenses after β is realized, that is, they may re-optimize their license allocation ex post.

Effectively, therefore, the timing of the actions is as follows:

       1) In Period 1, the level of investment (or the number of firms), K, is determined

           through free entry and exit, given the exogenously determined quota level, Z .

           Only the distribution of β, h(β), is known at this stage.

       2) In Period 2, β is realized, i.e., each firm faces a (different) productivity shock. At

           this time, the industry demand for licenses is determined, given K, β, and Z , and

           production takes place. Hence the license market and the product market clear in

           Period 2. 3

The model is solved backwards, beginning with Period 2.

                                          A. Period 2

       Consider an individual firm’s production function given by Equation (1). In Period 2,

the firm has already invested 1 unit of capital and knows what its realization of β is. Hence it

will demand licenses up to the point where the value of the marginal product of a license is

equal to the price of a license, denoted by v :


3
  Returning to the agricultural example, one may consider, for instance, a quota on capital
equipment for harvesting or a quota on pre- harvest insecticides: farms with low realizations
of β (poor harvests) will demand less of the restricted input than those with high realizations
of β (good harvests).

                                                Pβ f z ( z ) = v                                       (2)

Equation (2) implicitly defines the firm’s demand for licenses, zT(β, v, P):

                                                                    v 
                                         z T ( β , v , P ) = f z−1                                   (3)
                                                                    βP 

        As long as the Inada conditions are met, all firms will demand some licenses. Note

that z Tβ ( β , v , P ) > 0 , i.e., at any given license and product price, firms with a higher

productivity will demand more licenses as their marginal product of a license is higher. Note

also that z Tv ( β , v , P ) < 0 , i.e., an increase in the license price will reduce the demand for

licenses (for a given product price and productivity realization), and z TP ( β , v , P ) > 0 , i.e., an

increase in the product price will raise the demand for licenses (for a given license price and

productivity realization).

License market clearing

        Given the total number of licenses, Z , the license market clears when the industry’s

demand for licenses is equal to Z :

                                                                         v 
                       Z = K ∫ z T ( β , v , P) h (β ) d β = K ∫ f z− 1      h (β )d β               (4)
                              β                                 β
                                                                         βP 

Equation (4) implicitly defines the license price, v T ( P , K ; Z ) :

                                                               Z 
                                         v T ( P, K; Z ) = P.g                                       (5)
                                                               K

        Note that v T ( P , K ; Z ) is increasing in both endogenous variables, i.e.,

v TP ( P , K ; Z ) > 0 and v TK ( P, K ; Z ) > 0 , and decreasing in the exogenous variable:

v TZ ( P ,K ;Z )< 0 . For any given K and Z , an increase in the product price, P, will increase
                                                  - 11 -




the demand for licenses (as noted earlier) so the license price, v, will have to rise to maintain

the equality between license demand and supply. In fact, it can be seen from Equation (2)

that v varies one- for-one with P so that a doubling of the product price will lead to a doubling

of the license price. For any given P and Z , an increase in investment (or the number of

firms), K, will increase the demand for licenses through the scale effect so the license price,

v, will have to rise to maintain the equality between license demand and supply. For any

given P and K, an increase in the supply of licenses, Z , will reduce the license price, v.

        Thus, output of a firm with realization β is β f ( z T ( β , v T ( P, K; Z ), P)) , and industry

output is:

                        Q ( K ; Z ) = K ∫ β f ( z ( β , v ( P , K ; Z ), P )) h (β )d β
                          T                         T       T
                                                                                                       (6)
                                          β



        Lemma 1: QKT ( K ; Z )> 0 and QZT ( K ; Z ) > 0

        Proof: See Appendix I for the proof.

The intuition behind the first result is as follows. By concavity of the production function, the

marginal product of z is decreasing in z and lies below the average product of z. As shown in

(5), v T rises as K rises, for any given P and Z . This increase in v T induces each firm to use

less z, thereby raising the average product of z. Since the total amount of licenses used is

fixed at Z , total output must rise as a result.

Product market clearing

        The product market clears when aggregate supply of the final good equals aggregate

demand:

                                              D ( P) = Q T ( K ; Z )                                   (7)
                                                - 12 -




Equation (7) gives the equilibrium product price as a function of K and Z :

                                     PT ( K ; Z ) = D−1 (Q T ( K ; Z ))                             (8)

From Lemma 1, it follows that PKT ( K ;Z )< 0 and PZT ( K ;Z )< 0 . For any given Z , an

increase in K increases the supply of the product, driving down the product price.

        Using Equations (5) and (8), the equilibrium license price can also be written as a

function of K and Z :

                                                                       Z
                                 vT ( K ; Z ) = D−1 (Q T ( K ; Z )). g                            (9)
                                                                       K 

        Lemma 2: v TZ ( K ; Z ) < 0 but the sign of v TK ( K ; Z ) is ambiguous.

        Proof: See Appendix I for the proof.

For the second result, note that there are two effects on v T ( K ; Z ) of an increase in K for a

given Z . The first (scarcity) effect makes licenses relatively more scarce and hence raises

the license price, v. The second (output) effect operates through PT ( K ; Z ) : an increase in

K increases supply of the final product, reducing the product price, and thereby reducing v.

Since the two effects work in opposite directions, v T ( K ; Z ) could be increasing or

decreasing in K. It is likely to be decreasing in K when the output effect predominates, i.e.,

when K and Z are easily substitutable in production and/or when demand for the final good is

very inelastic (so that a small increase in output induced by an increase in K requires a large

fall in price). It is likely to be increasing in K when the scarcity effect predominates, i.e.,

when K and Z are not easily substitutable and/or demand for the final good is very elastic.

                                              B. Period 1

        In Period 1, entry and exit of firms will determine the total level of investment (or

industry size), K. The industry will be in equilibrium—i.e., there will be no further entry or

exit—when the expected profit from an additional unit of capital is zero. Let r denote the unit

cost of capital. Since all firms are ex ante identical, zero expected profit for an individual

firm is the same as zero aggregate profits. The zero-profit condition can thus be written as:

                               PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) = v T ( K ; Z )Z + rK                    (10)

where Z and K represent aggregate (industry) inputs of licenses and capital respectively.

Equation (10) implicitly defines the equilibrium level of investment under transferability,

which is denoted K T ( Z ) .

        Consider the left hand side of Equation (10) first. Since an increase in K shifts supply

out, moving the equilibrium down the demand curve, PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) is increasing in K

if demand elasticity exceeds unity, constant if demand elasticity equals unity, and decreasing

in K if demand elasticity is less than unity. As for the right hand side of Equation (10), the

second term, rK, is clearly increasing in K, but the first term, v T ( K ; Z ) Z , may be increasing

or decreasing in K: as noted in Lemma 2, it is likely to be increasing in K if demand elasticity

is high and decreasing in K if demand elasticity is low. If both inputs are essential, both the

PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) line and the v T ( K ; Z ) Z + rK line must ema nate from the origin when

graphed against K. 4 In addition, for stability, v T ( K ; Z ) Z + rK must intersect

PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) from below. 5 Figures 1, 2, and 3 illustrate these lines in the fixed

coefficients production setting discussed in Section V below.

          Proposition 1: An increase in the input quota can raise or lower entry.

          Proof: An increase in Z shifts the PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) line—graphed against K—

          upward if demand elasticity exceeds unity; downward if demand elasticity is less than

          unity; and has no effect if demand elasticity equals unity. 6 The v T ( K ; Z ) Z + rK line

          may shift up or down in response to an increase in Z since v TZ ( K ; Z ) < 0 from

          Lemma 2. Hence raising Z can raise or lower entry in general.

Proposition 1 implies that liberalizing the quantity control on intermediate inputs can shrink

an industry under certain circumstances. 7 For example, if demand elasticity is high, both the

PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) and v T ( K ; Z ) Z + rK lines are upward sloping, and an increase in Z


4
  If both inputs are essential, then when K is zero, output (QT) is zero and there is no license
demand so the license price (v T) is also zero. Hence, PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ;Z )= 0 and
v T ( K ; Z ) Z + rK = 0 when K = 0 in this case.
5
    For stability, K should increase (decrease) when industry profits are positive (negative).
6
  An increase in Z increases output (from Lemma 1) and lowers the product price. For a
given K, if demand is elastic, revenue rises along with Z so the PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) line shifts
up.
7
  It is easy to show that this result obtains even in the absence of uncertainty; it does not
hinge on license transferability. It may also be possible to obtain this result in a general
equilibrium framework where relaxing the quota generates negative income effects for quota
holders due to lower license prices; in general, however, in such models, these income losses
tend to be outweighed by the direct gains from relaxing the quota.

would shift the PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) line up and the v T ( K ; Z ) Z + rK line down if the inputs

are easily substitutable (since the increase in Z would lead to a large fall in v T ); hence an

increase in the input quota would lead to an increase in investment in this case. Section V

contains two examp les that cast more light on this issue.



                               IV. NONTRANSFERABLE LICENSES



    Now consider the case of nontransferable licenses. In this case, firms have to purchase

their licenses before knowing β and they are unable to re-optimize (i.e., trade their licenses)

after β is realized. Specifically, the timing is as follows:

    1) In Period 1, the level of investment (or the number of firms), K, and the demand for

        licenses, Z, are determined given Z . Hence, the market for licenses clears in

        Period 1.

    2) In Period 2, β is realized, i.e., each firm faces a (different) productivity shock. At that

        time, production takes place. Hence the market for the final good clears in Period 2.

                                            A. Period 2

Product market clearing

        Consider an individual firm’s production function given by Equation (1). Given that

K = 1 for each firm that entered the industry in Period 1, and that the firms are ex ante

identical, all firms will have obtained the same number of licenses in Period 1:

                                                              Z
                                           z NT ( K ; Z ) =                                       (11)
                                                              K

Hence, in Period 2, all firms will have the same amount of capital and the same number of

licenses. However, they will not produce the same amount of output: the output of each firm

will depend on its realization of β. Industry output in Period 2 is thus:

                              Q ( K ; Z ) = K ∫ β f ( Z / K ) h (β ) d β = KE ( β ) f (Z / K )
                                NT
                                                                                                                        (12)
                                                  β



             Lemma 3: QKNT ( K ;Z )> 0 and QZNT ( K ;Z ) > 0 .

             Proof: QKNT ( K ; Z ) = E( β )  f ( Z / K ) − ( Z / K ) fz ( Z / K )  > 0 since f ( z ) / z > f z ( z ).

             QZNT ( K ;Z ) > 0 follows from Equation (12).

             Setting total supply equal to total demand for the final good:

                                                      Q NT ( K ; Z ) = D( P)                                            (13)

yields the equilibrium product price as a function of K:

                                             P NT ( K ; Z ) = D −1( QNT ( K ; Z ))                                      (14)

As before, PKNT ( K ;Z ) < 0 and PZNT ( K ;Z ) < 0 .

                                                         B. Period 1

             In Period 1, the level of investment (or the number of firms), K, and the demand for

licenses, Z, are determined, given Z . Only the distribution of β is known at this stage; the

realization of β for each firm will be known in Period 2.

             Each firm is willing to pay the expected value of marginal product of a license. And,

as mentioned earlier, since firms are ex ante identical, each firm will purchase Z / K

licenses. Hence, the license price under nontransferability is:

         ( K ; Z ) = ∫ P ( K ; Z ) β f z ( Z / K )h (β ) d β = D (Q
                                                                    −1
                                                                              ( K ; Z )) E (β )f z (Z /K )

        Lemma 4: v ZNT ( K ;Z )< 0 but the sign of v KNT ( K ; Z ) is ambiguous.

        Proof: The proof is the same as in Lemma 2.

Note from Equations (12) and (15) that if the uncertainty takes the form of a mean-preserving

spread in firm output, then the outcome with nontransferable licenses is the same as it would

have been in the absence of uncertainty. In other words, the introduction of uncertainty in the

form of a mean-preserving spread in output will have no effect on the level of investment if

the restricted input is nontransferable, but may lead to higher or lower investment if the

restricted input is transferable.

        In Period 1, entry and exit of firms will determine the total level of investment (or

industry size), K. As before, the zero-profit condition is:

                             P NT ( K ; Z )Q NT ( K ; Z ) = v NT ( K ; Z )Z + rK                       (16)

        First consider the left hand side of Equation (16). Note that the position of the

P NT ( K ; Z )Q NT ( K ; Z ) line may be different than the PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) line considered

previously. Recall that under transferability, firms with a low realization of β can sell their

licenses to those with a high realization in Period 2. Such license trades raise output (since

the high-β firms will produce more) so that for any K, output under transferability is greater

than output under nontransferability. If the value of output— P( K; Z ) Q ( K ; Z ) —is decreasing

in K, then the P( K; Z ) Q ( K ; Z ) line will be lower under transferability than under

nontransferability. If the value of output is increasing in K, then the P( K; Z ) Q ( K ; Z ) line

will be higher under transferability than under nontransferability. And if the value of output
                                            - 18 -




is independent of K then the P( K; Z ) Q ( K ; Z ) line will be the same under transferability and

nontransferability.

       Now consider the right hand side of Equation (16). The second term, rK, is increasing

in K. But the first term, v NT ( K ; Z ) Z may be increasing or decreasing in K, as noted above.

How does v ( K ; Z ) differ under transferability and nontransferability? This comparison is

likely to be complex. Krishna and Tan (1998) show that when the quota is very restrictive

relative to K, i.e., when K is large enough, then v is higher under transferability than under

nontransferability, and when Z / K is very large then v is lower under transferability than

under nontransferability. Thus a monotonic relation between the transferable and

nontransferable license price is unlikely in general.

       Finally, note that Proposition 1 holds true for the nontransferable case as well.

       The following section presents illustrative examples using specific functional forms,

namely, a constant elasticity of demand function and: (1) Cobb Douglas production; and (2)

fixed coefficients production.



                                         V. EXAMPLES



                           A. Cobb Douglas Production Function

       Suppose the final good is produced using a Cobb Douglas production function:

F(K, Z) = KαZ1–α, where 0 < α < 1. The Cobb Douglas technology, which is commonly

assumed in agricultural applications, implies that all inputs are essential for production,
                                                - 19 -




i.e., both capital and licenses must be used in strictly positive amounts to obtain a positive

output. The intensive form for the firm’s production function can be written as:

                                          q = β f ( z ) = β z 1−α                               (17)

Assume that β is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2, so h(β) = ½ and E(β) = 1.

        Assume that the demand for the final product is isoelastic, with elasticity ε:

                                                 D = P −ε                                       (18)

        Consider first the case of transferable licenses. Using Equations (4), (6), and (8), it

can be shown that:

                                                                                  ε −1

                                                                 1 +α 
                                                                               

and:

                                                                               ε −1
                                                                       α
                                                               αK           ε

                                                               1 + α  
                                                      

Note from Equation (19) that PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) is increasing in K if ε > 1; decreasing in

K if ε < 1; and constant if ε = 1. From Equation (20), if ε ≥ 1 then v T ( K ; Z ) Z + rK is

increasing in K, but if ε < 1 then v T ( K ; Z ) Z + rK may be increasing or decreasing in K.

        Equating (19) and (20) yields the total level of investment under transferability:

                                                                           ε −1
                                                   ε

                                               α ε −1  α 
                            K ( Z ) =  2Z   
                             T            1−α
                                                            
                                                                                               (21)
                                              r   1+α  
                                                              

Thus, KT is increasing in Z if ε > 1; independent of Z (and equal to α/r) if ε = 1; and

decreasing in Z if ε < 1. From Equation (21), it follows that liberalizing the input restriction
                                                   - 20 -




can actually result in a contraction in industry size if demand for the final good is very

inelastic.

        The equilibrium transferable license price is:

                                                                                         ε −1

        The equilibrium final good price is:

                                                                                        1

Equations (22) and Equation (23) imply that the total effect of an increase in the input quota

is to lower the license price and to increase output, thereby reducing the final product price. 8

Although industry size may rise or fall with Z , the price of the final good is always

negatively related to Z so output is always positively related to Z . Hence, liberalizing the

input restriction always leads to an increase in output and a reduction in the final good price.

        Now consider the case of nontransferable licenses. Using Equations (12), (14), and

(15), it can be shown that:

                                                                                 ε −1

and:



8
  The general intuition is that in all three cases, there is a direct effect through Z and an
indirect effect through K, and the direct effect outweighs the indirect effect. For example,
recall that v TZ ( Z ) = v TZ ( K ; Z ) + vTK ( K ; Z ) K ZT ( Z ) . Although v TZ ( K ; Z ) < 0 and

As in the transferable case, P NT ( K ; Z )Q NT ( K ; Z ) is increasing in K if ε > 1; decreasing in

K if ε < 1; and constant if ε = 1. From Equation (25), if ε ≥ 1 then v NT ( K ; Z ) Z + rK is

increasing in K, but if ε < 1 then v NT ( K ; Z ) Z + rK may be increasing or decreasing in K.

        Equating Equations (24) and (25) yields the total level of investment under

nontransferability:

                                                                      ε −1

        The equilibrium nontransferable license price is thus:

        To summarize: (i) the equilibrium license price and level of investment may be higher

or lower under transferability compared with nontransferability, depending on how elastic the

demand for the final product is—specifically, KT > KNT and v T > v NT if ε > 1; KT < KNT and

v T < v NT if ε < 1; and KT = KNT and v T = v NT if ε = 1; and (ii) the product price is always lower

and output is always higher under transferability than under nontransferability. The first

result follows from comparing Equations (21) and (26) and Equations (22) and (27):

                         B. Fixed Coefficients Production Function

        Suppose the final good is produced using a Leontief (fixed coefficients) production

function: F(K, Z) = min(K, Z). To produce one unit of output, K and Z have to be combined

in a specified ratio; there is no possibility of substitution between the inputs. This is a useful

representation for production or export licenses.

        The firm’s production function can be written as:

                                       q = β f ( z ) = β min(1, z )                            (31)

        Note that f z(z) = 1 for 0 ≤ z < 1 and 0 for z ≥ 1. Hence the Leontief production

function does not meet the Inada conditions. As before, assume that β is uniformly

distributed between 0 and 2, and that the demand for the final product is isoelastic with

elasticity ε.

        Consider, for example, a quota on the number of fish that can be caught. Each firm

has one unit of capital (a boat-trip with a fixed capacity, say) which it has to combine with z

  When plotted with α on the horizontal axis, the line representing α/(1+α) lies above the line
representing (½)1/α for 0 < α < 1.

licenses in order to be able to catch fish. Increasing the number of licenses beyond the fixed

capacity will not increase the number of fish brought ashore; neither will increasing the

capacity beyond that allo wed by the number of licenses held increase the number of fish

brought ashore. Output is measured in terms of the total weight of the catch. Each firm draws

a random catch (due to luck, weather, etc.) which is not known until Period 2; β is a random

variable that determines the weight of the catch. So a firm utilizes one boat-trip combined

with z licenses to “produce” a catch weighing β pounds.

        First consider the case of transferable licenses. It can be shown that:

(See Appendix II for the derivation.) As expected, the first line, PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) , is

non-decreasing in K if ε > 1; non- increasing in K if ε < 1; and constant (and equal to 1) if

ε = 1. The second line, v T ( K ; Z ) Z + rK is a continuous line that has a slope of r for

K ≤ Z ; has a slope less than r for K > Z ; and takes the value of rZ at K = Z .

        Equations (32) and (33) are illustrated in Figures 1, 2, and 3 for ε > 1, ε < 1, and

ε = 1 respectively. The equilibrium level of investment under transferability is given by the

intersection of the two lines, PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) and v T ( K ; Z ) Z + rK . If

PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) < vT ( K ; Z )Z + rK at K = Z , then profits are negative at K = Z , so the

equilibrium level of KT must occur below Z . In this case—which occurs when Z > r − ε —the

equilibrium KT will be given by the intersection of K(ε–1)/ε and rK. So:

                                                  K T = r −ε                                       (34)

when Z > r − ε . This is depicted in Figures 1(a), 2(a), and 3(a). If

PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) = v T ( K ; Z )Z + rK at K = Z , then the equilibrium level of KT occurs at

Z . This case—which occurs when Z = r − ε —is depicted in Figures 1(b), 2(b), and 3(b). If

PT ( K ; Z )QT ( K ; Z ) > v T ( K ; Z )Z + rK at K = Z , then profits are positive at K = Z , so the

equilibrium level of KT must occur above Z . In this case—which occurs when Z < r −ε —the

equilibrium KT will be given by the intersection of Z (2 − ( Z / K )) ( ε −1)/ε and

2 Z ( ε −1)/ε (1 − (Z / K ))(2 − ( Z / K )) −1/ ε + rK . So K T ( Z ) is defined implicitly by:

                                                        −1/ ε        2
                                             Z               Z 

when Z < r −ε . This is depicted in Figures 1(c), 2(c), and 3(c).

        Note from Equations (34) and (35) that KT is independent of Z (and equal to r–ε) if

the input quota is relatively large ( Z ≥ r − ε ), and may increase or decrease with Z if the input

quota is relatively small ( Z < r −ε ). Implicitly differentiating Equation (35), it can be shown

that K TZ < 0 if ε < [1 − (Z / K T ]/[2 − ( Z / K T )]. Since Z / K T is bounded away from unity in
                                                 - 25 -




this region, the right hand side of the inequality is bounded away from zero. 10 This is in line

with the argument following Proposition 1, which suggests that if demand elasticity is high

then investment rises with Z .

         The equilibrium transferable license price, v T ( Z ) is:

                                  0                                   if Z ≥ r −ε
                                  
                      v T ( Z ) =   Z  −2       Z                                                (36)

                                    K (Z )    K ( Z ) 

where K T ( Z ) is given by Equation (35). Thus, the equilibrium license price is independent

of Z (and equal to zero) if the input quota is relatively large ( Z ≥ r − ε ), and decreases with

Z if the input quota is relatively small ( Z < r −ε ).

         Now consider the case of nontransferable licenses. Then each firm will have

Z / K licenses and all firms will produce in Period 2. If K ≤ Z , then total output is K and the

product price is K–1/ε. If K ≥ Z , then the total output is Z and the product price is Z −1/ ε .

Hence:

                                                            εε−1

                                                           

         As in the transferable case, P NT ( K ; Z )Q NT ( K ; Z ) is non-decreasing in K if ε > 1;

non- increasing in K if ε < 1; and constant (and equal to 1) if ε = 1. In addition,


10
  Consider an increase in Z with a proportional increase in KT so that Z / K T is unchanged.
Then the left hand side of Equation (35) will fall and the equality will no longer hold.
Therefore for Equation (35) to hold, an increase in Z has to be accompanied by an increase
                                                                                  (continued…)

the P( K; Z ) Q ( K ; Z ) line under nontransferability coincides with that under transferability

when K ≤ Z . When K > Z , the P( K; Z ) Q ( K ; Z ) line under nontransferability lies below

that under transferability if ε > 1 and above it if ε < 1 , as expected from the discussion in

Section IV. If ε = 1, then the P( K; Z ) Q ( K ; Z ) lines are horizontal and are identical under

transferability and nontransferability.

        In Period 1, if K < Z , then the expected marginal value product of a license is zero,

so v NT = 0. If K > Z , then the expected marginal value product of a license is Z −1/ ε , so

v NT = Z −1 /ε . If K = Z , one has to use the subgradient since the marginal product of z is not

continuously differentiable at z = 1. Hence:

The v NT ( K ; Z ) Z + rK line under nontransferability coincides with that under transferability

when K < Z ; it jumps up by Z (ε −1)/ε at K = Z .

        Equations (37) and (38) are also depicted in Figures 1, 2, and 3 for ε > 1, ε < 1, and

ε = 1 respectively. The equilibrium level of investment under nontransferability—KNT—is at

the intersection of (37) and (38). If P NT ( K ; Z ) Q NT ( K ; Z ) ≤ v NT ( K ; Z ) Z + rK at K = Z , then

KNT = KT. This is depicted in Figures 1(a)–(b), 2(a)–(b), and 3(a)–(b). If

Figures 1(c), 2(c), and 3(c).

        Intuitively, the expected value of the marginal product of K is equal to

P NT ( K ; Z ) = K −1/ ε if K < Z , and is equal to zero if K ≥ Z . However, since the price of K is

r, K will not be purchased beyond the point where its expected marginal product value is

equal to its marginal cost, i.e., where K −1/ ε = r (or K = r −ε ). Hence if Z > r − ε then the level

of investment will be equal to r–ε, but if Z ≤ r − ε then the level of investment will be equal to

Z . Thus:

                                                     r − ε   if Z ≥ r − ε

                                                      Z      if Z ≤ r −ε

Note that KNT is independent of Z (and equal to r–ε) if the input quota is relatively large

( Z ≥ r − ε ), and increases with Z if the input quota is relatively small ( Z < r −ε ). In other

words, industry size increases as the quantity control is relaxed, up to a point r −ε ; beyond

this point, further increases in Z have no effect on industry size. In comparison with the

transferable case, industry size is weakly smaller under nontransfe rability than under

transferability for every level of Z .

        As noted above, the equilibrium license price is:

                                                0            if Z > r −ε

                                   v NT ( Z ) = [0, Z −1/ε ] if Z = r − ε                            (40)
                                                Z −1/ε        if Z < r − ε

                                              - 28 -




Thus, the equilibrium license price is independent of Z (and equal to zero) if the input quota

is relatively large ( Z > r − ε ), and decreases with Z if the input quota is relatively small

( Z < r −ε ).

         To summarize: (i) the equilibrium level of investment is weakly smaller under

nontransferability than under transferability for every level of Z ; (ii) output is weakly lower

(and consequently price is weakly higher) under nontransferability than under transferability;

and (iii) the equilibrium nontransferable license price is the same as the equilibrium

transferable license price (v NT = v T = 0) when the input quota is not binding (i.e., when

Z ≥ r − ε ), but may be higher or lower than the equilibrium transferable license price when the

input quota is binding (i.e., when Z < r −ε ). The first result follows from Proposition 2 and

Equation (39). When the input quota, Z , is not binding (i.e., when Z ≥ r − ε ), then investment

and output are the same (and equal to r–ε) under both regimes. When the input quota is

binding (i.e., when Z < r −ε ), under nontransferability, all firms will produce in Period 2, so

output is Z ; but under transferability, only firms with a high productivity shock buy the

licenses and produce whilst those with a low productivity shock do not produce in Period 2,

so output is greater than Z and the price of the final good is lower than it would be under

nontransferability. The equilibrium nontransferable license price is the same as the

equilibrium transferable license price (v NT = v T = 0) when the quantity constraint is not

binding (i.e., when Z ≥ r − ε ). When the quantity constraint is binding (i.e., when Z < r −ε ),

then v NT = Z −1 /ε , which is smaller than v T (which is given by Equation (36)) if the

equilibrium level of investment under transferability, KT, is very large relative to the license

supply, Z ; this, in turn, is likely to be the case if ε is high (for a given r).
                                            - 29 -




       The results can be understood intuitively as follows. When the license supply is

small, output is necessarily small so the price of the final good is very high. As a result, the

expected value of the marginal product of investment is very high. Under transferability,

firms are willing to invest beyond Z since they know that the y can buy a license and

produce if they have a high enough realization of β. Under nontransferability, this will not

happen. Hence investment/entry will be higher under transferability than under

nontransferability. When the license supply is large, the final good price will be too low to

cover costs if firms enter up to Z . Hence, there will be fewer firms than licenses and ex post,

no firm will be in want of a license. As a result, the license price will be zero and investment

and output will be the same in both the transferable and nontransferable case.



                                        VI. CONCLUSION



       Quantity controls on production inputs occur quite frequently in practice. These

controls may be implemented in various ways. This paper analyzes the implications for a

competitive industry of input rationing that is effected through the sale of licenses. Two cases

are considered: the case of transferable licenses (i.e., where resale is allowed) and the case of

nontransferable licenses (i.e., where resale is prohibited). Using partial equilibrium analysis

and a two- input model of production with one restricted and one unrestricted input, it is

shown that the implications for the license price and the level of investment in the industry

are quite different in the two cases.

       In general, there is no clearcut comparison between the level of investment, the

license price, output, and the final product price under transferability and those under

nontransferability. Key factors in the comparison include the elasticity of demand for the

final good, the degree of substitutability between the restricted and unrestricted inputs, and

the restrictiveness of the quota. With a Cobb Douglas production function, the equilibrium

license price and level of investment under transferability are higher than under

nontransferability if demand elasticity is high, and lower than under nontransferability if

demand elasticity is low. However, output is always higher under transferability and

consequently, the product price is always lower than under nontransferability. In the example

of a fixed coefficients production function, where there is no substitution between the two

inputs, investment/entry is higher, output is higher, and consequently, the final good price is

lower under transferability than under nontransferability when the quota is binding

(i.e., when the license supply is small); however, the license price may be higher or lower

under transferability than under nontransferability. When the license supply is relatively

large, the license price is zero and investment/entry, output, and the final good price are the

same under transferability and nontransferability.

       Finally, although it is often assumed that liberalizing the input restriction would

increase investment in the affected industry, it is shown here that under certain conditions—

notably, if the demand for the final good is very inelastic and/or the inputs are very close

substitutes—liberalizing the input restriction may actually shrink the industry rather than

boost its growth.

demand for the final product: the higher the price elasticity of demand, the lower is ηP. ηK is

the partial elasticity of supply with respect to K for given Z . ηg is elasticity of the

expectation of the inverse of the marginal product of z with respect to the relative scarcity of

licenses, Z / K . Both ηg and ηK are related to the degree of substitutability between Z and K:

the greater the substitutability between Z and K, the smaller is ηg (as f z is elastic so that f z–1 is

inelastic) and the larger is ηK (as output is very responsive to changes in K).

The second bracketed term in Equation (59), D–1 (⋅)g(⋅)/K, is positive so the sign of v K ( K ; Z )

hinges on the first bracketed term, (–ηPηQ + ηg ). If the price elasticity of demand is high,

then ηP is low and (–ηPηQ + ηg ) is positive; if the price elasticity of demand is low, then ηP is

high and (–ηPηQ + ηg ) is negative.

Derivation of Equations (32) and (33)

         Since there is no substitution between capital and licenses, not every firm will find it

profitable to buy a license and produce upon realizing its β in Period 2. A firm in Period 2

will demand a license only if the value of its marginal product, βP (where β is known) is

greater than or equal to its cost, v. (The cost of capital is already sunk in Period 2.) Hence,

only those firms with a “good” realization of β will produce, where a “good” realization is

defined to be β ≥ v/P. Firms with a “bad” realization of β, i.e., those with β < v/P, will not

find it worthwhile to produce.

         The total demand for licenses is thus K [1 – v/(2P)]. Equating this with the total

supply of licenses yields: v T ( P , K ; Z ) = 2 P(1 − Z / K ) if K ≥ Z and 0 if K < Z (since the

license price cannot be negative).

                                                                2
         Total industry supply of the final good is K ∫                        β h( β ) d β , or:
                                                                max[0,v /P ]



                                            K                        if K ≤ Z
                                            

                                                     

Note that total supply can exceed K since the licenses are used only by the most efficient

firms.

         Equating total supply with total demand yields:

                                             K −1/ ε                      if K ≤ Z

         Using (65), the equilibrium license price may be written as:
                                               - 37 -                                    APPENDIX II

       In Period 1, the equilibrium level of investment, K, is determined by the zero profit

condition. Using Equations (64) and (65), it can be shown that:
