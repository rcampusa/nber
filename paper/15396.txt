                                              ABSTRACT

We report results from a large randomized natural field experiment conducted in southwestern China
in the context of insurance for sows. Our study sheds light on two important questions about microinsurance.
First, how does access to formal insurance affect farmers' production decisions? Second, what explains
the low takeup rate of formal insurance, despite substantial premium subsidy from the government?
We find that providing access to formal insurance significantly increases farmers' tendency to raise
sows. We argue that this finding also suggests that farmers are not previously insured efficiently through
informal mechanisms. We also provide several pieces of evidence suggesting that trust, or lack thereof,
for government-sponsored insurance products is a significant barrier for farmers' willingness to participate
in the insurance program.

1       Introduction
    Farmers in less developed economies face signiﬁcant barriers in access to credit, insurance and
other ﬁnancial products taken for granted in developed countries. At the same time, the risks
they face are typically far more signiﬁcant relative to their income than their counterparts in
developed economies. Lack of access to credit prevents potential entrepreneurs among farmers
from obtaining the necessary capital to start or expand their businesses, forcing them to either
stay in traditional farming or take other less proﬁtable paths. Lack of access to formal insurance
market can similarly prevent farmers from pursuing production activities that may be risky but
have potentially large returns.
    International aid agencies, non-governmental organizations, and proﬁt or non-proﬁt private
banks have devoted a large amount of resources to provide credits to residents in low income
regions. The best story of microﬁnance is that of Muhammad Yunus and Bangladesh’s Grameen
Bank which he founded in 1976, and was replicated in more than thirty countries from East Timor,
Bosnia and even many poor neighborhoods in the United States.1 Academically, a large empirical
literature has documented the success of microﬁnance programs and a theoretical literature is
also developed to understand its success (see de Aghion and Morduch, 2005 for a comprehensive
review).
    Surprisingly, there has been much less eﬀort, both practically and academically, devoted to
provide microinsurance to farmers in low income economies. As Morduch (2006) observed: “The
prospects (of microinsurance) are exciting, but much remains unknown. The expanding gaggle
of microinsurance advocates are ahead of the available evidence on insurance impacts. ... The
advocates may be right, at least in the long-term, but it is impossible to point to a broad range
of great evidence on which to base that prejudice.”
    Studying the causal eﬀect of insurance on agricultural production using observational data is a
challenging task because of the problem of unobserved heterogeneity. Certain risk types (unknown
to econometricians) may self select into some speciﬁc insurance scheme, and these risk types may
also aﬀect the choice of production technology, eﬀort level and thus output. For instance, more risk
averse people may prefer insurance and at the same time devote more eﬀorts in choosing eﬀective
technology to protect against animal diseases and epidemics. The presence of self-selection will
cause a spurious correlation between insurance coverage and agricultural output.
    To overcome the above challenge, we adopt in this paper an experimental approach to study the
eﬀect of insurance access on farmers’ subsequent production decisions. Our experimental design,

(2001) for an account of its replications around the world.

which we explain in details in Section 5, creates exogenous variations in insurance coverage across
villages that are arguably orthogonal to agricultural output, and we then use this exogenous
variation to identify the causal eﬀect of insurance on production.
    Speciﬁcally, we report results from a large randomized natural ﬁeld experiment conducted in
southwestern China in the context of insurance for sows. Our study sheds light on two impor-
tant questions about microinsurance. First, how does access to formal insurance aﬀect farmers’
production decisions? Second, what explains the low takeup rate of formal insurance, despite the
heavy premium subsidy from governments? We ﬁnd that providing access to formal insurance
signiﬁcantly increases farmers’ tendency to raise sows. We argue that this ﬁnding also suggests
that farmers are not previously eﬃciently insured through informal insurance mechanisms. We
also provide several pieces of evidence that trust, or lack thereof, for government-sponsored insur-
ance products acts a signiﬁcant barrier for farmers’ willingness to pay for the nominal insurance
premium.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the related literature;
Section 3 provides a simple theoretical framework to illustrate how expanded insurance options
could potentially aﬀect economic activity; Section 4 provides the institutional background for hog
production, and the insurance program for sows introduced in China in 2007; Section 5 describes
our experimental design; Section 6 describes the data sets and provides summary statistics; Section
7 presents our experimental result that sow insurance signiﬁcantly aﬀects farmers’ decision to raise
sows in subsequent periods; Section 8 tackles the puzzle of low take-up rate of heavily subsidized
sow insurance, linking it to trust both theoretically and empirically; and ﬁnally Section 9 concludes.


2    Related Literature
   Two recent papers are most related to our study. Gine et al. (2008) studied the determi-
nants of purchasing an innovative rainfall insurance policy oﬀered to small farmers in rural India.
They ﬁnd that insurance takeup is decreasing in the basis risk between insurance payouts and
income ﬂuctuations, increasing in household wealth and decreasing in the extent to which credit
constraints bind. These results match the predictions of a simple neoclassical model augmented
with borrowing constraints. However, they also found that risk averse household are less likely
to purchase insurance, and participation in village networks and familiarity with the insurance
vendor are strongly correlated with insurance takeup decisions. Closely related, Cole et al. (2008)
documented low levels of rainfall insurance take up, and then conducted ﬁeld experiments to un-
derstand why adoption is so low. Their experimental results demonstrate that high price of the
insurance and credit constraints of the farmers are important determinants of insurance adoption,


                                                  2
but they also ﬁnd evidence that endorsement from a trusted third party about the insurance policy
signiﬁcantly increase the insurance take up. Our ﬁnding of the importance of trust in our setting
is consistent with their ﬁndings. These two studies do not examine the causal eﬀect of rainfall
insurance on agricultural production.
    Our paper is also related to the large and important literature in development economics on
how poor villagers rely on informal insurance to cope with risks. In a seminal paper, Townsend
(1994) asks whether community-based informal insurance arrangements in the three south India
villages might in fact be so eﬀective that the poor can do a very good job of protecting their
consumption levels against unusual swings in income. His test is simple: under full insurance,
individuals’ income, sickness and other idiosyncratic shocks should not inﬂuence consumption at
all once aggregate consumption is controlled for. The intuition for this test is that if preferences
are time separable and display weak risk aversion, and if all individuals discount the future at the
same rate, and if all information is held in common, then an optimal allocation of risk bearing in a
stochastic environment implies that all individuals’ consumptions are determined by the aggregate
consumption, regardless of the date and history of shocks, thus individuals’ consumptions must
move together. When applying the test using a data set of roughly 120 households in three villages
in south India (the ICRISAT data), he found that although the full insurance is rejected statis-
tically, it does provide a surprisingly good benchmark: household consumptions indeed co-move
with village average consumptions, and household consumptions are not much inﬂuenced by con-
temporaneous own income, sickness, unemployment or other idiosyncratic shocks once controlling
for village consumption.
    Townsend’s 1994 study has important implications. It suggests that community-based informal
insurance eﬀectively shields villagers from their idiosyncratic shocks, thus policymakers should only
provide insurance against more aggregate shocks.2 Townsend (1994), however, does not shed light
on the mechanisms in which the almost full insurance is achieved by the India villagers, whether it
is informal community-based insurance including gifts and transfers from family networks, and/or
borrowing from village lenders; or via individuals building up grain reserves, or through purchase
and sales of assets such as bullocks and land to self-insure. Indeed, studies by Rosenzweig (1988),
Rosenzweig and Stark (1989) and Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1993) suggest that indeed households
in low-income countries employ a variety of channels to diversify their risk exposure, including
purchases/sales of durable production assets such as bullocks, diversifying the marriage location of
their daughters, and borrowing from family networks. Lim and Townsend (1998) found that in the
  2
   Kazianga and Udry (2006) examined the extent of consumption smoothing between 1981 and 1985 in rural
Burkina Faso in response to a period of severe drought. They, however, found evidence of little consumption
smoothing and almost no risk sharing.



                                                    3
three south India villages the most important mechanism is self insurance through building and
drawing down of grain reserves.3 Udry (1994) found that credit contracts with state-contingent
repayments plays an important role in pooling risks across households in northern Nigeria, even
though a fully eﬃcient risk-pooling equilibrium is not achieved.
    Our paper contributes to a further understanding of the eﬃciency of the informal insurance
mechanisms that farmers may have adopted due to the lack of access to formal insurance market.
In Section 3, we make a distinction between observing a full insured outcome and having eﬃcient
insurance. We illustrate that unless the farmers are previously eﬃciently insured through informal
mechanisms, more eﬃcient insurance institutions will still have an eﬀect on the farmers’ production
decisions even if we ﬁnd that their consumption does not ﬂuctuate with their income shocks. Thus,
our study on the eﬀect of formal insurance on farmer behavior also provides a test of whether
informal insurance mechanisms achieved eﬃciency: if farmers’ behavior does not change with the
introduction of formal insurance, it will be evidence that they are eﬃciently insured to start with;
otherwise, it is evidence that informal insurance was not eﬃcient despite the low sensitivity of
consumption to individual income shocks.
    To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the ﬁrst to examine the causal eﬀect of microin-
surance on production behavior using randomized ﬁeld experiments. However, there is a small
existing literature in agricultural economics that examined the eﬀect of federal crop insurance
on farmers’ decisions. For example, Horowitz and Lichtenberg (1993) examined how crop insur-
ance aﬀects corn farmers’ fertilizer and pesticide use in the U.S. Midwest and found that farmers
purchasing insurance applied signiﬁcantly more nitrogen per acre, spent more on pesticides, and
treated more acreage with both herbicides and insecticides than those who did not purchase insur-
ance. Goodwin, Vandeveer and Deal (2004) examined the extent to which crop insurance programs
have resulted in additional land being brought into production and found that increased partici-
pation in insurance programs led to statistically signiﬁcant, but very modest, acreage responses.
O’Donoghue, Key and Roberts (2007) use a large increase in Federal crop insurance subsidies as a
natural experiment to examine how harvested acreage and diversiﬁcation changed in response to
the policy-induced change in insurance coverage. They found that changes in the risk environment
do not seem to have large overall eﬀects.

3    A Theoretical Framework
    In this section, we sketch a simple theoretical framework to illustrate the diﬀerence between
full insurance and eﬃcient insurance and to derive several predictions regarding how insurance
may aﬀect production.

Full Insurance vs. Eﬃcient Insurance. Townsend’s seminal research suggests that farmers
in India villages are rather insulated from idiosyncratic income shocks as a result of informal
insurance. Here we would like to point out that, to the extent that the risks that farmers expose
themselves to are endogenous, a ﬁnding that the farmers’ consumption is not sensitive to their
individual income realizations after controlling for the village level average consumption does
not necessary indicate that making formal insurance available to the farmers would not aﬀect
production. That is, a ﬁnding of full insurance does not necessarily imply eﬃcient insurance.
    Figure 1 illustrates this basic observation. Suppose that a farmer can choose whether to engage
in a risky project. If she undertakes the risky project, her consumption in the two states (loss,
or no loss) will be at point 𝐴. If she does not undertake the activity, her consumption will be at
point 𝐵, where she will be considered to be fully insured in Townsend’s analysis. However, if she
had access to an eﬃcient insurance market, her consumption bundle might have been at point 𝐶.
As depicted, the farmer will choose 𝐵 over 𝐴, i.e., she would not undertake the risky project if
she does not have access to the eﬃcient insurance market; but she will choose 𝐶 over 𝐴, i.e., she
would undertake the risky project if eﬃcient insurance market is available.
    Of course, if the informal insurance available to the farmer actually allows her to achieve
𝐶 when she undertakes the risky project, then oﬀering the eﬃcient formal insurance would not
change her behavior. This suggests that it is not suﬃcient from the knowledge of whether farmers’
consumption are fully insured to infer about whether formal insurance will lead to change in
behavior.
    This simple observation also suggests a simple test of the eﬃciency of informal insurance. The
informal insurance farmers have access to is eﬃcient only if farmers’ behavior, measured by their
production choices, is not aﬀected when formal eﬃcient insurance is made available. The empirical
ﬁnding in our paper shows that farmers’ sow production is signiﬁcantly aﬀected when they have
access to formal insurance; this suggests that the informal insurance that villagers in our sample
might have access to is not eﬃcient.

Insurance and Production: A Simple Model. Formally, consider a farmer with wealth 𝑤,
who is contemplating whether to raise a sow. Raising a sow is a risky business. If the sow is
healthy and productive, the farmer obtains a proﬁt of 𝐾 > 0, but if the sow dies, she suﬀers a loss

of 𝐿 > 0. The perceived death risk is given by 𝑝 ∈ [0, 1] , and suppose that 𝑝 is distributed in the
population according to PDF 𝑓 (⋅) with mean 𝑝¯. For simplicity, suppose that the farmer makes
only a discrete choice of whether to raise one sow.4 Let 𝑢 (⋅; 𝜃) denote the farmer’s utility function
where 𝜃 is a vector of parameters that may measure, for instance, the farmer’s risk aversion.5 Her
choice problem is:

                          max {𝑢 (𝑤; 𝜃) , (1 − 𝑝) 𝑢 (𝑤 + 𝐾; 𝜃) + 𝑝𝑢 (𝑤 − 𝐿; 𝜃)} .                            (1)

To the extent that there may be heterogeneity among farmers in (𝑤, 𝑝, 𝜃) , we can denote the set
of the farmers who choose 𝑛 = 1 as:

                   𝑆0 = {(𝑤, 𝑝, 𝜃) : (1 − 𝑝) 𝑢 (𝑤 + 𝐾; 𝜃) + 𝑝𝑢 (𝑤 − 𝐿; 𝜃) ≥ 𝑢 (𝑤; 𝜃)} .                      (2)

    Now suppose that insurance contracts which reimburse the sow farmers of the loss of 𝐿 in the
event of sow death at a premium of Δ = 𝑝¯𝐿 become available. The farmer’s decision now becomes
a two-stage problem: ﬁrst, she needs to decide whether to raise a sow and then she decides whether
   4
    Indeed in China, family-based sow farmers typically raise up to two sows only.
   5
    We should interpret the utility function 𝑢 (⋅; 𝜃) as a reduced form for how the farmer approaches risks given
whatever informal insurance she has access to. Thus, for example, if a farmer is already eﬃciently insured from
the informal insurance mechanisms, her utility function 𝑢 (⋅; 𝜃) will take the linear form.

                  {             〈                                              〉}

             max 𝑢 (𝑤; 𝜃) , max                                                   .             (3)

Denote the set of farmers who choose 𝑛 = 1 (raising one sow) as
            {               〈                                             〉           }

                        ≥ max ⟨𝑢 (𝑤; 𝜃) , (1 − 𝑝) 𝑢 (𝑤 + 𝐾; 𝜃) + 𝑝𝑢 (𝑤 − 𝐿; 𝜃)⟩ .

Obviously, 𝑆1𝑁 ⊆ 𝑆1𝐵 ⊆ 𝑆1 . That is, all new sow farmers purchase insurance; but not every sow
farmer will buy insurance.
   Our ﬁrst result is that if the insurance premium Δ is actuarially fair or favorable for some risk
type 𝑝, then access to the insurance contract will increase the level of risky production.

Proposition 1. (Insurance and Production) If the farmers are risk averse, then the set of
farmers who choose 𝑛 = 1 increases when insurance is oﬀered, i.e., 𝑆0 ⊂ 𝑆1 .

Proof. A farmer’s wealth in the “no loss” and “loss” states if they raise a sow are respectively
(𝑤 − Δ + 𝐾, 𝑤 − Δ) with insurance, and (𝑤 + 𝐾, 𝑤 − 𝐿) without insurance. For any farmer with
𝑝 ≥ 𝑝¯, the wealths without insurance represent either a mean-preserving or a mean-decreasing
spread. Thus, if the farmers are risk averse, we have:

        (1 − 𝑝) 𝑢 (𝑤 − Δ + 𝐾; 𝜃) + 𝑝𝑢 (𝑤 − Δ; 𝜃) > (1 − 𝑝) 𝑢 (𝑤 + 𝐾; 𝜃) + 𝑝𝑢 (𝑤 − 𝐿; 𝜃) .

The result follows from inspecting the expressions for 𝑆0 and 𝑆1 respectively in (2) and (4).

    In the above proposition, we assumed that the insurance premium Δ is set to be equal to
𝑝¯𝐿. However, the same logic implies that the conclusion also holds if, for each risk type 𝑝, the
insurance contract is oﬀered at the actuarially fair premium of 𝑝𝐿. We test for the prediction of
Proposition 1 in Section 7.
    In the next proposition, we derive some implications on who should purchase the sow insurance,
which will have implications for our discussion in Section 8.

                                                 7
Proposition 2. (Demand for Insurance)

    1. If farmers do not have private information regarding 𝑝, then all farmers who choose to raise
       sows should purchase the insurance if they are risk averse.

    2. However, if farmers have private information regarding 𝑝, then at least for some (𝑤, 𝜃) ,
       farmers with suﬃciently low 𝑝 will raise sows but do not purchase insurance even if they are
       risk averse.

    3. If farmers are risk neutral, then the insurance will be purchased only when farmers have
       private information about 𝑝 and only by those with 𝑝 > 𝑝¯.

Proof. If farmers do not have private information regarding 𝑝, then each will perceive their risk to
be 𝑝¯. Since Δ = 𝑝¯𝐿, the wealths without insurance is a mean preserving spread. Thus all farmers
who choose to raise sows will purchase the insurance if they are risk averse.
    If 𝑝 is private information, then for those with suﬃciently low 𝑝, the wealths with insurance at
premium Δ = 𝑝¯𝐿 is mean-reducing, even though it reduces variance of the wealth. If farmers are
suﬃciently close to risk neutral, then such insurance will lead to lower payoﬀ. Thus they will not
purchase insurance.
    When farmers are risk neutral, only those with 𝑝 > 𝑝¯ will ﬁnd that an insurance at premium
Δ = 𝑝¯𝐿 is actuarially favorable. Thus these and only these farmers will purchase the insurance.


4         Institutional Background
    Pork is an important part of Chinese daily diet. In 2006, about 52 million tons of pork was
produced in China, accounting for 46.9% of world pork production and 64.6% of China’s total
meat production, and the hog industry was valued at 644.25 billion Yuan, accounting for 48.4%
of the total livestock industry.6
    In China pigs are mainly raised by rural households in their backyard as a sideline business;
large-scale hog farms are unusual especially in mountainous regions in southwestern China. The
scattered and small scale nature of hog raising not only exposes farmers to market risks, but also
to high incidence of pig diseases. Mortality rates for pigs and sows are quite high due to backward
breeding technology, weak swine farm infrastructure, poor vaccination and veterinary drug abuse.
Natural disasters, such as wind storm, blizzard, thunder, ﬂooding and earthquake also frequently
aﬀect pig production.
    6
        See Wang and Watanabe (2007) for a comprehensive account of China’s hog production.


                                                        8
    Since early 2000s China’s hog production has suﬀered from increasingly varied and complex
species of pig plagues with the four most common diseases being swine fever, swine erysipelas,
hyopneumoniae, and piglets paratyphoid. The frequency and severity of the diseases exceeded the
capacity of Chinese veterinary system whose grass-root level animal epidemic prevention teams are
poorly paid and inadequately trained. The annual mortality rate for lactating sows was estimated
to be around 6% per year.
    Infectious animal diseases led to large pork production ﬂuctuations. For example, the bird ﬂu
epidemic of 2003 across China caused a sharp decline in the production of live pigs; and in the
second half of 2006, the deadly blue ear disease, which spreaded very fast and caused high mortality
rate, brought about another shortage in the pork market. Pork price was more than 60% higher in
June 2007 than in June 2006. Due to the importance of pork in Chinese diet, the dramatic pork
price increase led to intensiﬁed public complaint and concerns about food-prices-driven inﬂation.
As a result, the Chinese government decided to intervene and oﬀer government subsidy to increase
pork supply. One of these government measures was to oﬀer government-subsidized insurance on
sow deaths. In July 2007, the Ministry of Finance initiated a plan speciﬁcally subsidizing the
insurance of sows raised in the middle and western parts of China. Under the plan, insurance
policies for sows at a coverage of 1,000 Yuan in the event of death are oﬀered at a total annual
premium of 60 Yuan. However, the central and local governments combined pay for 80 percent
of the premium – speciﬁcally, the central government contributes 30 Yuan and local governments
18 Yuan – and the farmer only needs to pay 12 Yuan premium for the insurance. The policy will
cover deaths of sows caused by major diseases, natural distress, and accidents.7
    The Property and Casualty Company (PCC thereafter) of the People’s Insurance Group of
China was designated by the central government as the sole insurance company to deal with
the insurance underwriting and claim settlement related to the subsidized sow insurance. Local
branches of PCC subsequently cooperated with the Bureau of Animal Husbandry (BAH) at local
levels to collect premium payments from pig farmers.
    Because the central and local governments pay for 80% of the insurance premium, county
and township governments have strong incentives to encourage pig farmers to participate in the
insurance plan. To make farmers in remote villages be aware of and access the insurance, BAH
at county and township levels mobilized various resources to promote the insurance policy, such
as propagandizing the insurance policy and its beneﬁts in local radio and television. But the
   7
     In the insurance coverage, major diseases include septicemia, blue tongue, scrapie, swine fever, hyopneumoniae,
swine erysipelas, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), porcine epidemic diarrhea, strep-
tococcus suis, and foot and mouth disease. Natural diasters include typhoon, tornado, rainstorm, lightning stroke,
earthquake, ﬂooding, hailstone, debris-ﬂow and mountain landslide. Accidents include ﬁre, explosion, building
collapse, and falling parts or articles from aircraft and other ﬂying objects.


                                                         9
most important channel is the in-person marketing and promotion of the insurance policy in
villages through so-called Animal Husbandry Workers (Xu Mu Yuan in Chinese, AHW hereafter).
Every village has one AHW who is a village resident and works for the BAH on the part-time
contractor basis. AHWs serve as the bridge between formal institutions (speciﬁcally BAH) and
rural villages for matters involving animal husbandry. AHWs are especially important in our
experimental area where mountainous land and poor transportation infrastructure make it highly
costly for outsiders to access the villages. Typical obligations of AHWs include making immune
injection for animals, providing farmers technical assistance on animal-raising and monitoring
animal diseases and epidemics.
    PCC, in cooperation with the BAH, mobilized the AHWs for the insurance program because
the AHWs’ expertise in pig-raising, their local knowledge about and connections with villages are
crucial for the farmers’ participation in the sow insurance. The AHWs act as the messenger to
spread the word about the insurance policies, explain to and convince farmers about the policy’s
beneﬁts, and act as a coordinator between PCC and farmers. For example, the insurance policy
requires that each sow be earmarked, literally, with a unique identiﬁcation number to be eligible
for insurance and to be veriﬁed in the case of a claim; AHWs thus need to count and check all
potentially eligible sows in the village and make earmarks. Local BAHs held special training
programs for the AHWs to understand the details of the sow insurance, as well as basic skills of
eﬀective promotion and persuasion.
    The regular pay for AHWs usually involves some ﬁxed wage (often a tiny amount) and fees for
services they provide, and varies across diﬀerent parts of China. In Jinsha county of Bijie prefecture
in Guizhou province, where our ﬁeld experiment was conducted, AHWs’ regular monthly pay is
15 Yuan lump sum and fees for services such as immunization injections. For their involvement in
the sow insurance campaign, local branches of PCC paid the AHWs a small lump sum to “cover
their food and transportation costs.” As we will describe in detail below, in our ﬁeld experiment,
we randomly assign the AHWs into diﬀerent additional incentives for their performance in terms
of the number of sow insurance purchases in their villages.


5    Experimental Design
    In order to obtain a consistent estimate of the eﬀect of insurance on farmers’ production
behavior, the key is to isolate an exogenous source of variation in insurance coverage. Within
the context of China’s sow insurance as described in Section 4, our idea is to randomize the
assignment of AHWs into diﬀerent incentive schemes for their performance in terms of the number
of sow insurance purchases in their villages. Diﬀerent incentive schemes are expected to generate


                                                 10
diﬀerent insurance coverages across villages. Given the randomization, the diﬀerence in incentive
schemes across villages should be unrelated to the sow output except for the indirect eﬀect on
production through insurance coverage. In our main empirical analysis, we will indeed use the
random incentive assignment as the instrumental variable for village-level insurance coverage and
identify the causal relationship between insurance and production.
    Our ﬁeld experiment was conducted in Jinsha County of Bijie Prefecture in Guizhou province.
Located in southwestern China, Guizhou province is a low-income region which relies heavily on
natural resources and agriculture. In 2007 the annual per capita net income of farmers was 2,458
Yuan in Bijie prefecture, and was 2,853 Yuan in Jinsha county. Bijie prefecture has a population
of 7.38 million and over 93 percent of its area is either highland or mountains. Because of poor
road conditions in the highland and mountainous areas, AHWs’ eﬀort is crucial in determining
the success of the sow insurance program.
    The local government of Jinsha County allowed us to run the experiment in 480 villages out
of a total 580 villages within its jurisdiction. Based on information from the China Agricultural
Census of 2006 (described below in Section 6), there is no systematic diﬀerence in all economic
indicators, including pig raising, between the villages in our experimental sample and the 100
left-out villages.
    In our experiment, we randomly assigned the AHWs of the 480 villages into three incentive
schemes.8 The incentives are summarized in Table 1. In the ﬁrst group of 120 villages, the AHWs
were oﬀered a ﬁxed reward of 50 Yuan to participate in our study with no additional incentives.
We refer to this group as the control group villages. The AHWs in the second group of 120 villages
are oﬀered a 20 Yuan ﬁxed reward, and an additional payment of 2 Yuan for each insured sow.
We refer to this group as the low incentive group (LIG) villages. In the remaining 240 villages, the
AHWs are oﬀered a 20 Yuan ﬁxed reward and an additional payment of 4 Yuan for each insured
sow. We refer to this group as the high incentive group (HIG) villages.9
    We believe that our choices of the ﬁxed payment and the incentives are very attractive to the
AHWs. As we mentioned in Section 4, PCC oﬀers only a small lump sum payment to AHWs
for their involvement in the sow insurance program; moreover, the regular monthly pay from the
BAH for the AHWs is only 15 Yuan. As a result, we expect that our incentive scheme will have
a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the sow insurance purchases.
    Each AHW in our experimental village was informed about the assigned reward plan on No-
vember 20, 2007 with cooperation from local BAH. They were also told that their performance

would be determined by the insurance polices collected and conﬁrmed by PCC. The experiment
took ﬁve weeks from November 21 to December 25.10 The data on insured sows in each sampled
village were collected in the week just after the experiment ended.


5.1     Discussions
    Why do we randomize at the village level? An alternative would be to conduct an experiment
where the randomization is at the household level. That is, we may randomly select a set of
households and make available to them the formal insurance option, while withholding such options
to the non-selected households. However, under such an experimental design, it is inevitable that
some households in the same village have access to formal insurance while others do not. It is
impractical to refuse to cover those households who were not oﬀered the insurance option, but
learned about it from the neighbors and would like to be insured. Such self-selecting households
would contaminate the randomization in the experimental data.
    Furthermore, there is a more serious shortcoming of household level randomization. As we
mentioned in the Introduction, there is substantial evidence that villagers in the same village are
likely engaged in informal risk sharing (see Townsend, 1994 for example), randomizing insurance
access at the household level may actually lead to an under-estimate of the true eﬀect of insurance
on production, due to the potential risk shifting from those households without access to formal
insurance to those with access.
    Randomizing at the village level has the added beneﬁt that we do not have to collect detailed
information about each household, given that we have the fortunate access to the detailed pre-
experiment village level information from the China Agricultural Census (CAC) conducted in early
2007.11
  10
     December 25 was the cut-oﬀ date for insurance purchase to be eﬀective from January 1, 2008. Only new sows
(that were not oﬃcially registered by the AHWs by December 25, 2007) would be accepted for insurance coverage
after this cut-oﬀ date.
  11
     See Section 6.2 below for details about the CAC.



                                                     12
    At the village level, a most obvious alternative research design is randomized phase-in.12 We
initially pursued this idea, but the Bijie Prefecture government insisted that preventing some
randomly selected villages from accessing the heavily subsidized sow insurance was impractical.
We then debated alternative ways to randomly generate diﬀerential access to insurance. We believe
that, by randomly allocating incentives to the Animal Husbandry Workers, we can generate de
facto diﬀerential access to the insurance product in diﬀerent villages. Indeed the ﬁrst-stage result
reported in Table 5 below conﬁrmed that incentives we provided to the AHWs led to substantial
diﬀerences in the number of insured sows.
    However, for our experimental design to work, AHWs’ eﬀorts must lead to diﬀerences in the
farmers’ insurance purchase decisions. Given that the heavily subsidized sow insurance was avail-
able to all villages, AHWs’ eﬀort diﬀerential could make diﬀerences in the farmers’ insurance
purchase decisions only when they would not have necessarily purchased the insurance, despite
the heavy subsidy, without the AHWs’ promoting eﬀorts (e.g., explaining and convincing farmers
about the beneﬁts of the insurance, etc). This is an important part of how our experimental
variations in the AHWs’ incentives can generate the desired variations in de facto access to the
insurance products. We return to examine this issue in Section 8.
    Finally, to the extent that our experimental variations in the AHWs’ incentives can generate
the desired variations in de facto access to the insurance products, it has one additional advantage
over the random phase-in design. With a random phase-in, villages will either have or not have
access to the insurance option, the experimental variation in access to insurance option is restricted
to a 0/1 dichotomous variation. In our experimental design, we can in principle generate a much
richer variation in insurance access because we can potentially provide a large variety of incentives
to AHWs.


6      Data
6.1    Data from the Experiment
    The data collected from our experiment is at the village level. For each village, we record the
total number of insured sows, including the identiﬁcation number of the insured sows, as well as
a list of the AHW characteristics, including his/her name, age, gender, education etc. We also
record the total payment received by the AHW in each village.
  12
   See Miguel and Kremer (2004) for an example of randomized phase-in design, and see Duﬂo, Glennerster and
Kremer (2007) for a general discussion about diﬀerent ﬁeld experiment designs.

6.2     Other Data Sets
   We match the data collected during the experiment with two other data sources: the China
Agricultural Census (CAC) of 2006, and the detailed sow death records and sow productions in
2008 from the local Bureau of Animal Husbandry.

China Agricultural Census of 2006. The China Agricultural Census (CAC) was conducted
by the National Bureau of Statistics of China between January and February of 2007. It was
followed by another two-month of data double-check to ensure the census quality. The CAC
covers 250 million rural households in 640 thousand villages and 35 thousand townships in China,
and it collects detailed information about agricultural production and services in farming, forestry,
husbandry and ﬁshery as of the fourth quarter of 2006.13 We obtained the detailed CAC data for
all villages in our study area, Bijie Prefecture in Guizhou Province.
    The CAC has several components, including one that is ﬁlled out by village leaders regarding
village characteristics such as registered population, villagers working as migrant workers else-
where, total farm land area, basic infrastructure (such as paved road, water treatment facility,
schools, etc.) and village government ﬁnancial information, etc.
    The main component of the CAC data, however, was collected at the household level. House-
hold heads were asked to enter information for every member of their households. We observe from
the household component detailed household information including how many individuals reside
in the household, their relationship to the household head, their age and gender composition, the
amount of contract land, the amount of land in use, ownership of housing, the self-estimated value
of house(s), ownership of durable goods, the availability of electricity, water and other amenities,
the number of household members that receive government subsidies, and engagement in various
agricultural activities including the number of sows and number of pigs raised in the household.
    We aggregate up the relevant household data to the village level and then match it, together
with the village component of the CAC, to our experimental data using the unique village identi-
ﬁcation number common to CAC and our experimental data.

Data from the Local Bureau of Animal Husbandry (BAH). We obtained data from the
agricultural statistics collected by the local Bureau of Animal Husbandry (BAH). In particular,
  13
    The National Bureau of Statistics of China also conducted an earlier round of China Agricultural Census in
1996. The aim of the CAC is to produce reliable statistics for rural population and activities; and it is designed
to cover every individual that resided or had registered residence in a rural village at the time of interview. For
more detailed information about this census, see “The Action Plan of the Second National Agricultural Census”
at http://www.stats.gov.cn/zgnypc/



                                                        14
we obtained the counts of the number of sows in each village tabulated by the BAH on the third
and fourth quarter of 2007, as well as the tabulations at the end of the ﬁrst two quarters of 2008.
    We also obtained the sow death records from the BAH. When a sow dies, the village AHW
records the death, and collects claim evidence, in particular, the number on the ear of the sow
that uniquely identiﬁes the sow. The AHW then submits the list of identiﬁcation ear numbers
of the dead sows to the BAH at the township level and then up to the local BAH, and ﬁnally to
the local branch (county-level) of the insurance company, PICC Property and Casualty Company.
The insurance company then sends its claim staﬀ to check and conﬁrm the death and its reasons.
If the death is conﬁrmed to be covered by the policy, the company makes compensation payment
to the farmer.


6.3     Descriptive Statistics
    Table 2 presents the basic summary statistics of the key variables used in our analysis, both
for the whole sample and separately by experimental groups. An observation is a village that
participated in our experiment. The pre-experiment variables are characteristics of the villages
collected before our experiment period (November 21 to December 25, 2007), mostly from the
Chinese Agricultural Census. The average number of sows in December 2006 was 16.3 across all
480 villages; and it was 17.9, 13.2 and 16.9 respectively among the control, LIG and HIG villages.
Even though the means are diﬀerent, a formal test cannot reject the null that the means of the
three groups are equal (with a 𝑝-value of 15.6%).14 It is interesting to note that the average
number of sows across all villages increased by almost 80 percent from 16.3 in December 2006 to
29.1 in September 2007, right before we conducted our study. In fact, the average numbers of
sows in September 2007 were very close across the three experimental groups, with means being
28.8, 28.1 and 29.8 respectively for the control, LIG and HIG villages. The number of pigs in each
village is about 350 in December 2006. The average population is about 1000 with an average age
of about 33, and about 20% of the villagers work elsewhere as migrant workers. About 54% of
the population in each village is male, and the average years of schooling is about 6, which means
that the average person in the villages just about ﬁnished the elementary school. Each household
has about 4.3 Mu of land – equivalent to about .71 acres – that is typical for this part of China.
    We also reported in Table 2 the means of two variables that we will use in our analysis in
Section 8 below. On average, there are about 551 villagers participating in the government-run
  14
    In fact, with the exception of the variable “Fraction Male in Village,” for all the other pre-experiment variables
in Table 2, formal tests show that the null that the means are equal across the three experimental groups are not
rejected. The “Fraction Male in Village” in LIG villages is 0.49% higher than that in the control group villages
and it is signiﬁcant with a 𝑝-value of 1.7%. The details are available from the authors upon request.

     Table 2: Summary Statistics of Key Village-Level Variables.
     Note: Each observation is a village. The whole sample consists of 480 villages, with 120, 120 and 240 respectively in the control group, the
     low and high incentive treatment groups.
New Cooperative Mecical Scheme (NCMS). Among all the villages, the NCMS participation rate
has a mean of 57% and a standard deviation of about 16.5%, thus there is substantial variation
across villages in the NCMS participation rates. Also, about 17% of the individuals receive some
form of government subsidy. We will use these two variables as proxies for trust for government
sponsored programs in our investigation of the role of trust in Section 8.
    Table 2 also reports the summary statistics of several post-experimental variables. The average
number of insured sows across the villages is 22.67. If we use the number of sows in September
2007 as the actual number of sows eligible for insurance, the aggregate takeup rate is about 78%.
However, there is substantial variation in insurance sign up rates across the experimental groups.
Among the control group villages, an average of 15.47 sows out of an average of 28.8 available
sows were insured; in LIG villages, an average of 21.51 sows out of an average of 28.1 available
sows were signed up for insurance; and in HIG villages, an average of 26.85 out of 29.8 sows were
signed up for insurance.
    We also report the number of sow deaths during the deadly snow storm between January 12
and February 25, 2008. On average, 0.19 sows died in one village. In addition, the table shows that
the number of sows in March 2008 and June 2008 continues to rise from the levels in September
2007.


6.4    Test of Randomization
    In Table 2 we showed that for almost all the pre-experiment variables, their means are equal
across the villages assigned in the three experimental groups. Table 3 reports a more formal test
of the quality of randomization underlying our experiment. It regresses the probability of being
assigned to the three experimental groups on a list of pre-experiment village-level variables. We
report the coeﬃcient estimates from the linear probability model, as well as the multinomial Probit
and Logit models. Table 3 overwhelmingly shows that none of the included variables predict the
experimental group assignment. In the whole Table 3, which reports 72 coeﬃcient estimates,
only two are marginally signiﬁcant at 10% level. Also, note that the adjusted 𝑅2 for the linear
probability models and the pseudo-𝑅2 for the Logit model are both less than 0.017, suggesting
that the experimental group assignments are very much random.

2008 and June 2008, about three and six months after our experiment respectively, on the number
of sows insured during our experimental period. However, in order to estimate a causal eﬀect of
insurance on production, one needs to exploit some exogenously induced variations in insurance
coverage. In Section 7.2, we use the random experimental group assignment as instruments for
the number of insured sows in order to recover the causal eﬀect of insurance access on subsequent
production.


7.1       Results from the OLS Regressions
       Table 4 reports results from the following OLS speciﬁcations:
               Y𝑖 = 𝛼0 + 𝛼1 Insured Sows𝑖 + Sows2006𝑖 + Township Dummies + 𝜖𝑖 ,                            (5)
where Y𝑖 represents the number of sows in village 𝑖 measured in March 2008 (Panel A) or June
2008 (Panel B), “Insured Sows” represents the number of insured sows in village 𝑖 by the end of
the fourth quarter of 2007, and “Sows2006” represents the number of sows measured in December
2006, and a set of Township dummies are included in some speciﬁcations in order to control for
the eﬀects of township-speciﬁc characteristics on sow-raising.15 Robust standard errors clustered
at the township level are used to calculate the 𝑡-statistics reported in parenthesis in Table 4.
    Focusing on the speciﬁcations with both controls of Township dummies and Sows2006 re-
ported in Column (3) of Panel A and Column (6) of Panel B, we see that insuring one more sow
in the fourth quarter of 2007 is associated with 1.093 more sows raised in March 2008 and 1.158
more sows in June 2008, after controlling for the number of sows in the village at the end of 2006
and the Township dummies. Both coeﬃcient estimates are strongly statistically signiﬁcant with
𝑝-value close to 0.
    However, the variation in the number of insured sows used in the above OLS regressions in-
cludes not only the exogenous variation induced by the randomly assigned AHW incentives, but
also endogenous variations across villages that may result from selection on unobserved hetero-
geneity across villages. Thus the OLS estimate cannot be interpreted as causal eﬀects of insurance
on subsequent production. For example, it could be that a village where more farmers are contem-
plating raising more sows are more likely to purchase sow insurance when such option is presented.
This would lead to an upward bias in the estimated eﬀect of insurance on production.
  15
     We choose to include the number of sows measured in December 2006 instead of in September 2007 for two
reasons. The pork price spike occurred in early 2007 somewhat unexpectedly, so the sows in December 2006 were
raised without the eﬀect from the pork price spike. Second, using sows measured at December 2006 also mitigates
the eﬀect of potential behavioral change in anticipation of the possible government subsidized sow insurance.
  However, if we were to replace Sows2006 by Sows2007, the estimated coeﬃcient on Insured Sows barely
changes both qualitatively and quantitatively. Results are available from the authors upon request.

7.2     Results from IV Regressions
    In order to identify the causal eﬀect of insurance coverage on sow production, we need to
isolate the exogenous variation in insurance access induced by the randomly assigned incentives
we provide to the Animal Husbandry Workers. In this section, we use the experimental group
assignment as instruments for insured sows in estimating regression equation (5).

First-Stage Results A valid instrument variable for Insured Sows in Equation (5) requires
that it be orthogonal to the error term 𝜖 and that it be signiﬁcantly correlated with Insured Sows
when all other relevant independent variables are controlled. Since the assignments of experimental
group to villages were random and should be unrelated to the sow production at the village level,
as demonstrated in Table 3, the ﬁrst requirement for experimental group assignment as an IV
for Insured Sows is automatically satisﬁed. Indeed Hansen’s 𝐽-statistics from the IV regression
reported in Table 6 is only 0.068; thus the over-identiﬁcation test does not reject the null that all
instruments are valid (with a 𝑝-value of 0.7938). This formally conﬁrms that instruments satisfy
the assumption that both are orthogonal to the error term 𝜖 in Equation (5).
    Now we report the ﬁrst-stage result that shows that the second requirement for the IV to be
valid is also satisﬁed. Table 5 reports the result from regressing the number of insured sows on
the experimental groups (Low Incentive Group and High Incentive Group, with the Control group
as the default category), controlling for the number of sows measured in December of 2006 and a

set of Township dummies.16 Overall we ﬁnd a very strong and signiﬁcant incentive eﬀect on the
insurance coverage. According to the estimates in the preferred speciﬁcation (Column 3), moving
from the control group with ﬁxed compensation to the low incentive treatment group results in
nearly 9.7 additional insured sows. Since the sample mean of the insurance coverage is 22.6, the
increase of 9.7 sows represents about 43% of the sample mean, an economically signiﬁcant eﬀect.
Moreover, as expected, we found that this incentive eﬀect is stronger for the high incentive group.
When Township dummies are included, the whole set of independent variables can explain more
than 45% of the total variation in the number of insured sows. Importantly, the partial 𝑅2 from
the ﬁrst-stage is about 0.0625, and the ﬁrst-stage 𝐹 -statistics for the signiﬁcance of the excluded
instrument is 13.49, well above the conventional threshold of 10 for weak instrument for the case of
a single endogenous regressor (see Staiger and Stock, 1997, p557; and Baum, Schaﬀer and Stillma,
2003).

results are available from the authors upon request.

the random assignment of incentives to AHWs, the estimated eﬀects of insurance on subsequent
production are smaller than those from the OLS regression reported in Table 4; but nonetheless,
the eﬀects of the number of insured sows in the fourth quarter of 2007 on the number of sows
measured in March and June 2008 are both statistically and economically signiﬁcant. In the
preferred speciﬁcations, Columns (3) and (6), one additional insured sow in the fourth quarter of
2007 increased the number of sows by 0.76 by March 2008 and by 0.819 by June 2008. Both of
the coeﬃcient estimates are signiﬁcant at 5% level.
    These eﬀects are very large. From the ﬁrst-stage result reported in Table 5, we know that the
low and high incentive group villages insured about 9.6 and 12.0 more sows, respectively, than the
control group villages. These increases in insured sows, according to the estimates in Table 6, led
to about 7.3 and 9.1 more sows being raised by March 2008 in the low and high incentive group
villages respectively than in the control group villages. Note from Table 2, however, the actual
diﬀerence in the number of sows in March 2008 between the low incentive group villages and the
control group villages is only 3.2, suggesting that if the extra incentives to the AHW workers were
not provided in the low incentive villages, there would have been 4.1 fewer sows in these villages
than in the control villages because, after all, the control villages had more sows in both December
2006 and September 2007. The diﬀerence in the number of sows between the high incentive group
villages and control group villages should be understood analogously.
    Finally, it is worth mentioning that there seems to some suggestive evidence that the eﬀect of
insurance on the number of sows is larger when the sows are measured in June 2008 (6 months
after the insurance was provided) than in March 2008 (only 3 months after the insurance was
provided). This is true both for the OLS result in Table 4 and the IV results in Table 6. This
most likely reﬂects the natural constraint that turning young female pigs into sows takes time;
typically, a farmer makes a decision about whether to keep a female pig as a sow or to slaughter
it and sell its pork when the pig is about 9 months old.


8    The Role of Trust in the Demand for Microinsurance
     Policies in Less Developed Regions
   As we discussed in Section 1, for our experimental design to work, it is crucial that not all
farmers will purchase the heavily subsidized insurance regardless of what incentives we give to the
AHWs. Fortunately for us, this is indeed not the case. As one can see from Table 2, for control
group villages, there were about 28.8 sows on average in the end of September 2007 (and likely
even more in November 2007 when our experiment was conducted), but on average only 15.5 sows

were insured. The take up rate for this heavily subsidized insurance option is just over 50% in the
control group villages.
    In this section, we explore the question of the apparently low takeup rate of the heavily
subsidized sow insurance, and in particular, we provide some suggestive evidence for the role
played by the villagers’ “trust” in these insurance products in their purchase decisions.
    It is useful to note that, from a theoretical perspective, there are several reasons that a farmer
may refuse to purchase a heavily subsidized insurance. First, even if a farmer is risk averse, she
may ﬁnd the insurance not worthwhile if she has private information that her risk is suﬃciently
lower than the average sow death probability used in setting the insurance premium (see Part 2
of Proposition 2). Second, if farmers do not have private information, they may refuse to buy
the subsidized insurance if they are already fully and eﬃciently insured by informal mechanisms
and thus behave as if they are risk neutral (see Part 3 in Proposition 2). These two possible
explanations, however, are inconsistent with our ﬁnding reported in Table 5 that sow insurance
coverage rates are signiﬁcantly aﬀected by the randomly assigned incentives to the AHWs. After
all, neither private information about the actual risks of sow death risk, nor the farmers’ risk
aversion could be aﬀected by what the AHW does.
    A third potential explanation is that not all farmers are aware of the sow insurance program
being introduced in the villages, and AHWs can aﬀect the takeup rates if they work harder to
spread the information to more farmers. This explanation is consistent with the ﬁrst-stage results
on the eﬀect of AHW incentives on the insurance takeup rate. But we discuss how our additional


                                                      23
evidence below is less supportive to this explanation, especially, the third evidence on the eﬀect of
sow deaths during a severe snow storm shortly after our experiment on subsequent sow production.
    A fourth potential explanation, which we provide several pieces of collaborating evidence for,
is that farmers have diﬀerent degrees of trust for whether the insurance product being oﬀered
is credible.17 It is important to note that, diﬀerent from any other subsidized program (such
as micro-credit) in which farmers receive money from the government or ﬁnancial institutions
up front; in the microinsurance setting, farmers are required to pay their insurance premium up
front, despite the discount, before securing any potential beneﬁt from this policy in the event of
a sow death. As a result, interested farmers can be seriously concerned about whether they are
able to get the payment as promised in the insurance contract if some unfavorable contingencies
occur. The issue of trustworthiness of government policies is particularly relevant in China since
governments at all levels often renege on their policy promises, and from the viewpoint of Chinese
farmers, local bureaucrats at townships are always searching for “legitimate” reasons to ask them
for money and sometimes even cheat them into paying unnecessary fees. More importantly, if local
governments fail to deliver their promises in the contract, there is virtually no way for farmers to
sue the government in the court.18
    When farmers do not have complete trust on whether the insurance product is genuine, the
insurance policy itself becomes a risk, as seen clearly in the simple model presented below in
Section 8.1. Importantly, under the trust explanation, AHWs can dispel farmers’ potential doubt
about the insurance policies by spending more time explaining to them how the policy works.
    As we mentioned in the introduction, our examination of the role of trust for the villagers’
demand of insurance echoes that of Cole et al. (2008) in their study of rainfall insurance. We
should emphasize that in their setting the rainfall insurance was oﬀered by a for-proﬁt insurance
company without premium subsidy. Thus, the trust examined in their setting is the trust for
insurance products oﬀered commercially, while in our setting the trust is for government-sponsored,
heavily subsidized insurance products. We should also note that we did not randomize trust in
our experimental design, while Cole et al. (2008) did in their study. It is interesting to note that
our evidence strongly collaborates their ﬁndings.
  17
     The importance of trust has also been recognized in Guiso, Sapienza and Zingales (2008) , which ﬁnds that
trust is an important determinant of stock market participation.
  18
     In China, the court is controlled by the government and it is very unlikely for the court to make ruling decisions
unfavorable to the government.

8.1       A Simple Model of Trust and Insurance Takeup
    First, Proposition 2 showed that there is no reason to expect an universal insurance take up
even if the premium is heavily subsidized. In particular, when risk type 𝑝 is private information,
those with suﬃciently small 𝑝 will not purchase the subsidized insurance if they are close to risk
neutral. However, such an explanation for the low takeup rate of the sow insurance would not have
predicted a systematic eﬀect of the incentives we oﬀered to the AHWs on the insurance takeup
rates.
    We now provide a simple model where the farmers are uncertain of whether the insurance
policy will be honored in the event of a sow death. When a farmer pays a premium of Δ for the
insurance, she faces uncertainty as to whether the insurance will be honored in the event of a
loss realization. Let 𝑡 ∈ [0, 1] denote the farmer’s probability belief that the insurance product is
trustworthy. Now the choice problem for the farmer is as follows:
      {               〈                                                                            〉}
                         (1 − 𝑝) 𝑢 (𝑤 + 𝐾 − Δ; 𝜃) + 𝑝 [𝑡𝑢 (𝑤 − Δ; 𝜃) + (1 − 𝑡) 𝑢 (𝑤 − Δ − 𝐿; 𝜃)] ,
 max 𝑢 (𝑤; 𝜃) , max                                                                                    .
                                           (1 − 𝑝) 𝑢 (𝑤 + 𝐾; 𝜃) + 𝑝𝑢 (𝑤 − 𝐿; 𝜃)
                                                                                                   (6)
The diﬀerence from (3) is that now in the event of a loss, the farmer only expects a payment of
𝐿 with probability 𝑡; and with probability 1 − 𝑡, she expects that she simply forfeits the premium
payment of Δ without receiving any compensation for her loss of 𝐿.
    Not surprisingly, the set of farmers whose behavior will be impacted by the access of insurance
now depends on 𝑡. The lower the trust, i.e., the smaller 𝑡 is, the less the impact of the insurance on
farmers’ production decisions. In the extreme when 𝑡 is zero, it is clear from (6) that the insurance
option is always dominated by the no insurance option.


8.2       Evidence 1: The Relationship Between Participation in the New
          Cooperative Medical Scheme and Sow Insurance Purchase
   As our ﬁrst piece of evidence that trust, or lack therefor, for government sponsored programs
may prevent farmers from purchasing the heavily subsidized sow insurance, we show that villages
where the farmers have previously demonstrated a higher level of participation in another gov-
ernment sponsored voluntary insurance program – the New Rural Cooperative Medical Scheme
(NCMS) – are also more likely to purchase the sow insurance.

New Cooperative Medical Scheme.19 The original Cooperative Medical Scheme (CMS),
introduced in rural China in the 1950s, was dismantled with the collapse of the collective economy
 19
      See Lei and Lin (2008) and references cited therein for more background information about the NCMS.


                                                       25
in the early 1980s. As a result, by 1985 only about 5% of rural counties in China had any form
of health care insurance. Chinese government launched the New Cooperative Medical Scheme in
2003, aiming to provide health coverage for the nation’s entire rural population by 2010. Both the
central and local governments provide subsidies to the premium. For Guizhou Province, in 2003
when NCMS was initiated, the central and local governments respectively subsidized the program
at the rate of 10 Yuan and 40 Yuan per enrollee annually; and the subsidy amounts were increased
to 20 Yuan and 50 Yuan respectively in 2006. Each enrollee is only required to contribute 24 Yuan
annually. Somewhat surprisingly, the heavily subsidized and reasonably priced NCMS was not an
immediate success; at the national level, the percentage of rural residents covered under the NCMS
increased from 3% in 2004 to 40.57% in 2006. In our sample of villages, as described in Table 2,
about slightly over 50% of the villagers signed up the NCMS, with quite sizeable variations in the
coverage rates across villages.

Empirical Result. While there might be a multitude of reasons for the variation in the NCMS
coverage across villages, in this section we entertain the hypothesis that one of these sources is
the trust for government sponsored programs. Under this hypothesis, if trust is also an important
determinant for villagers’ purchase of the sow insurance, we would then expect to see that there
would be positive correlation between a village’s takeup of the NCMS and its takeup of the sow
insurance.
    Columns (1)-(4) in Table 7 reports the relationship between the number of insured sows and the
number of villagers who participated in the NCMS. Results from the preferred speciﬁcation, which
controls for the number of sows in December 2006, as well as the experimental group assignment
and Township dummies, are reported in Column (4). The estimated coeﬃcient on the number of
villagers in NCMS is positive and signiﬁcant at the 10% level, thus suggesting that there is some
underlying common unobservable factor that leads the villagers to more likely join the NCMS
and purchase the sow insurance. At the point estimate, a one standard deviation increase in the
number of villagers in the NCMS, which is about 300 from Table 2, will lead to an increase of 4.5
additional insured sows, which represents about 20% of the mean number of insured sows (about
22.7 from Table 2).
    While we do not have direct evidence of what the common unobservable factors are, there are
several candidates. One is trust, or lack thereof, for government sponsored programs. Villages that
have a higher trust for government programs in general will both have a higher participation rate
in the NCMS, and are more likely to purchase the subsidized sow insurance. In villages assigned
to the high incentive group, the AHWs can increase sow insurance coverage by spending more
time to dispel the doubts that farmers may harbor toward the government sponsored insurance


                                                26
product. The fact that AHWs are the residents of villages and their personal reputation is held
as a “hostage” if they cheat their fellow villagers helps AHWs do their work well.
     Another candidate for the unobservable factor is that villages may diﬀer in how easy the infor-
mation about the government sponsored programs spread. For example, some villages may have
more close-knit social networks that words about the government sponsored programs, whether
it is the NCMS or the sow insurance, will quickly spread, leading to higher participation rates in
both the NCMS and the sow insurance. This channel, however, does not seem to be very plausible
because the NCMS has been in place for almost four years, and it is unlikely that any villager has
not heard about the NCMS. Yet, the participation rate for the NCMS is still low in the villages
with low participation rate for the sow insurance.20
     A third candidate is that the villages diﬀer in risk aversion. But as we argued in the beginning
of this Section, the incentives we assigned to the AHWs would not have a big eﬀect on the insured
sows if villages diﬀer only in risk aversion.



8.3     Evidence 2: The Relationship Between the Number of Households
        Receiving Government Subsidies and the Sow Insurance Purchase
    Our second piece of suggestive evidence that trust for government sponsored programs may
be the main reason for the seemingly low takeup rate of the sow insurance is the systematic
relationship between the number of households receiving government subsidies and the purchase
of sow insurance, reported in Columns (5)-(8) in Table 7. Here we hypothesize that villagers who
have been receiving government subsidies tend to have a higher trust for government sponsored
programs in general, and thus the subsidized sow insurance product in particular. The preferred
speciﬁcation with all the controls is reported in Column (8) and the coeﬃcient estimate on the
number of households receiving government subsidy is positive and signiﬁcant at 1%. At the point
estimate of the coeﬃcient, a one standard-deviation increase in the number of households receiving
government subsidy, which is 92 from Table 2, is associated with an increase of 5.4 insured sows,
representing about 25% of the mean number of insured sows (about 22.7 from Table 2).
    Potential lack of information about the government sponsored programs cannot be the common
unobservable factor explaining the positive association between households receiving government
subsidies and the number of insured sows. The reason is that eligible households with per capita
income below a government speciﬁed threshold automatically receive government subsidies; there
  20
    Moreover, if closer knit social network is the reason for better information spreading for the government
sponsored programs, it would at the same time also lead to less, not more, need for formal insurance.

is no need for ﬁlling out an application and thus there cannot be an eﬀect of knowledge about the
existence of the subsidy programs.
    It is also worth pointing out that villages with more households receiving government subsidies
tend to be poorer, and as a result farmers in such villages may be more risk averse. However,
this channel would not have explained why the diﬀerent incentives we provide to AHWs had a
large positive eﬀect on the sow insurance purchase. After all, the villages are randomly assigned
to the experimental groups, and as Tables 2 and 3 showed clearly, villages assigned to diﬀerent
experimental groups do not seem to exhibit any diﬀerence in the numbers of households receiving
government subsidies.


8.4     Evidence 3: Sow Death in a Snow Storm and the Eﬀect of Insur-
        ance on Subsequent Sow Production
   Finally, we report evidence from an unanticipated severe ice and snow storm that occurred
shortly after our ﬁeld experiment to show that lack of trust for government sponsored programs
might have played a crucial role in the low takeup rate of sow insurance.

Ice and Snow Storm in Early 2008. In early 2008, just a month and a half after our ﬁeld
experiment, a severe ice and snow storm hit southern and southwestern China and Guizhou was one
of the most aﬀected provinces. This storm began in mid-Janurary and ended until mid-Feburary,
and its scope and severity were unprecedented in at least the last ﬁfty years. Since snow storms
in general are rare in this part of China, let alone one with such severity, many sows and pigs died
during the snow storm especially for those sows raised in the backyard of village households which
lacked necessary facilities. News report indicated that there were a total of 5,973 sows that died
during the storm in Guizhou province. This unusual event, right after our experiment, oﬀers us a
rare opportunity to test the role of trust in the purchase of sow insurances.21
    The idea is simple. Nothing is more convincing to the villagers that the government subsidized
sow insurance is for real than actually paying out the promised damage compensation in this
unusual event. Indeed, as reported by Xinghua News Agency and Financial Times (Chinese),
following government directives, the insurance company quickly dispatched work teams to remote
villages to deal with claim evaluations and settlements.22
  21
    According to Wang and Watanabe (2007), summer months are the most deadly months for pigs in general.

Empirical Results. In fact, the ice and snow storm and the subsequent compensation from
the insurance company for insured sow deaths has two possible eﬀects. On the one hand, it
probably led farmers to have a higher awareness of the riskiness of the environment; on the other
hand, the insurance company’s prompt claim processing provided farmers a unique opportunity to
learn about the credibility of the insurance product. The ﬁrst eﬀect, in the absence of insurance
options, may lead to fewer sows in the future.23 The second eﬀect implies that, in villages with
more sow deaths and more insured sows, there would be more positive cases that the sow insurance
contracts are honored. Such positive cases of the insurance contracts being honored would raise
the villagers’ trust for the sow insurance program. Thus this mechanism will predict that the
eﬀect of sow insurance for subsequent sow production should be stronger in such villages.
    Table 8 reports results from regressions, both OLS and IV, that examines the eﬀect of insured
sows on the sow production measured in March 2008 (Panel A) and June 2008 (Panel B). The
speciﬁcations are similar to those in Table 6 except that we add “No. of Sow Deaths in Snow
Storm” in speciﬁcations in odd-numbered columns and additionally we include the interaction of
“No. of Insured Sows” and “No. of Sow Deaths in Snow Storm” in even-numbered columns.
    In all speciﬁcations, the number of insured sows in the fourth quarter of 2007 continue to
have a signiﬁcantly positive eﬀect on subsequent sow production measured in March and June
of 2008. The estimated magnitudes of the eﬀect do diﬀer across speciﬁcations. In the most
preferred speciﬁcations, reported in Column (4) and (8) respectively, the estimated coeﬃcients
on the interaction term of “No. of Insured Sows” and “No. of Sow Deaths in Snow Storm” are
positive and signiﬁcant at 5% level. Thus indeed, Table 8 provides support for our hypothesis that
villages where gains in trust for the government sponsored sow insurance programs are greater do
experience a larger production response to the access to insurance. Also note that in speciﬁcations
(4) and (8), we found that the coeﬃcient on “No. of Sow Deaths in Snow Storm” is negative but
insigniﬁcant.


9      Conclusion
   In this paper, we report results from a large randomized natural ﬁeld experiment that evaluates
the eﬀect of microinsurance on subsequent production. The randomized incentive schemes we
oﬀered to Animal Husbandry Workers generate plausible exogenous variations in the eﬀective
insurance access across 480 villages in our experimental sample. This allows us to use the random
incentive scheme assignment as the instrumental variable for insurance access to recover the causal
  23
    However, when access to insurance that does not adjust premium for possible changes in perceived death risk,
the eﬀect on future sow production is ambiguous.

eﬀect of insurance access on production.
    Our results indicate that having access to formal insurance signiﬁcantly increases farmers’
tendency to raise sows. To the best of our knowledge this is the ﬁrst large-scale randomized
experimental evidence of the eﬀect of microinsurance on farmer production behavior. Our ﬁnding
also provides a useful test of whether the informal insurance farmers might have access to was
eﬃcient. Our ﬁnding suggests that microinsurance may be as important as microﬁnance in poverty
alleviation, and microinsurance can supplement and strengthen the eﬀects of microﬁnance by
protection the farmers from the inherent risk of entrepreneurial activities.
    We also provide a set of collaborating evidence to suggest that trust, or lack thereof, for
government-sponsored insurance products acts a signiﬁcant barrier for farmers’ willingness to
participate in the insurance program. This ﬁnding is consistent with those of Cole et al. (2008).
We believe that overcoming the issue of the lack of trust should be a crucial consideration in the
next wave of microinsurance revolution.
