                                              ABSTRACT

Parties often regulate their relationships through “continuing” contracts that are neither long-term
nor short-term but usually roll over. We study the trade-off between long-term, short-term, and continuing
contracts in a two period model where gains from trade exist in the first period, and may or may not
exist in the second period. A long-term contract that mandates trade in both periods is disadvantageous
since renegotiation is required if there are no gains from trade in the second period. A short-term contract
is disadvantageous since a new contract must be negotiated if gains from trade exist in the second
period. A continuing contract can be better. In a continuing contract there is no obligation to trade
in the second period but if there are gains from trade the parties will bargain “in good faith” using
the first period contract as a reference point. This can reduce the cost of negotiating the next contract.
Continuing contracts are not a panacea, however, since good faith bargaining may preclude the use
of outside options in the bargaining process and as a result parties will sometimes fail to trade when
this is efficient.

1. Introduction

A large literature in economics and law has studied why parties write long-term contracts. A leading
explanation is that such contracts are useful to support specific investments, and there is much
empirical support for this 1. In a way it has been more challenging for economists to explain why parties
write short-term contracts, that is, contracts that are shorter than the likely term of their relationship.
The conventional answer is that it is costly for the parties to anticipate the contingencies that will arise
during the latter part of their relationship and to write down unambiguously how to deal with them.
However, as Maskin and Tirole (1999) have shown, if parties are fully rational, ingenious mechanisms
can be used to get the parties to reveal information as their relationship progresses, and to incorporate
this information into an enforceable contract. If there is even a reasonable chance that the parties’
relationship will endure it is hard to see why, under classical assumptions, such mechanisms would not
be used. Thus the question remains: why do parties write short-term contracts?

The purpose of this paper is to investigate this question and in doing so also to study another question
that as far as we know has received little attention from economists or lawyers. Why do parties often
regulate their relationships through contracts that are neither explicitly long-term nor short-term, but
rather are of indefinite duration in the sense that most of the time they roll over? Leading examples are
rental contracts where the lease is typically renewed; month to month rental contracts with no lease;
employment contracts where each party can (under some conditions) terminate the relationship, but
where they usually do not – most of the time business continues “as usual”. We call such contracts
“continuing”, although other terms are surely possible 2.

Before proceeding we should make it clear that we do not view continuing contracts as necessarily
legally enforceable. A tenant is typically not obliged to renew the lease or even to attempt to do so, and
the landlord may have no such requirement either. Similarly, in many employment contracts, a worker
can quit or a firm can fire the worker. Also, in a continuing relationship, the existence of a prior contract
may put no legal constraints on how the parties negotiate the next contract 3. In this paper we will be
interested less in what is legally required than in how people actually behave. We will focus on the idea
that the parties are likely to apply notions of fairness, fair dealing and good faith when they renegotiate
continuing contracts even if they are not legally required to do so. Moreover, the prior contract is likely
to be a very important reference point for determining whether a renegotiation is seen as fair 4. For

(1987), Crocker and Masten (1988), Pirrong (1993), Brickley et al. (2006), and Bandiera (2007).

  We do not describe them as “indefinite-term contracts” since lawyers already use the term indefinite to describe
preliminary agreements that may not be enforceable. See Bebchuk and Ben-Shahar (2001) and Schwartz and Scott
(2007) for an analysis of such agreements.

  But in some cases the parties may have an obligation to bargain in good faith. See Schwartz and Scott (2007).

  Kahneman et al. (1986), a paper to which we return below, provides considerable support for the idea that past
transactions serve as a reference point for future ones. See also Okun (1981). Rotemberg (2011) analyzes the
optimal pricing policy for a firm that faces consumers who can be antagonized by prices that are higher than usual.
Bar-Gill and Ben-Shahar (2003) argue that fairness is an important consideration when contracts are renegotiated
and that previously agreed-upon terms will influence what is regarded as fair.

example, consider a new rent or wage. Whether this is regarded as reasonable or not will be judged in
light of the initial rent or wage: attention will be focused on the change. Of course, other factors can be
important, such as market conditions, but the prior terms that the parties agreed to will have particular
salience 5. We will be interested in analyzing the consequences of this for the choice of an optimal
contract. We will argue that using the prior contract as a reference point can have costs as well as
benefits. On the one hand it can mean that there is less to argue about if not much has changed in the
relationship. On the other hand, it may make it more difficult to take certain kinds of outside options
into account, which may cause inefficiency.

We will consider a situation where parties have a choice between a long-term, a short-term, and a
continuing contract. A short-term contract is one where the parties agree in advance that they will not
be bound by considerations of fairness or good faith if they negotiate a future contract. A continuing
contract is one where the parties agree that they will be bound by such considerations 6. Of course, in
practice the choice may not be as clear-cut as this. For example, one of the authors of this paper has
rented a vacation house for many years in a row. The relationship as it has developed is best thought of
as continuing even though no language was ever used to that effect. This is a situation where a short-
term contract was probably feasible only if one or both parties had no intention of renewing.
Nonetheless it is useful to consider the choice of all three contracts—long-term, short-term, continuing -
-since economists have traditionally focused on long-term and short-term contracts. We will return to
this issue of feasibility in the conclusions 7.

To analyze continuing contracts, we apply the contracts as reference points approach developed in Hart
and Moore (2008). According to this approach one role of a contract is to get parties “on the same
page”, so as to avoid future misunderstanding. Misunderstanding leads to aggrievement and shading (in
the form of departures from consummate performance), and consequent deadweight losses. Hart and
Moore (2008) show that, under these conditions, Maskin-Tirole-type mechanisms lose their force and



5
  Some support for the idea that prior transactions serve as a reference point can also be found in the law. The
Uniform Commercial Code, Article 2-305, deals with the case where parties have signed a contract but left the
price open. Subsection 2, dealing with the case where the price is to be fixed by one party, includes the
qualification that the price must be fixed in good faith. The commentary goes on to argue that ‘ in the normal case
a “posted price” or a future seller’s or buyer’s “given price,” “price in effect,” “market price,” or the like satisfies
the good faith requirement.’ (Italics added.) See Uniform Commercial Code 50 2014-2015.
6
  Parties do sometimes include language in contracts about future negotiation. For example, Goldberg and Erickson
(1987, footnote 29) describe a contract that was for three successive three-year terms. The contract stated that
the parties could not terminate solely because the price was unsatisfactory without first engaging in good faith
negotiation on the price.
7
  It is worth noting that Kahneman et al. (1986) find that past transactions do not form a reference point if the
previous transaction was explicitly temporary, supporting the distinction we make between short-term and
continuing contracts. Also Bewley (1999) finds that while wages in the primary sector (long-term employment) are
downward rigid, wages in the secondary sector (short-term positions) are flexible downward, again supporting our
distinction between short-term and continuing contracts.



                                                           3
simple contracts can be optimal 8. So far the contracts as reference points approach has been used to
study situations where the current contract is a reference point for contractual revision or
renegotiation. We adapt this approach to allow for the prior contract to be a reference point.

We consider a very simple model where a buyer and a seller can trade zero or one widgets in each of
two periods. Both parties are risk neutral, there are no non-contractible investments, and there are no
wealth constraints. It is known that trade is efficient in the first period. If trade is always efficient in the
second period a long-term contract mandating trade in both periods (specific performance) is optimal. If
trade is always inefficient in the second period a short-term contract specifying trade in the first period
is optimal. But suppose that there is uncertainty about whether there are gains from trade in the
second period. In this case neither a long-term contract nor a short-term contract achieves the first-
best. A long-term contract can be renegotiated if it is learned that trade is inefficient at the beginning of
the second period, but since the parties will argue about how to divide the gains from renegotiation this
is costly. (Throughout we will assume that argument is costly because it leads to aggrievement and
shading.) In the case of a short-term contract, if trade is efficient in the second period, the parties must
negotiate a new contract from scratch and this is costly because the parties will argue about how to
divide the gains from trade.

A continuing contract may be a good compromise. To emphasize, a continuing contract is one where
there is no obligation to trade in the second period but if there are gains from trade the parties will
bargain using the first period contract as a reference point. At the risk of an abuse of language we will
sometimes refer to this as bargaining in good faith 9. Using the first period contract as a reference point
can reduce negotiation costs since there is less to argue about. For example, suppose that in the first
period the buyer’s value of trade is 20, the seller’s cost is 10 and the price is 15. At the beginning of the
second period the parties learn that the buyer’s second period value has increased to 24 and the seller’s
second period cost is still 10; that is, surplus has increased by 4. Using the first period contract as a
reference point means that argument will be confined to how the additional surplus of 4 will be split.
This means that the new price will lie between 15 (the buyer gets all the incremental surplus) and 19
(the seller gets all the incremental surplus). In contrast if the parties bargain from scratch, as in a short-
term contract, the argument will be over how to divide the surplus of 14: the price can be anywhere
between 10 and 24.

Although the use of the prior contract as a reference point can reduce argument/bargaining costs and
increase efficiency, this may not always be the case 10. Consider the same situation as above, but
suppose now that the seller has an outside option equal to 11 in period 2. We will argue that good faith

related field evidence, see Iyer and Schoar (2013).

  Bargaining in good faith is not a well-defined concept in the law. It can sometimes mean as little as that the
parties are willing to meet each other. However, it sometimes appears to mean considerably more. See Summers
(1982) for a general discussion of good faith in contracts.
10
   Hart and Moore (2008, Section V) consider the case where other parties’ contemporaneous contracts, as
opposed to the buyer’s and seller’s own prior contract, are reference points for the current transaction. This can
also be beneficial or costly depending on the circumstances.

                                                         4
may preclude this outside option from being used in the bargaining process. If the seller argues that she
should be paid at least 21 in the second period this may be regarded as opportunistic or coercive since it
cannot be justified on the basis of changes in value and cost within the relationship: it is not in the
[15,19] range. Either the seller feels uncomfortable suggesting a price of 21 or the buyer is unwilling to
go along with it; or, if it were to happen, B’s aggrievement and shading would be so great that the seller
would be worse off accepting the new terms than if she simply quit and took her outside option. The
result may be that the relationship ends and the seller takes her outside option even though this is
inefficient.

We do not wish to argue that outside options can never be taken into account in the bargaining process.
Whether they can or cannot will depend on the circumstances. In an influential study, Kahneman et al.
(1986), using telephone surveys, posed hypothetical situations to people to elicit their standards of
fairness. They found that people think that it can be fair for a firm to raise prices when its costs go up or
to lower wages if it is losing money, but not fair for it to raise prices if its product becomes scarce or to
lower wages if other workers are willing to work for less 11. This is very supportive of our assumption
that using changes in value or cost within the relationship to justify a price change is consistent with
good faith bargaining whereas using outside options is not. At the same time Kahneman et al. suggest
that appealing to outside options may be more acceptable if these outside options represent general
market trends 12. As they put it (p.730), “Some people will consider it unfair for a firm not to raise its
wages when competitors are raising theirs. On the other hand, price increases that are not justified by
increasing costs are judged less objectionable when competitors have led the way.” We will therefore
also consider the case where outside options can be used in bargaining 13. By this we simply mean that
in the above example the buyer will be willing to pay 21 to keep the seller in the relationship if the
seller’s outside option is 11 14.



11
   This is consistent with the arguments of Okun (1981). Okun emphasizes the importance of fairness in
determining firms’ pricing decisions in what he calls “customer markets” (see Okun, p.154). He distinguishes
between price increases based on cost increases, which are generally accepted as fair, and those based on demand
increases, which are generally regarded as unfair (see Okun, p.170).
12
   On this point see also http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/02/07/273060341/episode-516-why-paying-192-
for-a-5-mile-car-ride-may-be-rational . This podcast discusses whether Uber’s strategy of surge pricing is fair, with
the conclusion being that while this might be the case if the increase in price is linked to general market conditions
it would not be so if the price increase depended on the characteristics of individual customers.
13
   This case is, of course, very familiar to academic economists: an employee gets an outside offer and asks his or
her employer to respond and the employer does. But whether such behavior occurs, or is acceptable, can vary
over time and with the industry or sector or country concerned. For example, in the case of academic economists
responding to outside options has been common in the U.S. for a long time, but was uncommon in the U.K. until
fairly recently. For a dynamic analysis of the path of wages in a world where employers match outside options, see
Harris and Holmstrom (1982).
14
  Note that, even if it is difficult or costly to use outside options in bargaining, alternative arrangements may be
possible that substitute for this. For example, Weitzman (1984) and Oyer (2004) argue that firms may index wages
to profit or share prices as a way to avoid inefficient quits or lay-offs. Our model assumes that verifiable variables
that can form the basis of an index do not exist, although we return to the possibility of indexation in the
conclusions.


                                                          5
However, one of the implications of our analysis that should be stressed is that, to the extent that
outside options cannot be used in bargaining, fairness or good faith has costs as well as benefits, and
that ex post inefficient allocations will sometimes occur in an optimal (continuing) contract 15.

We should note a distinction between continuing contracts and another type of contract that is
observed in practice: a renewable contract. A renewable contract is one that continues if both parties
agree. However, the terms under which the contract will be renewed are typically specified in advance:
they may be the same as the terms of the initial contract, or they may be the terms that one of the
parties is offering new contractors 16. In contrast, we are interested in cases where the terms of the new
contract are left open and can be adjusted according to new events (a worker’s wage may stay the same
most of the time but every so often he or she will get a raise; rents will typically change at the end of a
lease, etc.). We will show that under some conditions a continuing contract is superior to a renewable
contract.

There is a large theoretical literature on the determinants of contract length, and we can mention only a
few contributions. Some papers assume a fixed cost of writing a (possibly contingent) contract and
derive contract length as a function of the volatility of the environment; see, e.g., Gray (1978) and Dye
(1985). Harris and Holmstrom (1987) consider actual duration in a model where new information
arrives but as they recognize there is no reason why the initial contract should not have infinite
duration. Diamond (1991) argues that short-term contracts might be used by some borrowers to signal
that they are of high quality and are willing to expose themselves to the hazards of renegotiation; he
does not consider continuing contracts. MacLeod and Malcomson (1993), Che and Hausch (1999), and
Segal (1999) identify situations where “no contract” achieves as good an outcome as a sophisticated
(incomplete) contract, which can be interpreted as saying that long-term contracts are sometimes not
needed; however, they also do not explain why continuing contracts are used.

Finally, Guriev and Kvasov (2005) consider a situation where a seller makes a relationship specific
investment and a buyer and seller can trade continuously over time. The buyer has an outside
opportunity whose arrival time is stochastic; if it arrives it is efficient for the relationship to terminate.
They show that it is optimal for parties to write what they call an evergreen contract – an indefinite
contract which can be terminated by the buyer (at some cost) with notice. However, they do not
consider what we have called continuing contracts where future terms are left open.

The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present the model and analyze the trade-off between
long-term, short-term, and continuing contracts for the case of no outside options. In Section 3 we
bring in outside options and consider both the case where they can be used in bargaining and the case



15
   Herweg and Schmidt (2015) have also shown that inefficient allocations can arise when contracts are reference
points if parties are loss-averse. They are concerned with a one period model where renegotiation takes place and
do not study how a contract can be a reference point for transactions in future periods.
16
   See Lafontaine and Shaw (1999). They note that when franchisees’ contracts are renewed this is usually done at
the “then-current” contract terms. Masten (2009) provides evidence on the value of long-term, renewable
contracts for the case of heterogeneous freight transactions.

                                                        6
where they cannot. In Section 4 we extend the analysis to other sorts of contracts, in particular,
renewable and exclusive contracts. Finally, Section 5 concludes.



2. The Model

We consider a buyer B and a seller S engaged in a two period, three date relationship. See Figure 1 for a
time-line. In each period they can trade zero or one widgets.

At date 0, B and S sign an initial contract that may be long-term, short-term, or continuing. This contract
is negotiated under competitive conditions at date 0 in the sense that there are many alternative sellers
for B and so each seller receives her outside option for the two periods, which we denote by 𝑢𝑢�. (One
can imagine that B auctions off the initial contract to the potential sellers.) If the contract is long-term,
it may be renegotiated at date 1. If the contract is short-term or continuing, a new contract between B
and S may be negotiated at date 1 for the second period.




B’s value 𝑣𝑣1 and S’s cost 𝑐𝑐1 for the widget in period 1 are already known when the initial contract is
written. We assume 𝑣𝑣1 > 𝑐𝑐1 . At date 1, before the initial contract is renegotiated or a new contract is
signed, B’s value 𝑣𝑣2 , S’s cost 𝑐𝑐2 , B’s outside option 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , and S’s outside option 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 for period 2 are
observed by both parties – there is symmetric information throughout (but 𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 , 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 and 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 are not
verifiable) 17. Trade in period 2 is efficient if and only if 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . At date 0, however, 𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 , 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵
and 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 are uncertain – they are drawn from a probability distribution 𝐹𝐹 (which is common knowledge).
Both parties are risk neutral, there are no wealth constraints, and without loss of generality we suppose
no discounting. We assume that 𝑢𝑢� is in a range where the buyer wants to offer the seller a contract 18.


17
   If 𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 , 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 and 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 were verifiable contingent contracts could be written and the problems that we study in this
paper would not arise. We discuss the observability-verifiability distinction further below.
18
   We do not model the market for buyers and sellers at date 1. This would require a general equilibrium analysis
in which there are several buyers and sellers at both dates 0 and 1 and the availability of alternative partners at
date 1 depends on contracts signed at date 0. The outside options 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 and 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 are a crude and short-cut way of
representing market alternatives at date 1. We also do not model why the market is more competitive at date 0
than at date 1. In the background there may be some relationship-specific investments or other types of lock-in.
Note, however, that the existence and extent of lock-in is captured implicitly. If 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 with high

                                                              7
For simplicity we assume that B has all the bargaining power in any negotiation or renegotiation at date
1.

Although bargaining at date 1 occurs under symmetric information it is not costless. We suppose that
the parties have different feelings of entitlement concerning their payoff from bargaining and since at
least one of them will be disappointed this leads to aggrievement and shading and consequently
deadweight losses. We will explain the details of this below.

It is convenient to focus in this section on the case where there are no outside options at date 1 –
𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 ≡ 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ≡ 0. We introduce outside options in Section 3.



Long-term contract

Suppose first that the parties write a long-term contract at date 0, specifying trade in both periods (a
specific performance contract). Without loss of generality we can assume the same price in each period,
which we denote 𝑝𝑝. At date 1 the parties will learn 𝑣𝑣2 and 𝑐𝑐2 . Obviously, if 𝑣𝑣2 > 𝑐𝑐2 there are no gains
from renegotiation. However, if 𝑣𝑣2 < 𝑐𝑐2 , B and S will want to renegotiate 19.

Recall that we assume that B has all the bargaining power. Thus B will offer S an amount (𝑝𝑝 − 𝑐𝑐2 ) – her
second period payoff under the existing contract – in return for not trading. However, following Hart
and Moore (2008), we suppose that S feels entitled to more of the surplus from renegotiation – in fact
she feels entitled to 100% of the surplus. (B also feels entitled to 100% of the surplus.) 20 In other words,
S feels entitled to a payoff 𝑝𝑝 − 𝑣𝑣2 (which would make B’s payoff 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑝𝑝, as under the specific
performance contract). The difference between what S feels entitled to and what she receives, 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑣𝑣2 ,
represents S’s aggrievement, A. As in Hart and Moore (2008), we suppose that S takes out her
aggrievement on B by shading and this reduces B’s payoff by 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃 = 𝜃𝜃(𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑣𝑣2 ), where 0 < 𝜃𝜃 < 1 is an
exogeneous parameter. Shading does not affect S’s payoff.

The bottom line is that, if 𝑣𝑣2 < 𝑐𝑐2 , after renegotiation B’s second period payoff = 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑝𝑝 − 𝜃𝜃(𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑣𝑣2 )
and S’s second period payoff = 𝑝𝑝 − 𝑐𝑐2 . The deadweight losses from renegotiation = 𝜃𝜃(𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑣𝑣2 )21.


probability, then this suggests significant lock-in. On the other hand, if 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ≤ 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 with high probability, this
suggests insignificant lock-in.
19
   For simplicity we assume that the contract always has to be renegotiated to achieve no trade. This might not be
the case, however, if 𝑣𝑣2 < 𝑝𝑝 < 𝑐𝑐2 since both parties want to walk away from the contract. Allowing for
renegotiation only if 𝑣𝑣2 > 𝑝𝑝 or 𝑐𝑐2 < 𝑝𝑝 would complicate matters without significantly changing our results.
20
   Our results would not change significantly if each party felt entitled to a fraction 𝛼𝛼 of the surplus, where
1
   < 𝛼𝛼 ≤ 1.
2
21
   One way S could shade is by being difficult, disagreeable or unresponsive during the renegotiation process (e.g.,
S could drag things out by not answering B’s phone calls or emails promptly). Of course, such behavior could also
affect S’s payoff, something we do not allow for here. Obviously, there are other reasons why renegotiation may
lead to deadweight losses. We appeal to aggrievement and shading because we will use these ideas in what
follows.

                                                              8
With these preliminaries out of the way, we can now turn to an optimal long-term contract. An optimal
long-term contract maximizes B’s expected payoff subject to S receiving at least 𝑢𝑢�. That is, it solves:

(2.1)   𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑝𝑝) + ∫𝑣𝑣           (𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑝𝑝)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣         [𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑝𝑝 − 𝜃𝜃(𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑣𝑣2 )]𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

S.T.

(2.2)   (𝑝𝑝 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫(𝑝𝑝 − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ≥ 𝑢𝑢.

Obviously (2.2) holds with equality since (2.1) is decreasing in 𝑝𝑝. Letting 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵 , 𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆 be B’s and S’s overall
payoffs, respectively, and substituting (2.2) into (2.1) yields

(2.3)   𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 = (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣        (𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣         𝜃𝜃(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝑢𝑢,

        𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 = 𝑢𝑢.

In other words, B’s payoff equals social surplus net of shading costs minus 𝑢𝑢.
                                                                            �

We should emphasize that we have considered only a very particular kind of long-term contract. More
general long-term contracts would allow one or both parties to breach by paying (possibly zero)
damages. We will return to this issue later, but simply note at this point that our results do not change
significantly if more general contracts are allowed.



Short-term contract

We consider next the case where B and S sign a contract that specifies trade only for period 1 with no
commitment, promise, or understanding that the parties will be bound by considerations of fairness or
good faith if they negotiate a future contract.

Obviously, if 𝑣𝑣2 ≤ 𝑐𝑐2 , no trade will occur in period 2. If 𝑣𝑣2 > 𝑐𝑐2 , the parties will renegotiate from
scratch since no promises have been made: the reference point is no trade. The implication of this is
that B offers S a payoff equal to zero, but S feels entitled to 100% of the gains from trade, 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 . Thus
S’s aggrievement is 𝐴𝐴 = 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 , shading = 𝜃𝜃(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ), and B’s net payoff = (1 − 𝜃𝜃)(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ) while
S’s payoff is zero.

Let 𝑝𝑝1 be the first period price. An optimal short-term contract solves:

(2.4)   𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑝𝑝1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣          (1 − 𝜃𝜃)(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                  2 >𝑐𝑐2


S.T.

(2.5)   (𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) ≥ 𝑢𝑢.




                                                                       9
Again (2.5) holds with equality since B can always gain from reducing 𝑝𝑝1 . Hence

(2.6)    𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣        (1 − 𝜃𝜃)(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝑢𝑢,
                                     2 >𝑐𝑐2


         𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 𝑢𝑢.

As above, B’s payoff equals social surplus net of shading costs minus 𝑢𝑢.
                                                                      �



Continuing contract

We now turn to what we call a continuing contract. A continuing contract is a contract that specifies
trade in the first period, does not commit the parties to trade in the second period, but includes some
commitment, promise, or understanding that the parties will be bound by considerations of fairness or
good faith if they do negotiate a future contract.

We formalize the idea of fairness or good faith as follows. At date 1, if 𝑣𝑣2 ≤ 𝑐𝑐2 , the parties walk away
and surplus is zero 22. However, if 𝑣𝑣2 > 𝑐𝑐2 , they bargain using the period 1 contract as a reference point.
If conditions have not changed much, that is, 𝑣𝑣2 ≈ 𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐2 ≈ 𝑐𝑐1 , then good faith means that the price
should not change much. (There is an exception to this, noted below, if 𝑝𝑝1 < 𝑐𝑐1 or 𝑝𝑝1 > 𝑣𝑣1 .) On the
other hand, if 𝑣𝑣2 or 𝑐𝑐2 do change relative to 𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐1 , then good faith means that the price can change but
only commensurate with the changes in 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐.

To be precise, suppose 𝑣𝑣2 > 𝑐𝑐2 , and let ∆𝐺𝐺 = (𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ) − (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ). We distinguish between the cases
∆𝐺𝐺 ≥ 0 and ∆𝐺𝐺 < 0. Previously we assumed that each party feels entitled to 100% of any change in
surplus. However, that was for the case where the change was always positive. We now assume that B
and S’s self-serving biases are such that each party feels entitled to any increase in surplus but feels that
the other should suffer any decrease in surplus. However, both regard the initial contract as a reference
point.

Before continuing, we should note that our assumption that the parties focus on changes in surplus
rather than changes in 𝑣𝑣, 𝑐𝑐 independently is only one of several possibilities. It would also be plausible to
assume that B attributes increases in 𝑣𝑣 (resp., 𝑐𝑐) to B’s (resp.,S’s) actions or talent and decreases in 𝑣𝑣
(resp., 𝑐𝑐) to luck; and vice versa for S. This would change some details but not the thrust of the analysis.
The important thing is that it is changes in 𝑣𝑣, 𝑐𝑐 not absolute values that matter in a continuing contract.

It is also worth discussing a little further what we have in mind when we assume that changes in 𝑣𝑣, 𝑐𝑐
can be observed by both parties but are not verifiable and so cannot be part of an indexed contract.
Imagine that 𝑐𝑐 rises. S knows this and can perhaps produce an argument or evidence to B that will

22
  We are ruling out the possibility that one or other party might feel aggrieved and shade in the event that trade
does not occur given that it could have; for example, if S’s cost is low she might be angry with B that his value is
even lower. Note that it might be difficult for S to shade against B under these conditions since B walks away and
no trade takes place. A similar assumption is made in Hart and Moore (2008): shading cannot occur if one party
walks away.

                                                                  10
persuade him that this is indeed the case. However, if the parties wrote an ex ante contract that said
that price will rise if S produces evidence that c has risen, then this could lead to abuse: S could produce
something that looks like evidence but isn’t really. In other words, the observability but nonverifiability
of evidence can justify the assumption that changes in 𝑣𝑣, 𝑐𝑐 are observable but not verifiable.

Let us return to the case where each party feels entitled to increases but not decreases in surplus. Then
B regards 𝑝𝑝 as a reasonable price where

(2.7)     𝑝𝑝 − 𝑐𝑐2 = 𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑐𝑐1 + 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(∆𝐺𝐺, 0).

That is, B believes that S’s period 2 payoff should equal her period 1 payoff if ∆𝐺𝐺 ≥ 0 and fall by −∆𝐺𝐺 if
∆𝐺𝐺 < 0. However, B recognizes that he cannot offer a price below 𝑐𝑐2 (𝑝𝑝 < 𝑐𝑐2 if 𝑝𝑝1 < 𝑐𝑐1 and ∆𝐺𝐺 > 0)
and, of course, B would never offer a price in excess of 𝑣𝑣2 (𝑝𝑝 > 𝑣𝑣2 if 𝑝𝑝1 > 𝑣𝑣1 and ∆𝐺𝐺 < 0). Thus B will
adjust 𝑝𝑝 so that it lies in the [𝑐𝑐2 , 𝑣𝑣2 ] range and offers S


(2.8)     𝑝𝑝̂ = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 �𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 �𝑝𝑝, 𝑐𝑐2 ��.

By a parallel argument, S regards 𝑝𝑝 as a reasonable price where

(2.9)     𝑝𝑝 − 𝑐𝑐2 = 𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑐𝑐1 + 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(∆𝐺𝐺, 0).

That is, S thinks that her payoff should rise by ∆𝐺𝐺 if ∆𝐺𝐺 ≥ 0 and stay the same if ∆𝐺𝐺 < 0. However, S
recognizes that price must lie between 𝑐𝑐2 and 𝑣𝑣2 and so feels entitled to

(2.10) 𝑝𝑝� = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀�𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑝𝑝, 𝑐𝑐2 )�.

It follows that S’s aggrievement is given by 𝐴𝐴 = 𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ and she shades by 𝜃𝜃𝜃𝜃. Hence B’s and S’s period 2
payoffs are given by

(2.11) 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵2 = 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝜃𝜃(𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ ),

(2.12) 𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆2 = 𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝑐𝑐2 ,

respectively.

Given the above, an optimal continuing contract solves:

(2.13) 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑝𝑝1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣                 �𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝜃𝜃(𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ )�𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                        2 >𝑐𝑐2


S.T.

(2.14) (𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣             (𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ≥ 𝑢𝑢.
                             2 >𝑐𝑐2




                                                                          11
It is easy to see that (2.14) holds with equality: if not, reducing 𝑝𝑝1 a little reduces 𝑝𝑝̂ and 𝑝𝑝� and hence
raises 𝑣𝑣2 − (1 − 𝜃𝜃)𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝜃𝜃𝑝𝑝�, which increases (2.13) 23. Substituting (2.14) into (2.13) we can write the
parties’ payoffs as

(2.15) 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶 = (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣                 [𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝜃𝜃(𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ )]𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝑢𝑢,
                                          2 >𝑐𝑐2


         𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶 = 𝑢𝑢.

Note that 𝑝𝑝1 affects (𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ ) and so is still present in (2.15). Thus in contrast to a short-term or long-
term contract it is not the case that 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶 changes one to one with 𝑢𝑢.

At this point an example may help. Suppose that 𝑣𝑣1 = 20, 𝑐𝑐1 = 10 and 𝑝𝑝1 = 15. Assume that at date 1
it is learned that 𝑣𝑣2 = 24, 𝑐𝑐2 = 10 (surplus goes up by 4). Then with a continuing contract B will regard
15 as the appropriate price (this gives all the additional surplus to B), while S will regard 19 as the
appropriate price (this gives all the additional surplus to S). B will offer 15 but S will be aggrieved by 4
and will shade by 4𝜃𝜃.

Suppose instead that it is learned that 𝑣𝑣2 = 24, 𝑐𝑐2 = 20 (surplus goes down by 6). Now B regards 19 as
the right price since this makes S bear the full decrease in surplus. However, S will not trade at 19 and
so B adjusts his notion of entitlement so that 20 becomes a reasonable price. S regards 25 as a
reasonable price by a similar argument, but since B will not trade at this price she adjusts her
entitlement to 24. Thus B will offer 20 but S will be aggrieved by 4 and will shade by 4𝜃𝜃.

We now turn to a comparison of long-term, short-term, and continuing contracts. In the case of no
outside options it is easy to show that a continuing contract is always at least as good for B as a short-
term contract (S is indifferent since she always gets 𝑢𝑢).

Proposition 1. With no outside options, 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶 ≥ 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 .

Proof: Consider an optimal continuing contract. We know from (2.15) that

(2.16) 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶 = (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣                 [𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝜃𝜃(𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ )]𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝑢𝑢
                                          2 >𝑐𝑐2



≥ (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣             (1 − 𝜃𝜃)(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝑢𝑢 = 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 ,
                        2 >𝑐𝑐2


where the inequality follows from the fact that 𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ ≤ 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 . Q.E.D.

In other words, in this very simple setting, good faith is always a plus: it reduces aggrievement and
shading since, with the first period contract as a reference point, there is less to argue about in period 2.



23
  Note that 𝑝𝑝1 plays two roles. It acts as a reference point for the period 2 price and it also serves to distribute
surplus. We are ruling out the possibility that a lump sum transfer can be used to distribute surplus independently
of the first period price. Our assumption is that, if this were attempted, the parties would “see through it” and use
the average of the two as a reference point.

                                                                          12
(In the above example there was strictly less to argue about in the first case when surplus went up and
the same amount to argue about in the second case when surplus went down.)

In order to compare a continuing contract with a long-term contract, it is useful to proceed as follows.
Write the distribution function of (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 ) conditional on 𝑣𝑣2 > 𝑐𝑐2 as 𝐹𝐹1 and the distribution function of
(𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 ) conditional on v2 ≤ c2 as 𝐹𝐹2 . That is,

(2.17)                    𝐹𝐹 = 𝜋𝜋𝐹𝐹1 + (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝐹𝐹2 ,

where 𝜋𝜋 = 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝(𝑣𝑣2 > 𝑐𝑐2 ). In Proposition 2(i) we keep 𝐹𝐹1 and 𝐹𝐹2 fixed and vary 𝜋𝜋. In Proposition 2(ii)
we keep 𝜋𝜋 and 𝐹𝐹2 fixed and vary 𝐹𝐹1 .



Proposition 2

    (i)      Fix 𝐹𝐹1 and 𝐹𝐹2 . For 𝜋𝜋 close to 0 a continuing contract is superior to a long-term contract,
             whereas for 𝜋𝜋 close to 1 a long-term contract is superior to a continuing contract.
    (ii)     Fix 0 < 𝜋𝜋 < 1 and 𝐹𝐹2 . Suppose 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(|𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 )| ≤ 𝜀𝜀|𝑣𝑣2 > 𝑐𝑐2 ) = 1 for some
             𝜀𝜀 > 0. Then if 𝜀𝜀 is small enough a continuing contract is superior to a long-term contract.

Proof

Result (i) is obvious. If 𝜋𝜋 equals zero a long-term contract is always renegotiated and hence exhibits
shading, while a continuing contract yields the efficient outcome – no trade – with no shading. By
continuity the ranking of the contracts stays the same for 𝜋𝜋 close to zero. The opposite argument
applies for 𝜋𝜋 = 1.

To prove (ii), note that a continuing contract achieves the first-best if 𝜀𝜀 = 0. The reason is that either
𝑣𝑣2 < 𝑐𝑐2 and the parties walk away or 𝑣𝑣2 > 𝑐𝑐2 and there is nothing to argue about in period 2: B and S
agree that the division of surplus should stay the same (or if 𝑝𝑝1 > 𝑣𝑣1 that price should equal 𝑣𝑣2 ). Also 𝑝𝑝1
can be adjusted so that S receives 𝑢𝑢 and B obtains all the surplus.

In contrast a long-term contract does not achieve the first-best since renegotiation and shading occur if
𝑣𝑣2 < 𝑐𝑐2 .

Again by continuity the ranking of the contracts is preserved for 𝜀𝜀 close to zero.     Q.E.D.

Proposition 2(i) says that a continuing contract is superior to a long-term contract if trade is unlikely to
be efficient in the second period; while a long-term contract is superior to a continuing contract if trade
is likely to be efficient in the second period. This is, of course, rather obvious. Proposition 2(ii) is a bit
more subtle. It says that a continuing contract will be optimal if conditional on trade being efficient in
the second period surplus does not change very much relative to the first period. To put it in everyday
language a continuing contract works well if it is known in advance that either business will remain as
usual or a big change will occur that will make it efficient for the relationship to break up.

3. Outside options

In this section we allow for the possibility that 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ≠ 0. This does not change the analysis of long-term
and short-term contracts significantly. It also does not greatly change the analysis of continuing
contracts to the extent that appealing to outside options in the bargaining process is consistent with
good faith, e.g., because they correspond to market trends — see the discussion in the introduction.
(We refer to this as case M.) However, good faith may prevent parties from incorporating outside
options into the bargaining process if the outside options are idiosyncratic and do not represent market
trends: doing so may be seen as opportunistic. (We refer to this as case I.) In this case the analysis does
change significantly 24.

Let us deal first with the easy cases of long-term and short-term contracts. It is now efficient for trade to
occur in the second period if and only if 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . With a long-term contract renegotiation will
therefore occur if 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 < 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . In this case B will offer S 𝑝𝑝 − 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 not to trade, but S will feel
entitled to 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 − 𝑣𝑣2 + 𝑝𝑝. Shading = θ(𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 − 𝑣𝑣2 + 𝑐𝑐2 ). Thus, analogously to (2.1) – (2.2), a long-term
contract solves:

(3.1)        𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑝𝑝) + ∫𝑣𝑣                         (𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑝𝑝)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣                               [𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 − 𝑝𝑝 + 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝜃𝜃(𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 −
                                        2 −𝑐𝑐2 >𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆                                 2 −𝑐𝑐2 ≤𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆
                                                                                                                        𝑣𝑣 2 + 𝑐𝑐2 )]𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

S.T.

(3.2)        (𝑝𝑝 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫(𝑝𝑝 − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ≥ 𝑢𝑢.

As before, (3.2) holds with equality and

(3.3)


     𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 = (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) +            �             (𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 +                  �             [𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 − 𝜃𝜃(𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 − 𝑣𝑣2 + 𝑐𝑐2 )]𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝑢𝑢,
                                 𝑣𝑣2 −𝑐𝑐2 >𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆                              𝑣𝑣2 −𝑐𝑐2 ≤𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆


     𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 = 𝑢𝑢.



By analogy to (2.4) - (2.5), a short-term contract will solve:

(3.4)        𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑝𝑝1 ) + ∫ 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣                              (1 − 𝜃𝜃)(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 − 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                                             2 −𝑐𝑐2 >𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆


S.T.



24
  Of course, any real situation will include elements of both cases: with some probability the outside options will
represent market trends and can be included in bargaining and with some probability they will not represent
market trends and cannot be included. To simplify we consider the two cases separately.

                                                                                     14
(3.5)       (𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫ 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ≥ 𝑢𝑢.

(3.5) holds with equality and so

(3.6)       𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫(𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣                                (1 − 𝜃𝜃)(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 − 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝑢𝑢,
                                                                          2 −𝑐𝑐2 >𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆


            𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 𝑢𝑢.



Consider next a continuing contract. Start with case M where outside options can be used in the
bargaining. Suppose 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . Then the analysis is similar to that of Section 2. B thinks that 𝑝𝑝
is a reasonable price but recognizes that price must lie in the [𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 ] range and so offers S

(3.7)             𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑀𝑀 = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 �𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 �𝑝𝑝, 𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ��.

S thinks that 𝑝𝑝 is a reasonable price but recognizes that price must lie in the [𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 ] range and
so adjusts her entitlement to

(3.8)         𝑝𝑝�𝑀𝑀 = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀�𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑝𝑝, 𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 )� .



In other words in case M each party is willing to adjust the price to match the other party’s outside
option if there are gains from trade. Note that (3.7) and (3.8) are not simply (2.8) and (2.10) with 𝑣𝑣2,
𝑐𝑐2 replaced by 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . The reason is that the formulae for 𝑝𝑝 , 𝑝𝑝 depend on 𝑣𝑣2, 𝑐𝑐2 not 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 ,
𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . 25

An optimal continuing contract solves:

(3.9) 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑝𝑝1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣                               �𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑀𝑀 − 𝜃𝜃(𝑝𝑝�𝑀𝑀 − 𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑀𝑀 )�𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣                           𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                         2 −𝑐𝑐2 >𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆                                                       2 −𝑐𝑐2 ≤𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆


S.T.

(3.10) (𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣                              (𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑀𝑀 − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣                       𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ≥ 𝑢𝑢.
                                  2 −𝑐𝑐2 >𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆                              2 −𝑐𝑐2 ≤𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆




As before, (3.10) holds with equality and so we obtain


25
   For example, suppose 𝑣𝑣1 = 20, 𝑐𝑐1 = 10 and 𝑝𝑝1 = 15. At date 1 it is learned that 𝑣𝑣2 = 24, 𝑐𝑐2 = 10, 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 =
0, 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 11. Then 𝑝𝑝̂ 𝑀𝑀 = 𝑝𝑝� 𝑀𝑀 = 21 and there is nothing to argue about. In contrast, if we replace 𝑐𝑐2 by 𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 =11
and set 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 0 then according to the logic of Section 2 𝑝𝑝̂ =24, 𝑝𝑝� = 21 and there is something to argue about.



                                                                                  15

                  𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = 𝑢𝑢.

Proposition 1 generalizes to this case. A continuing contract that can fully adapt to market trends is
always superior to a short-term contract: there is less to argue about given that the period 1 contract
forms a reference point.

Proposition 3 (Case M). 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 ≥ 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 .

We turn now to the case where outside options cannot be used in bargaining (case I). It is helpful to
start with an example. Suppose 𝑣𝑣1 = 20, 𝑐𝑐1 = 10 and 𝑝𝑝1 = 15. At date 1 it is learned that 𝑣𝑣2 =
24, 𝑐𝑐2 = 10, 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 = 0, 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 6. In Section 2 we considered this case without outside options and argued
that B would offer S 15. B would reason that surplus has risen relative to period 1 and he is entitled to
the increase, thus S’s payoff should remain at 5. Of course, given that S now has an outside option of 6
trade will fail to occur at a price of 15. Can B be more flexible? We argue that he can. In particular, B
can accept that some or all of the surplus increase belongs to S if this is necessary to ensure trade. As a
result B is willing to offer S up to 19. However, B is not willing to go further: he is not willing to accept a
payoff reduction given that surplus has risen. (This is the difference between cases M and I.)

Of course, with B’s increased flexibility, trade can occur when 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 6 since B will offer S 16. But, since B
is not willing to go above 19, if 9 < 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 < 14 trade will not occur even though this is inefficient. Thus in
case I good faith sometimes leads to inefficient outcomes.

Let us now move to the general analysis. As we have seen B feels that 𝑝𝑝̂ = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 �𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 �𝑝𝑝, 𝑐𝑐2 �� is a
reasonable price. However, B is willing to ascribe all increases in surplus and no decreases in surplus to
S if this is necessary to ensure trade, which yields 𝑝𝑝� = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀�𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑝𝑝, 𝑐𝑐2 )� as a reasonable price. (Of
course, this is the price S thinks is reasonable although analogously to B she is flexible enough to accept
𝑝𝑝̂ if this is necessary to ensure trade.) Thus the range of acceptable prices is [𝑝𝑝̂ , 𝑝𝑝�]. If this range
intersects with the range [𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 ], trade is possible; otherwise it is not. (If 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 < 𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆
the intersection is of course empty.) In our example [𝑝𝑝̂ , 𝑝𝑝�] = [15,19],                      [𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 ] =
 [10 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , 24] and so the intersection is nonempty as long as 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ≤ 9.

If [𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 ] ∩ [𝑝𝑝̂ , 𝑝𝑝�] ≠ ∅, let 𝑝𝑝′ be the smallest price in the intersection and 𝑝𝑝′′ the largest price.
B will offer 𝑝𝑝′, S will be aggrieved by (𝑝𝑝′′ − 𝑝𝑝′) and shading = 𝜃𝜃(𝑝𝑝′′ − 𝑝𝑝′).

Thus a continuing contract solves:

An important difference from the M case is that (3.13) may not be binding at the optimum. The reason
is that (3.12) may not be monotonic in 𝑝𝑝1 given that a lower 𝑝𝑝1 may lead to inefficient outcomes. In
other words an “efficiency” wage (or price) may be optimal. Also it is no longer true that a continuing
contract is always superior to a short-term contract. Example 3.1 illustrates both of these possibilities.

Example 3.1

There is no uncertainty, 𝑣𝑣1 = 20, 𝑐𝑐1 = 10, 𝑣𝑣2 = 20, 𝑐𝑐2 = 10, 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 1, 𝑢𝑢 = 1.

Consider a continuing contract (case I). Suppose 10 ≤ 𝑝𝑝1 ≤ 20. Since 𝑣𝑣2 = 𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐2 = 𝑐𝑐1 , 𝑝𝑝 = 𝑝𝑝 = 𝑝𝑝1
and so 𝑝𝑝̂ = 𝑝𝑝� = 𝑝𝑝1 . That is, 𝑝𝑝2 = 𝑝𝑝1 : no change in price is possible. Hence, given S’s outside option in
period 2, trade will occur in period 2 only if 𝑝𝑝2 = 𝑝𝑝1 ≥ 11. Given 𝑝𝑝1 ≥ 11, it is optimal for B to set
𝑝𝑝1 = 11: this ensures trade in both periods and yields 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵 = 18, 𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆 = 2. Alternatively, if 𝑝𝑝1 < 11, since
no trade occurs in period 2, it is best for B to set 𝑝𝑝1 = 10. This yields 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵 = 10, 𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆 = 1. (It is easy to
show that 𝑝𝑝1 < 10 or 𝑝𝑝1 > 20 is not optimal.)

Obviously the first contract is superior, and this gives S more than her reservation utility 𝑢𝑢. As promised
(3.13) is not binding.

Now let’s compare the optimal continuing contract with a short-term contract. Under a short-term
contract

                                                      𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑐𝑐1 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 𝑢𝑢

and so 𝑝𝑝1 = 10. Hence

                                              𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 10 + (1 − 𝜃𝜃)9 = 19 − 9𝜃𝜃

                                                                                    > 18 = 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶



       1
if 𝜃𝜃 < .
       9

                         1
In other words, if 𝜃𝜃 < , a short-term contract is superior to a continuing contract: the reason is that the
                         9
shading cost is less than the benefit of keeping S at her reservation utility.

Of course, in this example, with no uncertainty, a long-term contract achieves the first-best since trade
is always efficient. The next example shows that a short-term contract can be uniquely optimal for the
idiosyncratic case.



                                                                    17
Example 3.2 (Case I)

𝑣𝑣1 = 20, 𝑐𝑐1 = 10. There are three states of the world in period 2. In s1 (prob 𝜌𝜌/2) 𝑣𝑣2 = 20, 𝑐𝑐2 =
10, 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 3; in s2 (prob 𝜌𝜌/2) 𝑣𝑣2 = 20, 𝑐𝑐2 = 10, 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 13; and in s3 (prob 1 − 𝜌𝜌) 𝑣𝑣2 = 10, 𝑐𝑐2 = 20,
𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 0. 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 = 0 in all states.

Trade is efficient only in s1 in period 2.

Continuing contract

Under a continuing contract, trade never occurs in s2 or s3: the parties walk away. If 𝑝𝑝1 < 13, trade
does not occur in s1 either since 𝑣𝑣 and 𝑐𝑐 have not changed and outside options cannot be used in
bargaining: 𝑝𝑝2 = 𝑝𝑝1 and S will quit. Hence

                                               𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = 𝑝𝑝1 − 10 + 8𝜌𝜌,

If 13 ≤ 𝑝𝑝1 ≤ 20, trade occurs in s1. Hence

                                                                    𝜌𝜌 13𝜌𝜌

The relationship between 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 and 𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 is illustrated in Figure 2. Note that the discontinuity arises from
                                                         7𝜌𝜌

and a higher expected payoff for B.




From Figure 2 it follows that an optimal continuing contract satisfies:
                                                                                                               9𝜌𝜌

                      𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 = 10 +    2

                                                                                                                        2

For low values of 𝑢𝑢� pushing S down to her reservation utility implies such a low 𝑝𝑝1 that there will be an
inefficient quit in s1. For intermediate values of 𝑢𝑢� B is better off raising 𝑝𝑝1 to 13 so that trade will take
place in s1; this results in S getting more than her reservation utility. Finally, to satisfy S’s participation
constraint for high values of 𝑢𝑢� 𝑝𝑝1 must be high enough so that trade will take place in s1. In this region a
continuing contract achieves the first-best.

Long-term contract

A long-term contract requires renegotiation in s2 and s3. It is easily seen that

                                                                  23𝜌𝜌 17𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌

                                                  𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿 = 𝑢𝑢�.

Short-term contract

A short-term contract requires renegotiation in s1. It is easily seen that

                                                         23𝜌𝜌 7𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌
                                       𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 10 +       −      − 𝑢𝑢,
                                                                      �
                                                          2    2

                                                    𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 = 𝑢𝑢�



It follows from the above that the (unique) optimal contract is:
                                                                           7

    (ii)    Long-term if and only if 𝜌𝜌 > 5/6 and 𝑢𝑢� < 3 + 8𝜌𝜌 − �10 −                  𝜌𝜌� 𝜃𝜃

                                                                     17                      7                     23
    (iii)   Continuing if and only if 𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚 �3 + 8𝜌𝜌 − �10 −           𝜌𝜌� 𝜃𝜃, 3 +   8𝜌𝜌 − 𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌�   ≤ 𝑢𝑢� ≤ 10 +      𝜌𝜌
                                                                     2                       2                     2

We know that for low values of 𝑢𝑢� a continuing contract results in an inefficient quit. This is more costly
for B than shading under either a short-term or a long-term contract. For high values of 𝑢𝑢� a continuing
contract achieves the first-best. For intermediate values of 𝑢𝑢� there is a tradeoff. S receives more than
her reservation utility under a continuing contract while a short-term or a long-term contract results in
shading. Therefore, for the lower values of 𝑢𝑢� (in the intermediate range) the benefit of getting S down
to her reservation utility outweighs the expected shading costs of a short-term or a long-term contract.



Based on Example 3.2, we can state the following proposition.

Proposition 4

In case I, the optimal contract can depend on 𝑢𝑢.



The intuition here is that while the comparison between a long-term contract and a short-term contract
is independent of 𝑢𝑢 (in both cases 𝑢𝑢 is subtracted off the buyer’s payoff), the value of a continuing
contract can depend on 𝑢𝑢 in a more complicated way since for some levels of 𝑢𝑢 the buyer will offer the
seller an efficiency wage. As a result a continuing contract may be suboptimal for one level of 𝑢𝑢 but then
as 𝑢𝑢 rises the buyer’s payoff under a continuing contract stays the same while it falls under a long-term
or short-term contract. Hence a continuing contract can become favored for high values of 𝑢𝑢 . This is
what happens in Example 3.2 above, where only the seller has an outside option. On the other hand, if
the buyer has an outside option, an increase in 𝑢𝑢 can make a continuing contract less desirable since as
𝑝𝑝1 rises, the buyer will quit more often.


                                                         20
The next two propositions provide some general conditions under which the contracts can be ranked.
They parallel Proposition 2 and as there it is useful to write

(3.18) 𝐹𝐹 = 𝜋𝜋𝐹𝐹1 + (1 − 𝜋𝜋)𝐹𝐹2 ,

where 𝐹𝐹1 is the distribution of (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 , 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) conditional on 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , 𝐹𝐹2 is the distribution of
(𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 , 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) conditional on 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ≤ 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , and 𝜋𝜋 = 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ).



Proposition 5 (for case M)

    (i)       Fix 𝐹𝐹1 and 𝐹𝐹2 . For 𝜋𝜋 close to zero, a short-term or continuing contract is superior to a long-
              term contract, whereas for 𝜋𝜋 close to 1 the reverse is the case.
    (ii)       Fix 0 < 𝜋𝜋 < 1. Suppose 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(|𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 )| ≤ 𝜀𝜀|𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) = 1 for
              some 𝜀𝜀 > 0. Then for 𝜀𝜀 small enough a continuing contract is optimal.

Proof

Part (i) is proved in the same way as in Proposition 2. To prove (ii), note that a continuing contract
achieves the first-best if 𝜀𝜀 = 0. The reason is that either 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ≤ 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 and the parties walk away or
𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 and there is nothing to argue about in period 2: B and S agree that the division of
surplus should stay the same subject to individual rationality and outside option constraints being
satisfied. Also 𝑝𝑝1 can be adjusted so that S receives 𝑢𝑢 and B obtains all the surplus. Thus the first-best is
achieved. Since a short-term or long-term contract does not achieve the first-best a continuing contract
is optimal. By continuity the same is true if 𝜀𝜀 > 0 is small.                        Q.E.D.



Proposition 6 (for case I)

    (i)       Fix 𝐹𝐹1 and 𝐹𝐹2 . For 𝜋𝜋 close to zero, a short-term or continuing contract is superior to a long-
              term contract, whereas for 𝜋𝜋 close to 1 the reverse is the case.
    (ii)      Fix                                  0 < 𝜋𝜋 < 1.                                                       Suppose
              𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(|𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 )| ≤ 𝜀𝜀, 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 ≤ 𝜀𝜀, 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ≤ 𝜀𝜀|𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) = 1 for some 𝜀𝜀 > 0.
              Assume also 𝑢𝑢� ≥ 𝐸𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . Then for 𝜀𝜀 small enough a continuing contract is optimal.
    (iii)     Suppose there exist 𝑟𝑟1 , 𝑟𝑟2 such that (𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐1 , 𝑟𝑟1 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) ∈ support 𝐹𝐹1              for some 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 and
              (𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐1 , 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟2 ) ∈ support 𝐹𝐹1 for some 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , where 𝑟𝑟1 + 𝑟𝑟2 > 𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 . Then for 𝜃𝜃 small enough
              a long-term or short-term contract is superior to a continuing contract.

    Proof

    Part (i) is proved in the same way as in Proposition 2. To prove (ii), note that a continuing contract
    achieves the first-best if 𝜀𝜀 = 0. The reason is that either 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ≤ 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 and the parties walk
    away or 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 and there is nothing to argue about in period 2, and since 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 = 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 0
    trade occurs. Also 𝑝𝑝1 can be adjusted so that S receives 𝑢𝑢 and B obtains all the surplus. Thus the

                                                             21
     first-best is achieved. Finally, 𝑝𝑝1 ≥ 𝑐𝑐1 since 𝑢𝑢� ≥ 𝐸𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . Since a short-term or long-term contract does
     not achieve the first-best a continuing contract is optimal. By continuity the same is true if 𝜀𝜀 > 0 is
     small given that 𝑝𝑝1 can be adjusted slightly to ensure that trade continues to take place in the
     presence of small outside options.

     To prove (iii), note that if 𝜃𝜃 is small a long-term or short-term contract approximates the first-best.
     In contrast a continuing contract does not since good faith bargaining leads to a second period price
     equal to 𝑝𝑝1 if 𝑣𝑣2 = 𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐2 = 𝑐𝑐1 , and hence trade cannot occur in both (𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐1 , 𝑟𝑟1 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) and
     (𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐1 , 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟2 ): there will be inefficiency in a continuing contract. Q.E.D.



     Proposition 5(ii) and 6(ii), like Proposition 4(ii), can be interpreted as saying that a continuing
     contract works well if it is known in advance that either business will remain as usual or a big change
     will occur that will make it efficient for the relationship to break up.



     4. Renewable and Exclusive Contracts

     We have studied a particular class of contracts. But there are other possibilities. We consider two
     in this section: renewable and exclusive contracts 26.

     4.1 Renewable Contracts

     A renewable contract is a contract that specifies a first period price and a second period price, but
     allows either party to walk away in the second period. Another way to think of a renewable contract
     is that, concerning the second period, it is an “agreement to agree”. As mentioned in the
     introduction such contracts are observed in practice.

     A renewable contract can then be represented by a first period price 𝑝𝑝1 and a second period price
     𝑝𝑝2 . 27

     Trade occurs in the second period if

     (4.1) 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑝𝑝2 ≥ 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵,

     (4.2) 𝑝𝑝2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ≥ 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 .


26
   We could consider other types of contracts, e.g., long-term contracts that that allow one of both parties to exit
(or “breach”) but only if they pay damages; or contracts that give one or both parties an option to exercise trade in
the second period. Doing so would not vitiate the relevance of the trade-offs discussed here. Note also that a
renewable contract, discussed next, can be thought of as a long-term contract where either party can breach by
paying zero damages.
27
   We could consider a price range, with B choosing from this range ex post, instead of a single second period price
(as in Hart and Moore (2008)). This would not change the analysis significantly.


                                                         22
     If one of (4.1) - (4.2) fails to hold, but 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 the parties renegotiate. In this case B offers
     S a price 𝑝𝑝 = 𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , S feels entitled to 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , and S shades by 𝜃𝜃(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 − 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ). An optimal
     renewable contract solves:

       S.T.

     (4.4)                       𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑐𝑐1 + ∫𝑣𝑣                                       (𝑝𝑝2 − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣                                                        𝑟𝑟 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

                                                                                                                                                                                 +
                                                        2 −𝑝𝑝2 ≥𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵, 𝑝𝑝2 −𝑐𝑐2 ≥𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆                         2 −𝑐𝑐2 >𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ,𝑣𝑣2 −𝑝𝑝2 <𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵

       2 −𝑐𝑐2 <𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆




     Since (4.3) is decreasing in 𝑝𝑝1 , (4.4) will be binding at the optimum. Thus we can write

     (4.5)                     𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝑅𝑅 = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑝𝑝2 �𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 + ∫(𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣                                               (𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 − 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 +
                                                                                                        2 −𝑝𝑝2 ≥𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵, 𝑝𝑝2 −𝑐𝑐2 ≥𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆

     ∫𝑣𝑣                                                          [(1 − 𝜃𝜃)(𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 − 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 )]𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 − 𝑢𝑢�,
       2 −𝑐𝑐2 >𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ,𝑣𝑣2 −𝑝𝑝2 <𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜   𝑝𝑝2 −𝑐𝑐2 <𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆


                              𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆𝑅𝑅 = 𝑢𝑢

     Compared with a continuing contract, a renewable contract has advantages and disadvantages. The
     advantage is that the second period price is nailed down and so, if (4.1) - (4.2) are satisfied, trade
     will occur and there is nothing to argue about. In contrast, under a continuing contract, there will
     be argument and aggrievement if 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ≠ 𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 and, in case I, trade may not occur at all. The
     disadvantage of a renewable contract is that, if (4.1) or (4.2) is not satisfied, the parties will bargain
     over the whole gains from trade (𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 − 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) in renegotiation and there will be substantial
     shading. In contrast under a continuing contract the use of the first period contract as a reference
     point may allow the parties to adjust to the new situation relatively easily.

     Since our focus in this paper has been on continuing contracts we present two examples showing
     that a continuing contract can be superior to a renewable contract. We do not mean to suggest,
     however, that the ranking cannot be reversed 28.



28
  In our formulation a renewable contract is always at least as good as a short-term contract. This is because the
parties can always renegotiate if (4.1) or (4.2) fails to hold, as if the renewable contract never existed. This may be
too optimistic. In some cases renegotiation of a renewable contract may be seen as opportunistic and the parties
may simply walk away. A short-term contract can then be better than a renewable contract.

                                                                                         23
Example 4.1

(𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐1 ) = (20,10), (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 ) = (20,10), (35,25) or (10,20), 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 = 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 = 0, 𝑢𝑢 = 0.

The first-best can be achieved with a continuing contract where 𝑝𝑝1 = 10. In period 2 the surplus is
the same as in period 1 if it is positive. Therefore the parties agree that S’s payoff should be zero as
in period 1. This yields 𝑝𝑝2 = 10 if (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 ) = (20,10) and 𝑝𝑝2 = 25 if (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 ) = (35,25). There is no
shading.

In contrast, a renewable contract does not achieve the first-best since there is no 𝑝𝑝2 ∈ [10,20] ∩
[25,35].



Example 4.2

(𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐1 ) = (20,10), (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 ) = (20,10) or (10,20), (𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) = (7,0), (0,7) or (4,4).          (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 ) and
(𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) are independent. 𝑢𝑢 = 𝐸𝐸𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 .

Assume that outside options can be used in bargaining (case M). Then a continuing contract with
𝑝𝑝1 = 10 achieves the first-best. Suppose (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 ) = (20,10). Then since (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 ) = (𝑣𝑣1 , 𝑐𝑐1 ), both
parties think that 𝑝𝑝2 = 10 is a reasonable price. However, both recognize that outside options must
be matched to ensure trade. This yields 𝑝𝑝2 = 10 if (𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) = (7,0), 𝑝𝑝2 = 17 if (𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) = (0,7), and
𝑝𝑝2 = 14 if (𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) = (4,4). There is no aggrievement or shading.

In contrast, a renewable contract does not achieve the first-best. The reason is that there is no 𝑝𝑝2
such that (4.1) - (4.2) are satisfied for (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 , 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) = (20,10,7,0),   (𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑐𝑐2 , 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ) = (20,10,0,7)
since that would require

(4.6) 20 − 𝑝𝑝2 ≥ 7,

(4.7) 𝑝𝑝2 − 10 ≥ 7,

which is impossible.

Note also that, more generally, Propositions 5 and 6 provide general conditions under which a
continuing contract will achieve (approximately) the first-best and can therefore be expected to be
superior to a renewable contract.



4. 2 Exclusive Contracts

A feature of a continuing contract is that the parties are free to walk away. We now consider the
possibility that the parties constrain themselves not to do that. In particular, B and S agree that,
while they will not necessarily trade with each other, they will not trade with anyone else: neither
can quit because of an outside option. (Of course, such a contract can always be renegotiated.) In

                                                        24
     addition the contract is continuing in the sense that, if the parties bargain with each other, this
     bargaining will be in good faith. We call a contract of this type an “exclusive contract”. We will see
     that an exclusive contract may have some advantages over a continuing contract (case I).

     Suppose first that B and S learn at date 1 that 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ≥ 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . Then the exclusive contract will
     not be renegotiated since trade is efficient. The outside options are irrelevant since neither party
     can walk away. Hence the analysis is as in Section 2. B will offer S

     (4.8) 𝑝𝑝̂ = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 �𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 �𝑝𝑝, 𝑐𝑐2 �� ,

     and S will shade by 𝜃𝜃(𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ ), where

     (4.9) 𝑝𝑝� = 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀�𝑣𝑣2 , 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀(𝑝𝑝, 𝑐𝑐2 )�.

     The parties’ period 2 payoffs are

     (4.10) 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵2 = 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝜃𝜃(𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ ),

     (4.11) 𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆2 = 𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝑐𝑐2 .

     Suppose next that 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 < 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . Then renegotiation will occur. There are two subcases. If
     𝑣𝑣2 ≤ 𝑐𝑐2 , in the absence of renegotiation the parties would not trade and so each would get a payoff
     of zero. In this subcase B will offer S −(𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ), S will feel entitled to 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 , and S will shade by 𝜃𝜃(𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ).
     The period 2 payoffs are

     (4.12) 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵2 = 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 − 𝜃𝜃(𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ),

     (4.13) 𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆2 = 0.

     The second subcase is where 𝑣𝑣2 > 𝑐𝑐2 . Then in the absence of renegotiation B and S would bargain
     in good faith and agree to trade. The analysis of good faith bargaining is the same as in Section 2. B
     will offer 𝑝𝑝̂ , and S will feel entitled to 𝑝𝑝�. S’s payoff = 𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝑐𝑐2 . Consider now the renegotiation to
     allow the parties to trade elsewhere. B will offer S −𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 + 𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝑐𝑐2 , and S will feel entitled to
     𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 − 𝑣𝑣2 + 𝑝𝑝�. S’s total shading = 𝜃𝜃(𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 − 𝑣𝑣2 + 𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ ). Thus period 2 payoffs will be given
     by

     (4.14) 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵2 = 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 − 𝑝𝑝̂ + 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝜃𝜃(𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 − 𝑣𝑣2 + 𝑐𝑐2 + 𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ ),

     (4.15) 𝑈𝑈𝑆𝑆2 = 𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝑐𝑐2 .

     It follows that an optimal exclusive contract solves:

(4.16) 𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀𝑀 (𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑝𝑝1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣                               �𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝜃𝜃(𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ )�𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣                                 [𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 −
                                          2 −𝑐𝑐2 ≥𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆                                         2 −𝑐𝑐2 <𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ,𝑣𝑣2 ≤𝑐𝑐2 ,

                          2 −𝑐𝑐2 <𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ,𝑣𝑣2 >𝑐𝑐2 ,




                                                                               25
S.T.

(4.17) (𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑐𝑐1 ) + ∫𝑣𝑣                       (𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 + ∫𝑣𝑣                                       (𝑝𝑝̂ − 𝑐𝑐2 )𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 ≥ 𝑢𝑢.
                           2 −𝑐𝑐2 ≥𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆                                 2 −𝑐𝑐2 <𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ,𝑣𝑣2 >𝑐𝑐2


       Under an exclusive contract the inefficiency that arose with a continuing contract (case I) does not
       occur. In particular, trade takes place whenever 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , since neither party can quit
       without renegotiation.

       It is easily seen that B’s payoff in (4.16) is decreasing in 𝑝𝑝1 : a reduction in 𝑝𝑝1 reduces (1 − 𝜃𝜃)𝑝𝑝̂ + 𝑝𝑝�.
       Hence (4.17) will be binding at an optimum. (Recall that this is also true for long-term and short-
       term contracts but was not true for continuing contracts in the presence of outside options.) We
       can therefore write B’s payoff as

(4.18) 𝑈𝑈𝐵𝐵𝐸𝐸 = 𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 + ∫𝑣𝑣                        �𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − 𝜃𝜃(𝑝𝑝� − 𝑝𝑝̂ )�𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑

As we have noted exclusive contracts can be more efficient than continuing contracts (case I) since trade
will always occur when 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . At the same time, similar to long-term contracts, exclusive
contracts involve renegotiation costs if 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 < 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 . There is no simple ranking between long-
term, short-term, continuing (case I), and exclusive contracts, but the following proposition identifies a
situation where an exclusive contract is optimal 29.

Proposition 7

Suppose that for some 𝜀𝜀 > 0, (i) 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ≥ 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ⇒ | 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 − ( 𝑣𝑣1 − 𝑐𝑐1 )| ≤ 𝜀𝜀, (ii) 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 < 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 +
𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 ⇒ 𝑣𝑣2 < 𝑐𝑐2 and 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 < 𝜀𝜀, 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 < 𝜀𝜀. Then, if 𝜀𝜀 is small, an exclusive contract approximates the first-best.

Proof

       (i) guarantees that, whenever trade is efficient, there is little to argue about given that the period 1
       contract is a reference point. (ii) guarantees that, whenever trade is inefficient, there is also little to
       argue about given that 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 is small. Q.E.D.

29
     It is easy to show that a continuing contract (case M) always dominates an exclusive contract.

                                                                                  26
Two points should be noted. First, if there is a significant probability that 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 < 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 and that
 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 > 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , then neither a long-term contract nor a short-term contract will approximate the
first-best since both will involve renegotiation costs. Also a continuing contract (case I) will not
approximate the first-best if 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 or 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 can be high when 𝑣𝑣2 − 𝑐𝑐2 ≥ 𝑟𝑟𝐵𝐵 + 𝑟𝑟𝑆𝑆 , since it will be impossible to
find a 𝑝𝑝1 such that neither party ever quits. Hence under the conditions of Proposition 4 an exclusive
contract will typically be optimal among the contracts we have considered.

Note also that condition (B) is less restrictive than it may appear. It says that when trade is inefficient
between B and S neither party can do well elsewhere. But this may be the case if a high cost 𝑐𝑐2 for S
also means that S’s cost of supplying elsewhere is high; and if a low value 𝑣𝑣2 for B also means that B’s
value from buying elsewhere is low.



5. Conclusions

In this paper we have studied the trade-off between long-term, short-term, and continuing contracts in
a setting where gains from trade are known to be present in the short-term, and may or may not be
present in the long-term. We have shown that a continuing contract, which uses the first period contract
as a reference point, can sometimes be a useful compromise between a long-term contract and a short-
term contract. A continuing contract will perform particularly well if either “business will remain roughly
as usual” over time or a big change will occur that will make it efficient for the relationship to break up.
This may describe quite well the situation of many rental or employment relationships mentioned in the
introduction and help to explain why continuing contracts are often seen in these settings. Continuing
contracts are not a panacea, however, since good faith bargaining may preclude the use of outside
options in the bargaining process and as a result parties will sometimes fail to trade when this is
efficient.

We have also shown that a continuing contract that leaves the terms of trade in subsequent periods
open can be superior to a renewable contract that specifies these terms.

Clearly our paper is only a start on the analysis of these different types of contract, and there are several
further developments that seem fruitful. First, our model is based on the idea that the market at date 0
is more competitive than at date 1: indeed at date 0 it is perfectly competitive, whereas at date 1
parties’ outside options are exogenous and may yield each party strictly less than if they trade together.
In other words there is a “fundamental transformation” in the sense of Williamson (1985). However, we
have not modeled this transformation explicitly. It would be interesting to do this, perhaps by
introducing relationship-specific investments.

Related to this, if there are many buyers and sellers at date 0, then the contracts they sign with each
other will affect who is available as a trading partner at date 1. Under these conditions outside options



                                                        27
at date 1 will no longer be exogenous, but will be determined as part of a general equilibrium. Analyzing
this general equilibrium would seem valuable although challenging.

In our analysis of continuing contracts we have distinguished between the cases where outside options
can or cannot be used in the bargaining process. We argued that which case applies may depend on
norms and practices in the industry or country concerned. However, it may also depend on agents’
actions. For example, if a worker receives an outside offer out of the blue, his or her employer may treat
this differently from the case where the worker searched for this offer: the employer may be more
willing to match in the first case than the second. Another way to enrich the model would be to
recognize that many outside opportunities are not obtained costlessly but are the result of a search
process.

Our analysis has several other obvious limitations. First, we have assumed that nothing is verifiable. But
in practice there may be signals of profitability that the parties can use as an index for prices. The
relevant question may then become whether it is better for the parties to choose an indexed long-term
or renewable contract or a continuing contract that leaves the terms open. The framework we have
developed here should be useful for analyzing this. 30 Second, we have ignored risk-aversion, wealth
constraints, and moral hazard (e.g., the seller can take actions to affect the quality of the good traded):
all of these may be important in determining the nature and length of contracts. Third, by considering a
finite horizon model we have ignored reputational concerns. But in practice these are obviously
important in determining how parties negotiate or renegotiate contracts, how they react to not getting
what they feel entitled to (whether they shade or not), whether they are willing to match outside
options, etc.

Finally, we have assumed that the parties have a clear choice between writing a short-term or a
continuing contract. But in practice even a short-term contract may create obligations between the
parties that require them to treat each other fairly in the event that they trade again. In other words a
short-term contract may merge into a continuing contract. To understand what contracts are feasible
requires a theory of how obligations are determined, including whether parties can manipulate or
design notions like good faith or instead must take them as given 31. This is a challenging research agenda
that seems an important complement to what we have done here.

  If the parties were able to design fairness or good faith without constraints they could choose them to mean that
the parties must split the ex post surplus 50:50. In our context of symmetric information and no noncontractible
specific investments a long-term, short-term, and continuing contract would then all achieve the first-best. While
splitting the surplus is a familiar idea when value and cost are verifiable, it is not something that we see, or that
one can easily imagine being implemented, in other contexts such as ours. Exactly why remains an open question.
