                                             ABSTRACT

The joint production of paintings by more than one artist was not uncommon in the past: a number
of Old Masters had assistants do much of the work on their paintings, executing images that had been
planned by the master. Yet prior to the twentieth century very few paintings were actually signed by
more than one artist. Early in the twentieth century, many important conceptual artists occasionally
co-authored paintings or drawings, but consistent co-authorship of paintings, sculptures, and photographs
is a practice that is novel to the late twentieth century. These recent instances have generally involved
pairs of conceptual artists. The English team, Gilbert and George, is the most important pair that has
consistently produced co-authored works; they have executed all of their work jointly since 1969,
when they made Singing Sculpture, their first and most famous piece. A number of pairs of young
conceptual artists had worked closely together earlier in the century, but they did not formally co-author
their work, perhaps because of the art world's commitment to the ideal of the autonomous artist. Since
the critical and economic success of Gilbert and George has demonstrated that this resistance can be
overcome, co-authorship has become more common among younger conceptual artists, and this trend
is likely to continue in future.

Introduction

       Consistent co-authorship of painting or other works of advanced visual art did not occur

prior to the late twentieth century. In recent decades, however, this practice has been followed

by a handful of teams of important artists. Yet the history of visual artists working together

suggests that co-authorship is likely to become more widespread in the future, and for this reason

the practice is of greater interest than would be warranted by the limited number of artists who

have already adopted it. A brief survey of this history can help us to understand its recent

emergence.

Before Modern Art

       Joint production of paintings was an accepted practice in the Renaissance, as eminent

masters presided over studios that might comprise dozens of students and assistants. So for

example Vasari reported that when Raphael became successful he employed a large number of

assistants and “was never seen at court without some fifty painters.”1 John Pope-Hennessy noted

that in this phase of his career “Raphael over a large part of his work became an ideator instead

of an executant,” as he made detailed preparatory drawings or cartoons for works that would

then be painted by assistants.2 Raphael’s practice of having his plans executed by others was a

consequence of his conceptual approach to art, for he clearly considered the essence of his works

to lie in their conception. Art scholars have generally agreed, as for example E. H. Gombrich

described Raphael’s images as “ideas come to life.”3 Like other conceptual masters of his time.

Raphael consequently did not hesitate to present joint products of his studio as his own work.

Yet although several artists might work on a single painting, it was very rare for the finished

product to bear the signature of more than one artist, for in virtually all cases there was a clear
                                                  4

distinction between the roles of the master and his assistants.

       Occasional instances can be found prior to the modern era in which two independent

masters jointly produced a painting. One example is the case of Peter Paul Rubens (1577-1640)

and Jan Brueghel the Elder (1568-1625), the two most important painters in Antwerp in the early

seventeenth century. The two were good friends, and they executed about two dozen paintings

together between 1598 and Brueghel’s death in 1625. Although only one of these paintings was

actually signed by both artists, Anne Woollett observed that their joint works “are distinguished

by the evident separateness of their hands in a composition,” and that “their established

specialties and styles of painting serve as the visual equivalent of a signature.”4

       In general, Brueghel appears to have initiated the joint paintings, carrying out the

drawing of the overall composition and much of the painting, including landscape and other

natural motifs, which were his specialty. Rubens then painted the figures, which were his

particular strength. That the paintings contain few significant pentimenti (changes made during

the process of execution) suggests that the compositions were planned carefully in advance.

Scholars assume that the two painters worked on these paintings sequentially, and that in fact

each probably worked in his own studio, with the canvases being moved back and forth. That

both Brueghel and Rubens were conceptual artists, who were accustomed to painting from

preliminary drawings, obviously facilitated the process, for neither typically found it necessary

to alter work the other artist had already done on a particular painting.5

       Although the older Brueghel was more established when the two artists began working

together, Rubens soon gained greater prominence, and ultimately became a much more famous

painter. So for example a survey of 18 recent textbooks of art history found a total of 65
                                                 5

illustrations of paintings by Rubens, compared to six for Brueghel. The textbooks also show that

the joint paintings were not among Rubens’ most important contributions, for only two of his

illustrations are of co-authored paintings.6

The Twentieth Century

       Co-authorship of paintings and other works of visual art became much more common in

the twentieth century, as a number of groups of conceptual artists produced significant numbers

of joint productions, that two or more artists would sign. So for example many co-authored

works were made by Dada artists in the late 1910s and early ‘20s, by Russian Suprematists and

Constructivists during the 1920s, by Surrealists from the 1920s on, and by members of the Cobra

group from the late 1940s on. Co-authored works consequently exist by many prominent artists,

including the Dada artists Jean Arp, George Grosz, and Raul Hausmann, the Russians Kazimir

Malevich and Georgii and Vladimir Stenberg, the Surrealists Joan Miró, Yves Tanguy, Salvador

Dali, and Roberto Matta, and the Cobra painters Asger Jorn, Pierre Alechinsky, and Karel

Appel.7 The Surrealists in fact produced hundreds of drawings, each of which was co-authored

by three or four artists: these were the products of a game the group often played, that they

named Exquisite Corpse.8

       Yet although there were many co-authored works made by artists in these groups during

the first half of the twentieth century, these works did not make co-authorship an important

phenomenon in the visual arts. The co-authored works were rarely significant efforts: although

they were often produced by important artists, in no instance did they rank among those artists’

most important contributions. The co-authored works were typically minor pieces, made

quickly, and often, as in the case of the Surrealists’ Exquisite Corpse drawings, primarily for the
                                                 6

artists’ amusement. Very few artists in the first half of the twentieth century consistently co-

authored works with one other artist and devoted significant effort to this joint activity. In a few

exceptions to this last generalization, including the case of Jean Arp and his wife, Sophie

Taeuber-Arp, both artists had made substantial bodies of work before they began working

together, and one of the partners had a considerably greater reputation based on the earlier work,

so the joint work was typically overshadowed by the more prominent artist’s productions.

       Throughout most of the century, an effective barrier to the serious and sustained

production of co-authored art remained in place. Specifically, co-authorship was prevented by

the traditional conception of the artist as an autonomous agent. Curiously, this conception

persisted in spite of the fact that both patrons and critics have long recognized that Western art

has always been in many respects a communal activity: the workshops of the Old Masters, where

many paintings were jointly made by several artists, and the many stylistic groups in which

modern artists worked closely together – Impressionism, Fauvism and Cubism, to name a few –

immediately provide evidence of this recognition. Yet critics and collectors nonetheless appear

to have insisted that individual works be identified with the name of a single artist.

       In the second half of the twentieth century, significant cases of co-authorship have

become more common in advanced art. In a number of cases, this is a consequence of instances

in which a husband and wife who were already both working as artists decided to sign all their

works jointly. Examples of this include Edward Kienholz and Nancy Reddin, Claes Oldenburg

and Coosje van Bruggen, and Christo and Jeanne-Claude Javacheff. Although some of the work

these artists have made has achieved prominence, in general these teams’ joint work has been

overshadowed by the reputations established earlier by the more eminent of the two partners. So
                                                 7

for example an art scholar remarked that “Although [Kienholz] has included his wife’s name as

co-creator, he has not yet allowed her to have great impact on his style.” The same scholar

judged that “Although the Oldenburgs’ collaboration is acknowledged, . . . the style belongs to

the husband,” and that in yet another case, “the ideas are Christo’s; the financial organization

Jeanne-Claude’s.”9

       A new practice emerged in the late twentieth century, however, in which teams of two

artists working together from the beginning of their careers, making all of their art jointly, have

become significant contributors to advanced art. In most cases these artists have had family

relationships: they include husbands and wives (Bernd and Hilla Becher), brothers (Mike and

Doug Starn, Jake and Dinos Chapman), and partners in long-term relationships (Gilbert and

George, Tim Noble and Sue Webster). A survey of 20 textbooks of art history published since

1990 serves to measure the relative importance of the most prominent of these recent artistic

teams. Most notable is the success of Gilbert and George, as Table 1 shows that they have an

average of almost one illustration per book. Gilbert and George appear to be genuine innovators

in creating a successful model of artistic co-authorship, and their case is consequently of

considerable interest.

Gilbert and George

       Gilbert Proesch (1943- ) and George Pasmore (1942- ) met in 1967, when they were

students in the sculpture department of St. Martin’s School of Art in London. Both were

dissatisfied with the formalist orientation of the program: “They taught you to think solely about

form: Extraordinary! The entire course was about the work’s form, color, shape, weight. The

teachers didn’t think about content, meaning didn’t come into it.”10 They decided that together
                                                 8

they would create a new type of art, in which they themselves would become the art. The critic

David Sylvester later found the key to their art in its beginning: “everything they’ve done

depends from that marvelous wheeze they had as students that a couple of artists could be living

sculptures.”11 Gilbert agreed: “we decided we were the object and the subject. And I think that

was the biggest invention we ever did… We made a decision, like another artist who tells

himself the most important thing is the form. And for us the most important thing was us as

objects speaking to the world.”12 An element of the decision was that the two would be one

artist: “Two people make one artist. We think that we are an artist.” When asked if each could

make art individually, Gilbert responded “I think it would be totally impossible.”13

       As part of their position that they are a single artist, Gilbert and George deny that their

work is the product of any functional division of labor: “All those partnerships you think of, it’s

one person doing one thing and another doing another, bringing their different talents to bear on

something. We don’t think we’re doing that. We never see it that we are doing a picture

together in that way.”14 Early in their career, Gilbert and George made large charcoal drawings

based on photographs, but they abandoned these, in part because some viewers would attempt to

separate their contributions. To make this impossible, their subsequent work has been based on

photography: “We invented a technical form to make one art that doesn’t distinguish between us.

You don’t see the brush strokes, the handwritten message that every artist is so proud of.” 15 This

served their original decision to become one artist, for “it was a way of getting away from self.”16

       Gilbert and George have explained why they consider their practice of making art

together to be advantageous: “We can never have self-doubt. Because the normal artist is always

asking himself questions, he is sitting in front of the canvas saying, ‘Should I put another green
                                                 9

cow in the corner, should I change the color of the sky?’, and no answer comes back. Whereas

with two people you’ve always got an answer. Self-doubt is vanishing. As long as the other

always says yes – and we always say yes to each other. I think we share an enormous sense of

purpose. I think that’s our greatest strength.”17 When they are asked how they resolve

disagreements about their work, they deny that they have any: “we never argue.”18

       When Gilbert and George left St. Martin’s, they set out to become successful artists: “We

were desperate to draw attention to ourselves.” In 1969, dressed in matching tweed suits, with

bronze paint on their faces and hands, they sang an old music hall song, “Underneath the

Arches,” continuously for eight hours in Charing Cross, one of the busiest spots in London.

Titled Singing Sculpture, the work became famous, and during the next five years they presented

it in clubs, art schools, and museums throughout Europe, Australia, Asia, and the United States.19

Gilbert and George consider Singing Sculpture to have been their first work, and it remains their

most important: photographs of it appear in eight of the 20 textbooks surveyed by this study,

whereas none of their other works appears in more than two books.

       Gilbert and George have consistently maintained that art should be conceptual. In a 1982

interview they declared that “Art is completely abstract, intellectual,” in 1987 they stated that

“Art is pure thought,” and in 1993 they explained that “Art is about having new ideas.” 20 What

matters to them is not the process of making art, but the result: “The work is totally unimportant

except for the end result. It is only the message that is important.”21 In pursuit of powerful

images, over time their works have become larger and more colorful, recently filling large walls

with grids of panels made with digital technology. Their images nearly always feature

themselves, often dressed in their trademark tweed suits, but occasionally in the nude, and they
                                                 10

frequently include enlarged photographs of bodily fluids and waste products, with provocative

texts referring to religion, homosexuality, male prostitution, AIDS, and other topics of obvious

social significance. They contend that their goal is to influence people: “We are not here to

reflect or illustrate life. We want to form it, change it.”22 Curiously, however, although the

images and language in their works are often shocking, their messages are generally unclear: as

David Sylvester noted, “there is something deeply equivocal about what is expected of us.”

Sylvester placed this within a conceptual tradition: “Gilbert and George, like Duchamp, never

forget the importance of keeping us guessing.”23

The Next Generation

       Gilbert and George appear to be appreciated more in England than elsewhere: Louisa

Buck recently observed that they, along with Damien Hirst and David Hockney, are Britain’s

best-known living artists, and in 2002 Hirst complained that “I can’t help thinking if Gilbert and

George were American, they’d be much more significant.” 24 The impact of the pair in England

may account for the greater prominence in London of artistic teams of the next generation. So for

example the younger team of sculptors Tim Noble (1966 - ) and Sue Webster (1967 - )

announced their first exhibition by making flyers on which they superimposed photographs of

their own faces on a picture of Gilbert and George.25

       Louisa Buck listed several ways in which Jake (1966 - ) and Dinos (1962 - ) Chapman

are indebted to their older colleagues: “Like contemporary art’s other famous double act, Gilbert

and George (for whom they once worked as assistants), the Chapmans have benefitted from the

PR advantages of presenting a twinned front. They have also embraced scandal and outrage by

creating images that many people find offensive... while declaring that they are only dealing with
                                                 11

what is already floating in the cultural ether. More significantly, however, the Chapmans have

followed the example of Gilbert and George by presenting often outrageously transgressive

subject matter in a way that appears mechanical and pristine - thus further distancing themselves

from the work.”26

       The Chapman brothers’ art is highly conceptual: “They play with visual and verbal

correspondences, create hilariously vulgar and impenetrably obscure associations, layer images

onto existing historical imagery and cyclically reconfigure motifs that reappear in different

guises. They employ word games, visual puns, illogical anachronism and time leaps, biological

shifts and moral conundrums, unexpected variations in scale and sudden alterations between

media to create both amusing and unsettling ambiguities.”27 One of their characteristically

conceptual practices is to draw heavily on earlier artists’ work. Early in their careers they

became fascinated with Francisco Goya’s series of etchings, The Disasters of War, and they

proceeded to make a number of works based on it. These include Insult to Injury, of 2003. After

purchasing an edition of Goya’s Disasters series for £25,000, they defaced or (in their word)

“rectified” Goya’s black-and -white images by drawing colored cartoon faces over those of some

of the original figures, and occasionally adding helmets decorated with swastikas. They

presented these “improved” works in an exhibition titled The Rape of Creativity.28 When some

critics expressed outrage at what they called an act of vandalism, the Chapmans made two

arguments in their defense. One was economic: noting that each of the 80 etchings in their series

sold for £13,500, they asked how an act that raised the value of a work of art could be considered

vandalism. The other argument was canonical, as the brothers pointed to the famous precedent of

the young Robert Rauschenberg erasing a drawing by Willem de Kooning to create a new work
                                                 12

of art in 1953.29

        The comparison between the Chapmans’ Insult to Injury and Rauschenberg’s Erased de

Kooning Drawing is of course inexact, because rather than eliminating Goya’s work, the

Chapmans added to it, and thus effectively made themselves co-authors of Goya’s. The

Chapmans have made other works that refer to artistic co-authorship, including a set of etchings,

titled Exquisite Corpse, that mimic the composite drawings made in the course of the game of

that name by the Surrealists, in which each of several panels on a folded sheet of paper was

drawn by a different artist who could not see the forms made by preceding participants. The

frequency with which the Chapmans appropriate other artists’ images and practices implies that

one of the themes underlying their work is in fact artistic collaboration. Consistent with this, they

have spoken of the history of art as a continuity, and have claimed that “We’re trying to diffuse

the creative importance of the artist in the process of making art.”30

Artistic Teams

        The twentieth century has seen a number of significant instances of two young

conceptual artists working closely together. Several of these have attained almost mythic status.

From 1909 until the outbreak of World War I, Picasso and Braque joined forces in developing

Cubism. Picasso recalled how closely they had worked together: “At that time our work was a

kind of laboratory research from which vanity was excluded.”31 Braque similarly stressed that

they had cooperated to solve problems: “In the early days of Cubism, Pablo Picasso and I were

engaged in what we felt was a search for the anonymous personality. We were inclined to efface

our own personalities in order to find originality. Thus it often happened that amateurs mistook

Picasso’s painting for mine and mine for Picasso’s. This was a matter of indifference to us
                                                 13

because we were primarily interested in our work and in the new problem it presented.”32

        Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg worked closely together during the late 1950s,

when both were making what proved to be their most important innovations. Rauschenberg

recalled that “Jasper and I literally traded ideas.”33 Johns stated that “I suppose I learned more

about painting from Bob than I learned from any other artist or teacher, and working as closely

as we did and more or less in isolation, we developed a strong sense of kinship. When that

ended, each of us seemed to develop - where there had been none before - some sense of self-

interest.”34 At a time when the two artists were receiving little encouragement from the art world

at large, Rauschenberg explained that the support they got from each other gave them

“permission to do what we wanted.”35 Today Johns and Rauschenberg object to comparisons

between their early working relationship and that of Picasso and Braque, pointing out that unlike

the two young Cubists, they never shared an artistic style. During that early time, however, they

nonetheless drew comfort from the parallel they perceived between their situation and that of the

Cubists. Thus Johns recently told a journalist, “I remember once, I was reading Gertrude Stein’s

Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas to him, reading it out loud, and Bob turned and said, ‘One day

they’ll be writing about us like that.’”36

        Like these other pairs of young artists before them, Gilbert and George faced

considerable opposition to their work early in their careers. One example occurred shortly after

they left St. Martin’s, and had begun to present themselves as living sculptures. Hoping to get

support from their former teachers, they went back to see several, including Anthony Caro, the

most eminent sculptor at St. Martin’s. “We went to a pub near his studio and sat and had half a

bitter and a cheese roll, and explained where we wanted to take our art. He listened very
                                                  14

carefully, quite politely. Then he said, ‘I hope very much that you don’t succeed, but I rather

think you might.’”37 Like the young Picasso and Braque, and the young Johns and Rauschenberg,

the young Gilbert and George joined together to solve problems, with a primary emphasis on

artistic concepts, rather than the personality of the artist. And like those earlier teams, Gilbert

and George made their early innovations in the face of considerable adversity. Unlike their

earlier counterparts, however, Gilbert and George not only worked as if their art was a joint

product, but actually formally co-authored their work. And unlike the earlier teams, Gilbert and

George did not part company after an initial period of discovery: in 2007, their retrospective

exhibition at London’s Tate Modern Museum surveyed work that they had done over the course

of 38 years, from 1969 through 2006. In their complete and consistent co-authorship of their

work, and the degree of their success, Gilbert and George effectively became pioneers of a new

practice in advanced art. They have succeeded in convincing the art world that a pair of

individuals can jointly make a significant contribution. The introduction to the booklet

distributed at their recent retrospective exhibition in London includes a sentence that

simultaneously points to the English art world’s view of their importance and the acceptance of

the pair as a unit, noting that “it is fitting that Gilbert & George: Major Exhibition is the largest

retrospective of any artist to be held at Tate Modern.”38

       As the survey of art history textbooks demonstrates, Gilbert and George are the most

successful team working today, but they are not unique among contemporary artists in their

consistent production of co-authored art. Key aspects of their practice also appear to be common

to other contemporary artistic teams. So for example, the photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher

have explained that in their practice “there is no division of labor in the sense that one person is
                                                 15

always responsible for one aspect or phase of the work. Both of us do everything: at times we

each do a certain task and then we swap... Outsiders cannot tell who has taken a particular photo

and we also often forget ourselves. It simply is not important.”39 And Jake and Dinos Chapman

have declared that they always work together in order to suppress their individual

preoccupations: “We work together as a means to avoid coalescing into a single boring artist

preoccupied with all things personal and internal.”40

The Future of Co-Authorship in Art

       Co-authorship has become not only common but typical in many academic disciplines.

Although it is not common in visual art, in recent decades it has become a consistent practice for

a handful of important pairs of artists, and it is now widely accepted by art critics as well as

collectors. So for example Gilbert and George were awarded the English Turner Prize in 1986,

and Jake and Dinos Chapman were short-listed for that prize in 2003, as Jane and Louise Wilson

had been in 1999. And a number of artistic teams, including Gilbert and George, Bernd and Hilla

Becher, Tim Noble and Sue Webster, Peter Fischli and David Weiss, and Jake and Dinos

Chapman, have all had individual works sell for $100,000 or more at auction.

       Throughout the past century, a number of pairs or small groups of young conceptual

artists have worked closely together, often to solve specific technical problems, and to give each

other encouragement while breaking accepted rules of art. During most of the century, these

artists did not actually co-author their works, perhaps in part because they feared this would not

be accepted by others in the art world. This is no longer true, for co-authored art is now exhibited

in the most important museums of modern art, and generates substantial prices at auction. In

view of this, it is likely that in future increasing numbers of young artists will not only make
                                                    16

their work jointly, but will present it explicitly as their joint product. It is also likely that, as in

the past, these teams will generally be made up of conceptual artists, for ideas appear to be more

readily exchanged and negotiated than visions.
