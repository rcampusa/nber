Markets for Reputation: Evidence on Quality and Quantity in Academe

                                              ABSTRACT

We develop a theory of the market for individual reputation, an indicator of regard by one’s peers
and others. The central questions are: 1) Does the quantity of exposures raise reputation independent
of their quality? and 2) Assuming that overall quality matters for reputation, does the quality of an
individual’s most important exposure have an extra effect on reputation? Using evidence for academic
economists, we find that, conditional on its impact, the quantity of output has no or even a negative
effect on each of a number of proxies for reputation, and very little evidence that a scholar’s most
influential work provides any extra enhancement of reputation. Quality ranking matters more than
absolute quality. Data on mobility and salaries show, on the contrary, substantial positive effects of
quantity, independent of quality. We test various explanations for the differences between the determinants
of reputation and salary.

…reputation ... traditionally has been regarded as too squishy to measure.
(Business Week, July 9, 2007)

I. Introduction

      There has been a substantial literature in economics on the formation of reputation, both of

individuals and of the groups to which they belong. Most of the research has been purely theoretical, with

an analysis of reputation of firms (good-will) as an asset (Tadelis, 2002) and with much of the work

focused on reputation arising from behavior in repeated games (Mailath and Samuelson, 2006). Another

strand of theory has focused on timing, including the dynamics of the relation of individuals’ behavior

and reputations and those of the firms for which they work (or the products or services they produce)

(Tirole, 1996), and on the reputation-maximizing timing of the release of information (Sarafidis, 2007).

Presumably reputation, defined as “overall quality or character as seen or judged by people in general,” is

something that develops over time in the minds of those who are judging the person, group, product, etc. 1

      Because reputation is based on perceptions of “overall quality,” the appropriate prior question

would seem to be what we mean by quality—what aspects of individuals’ behavior contribute to quality

and thus generate their reputations and those of the groups to which they belong.             As such, the

construction of reputation might be thought of as analogous to an implicit market in which bundled

aspects of a good or service are traded for some overall price (Rosen, 1974).             A “supplier” of

characteristics brings them to a market, where “purchasers” (employers; the public; one’s professional

peers; one’s fellow employees; one’s neighbors; one’s customers) express their preferences by assigning

weights to the suppliers’ efforts. These weights in turn combine in the purchasers’ views to generate the

suppliers’ reputations. In this implicit market for reputation the returns to its various determinants are

created by buyers’ preferences and the ability of existing and potential suppliers to generate those

determinants. We can always measure the market “prices” of the dimensions of quality; and if we can

identify the separate behavior of each party, or assume that one party’s behavior does not respond to the

returns to various determinants of reputation, we can even infer the structure of preferences for reputation

or the reputation-enhancing productivity of various characteristics.


1
 Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary, June 5, 2008.
      In this study we illustrate the notion of the implicit market for reputation with the example of the

determinants of the reputations of academic economists. Our particular focus is on how the market values

both the quantity of their scholarly output and, in the spirit of the hedonic markets literature, various

aspects of the quality of their output. The more specific questions are: 1) How does the quantity of

publications affect the regard in which a scholar is held by other scholars? 2) Do a few extremely well-

regarded publications have the same reputational effect as an equally successful (in terms of its total

impact on other scholars) publication list that is more diffuse? and 3) Are the determinants of reputation

the same as the determinants of pecuniary returns? The answers to these specific questions about the

rewards to scholars should shed some light on the general determinants of professional reputation,

especially about how its formation is affected by the trade-offs along various dimensions of reputation-

enhancing activities, as well as on the pecuniary returns to reputation.

II. Thinking about Reputation

      Our question asks how reputation is formed—what goes on in buyers’ minds as they observe the

outcomes of suppliers’ efforts that might generate reputations. Presumably reputation is related to

memory and how the actions and sequences of suppliers’ behavior produce memories in the minds of the

buyers. As such, the literature on memory and learning in experimental psychology may be informative

for our purposes. That literature unsurprisingly makes it clear that memory is enhanced by additional

exposure. In terms of our question about the trade-offs among the dimensions of quality, however, the

issue is whether memory of an item within a class is better enhanced by a given number of stimuli of one

item in that class or of several different items in the same class.

      A fundamental work in the general area of memory (Tulving and Thomson, 1973) demonstrated its

complexities and proposed a theory of “encoding specificity”—that the specifics underlying exposure to

events and the keys that might lead to the retrieval of memory interact to determine how memories

develop. This study led to a huge literature, none of which speaks directly to our question, but part of

which may shed some light on it. Arnold and Lindsay (2002) imply that people will remember better if

they are stimulated by exact repetition of an event rather than by variations in it. Starns and Hicks (2005)

show that providing related stimuli at the same time has complementary effects on memories of each, but


                                                       2
that this is only true if the stimuli are provided in the same experimental session. In a slightly different

context, that of studying for tests, the results of Kurtz and Loewenstein (2007) show qualitatively similar

results. Overall one might infer that these experiments support the notion that memory will be more

strongly enhanced by repetitions of the same stimulus than by the same number of different, but related

stimuli. Viewing the class of stimuli as all references to a scholar’s work, and each individual stimulus as

a reference to a particular study, they suggest that scholarly reputation may be more strongly affected by a

very important publication than by an equally-visible series of lesser works.

      While there are many human endeavors in which multiple dimensions of quality might be viewed

as determining rewards, there has heretofore been no direct analysis of the relative roles of different

measures of quality. An area in which one might examine such effects is in sports, with the most research

having been carried out on major league baseball. While no studies have focused on our concerns,

several have examined salary determination as affected by various dimensions of players’ productivity.

Faurot and McAllister (1992) find a negative effect of a player’s home runs on arbitrators’ salary awards,

once runs created are held constant; Kahn’s (1993) estimates of salary determination do not suggest any

additional effects of extra-base hits on salary among white batters. At least in the endeavor of professional

baseball, a second dimension of quality does not appear to generate additional rewards beyond those

produced by overall quality.

      The particular issue is how the market for reputation, R, is affected by three dimensions of

production: Quantity, and two types of quality. 2 In the example of academic reputation, we define

quantity as the number of publications, Q. We define quality as q1, the total recognition of a scholar’s

entire oeuvre by other scholars, and q2n, the recognition of his/her nth-most recognized publication (where

n is some arbitrary small number, with n=1 in most of our empirical work).3 We assume that the members

of a scholar’s profession consider his/her outputs in creating their estimates of the scholar’s reputation.

Buyers thus have some demand for reputation as a function of these characteristics:


2
 Obviously, we could generalize this to additional dimensions of quality; but the formulation we use is the simplest
that allows us to construct empirical analogues.
3
 One might for convenience analogize to baseball and think of Q as at-bats, q1 as runs batted in and q21 as slugging
average.

                                                         3
    (1)       RDi = RDi(Q, q1, q2n), i = 1,…, I,

with the partial derivatives RDij ≥ 0 for all j dimensions of reputation-enhancing activity. The responses

of reputation to its determinants show the marginal willingness of demanders to reward various

dimensions of scholarly work.

          The identity of the “buyers” of reputation varies with the example. Certainly the phrase from the

definition, “people in general,” should not be interpreted too broadly. The public in general does not

determine and probably does not care about the reputations of individual scholars. Also, within the

scholarly community some members undoubtedly have a greater influence in contributing to judgments

about reputation than others. Because of the difficulties in identifying members of the groups that

determine reputation, we base our example on a wide variety of measures of reputation. The buyers could

be the individual’s professional peers, his/her professional organization, some professional opinion

leaders, or perhaps those institutions that are potential or actual buyers of his/her services.

    By analogy, the scholars whose reputations are determined in this market generally engage in

activities that will maximize their reputations, conditional on their abilities, by responding to the market

returns to quantity and the quality dimensions.           Their activities will produce an analogous set of

reputational supply functions, one by each of the scholar/participants in this reputational market:

    (2)       RSk = RSk(Q, q1, q2n), k = 1,…K,

with the RSkj ≥ 0 for all j. The responses in (2) show the reputational returns to an increase in particular

aspects of a scholar’s efforts. As is usual in hedonic models, together the demand and supply functions

interact to generate a market reward function describing the determinants of reputation:

    (3)       R = R(Q, q1, q2n), with Rj ≥ 0 for all j.

          The buyers i presumably differ in their ability to purchase reputation—those institutions that are

richer will be able to buy more reputation, and in general will presumably be observed with a staff that

has higher Q, q1 and q2n. There is no reason to assume that the RDi are homothetic, so that an interesting

empirical exercise would examine how the returns to these determinants of reputation vary with the total




                                                          4
resources available to the buyers to purchase reputation. 4 Our empirical work provides some evidence on

this issue.

         Whether there is any substitution in scholars’ production of reputation and whether the supply

functions (2) actually result from some maximizing calculations are more difficult questions. Individual

heterogeneity is implicit in (2), but we also assume that the total amount of effort devoted to producing

reputation is fixed to the individual, or at least that individuals’ production functions, while different, are

homothetic. Even within this assumption, if the returns to particular dimensions of quality differ, are

scholars aware of this? If they are aware, are they capable of substituting toward more highly rewarded

dimensions—is the market output of reputation really jointly determined by demanders and suppliers? It

may be that each scholar has a Leontief-type production function in these inputs into reputation (although

clearly individual production functions may differ), so that no supply-side substitution is possible and the

market prices reflect buyers’ preferences.

III. Testing the Determinants of Reputation—Measuring Inputs and Output

A. General Issues

         Ideally we would have measures of individuals’ reputations or of some result of the reputations

that they have established. One approach is based on the notion that some of the purchasers of reputation

are one’s peers, so that awards conferred by peers represent their assessments of a scholar’s reputation. A

second, indirect approach assumes that the members of an academic collective (department) seek to avoid

diminishing its reputation. To achieve this goal they only add those marginal members whose individual

reputations are at least as high as some summary measure of the reputations of the collective’s current

members (e.g., Rosen, 1987; Basu, 1989, and, by analogy, the literature on the worker-managed firm




4
 This view of buyers seeking to purchase reputation based on their resources predicts the unsurprising result that
scholars attached to richer schools will have greater reputations. This outcome arises not because the school confers
reputation on the scholar, but rather because it can “purchase” the services of those scholars who are capable of
generating greater reputations, which are then conferred onto the institution. This approach has the interesting
prediction that, where there is greater heterogeneity in institutional resources, we should observe a steeper gradient
across institutions in the extent of scholarly reputation. This prediction seems supported by work of Cardoso et al
(2008) showing that the research success of younger American labor economists varies more with the source of their
doctorate than does that of their European counterparts.



                                                          5
going back to Ward, 1958). 5 Thus for members of collectives that are sufficiently large, a measure of

individual reputation is the reputation of the collective. Taking the same tack, the collective’s reputation

is an even better proxy for the reputations of its newer members—those whose reputations were recently

deemed by more senior members of the collective to be sufficiently high that their admission to the

collective would not reduce its reputation.

        One might argue that salary or compensation is a result of scholarly reputation and can be

analyzed in the same way as the indicators already discussed.               Since we assume that economics

departments and the universities of which they are constituents attempt to maximize reputation, one might

expect that the inputs that affect reputation will affect salaries in similar ways. Indeed, a long literature

exists on the role of the quantity and quality of publications in salary determination in economics, with

citations by other scholars often being the proxy for quality (Hamermesh et al, 1982; Moore et al, 1998;

and Bratsberg et al, 2009, are just a few of the many that typically use samples of scholars at a few

institutions) and with counts of articles and books proxying quantity. This literature could be viewed as

measuring the impacts of these indicators on an outcome of reputation. One way of obtaining extra salary

is by obtaining additional job offers. These too are presumably based on one’s reputation, so that

examining a sub-sample of offers (accepted offers by job-changers) provides an additional test for the role

of reputation and the possible distinction between its determinants and those of salaries.

B. Specific Measures

        Our sample consists of full professors in those economics departments that are included among

the 88 American departments listed as being in the top 200 in the world by Kalaitzidakis et al (2003).

This provides a sample of 1339 scholars. While this sample is obviously selected—its members had to

have sufficient individual reputations to be included in this fairly elite group of institutions—there is

presumably enough variation in reputation across the 88 departments that selectivity bias is not solely

responsible for any results we obtain. 6


5
 The minimum size of the collective whose reputation can be assigned to the individual for this purpose and is thus
not determined by that individual is not clear, and in the empirical work we experiment with various cut-offs.
6
 In the Kalaitzidakis et al (2003) rankings these 88 departments range from Harvard to the University of Arkansas--
Fayetteville in this selected group of institutions.

                                                        6
           To proxy individual reputation we develop specific representations of the general measures

outlined above. The first series of measures proxies reputation by awards received by the individual. We

first define Honored as equaling one for those sample members who received a Nobel Prize, were elected

President of the American Economic Association (AEA), named a Distinguished Fellow of the AEA or

received its Clark Medal (until 2009 awarded biennially to an economist under age 40).                  The set of

individuals who are the buyers of reputation in (1) is the Nobel Committee (with solicited advice) for the

Nobel Prize and various AEA committees for the other awards.

           The difficulty with the variable Honored is that economists are extremely stingy in providing

distinctions to each other—using this definition, an honor is received by only a tiny fraction of individuals

even in this elite sample. A more broadly received indicator of reputation is election as a Fellow of the

Econometric Society. (A description of these elections is in Hamermesh and Schmidt, 2003.) Members

of our sample account for all of the fellows who are not emeriti in American economics departments and

for nearly half of all fellows world-wide. Here the buyers of reputation comprise the set of existing

fellows.

           The second series of measures is based on the reputation of the department with which the scholar

is associated and stems from our hypothesis that the reputation-maximizing collective’s reputation forms

a lower bound of the individual’s. The first measure is the department’s ranking in Kalaitzidakis et al

(2003) (between 1, the highest, and 200, the lowest), based on publications by members of the

department. We also use the U.S. News and World Report subjective ratings of graduate programs in

economics as another proxy for reputation. The National Research Council’s (1995) subjective ratings of

faculty quality in 1993 are yet another measure of departmental reputation. All three measures allow us

to examine the determinants of the collective reputations of the institutions which chose to employ the

scholars, implicitly therefore proxying the lower bounds of each scholar’s reputation. 7 That is clearly the

case using the NRC93 ratings as measures of the reputation of people who moved into or were tenured in

those departments after1992.

7
 Most department administrators are admonished to build a better department, one that is stronger in research. Thus,
for example, one university describes the chair’s role, “The chairperson has a special obligation to build a
department strong in scholarship….” (Michigan State University, Faculty Handbook, 2.1.2.1)



                                                         7
         We create an indicator of whether a scholar moved between 1993 and 2007 among those who had

been professionally active at least since 1986, long enough to have established a reputation that might

have affected their mobility. This allows us to study mobility to examine whether its determinants are the

same as those of our proxies for reputation. Salary data for individual faculty members are difficult to

obtain (nearly impossible for private institutions), but for 43 of the 53 public institutions in our sample we

were able to acquire data from university websites and direct contacts to calculate full-time academic-year

salaries. 8 After various consistency checks on these data we were left with usable observations on the

academic-year salaries of 564 economists. 9

         The measures of quantity and the dimensions of quality all come from the Web of Science®

Social Science Citation Index, which includes articles in an immense variety of refereed and unrefereed

journals, but no books or unpublished papers. 10 Social science journals are where economists publish

most of their scholarly work and are thus the outlets in which they establish their reputations and in which

other scholars acknowledge their influence. 11 To represent Q we use the number of entries in a scholar’s

record from 1956-2007, a period that encompasses the active worklives of all members of our sample.

8
 Most of the data were for 2007-08, but where they were not we used 1.04(2007-t) to inflate salaries. One institution
only had salary data for 2004-05, while for many, particularly the University of California system, the data were for
2006-07. In some cases it was impossible to determine if the faculty member was on a 9-month appointment, and
those cases were not included in the analysis.
9
 Sixteen of the schools included here comprise the biennial survey of salaries reported for 2006-07 at
http://www.eco.utexas.edu/faculty/Hamermesh/EcSalsPublicCleaned.xls . The correlation of the average salaries
computed for each school and the averages provided there is 0.89, suggesting relatively little systematic
measurement error in our compilation of salary data.
10
  One might be concerned that excluding publications that are in science journals, and also excluding citations from
science journals, might bias our results. It is obviously true that this exclusion generates errors; but the errors are
clearly small—in a random sample of 50 observations (chosen from a consecutive section of the alphabet) the
correlation between citations in the SSCI and total citations in the SSCI, Science Citation and Arts and Humanities
Indexes together was 0.979, while that between citations to the most-cited paper from the two sources was 0.993.
One might also be worried that we count all citations, including self-citations. To examine this potential problem
we took another random sample of 50 and computed the correlation of total citations and total citations without self-
citations. The Pearsonian correlation coefficient was 0.984, while the rank correlation coefficient was 0.991. We
thus do not view this as a problem. (In any case, while it is easy to obtain total citations excluding self-citations,
obtaining q2n excluding self-citations is not feasible.)
11
 This choice seems the best among the possible ways of counting total citations and citations to individual works.
One should stress, however, that Q, and thus the publications that could be cited, excludes books and working
papers. The former exclusion is not important for most economists, and the latter exclusion matters little in a sample
of full professors. The alternative use of the SSCI would be based on authors rather than publications, but the SSCI
does not allow a convenient tabulation of a scholar’s most-cited works by this method. An alternative would be to
use Google Scholar or SCOPUS, but their methods of tabulation are less clear.



                                                          8
The dimensions of quality are represented by citations, with q1 proxied by the total citations to a scholar’s

works that are included in Q, and q2n being the numbers of citations to the scholar’s n’th most-cited work,

n=1,…, 5. 12 Obtaining information for those whose names are unique (like the authors of this paper) is

not difficult; for nearly 100 others it required direct comparisons of curricula vitae to the entries in the

SSCI and, in several cases, correspondence with individuals in the sample. 13

         The other measures account for individual characteristics that may affect the measured market

prices of the determinants of reputation because they may be correlated with Q or one of the q. We

include the year of the author’s first publication listed in the SSCI to measure the time s/he has had to

construct a reputation, always in quadratic form. The gender of the scholar may bias our measures of

quality, since some have argued (Ferber, 1986) that same-sex citation is a common practice, although

others (Hamermesh and Schmidt, 2003) fail to find any disparate outcomes in receipt of a particular

award. The author’s place in the alphabetical list in the sample may function similarly, as some (Einav

and Yariv, 2006) have shown that those whose names are earlier in the alphabet tend to be favored in

certain aspects of scholarly work. We used on-line vitae to generate a measure of whether the person

received his/her undergraduate education at an English-language university, on the grounds that migration

to the U.S. from the upper tail of the ability distribution might occur (Borjas, 1987) and might be

correlated with the quantity and quality measures. Finally, we created an indicator for anyone who had

published an article in the sub-field of theoretical econometrics. Most of the results that we present use

these controls, but including them does not alter the general conclusions of the study about the crucial

variables that can generate reputation.

IV. Descriptive Statistics

         Table 1 presents statistics describing the outcome measures that we use to proxy reputation. The

publication-based ranking (again, 1 is highest) has a mean well below the average of 200 departments,


12
  The results of Cole and Cole (1973) make it clear that concerns that citations might measure infamy rather than
fame are misplaced.
13
  One might argue that citations themselves measure reputation. That argument, however, is equivalent to stating
that labor inputs into production represent output. Given that we have various measures of reputation, it makes
sense to view the process of reputation formation as citations, an input, producing one of our proxies for reputation,
an output.

                                                          9
partly because higher-ranked departments are larger, partly because American economics departments

disproportionately comprise the higher ranks of the world-wide set of 200 institutions. The USNWR and

NRC ratings (with 5 being the maximum possible in both, and 2.5 and 0 the respective minima) indicate

similarly that the average sample member’s location is in a department that is fairly highly rated. Being

Honored by the Nobel Committee or the AEA has been attained by only 3 percent of the full professors at

these 88 departments, with honors, as we have defined them, having been received by individuals in only

18 different departments. Econometric Society Fellows comprise 21 percent of the sample and are found

in 46 of the departments.

        Table 2 contains descriptive statistics on the determinants of reputation. The first thing to notice

about these inputs is the skewness of all the quality measures—the means of both q1 and the q2n far

exceed their medians; and the maxima are huge. The quantity measure is also highly skewed, although

not nearly so much as the quality measures. In this sample 6 percent of the members are women, roughly

consistent with a recent survey (CSWEP, 2009) showing 8.5 percent females among full professors at a

small number of Ph.D.-granting institutions. Nearly one-fourth of the sample members received their

undergraduate education in a country where English is not the predominant language, and we classify 9

percent as econometricians.

        Our central focus is on the roles of quantity and various dimensions of quality in determining

reputation. If the quality measures were perfectly correlated, this would be a futile exercise. They are

not. It is the case that twelve of the twenty most heavily cited members of our sample are among the top

twenty in terms of the scholar’s most-cited single publication. Obviously, this information is barely more

than anecdotal. While the correlation of these two measures is high, 0.81, the measures are far from

perfectly collinear, suggesting there may be enough independent variation to allow us to examine the

roles of both dimensions of quality in generating reputation. The correlations between Q, the number of

items published, and q1 and q21, are much lower—0.56 for q1, 0.32 for q21. Only four of the twenty most

prolific authors are in the top twenty along either of the quality dimensions. Publishing papers represents

a different dimension of activity from total measured quality or the quality of one’s best-known work as

indicated by citation counts.

V. Estimating the Impact of Quantity and Qualities on Reputation

A. Reputation Reflected in Awards

        The first three columns of Table 3 report the results of estimating the impacts of Q, q1 and q21 on

the probability of receiving one of the rare honors available to American economists. The second three

columns present estimates of the determinants of having been elected a Fellow of the Econometric

Society. In addition to the results displayed in the table, the probits describing Honored all hold constant

for alphabetical location, location of undergraduate education, a quadratic in the year the scholar’s first

SSCI-indexed paper appeared, while the probits for election as Fellow add the indicator for female to

these. 14 Place in the alphabet never has a significant effect on receipt of one of these awards (and has no

significant effect on any of the reputational measures discussed in this Section), nor does gender. Not

surprisingly, being Honored is substantially more likely among authors whose first published paper

appeared earlier—except for the Clark Medal, these awards are usually for a lifetime of producing these

inputs into reputation.

        The results presented in Column (4) are similar to those in Column (1), as are those in Column

(5) to Column (2), and in Column (6) to Column (3). The first point to note throughout is that the number

of entries, Q, never has a significant positive impact on reputation as measured in these two ways.

Conditional on quality, having produced a lot of material adds nothing to reputation. Indeed, the effect on

Fellow is negative and significant in all three specifications. At the very least we can conclude that

quantity does not add to these proxies for academic distinction and may diminish it, conditional on the

quality of the work. 15

        There is some evidence in Table 3 that both dimensions of quality generate reputation, as proxied

by these measures, although the returns to q21, conditional on q1, are only barely statistically significant in


14
  The indicator for female is not included in these probits, because only one woman has been honored according to
this measure.
15
  One might be concerned that we measure from the stock of existing Fellows, not from the flow of newly-elected
Fellows. To do that would require obtaining information on Fellows at the time they were elected, which is difficult
but possible. Fatally, however, it would require information on those who were never elected, most of whom were
never on the Fellows ballot. While using the stock may introduce errors, there is no reason for them to be generating
biases that lead these results to mirror those for all the other measures of reputation discussed in this Section.



                                                         11
the equations for Honored, and insignificant in the equations for Fellow. There is also evidence that the

marginal payoff to additional citations in total, or to the author’s most-cited work, is diminishing: Adding

quadratic terms to these probits, as shown in Columns (2) and (5), substantially increases their ability to

predict the receipt of these awards. 16

         Also intriguing in Table 3 are the changes in the estimates that occur when we recognize that,

except for the Nobel Prize, each of the other honors is awarded to American economists on a regular

basis.   Even if Q or each measure q were smaller, some American economist would have his/her

reputation acknowledged by receipt of one of the AEA awards; and while it is not necessary, one might

imagine that current Econometric Society Fellows, of whom half are Americans, would continue to elect

many of their American peers. Columns (3) and (6) are identical to Columns (1) and (4), except that total

citations, citations to the most-cited paper and number of publications are replaced by the scholar’s rank

along each dimension. Here and throughout we treat rank as increasing, so that a positive coefficient

indicates that higher quality or quantity increases the likelihood of the outcome that reflects an enhanced

reputation. In the case of Honored the equation does not fit as well as the quadratic version, but the fit is

better than in Column (1). The ability to predict receipt of election as Fellow is, however, substantially

enhanced. 17 These results suggest that the market for reputation, at least as proxied by these awards, may

be more like a tournament than a competition in which additional quality per se increases the chance of

success (Lazear and Rosen, 1981).

B. Individual Reputation Reflected by Departmental Reputation

         In this sub-section we examine how the reputation of the economics department with which an

individual is affiliated is related to the quantity and quality measures that we believe may determine



16
  We do not use the h-index (Hirsch, 2005). (Ranking an author’s papers in descending order of their citation counts,
an author’s h-value indexes the paper that is ranked h’th in the order and that receives h citations. An h-index of
around 35 is typical for Nobel laureates in economics.) For analytical purposes this measure has the problems that it
combines quantity and quality and also fails to indicate dispersion in quality. No doubt it could be used here, but
interpreting the meaning of any measured impact would be difficult.
17
  The equations in Columns (1)-(3) were re-estimated defining the outcome to exclude receipt of the Clark Medal.
The results were very similar to those presented in the Table. Similarly, none of the conclusions here or anywhere
else in this study changes qualitatively if we estimate bivariate relationships between a reputational outcome and
each of the quality and quantity measures singly.



                                                         12
reputation. We have argued that the market for scholars makes the reputation of one’s department a

proxy for one’s own reputation and thus a reflection of the roles of quantity and quality of research in

generating reputation. In order to maintain the assumption that a department of a given reputation is

“purchasing” scholars’ attributes, we arbitrarily restrict the samples in this section to departments with at

least 10 full professors (so that presumably an individual’s reputation has only a small part in establishing

the reputation of the collective and problems of reverse causation are minimized). This reduces the

number of observations from 1339 to 1188 (and the number of departments to 66). 18

         The determinants of the scholarly reputations of the scholars (proxied by the reputations of their

departments) are presented in Table 4. Included in all the equations, but not shown in the table, are the

effects of experience, alphabetical position, being an econometrician and gender. None of the last three

came close to statistical significance in any of the estimates. Given the importance of size, the number of

full professors in a department is held constant and is unsurprisingly highly significant in increasing a

department’s reputation.

         Columns (1) and (5) present results analogous to those in Columns (1) and (4) of Table 3. We

again treat the publication ranking so that a higher number indicates a higher rank, and thus that all the

independent variables with positive (negative) coefficients indicate an improvement in the rankings. In

non-tabulated estimates younger authors (those whose first papers are more recent) are associated with

departments with higher reputational rankings. Holding this measure constant may be important and may

reflect the crucial nature of one’s first publication (Siow, 1991); but the result is at least partly an artifact

of the sample selection criterion we have used—full professors.                Those scholars who become full

professors earlier tend to be associated with schools with higher reputations. 19 This outcome may result

from higher-ranked schools having sufficient resources to buy an option by gambling on very promising

younger researchers.



18
 The crucial results in this sub-section hardly change if we restrict the sub-sample to the 940 scholars located in the
44 departments with at least 15 full professors, or if we include all 1339 observations.
19
 Dropping this measure from the regression hardly changes the results: The coefficient on q1 becomes 0.511, that on
q21 becomes 0.945, and that on Q becomes -4.882.



                                                          13
        Having been educated in an English-speaking country (for the overwhelming majority of the

sample this is the U.S.) is associated with being at an institution with a lower reputation. 20 This is similar

to the results for election as Fellow, although having been educated abroad had no impact on being

Honored by the Nobel Committee or the AEA. On the supply side these results may reflect self-selection

by potential scholars from the upper tail of ability among potential non-American graduate students

and/or faculty. On the demand side it may reflect the unwillingness of lower-ranked institutions to hire

otherwise identical foreigners, either because the school values teaching relatively more and is concerned

about language ability, or because of pure discrimination.

        As with the results on reputation reflected in awards, at the very least here too Q has no impact.

The estimates in Columns (1) and (5) of Table 4 show, however, that increases in q1 lead the scholar to be

located in a higher-ranked department. There is no extra fillip to these proxies for reputation from having

one’s scholarly recognition concentrated more heavily on one work—q21 has no effect on the USNWR

rating and an insignificant positive effect on the publication-based ranking. When we allow for non-

constant marginal returns to the quality measures, in the estimates shown in Column (2) and (6), it is clear

that there are diminishing returns to quality along both dimensions. Moreover, both linear and quadratic

terms along the overall quality dimension are statistically significant, but the quadratic in q21 only matters

for the publication-based ranking. Implicitly, the results demonstrate that higher-ranked departments are

concerned with the overall quality of publications, as measured by the author’s total recognition by other

scholars, and possibly too by the distinction of the scholar’s best-known work. They do not, however,

pay any attention to the quantity of publications.

        Unlike the results in the previous sub-section, there is no mechanical reason to expect any relation

between a scholar’s rank along some quality dimension and his/her reputation, as reflected in the

department with which s/he is affiliated. Departments and universities are, however, competing for

prestige/students/funds, so that at least to some extent one might imagine that there are tournament-like

aspects to the market for individuals’ reputations, as reflected in the ranking of their departments. To


20
  There may be a distinction between those educated on the Indian sub-continent and those educated elsewhere,
perhaps due to differential discrimination, perhaps to differential familiarity with English. We added an indicator
for Indians and Pakistanis, but its effect was tiny and statistically insignificant.

                                                        14
examine this possibility we re-estimated the basic equation, again proxying Q, q1 and q21 by the scholar’s

rank in the sample along the criteria of number of publications, total citations and citations to his/her

most-cited work. Comparing the results, presented in Column (3) and (7), to those in either of Columns

(1) and (2), or (5) and (6), it is clear that a scholar’s rank along all three dimensions has a bigger impact

on his/her reputation than do the cardinal measures. While not explicitly a tournament for reputation, the

results also suggest that the market for scholarly reputation has tournament-like characteristics along one

dimension of quality. In this formulation, however, q21 is not important—only total citations matter.

Moreover, the impact of one’s rank in Q on both proxies for reputation is significantly negative. The

reputations that their departments confer on the more prolific scholars are lower than those of less prolific

scholars whose work has achieved the same recognition.

        One might be concerned about a possible two-tier labor market in economics, with the

determination of reputation differing between public and private institutions. That argument is especially

cogent given that the top eight departments in both the publication-based rankings and the USNWR

ratings are in private institutions. There is in fact very little difference in the effects of the determinants of

the two proxies for reputation between the two types of institution. Separate estimates of Column (3) for

public (private) schools yield estimates of the effects of q1, q21 and Q as 6.264 (6.080), -7.806 (-1.237) and

-2.995 (-1.796) respectively. For Column (7) similar re-estimates yield 0.564 (1.036), -0.0105 (-0.0096)

and -0.0071 (-0.0416). Tests of equality of the estimates across the equations fail to reject the hypothesis

that the structures are the same. This similarity should not really be surprising—there is substantial

mobility between tenured positions between the two sectors, so that reputational effects are likely to be

determined at the same margins.

        We can expand the quality ranking measures to use both q21 and q22, as shown in Columns (4) and

(8) of Table 4. 21 As in Columns (3) and (7), only the scholar’s ranking in total citations has a significant

effect on the proxies for reputation. There is no evidence of a significant additional impact of either the




21
 The simple correlation between the numerical proxies for these quality measures is 0.82.



                                                        15
most- or second-most-cited paper. What matters for reputation is the overall quality of the works that an

author has produced. 22

        Relying on the formulations in Columns (3) and (7), we examine how the proxies for reputation

are affected by quantity and quality at different levels of the publication-ranking and the USNWR rating.

In other words, do their effects on reputation differ at the margin depending on the scholar’s ability to

generate reputation at different levels? Quantile regressions at the 75th percentile, the median and the 25th

percentile of the quality rankings of departments suggest that there are few differences in the effects of

the significant variables, q1 and Q, at these quantiles. The importance of total quality, and the negative

impact of quantity, pervades the distribution. The same conclusions are produced from separate least-

squares regressions on individuals in the upper and lower halves of the publication-based rankings and the

USNWR ratings. The absence of important differences at the quantiles suggests that the demand functions

for reputation may be homothetic.

        While the effects of total quality and quantity have statistically significant (in opposite directions)

effects on these proxies for reputation, the sizes of the effects are at least as important. Using the

distributions in Table 2 and the estimates in Columns (3) and (7) of Table 4, we can calculate the impacts

of changes in these measures. Taking the publication rankings, a move from the 25th to the 75th (5th to

95th) percentile of q1 increases the ranking by 42 (75). Using the USNWR ratings, the same changes

generate effects of 0.62 (1.11) on the rating. The inter-quartile change thus increases the reputational

proxies by about 2/3 of a standard deviation, while a change from the 5th to the 95th percentile would

move one’s reputation from near the middle to near the top of the range. Increases in Q significantly

reduce the reputational proxies, although the effects are smaller but still substantial: -18 (-32) in the

publication ranking, -0.15 (-0.27) in the USNWR rating.

        In Section II we argued that our estimates are tracing out the hedonic locus between scholarly

efforts that generate quantity and various dimensions of quality and the scholarly reputation that they

produce. To what extent can we interpret the estimates as reflecting the preferences of buyers of quantity



22
 The partial correlation coefficient between q1 and the vector q21 through q25 is 0. 974, making it difficult to move
beyond the estimates presented in Column (4).

                                                         16
and quality in this reputational market? This depends on the extent to which scholars (suppliers of

reputation) can substitute along the different margins of quality, and between quantity and quality. If

each produces along a (possibly personal) Leontief-type function, then the estimates that we have

presented of the market locus are structural estimates of the values that buyers attach to the determinants

of reputation, given the fixed supply along each margin. If suppliers are able to substitute along these

margins, then the failure of the market returns to be equated at all margins (the facts that overall quality

generates extra rewards and that quantity per se has no or even a negative impact) suggests either that

suppliers are unaware of the differential returns or that they cannot fully substitute at all margins. Either

way, the possible existence of some substitution by suppliers of reputation along these margins implies

that, if anything, our results understate the degree of inequality of the partial derivatives in the demand

functions RDi .

C. Using Mobility to Bound Reputation

        An additional way of examining the roles of quantity and quality in generating reputation using

schools’ reputational ratings is to study the quality of the department into which new full professors were

hired between 1993 and 2007. We assume here that the decision to hire a new full professor, either from

outside or by granting tenure to an untenured professor, reflects decision-makers’ beliefs that the person

will add to the reputation of the department (his/her reputation is at least that of the collective’s average

without him/her). Accordingly, a lower-bound measure of the individual’s reputation is the reputation of

the department some time shortly before s/he joined it

        Table 5 shows the distribution and some statistics describing the 308 sample members who

became tenured full professors at one of the 88 schools between 1993 and 2007. 40 percent were

promoted internally; of the other 60 percent, nearly one-third were hired from unranked departments,

from non-U.S. institutions or from outside academe. Of the remaining 40 percent, roughly half moved

from schools that were lower in the publication ranking than their current position.

        For the scholars in our sample who moved between schools from 1993 to 2007 or who entered

the economics labor market after 1992, we relate the 1993 NRC quality rating to the variables included in

the equations presented in Table 4. The scholarship of these 308 individuals could not have affected the


                                                     17
quality rating of the school in 1993. Thus relating the 1993 NRC rating to the individuals’ efforts is an

even cleaner measure of the impact of the quantity and quality inputs on reputation than those used in the

previous sub-section, under the maintained assumption that schools will not hire or tenure scholars who

reduce their reputations.

        The estimates are shown in Table 6.        As in all the estimates based on other measures of

departmental reputation as proxies for the lower bound on the scholar’s reputation, using rankings of the

quality and quantity inputs describes the determinants of reputation better than cardinal measures. Also

as before, there is a negative relationship between this proxy for reputation and the scholar’s ranking in

the distribution of Q. As with all the other measures that we have examined in this Section, merely

writing more papers, conditional on the overall quality of one’s work, generally reduces one’s reputation.

As the results in Columns (1)-(3) show, only q1 significantly increases what we have identified as the

lower bound of the scholar’s reputation. Moreover, as in nearly all our other efforts to describe various

proxies for reputation, the marginal effect of additional quality is diminishing; and, as before, increasing

q21 has essentially no effect on reputation.

VI. The Non-Reputational Returns to Quality and Quantity

A. The Impact on Mobility

        Assuming as we have that universities seek to maximize their reputations through the reputations

of their faculty, one would expect that we would observe the same effects of our measures of quality and

quantity on the payoffs that universities offer to attract and/or retain faculty. Thus we initially examine

the impact of these measures on the likelihood that an individual whose first publication appeared before

1987 was hired with tenure between 1993 and 2007. Of the full professors in the sample 913 presumably

could have moved with tenure to the department in which they are now located. Of those eligible for

inclusion in the sub-sample by this criterion, in 2007 20 percent were at departments different from the

one that employed them in 1992.

        In Table 7 we report the results of estimating probits describing whether one of the members of

this sub-sample moved during this fourteen-year period, as determined by the number of publications and

several dimensions of quality. That English-educated faculty members are significantly less likely to


                                                    18
move is unsurprising: The foreign-born presumably are earlier in the process of searching for a good job

and/or geographic match. As in the estimates of its effect on the various proxies for reputation, greater

general quality makes mobility more likely; and having one’s scholarly recognition concentrated on one

study has no significant impact.

        The crucial difference here is that the probability of moving is strongly positively related to the

number of publications one has generated. This result may merely reflect the fact that movers are a

doubly selected sample: While they have to meet at least the reputational median of the department that

hires them, other scholars may have at least as high a reputation but reject mobility, either because they

reject formal job offers or because it is known that they do not seek them. There are other explanations,

and we consider them in the general context of additional evidence on non-reputational outcomes.

        Of the 308 faculty who moved or were newly tenured, Table 5 showed that 181 were movers, and

of these 130 came from ranked schools. Movements up and down the quality ladder were roughly equal,

and the range of mobility was huge. The question is how the quality and quantity measures affected the

size of the change in the quality of the department with which the scholar was affiliated. We divide the

set of 130 rank-changers into those who improved by at least 10 ranks, those whose ranking changed only

marginally, and those whose ranking fell by at least 10, and present estimates of the ordered probits

describing this outcome in Column (1) of Table 8. None of the parameter estimates is statistically

significant, although Q approaches significance and is surprisingly positive.

        Additional evidence on this is provided by the probits in Columns (2) and (3), the first of which

defines an indicator equaling 1 if the person’s ranking improved by at least 10, the second of which

defines an indicator equaling 1 if his/her ranking declined by at least 10. Again no estimated parameter

on q1 or q21 is statistically significant; but the impact of Q for those whose position improved is

statistically significant and positive. As with the probability of moving, the probability of moving up is

determined chiefly not by quality but by the sheer volume of output.

B. The Impacts on Salary

        To examine more closely this apparent disconnect between the determinants of individuals’

reputations and the determinants of individuals’ non-reputational returns, we examine the salary data that


                                                    19
we collected for 2007-08 for full professors in 43 public universities. Although we only have salary data

on 42 percent of the economists comprising our sample, this group of faculty members at public

universities should be sufficiently large to allow us to explore a comparison of the impacts of Q, q1 and

q21 on salary to their impacts on reputation.

        We stress that the observations that we use in this sub-section are not a random sub-sample:

Unsurprisingly, since public universities are typically lower-ranked, the members of the sub-sample have

fewer citations in total (median of 250 compared to 310 in Table 2), fewer citations to their most-cited

paper (median of 57 compared to 71), but nearly the same number of papers (median of 22 compared to

24). 23 Moreover, we could not obtain salary information on 10 of the 53 public institutions in the sample,

and those individuals on whom we have usable salary and citations data have statistically insignificantly

lower averages of Q, q1 and q2n than those public-university faculty members on whom we do not have

salary information.

        Regressions of the logarithms of nine-month salaries against the same combinations of citations

and publications measures used in the previous sections are shown in Columns (1)-(3) of Table 9. The

usual control variables are included too, along with school fixed effects. 24 As with the reputational

measures, salaries are described better by ranks in citations in total and to top-cited papers than by raw

numbers. Thus we concentrate on the results in Column (3). As before, total citations have a significant

positive effect on salary. The effect is not small: Going from the 25th to the 75th percentile of total

citations in this sub-sample raises salary by 33 percent, and from the 5th to the 95th by 67 percent (on a

mean of $150,200).

        Unlike its impact on reputation, which for some of the proxies was positive, as in the results in

the previous sub-section there is no significant additional effect of citations to the author’s most-cited

paper—indeed, it seems to have less of an effect on salary than citations to the scholar’s other work.

23
  Indeed, the distributions of citations and numbers of publications are similar below the median, but the overall
distributions have longer right tails.
24
  While the vector of fixed effects is highly significant statistically, its inclusion changes none of the inferences
about the impacts of the citations and publication measures on salary. The results are also qualitatively nearly
identical if we replace the school fixed effects with the departmental rankings, or the departmental ratings, used in
the previous section; and the correlation of ranking (rating) with average salary is 0.80 (0.84).



                                                         20
Moreover, unlike the results on direct measures of reputation, but like that on the probability of moving

and the quality of the move, and as shown in some studies of academic salaries, Q has a positive and

statistically significant effect on salary. The effect is moderate: Going from the 25th to the 75th (5th to the

95th) percentile of Q increases salary by 6 (10) percent), but it stands in sharp contrast to the results on

reputation itself in this study. Estimates of these effects at the 25th, median and 75th percentiles (not

presented) show that the effects are quite similar at different points of the distribution of salaries.

         One might be concerned that the results on salary arise simply because the sub-sample differs

along quality dimensions from the overall sample. To examine this possibility, in Columns (4)-(6) of

Table 9 we re-estimate the equations in Columns (6) of Table 3 and (3) and (7) of Table 4, here using

only the sub-sample of public university faculty on whom we have salary data. 25 The impacts of Q and

q1 on Fellow are smaller in absolute value in this sub-sample, but they are qualitatively not that different

from those for the entire sample. The estimated impacts of the quality and quantity measures on

departmental rankings and ratings are nearly identical in this sub-sample to those in the entire sample.

Overall the results suggest that the effect of Q on an individual’s salary is at the very least quite different

from its effects on various proxies for his/her reputation. 26

         Although some of their determinants are the same, clearly reputation does not translate directly to

salary nor can they be equated (Moore et al, 2001). The contrast between the effects of Q in Column (3)

and in Columns (4)-(6) thus poses an interesting conundrum: Why should universities pay off on

something—the sheer volume of production—that, as our results demonstrate, does not raise and may

even reduce an individual’s reputation?           There are two general categories of explanation for this

remarkable difference: 1) The information available to those who determine salaries differs from that


25
 We do not use Honored here, as only 5 of the 564 observations received an honor, while 63 are Fellows.
26
  These results are not a matter of somehow different salary determination for younger and older full professors.
Re-estimating the specification in Column (3) on the large majority of the sample who received their doctorate
before 1987 hardly changes the results. Similarly, interacting experience with the quantity and quality measures adds
nothing to the estimates in Column (3). Nor are salaries lower, other things equal, as a compensating differential for
those who have better reputations: For those scholars for whom Fellow = 1, in re-estimates of Column (3) salaries
are a significant 10 percent higher, other things equal; but the qualitative impacts of Q, q1 and q21 are unchanged.
No doubt suppliers trade off honorifics for pecuniary returns in compensation packages (see Besley and Ghatak,
2008), but their honorifics are also rewarded by the market.



                                                         21
available to the demanders of reputation generally; and 2) There are unobservable factors correlated with

Q that make scholars who produce a lot of output more productive in ways that do not affect or even

lower their external reputations.

        We can test various explanations under the first general rubric. One possibility is that those who

determine salaries are unaware of citation information or do not take it into account, so that Q provides

the only signal of productivity (remember that Q and the q measures are positively correlated). As one

effort to examine this possibility, we surveyed individuals in the departments used in this sub-section,

obtaining data on whether information on recent accepted/published work, and/or recent citations, is

collected for use in determining annual salary changes. 27 We obtained responses from all 43 departments,

with the unsurprising result that all obtain information on publications; but only 8 departments, covering

126 of the 564 individuals included in the estimates in Table 9, obtain information on annual citations.

The contrast between the results on salary and reputation may therefore simply arise from most schools

ignoring citation information in salary-setting.

        If these results stem from the failure of most institutions to obtain information on citations, we

would expect to see that the number of publications affects salary determination less in those departments

that do collect citations data, while total citations and citations to the most-cited paper have greater effects

there. Adding interactions of an indicator for collecting citations data with Q, q1 and q21 to Column (3) of

Table 9, as shown in Column (1) of Table 10, we find that none of the interactions has a t-statistic above

one, and the vector of interactions is statistically insignificant. Entering each interaction term separately

does not alter the conclusion. While some schools do collect citation data when salaries are determined,

having that information available does not seem to alter the effects of the determinants of salaries.

        A related possibility is that the locus of control of salary-setting may differ across the 43

institutions, with salary-setting in departments that are part of relatively homogeneous colleges paying

less attention to Q, since other departments in the unit have similar production technologies and internal

systems of evaluation. To examine this possibility we created an indicator for those departments that are

part of large general colleges (typically called Arts and Sciences, Liberal Arts, etc.), equaling 1 for 41

percent of the observations used in the estimates in Table 9. The results of interacting this indicator with

the quality and quantity measures are shown in Column (2) of Table 10. Again, none of the interactions

has a t-statistic above one, and the entire vector is insignificant. 28

        Another explanation may be that the salaries of those who have moved into a department are

determined differently from those of stayers (although the evidence in the previous sub-section suggested

the same effects on the probability of moving that we have observed here on salaries), with the

determination of movers’ salaries being more responsive to Q and less to the quality measures. For the

reduced sample who could have moved from another institution, we interact the indicator of movement

with the quality and quantity measures, with the results presented in Column (3) of Table 10. Again none

of the individual interactions is significant, nor is the entire vector of interactions as a group. 29

        Yet another possibility under this rubric is that salary determination in larger departments, where

there is a greater likelihood that a colleague is familiar with the quality of one’s work and does not need

to rely so much on quantity as a signal, is based less heavily on Q. Interacting the number of full

professors in a department with Q and the two quality indicators, as shown in Column (4) of Table 10,

produces the same insignificant interactions as the previous three re-specifications.

         One (perhaps testable) possibility under the second rubric is that the same personality

characteristics that lead scholars to churn out many papers are correlated with other characteristics that

generate high salaries and make them more likely to move. Some of the correlations may be with

characteristics that might be viewed as desirable. For examples, those who write a lot might also be

energetic or even better teachers, might be more active departmental citizens, and/or less troublesome and


28
  One might also guess that higher-ranked schools pay more attention to total citations, which, as we showed, are the
major determinant of reputation, and less to Q. Re-estimating the equation in Column (3) of Table 9 by adding the
interactions of the department’s ranking (rating) with Q, q1 and q21 suggests that this is not the case in this
subsample. The interaction terms were insignificant individually and as a group, F(3, 550)=0.92, (F(3, 348)= 0.64).
29
  The estimates imply that, other things equal, those who had moved earned 14 percent more per year than otherwise
identical faculty who had not. This result is consistent with the Ransom’s (1993) findings on the relation between
academic salaries and job tenure.



                                                         23
more stable colleagues. Some might be viewed as undesirable—they might agitate more successfully for

salary increases, either by soliciting and receiving job offers and/or by clever negotiation with their

current employer.

        To examine this possibility, admittedly quite imperfectly, we obtained (for all but two people)

information on whether individuals in the sub-sample had ever been a department chair or a more senior

university official. Presumably being chosen for such a position indicates at least a minimal level of

organizational ability and desirable personality traits.   We interact an indicator for this proxy for

personality traits with the quantity and quality measures, with the results shown in Column (5) of Table

10. (The indicator equaled one for 24 percent of the sub-sample.) Here the interactions as a group are

statistically significant; and q1 matters relatively more than Q for those who were never administrators,

which gives some credence to this explanation for the disconnect between reputation and salary.

Nonetheless, even for those who never were administrators, Q has a positive and nearly significant effect

on salary.

        None of the testable explanations explains the conundrum very well. Some additional, non-

testable explanations combine both informational inadequacy and unobservables. Assume that entrants

into the academic market for reputation consist of two observably indistinguishable but distinct types:

Good guys, whose future papers will be cited a lot; and opportunistic guys, who devote their effort to

publishing articles that eventually generate few citations. Reputation alone cannot fully sort the good

from the opportunistic, because updating wages may not be fully possible when wages are not adjustable

downward. In the academic market a disconnect between reputation and salary will occur.              The

reputational market may have characteristics comparable to those of markets for firms’ reputations

(Tadelis,2002).

        Alternatively, assume that each supplier of reputation produces along a stochastic Leontief

production function, so that each paper has the same probability of being an important contribution, but

some are of higher quality than others. Then greater quantity, indicative of more effort (more draws from

the person’s distribution), indicates that the scholar is more likely to produce a high-quality piece of

research. Quantity itself becomes an indicator of future quality. Clearly this explanation too is not


                                                   24
testable, but it might be an additional explanation for the findings that the quantity of scholarly output per

se has negative effects on reputation but positive effects on mobility and salary.

VII. Conclusions

        We have used the careers of academic economists as a simulacrum for studying the determinants

of reputation. Reputation is a nebulous concept, and for that reason we have been compelled to find a

number of proxies for it, none of which, we admit, could possibly capture the idea fully. Our focus has

been on the relative roles of what might be characterized as the number of attempts to establish

reputation, the number of actual impressions made on those who might determine one’s reputation and the

distribution of those impressions across their number. We proxy the number of attempts by the number

of papers a scholar has published, their impressions by the number of times those published works are

cited, and their distribution by the concentration of citations on one or several published papers.

        Although the evidence is somewhat mixed, it appears that, at least in this example, simply

attempting to establish a reputation by writing more papers has no impact on a large number of proxies

for reputation and very possibly even a negative effect. It does, however, affect the likelihood that a

scholar is able to change jobs, and it also raises salaries in the sub-sample we have used. The major

determinant of reputation—what is rewarded in this particular academic reputational market—is the

interest that a scholar’s work generates among his/her peers. There is at most only weak evidence that the

concentration of impressions on a single piece of work—one article, in this case—generates additional

increases in one’s reputation. Finally, we also find evidence that this reputational market has tournament-

like aspects—one’s ranking along the dimension of overall quality appears to describe one’s reputation

better than do one’s absolute achievements along this dimension.

        The disconnect between the determinants of reputation and the determinants of salary might

merely result from a difference in goals between agents on the demand-side of reputational markets and

those university official who set salaries. Assuming, however, that the goals of universities are best

achieved by enhancing their reputation rather than by paying for characteristics that do not enhance

reputation, there may be an opportunity for university administrators to reallocate resources in salary-

setting and improve their institutions’ positions. Paying off at the margin more on reputation and less on


                                                     25
the quantity of publications would be a sensible approach. One would think that, with the recognition of

this disconnect, we would see markets working to remove these differences at the margin. 30

        While our example is obviously quite specific, the general view of a market in which various

characteristics are implicitly supplied and purchased and interact to generate reputation seems useful in a

variety of other reputational markets.       Any labor market in which the participants’ output can be

identified would appear equally amenable to studying the quantity/quality determinants of reputation. The

establishment of reputation in other academic disciplines and in the professions (attorneys and physicians

being obvious examples for which overall measures of reputation are readily accessible) can mutatis

mutandis be analyzed using essentially the same methods that we have used here; and the nature of

reputation in artistic/creative activities is similar enough to that in academic disciplines to make studying

it using approaches like the one here worth pursuing. Also, the reputations of restaurants, and perhaps

other retail outlets, might be studied in the same way. The main points are that it is useful to view the

establishment of reputation as stemming from market interactions, and that the various determinants of

reputation can be analyzed in a wide variety of real-world contexts.

  If general managers of major league baseball teams can recognize these profit opportunities, as they seem to have
(see Hakes and Sauer, 2006), one would think that department and university administrators would also be able to
do so.
