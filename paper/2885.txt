       THE EXTENT OF MEASUREMENT ERROR IN LONGITUDINAL EARNINGS DATA:
                         DO TWO WRONGS MAKE A RIGHT?


                                   ABSTRACT




        This   paper examines the properties and prevalence of measurement

   error in longitudinal earnings data. The analysis compares Current

   Population Survey data to administrative Social Security payroll tax

    records for a sample of heads of households over two years. In contrast.

   to the typically assumed properties of measurement error, the results

    indicate that errors are serially correlated over two years and

   negatively correlated with true earnings (i.e., mean reverting).

   Moreover, reported earnings are more reliable for females than males.

   Overall, the ratio of the variance of the signal to the total variance is

    .82 for men and .92 for women. These ratios fall to .65 and .81 when the

    data are specified in first-differences. The estimates suggest that

    longitudinal earnings data may be more reliable than previously believed.

    Economists have long been concerned that mismeasurement of data

leads to spurious results or obscures true economic relationships.1 This

concern has been heightened by the increased use of longitudinal data

sets. If measurement errors are uncorrelated over time, then statistical

problems caused by the mismeasurement of economic data may be greatly

exacerbated when longitudinal data are used to estimate fixed-effects or

first-differenced regressions (Griliches and Hausman, 1986). On the

other hand, if economic data are consistently misreported over time, then

first-differencing could conceivably increase the reliability of

longitudinal data. This paper examines the nature and extent of response

errors in longitudinal data on individual-reported labor earnings.

    The analysis uses a unique data set that links two consecutive March

Current Population Surveys (CPS) to employer-reported Social Security

earnings records. Data are thus available on each employee's

self-reported earnings and employer-reported earnings at two points in

time. Our maintained assumption is that Social Security payroll records

are a relatively accurate measure of true earnings. Although the results

are specific to annual earnings data reported in the CPS, they have

potentially important implications for a variety of empirical studies.

It is common for annual earnings to appear as a left-hand-side variable

error and its effects include Morgenstern (1963), Griliches (1974, 1985),

(1985), and Solon (1987).

in human capital earnings regressions, and as a right-hand—side variable

in unemployment duration models, labor supply studies, consumption

functions, and other empirical analyses. Particularly in the area of

labor supply, many researchers have come to conclude that measurement

error in earnings has a dominant impact on empirical findings (e.g.,

Altonji, 1986, Abowd and Card, 1987, and Ashenfelter, 1984) A better

understanding of the nature and magnitude of measurement error is

necessary to properly account for its influence on empirical analyses.

     The paper is organized as follows. Section one describes the data

set that we use. Section two reviews the effect that measurement errors

have on econometric analyses under a variety of assumptions, and presents

a convenient summary statistic to measure the reliability of a variable.

Section three estimates the properties of measurement error in

longitudinal earnings data. The analysis uses Social Security payroll

records as a measure of true earnings, and estimates limited dependent

variable models to account for the censoring of Social Security earnings

at the taxable maximum. In section four we address several potential

problems that might affect the robustness and representativeness of our

results.

     The main findings of the paper can be simply summarized:

Differencing CPS earnings exacerbates measurement error problems, but

even in the first-differenced data there is more news than noise. Our

estimates suggest that for men greater than 80% of the measured

cross-sectional variation in yearly earnings corresponds to true

variation, while nearly 65% of the observed variation in

first—differenced earnings is true variation. For the sample of women

these figures rise to 90% in the cross-section and 80% in
                                   —3-




first—differences. Horeover, measurement error appears to be positively

auto—correlated over two years, and negatively correlated with true

earnings. These last two findings are inconsistent with the assumptions

of classical measurement error which are typically employed in empirical

studies.

I. Data

        The CPS is a widely used source of labor market data. A stratified,

cluster sample containing about 55,000 households is surveyed every

month, and half of the households are resurveyed the following year.2

Each March the Annual Demographic Supplement to the CPS asks individuals

a question on their annual labor earnings in the previous calendar year.

If an individual is not home at the time of the survey, another household

member is asked to give a "proxy response" for that individual. The

annual earnings question is deliberately asked in the month of March

because it is hoped that individuals will be especially knowledgeable of

their income at this time of year since income tax returns are due in

April. The annual earnings concept in the CPS is meant to reflect all

wages, salary, tips and bonuses before deductions received from employ-

ment in the preceding calendar year.

        The diagram in Figure 1 outlines the steps we took to generate a

longitudinal employer-employee data set with CPS data. The starting

point was the 1978 CPS-SER Exact Match File. This file was created by a

joint project of the Census Bureau and Social Security Administration

(SSA), and contains survey responses for persons in the March 1978 CPS

Annual Demographic File linked to their respective earnings information

in    SSA administrative records. Individuals in the March    1978 CPS were

asked a supplemental question on their social security number. If the
social security number of the head of the household was not obtained in


2
   Households in the selected addresses are in the survey for four
consecutive months, not interviewed for the following eight months, and
then back in the survey for a final four months. Thus, in any given
month half of the households will be re-interviewed the following year,
and   the other half were interviewed in the previous year.

Notes:    The match between social security earnings histories and the March 1978 CPS was carried Out by the
          Census Bureau and Social Security Administration.  The authors matched the March 1977 CPS to the
          March 1978 CPS for household heads on the basis of household ID numbers and personal characteristics.
          The 1978 ELS Micro Data File containing information on the household respondent and type of interview
          was merged to the data set by the authors on the basis of unique household identifiers. Similar in-
           formation can not be matched for 1977 because of changes in the identification codes in the BLS Micro
           Data File.

the initial interview, CPS surveyors were instructed to call the

household again. Exact matches between CPS and SSA records were then

identified on the basis of the respondent's social security number, name,

age, sex, race and line number. Table 1 gives the sample size at each

step of the way for the sample of household heads. In only about half of

the cases could respondents to the CPS survey be positively linked to

their corresponding Social Security records.

     The resulting matched CPS-SER file contains a single cross-section

of responses to the tlarch CPS questions for 1978, and a time—series of

annual covered SSA earnings records for each individual from 1950 to

1978. The Social Security earnings records are taken directly from

employer-reported Form 941 quarterly payroll tax records, which are used

by the Social Security Administration to calculate OASDHI benefits and

determine insured status. Nearly 99 percent of the population we examine

is in covered employment (Alvey and Cobleigh, 1980). One important

limitation of the SSA earnings data is that earnings are censored at the

taxable maximum. The maximum was $16,500 in 1977 and $15,300 in 1976.

Although in these years relatively few women (5%) have earnings above the

Social Security earnings ceiling, nearly half of the males' earnings are

censored at the earnings maximum.

     The CPS earnings question and Social Security earnings records

closely approximate the same concept. In fact, CPS surveyors are allowed

to examine respondents' tax forms and W2 statements if they are offered

during the interview. And surveyors are explicitly instructed as to

which line of the tax form to use in filling—out the questionnaire.3 It

is   not known,   however, how often tax forms are actually referred to in
the   course of   CPS interviews.4

       To create a longitudinal data set containing employee and employer

earnings reports at two points in time, we have matched the 1977 March

CPS Annual Demographic File to the 1978 CPS-SER data set. This match is

based on each respondent's unique CPS household identification number,

age, education, sex and race. Half of the observations in the March 1977

CPS are in rotation groups that are re-interviewed in the March 1978 CPS.

Because the match between CPS and SSA records is most accurate and

complete for heads of households, we focus solely on this group. About

two-thirds of the observations in the appropriate rotation groups in the

1978 CPS could be successfully matched to the 1977 CPS.

       The 1978 and 1977 March CPS Public Use Demographic Files do not

contain information on whether earnings data are reported by individuals

directly through a self-response or by another household member in a

proxy response. Since whether an individual answered a question directly

by him or herself may influence the accuracy of the response, and since

the likelihood of self—response may differ systematically across groups

of the population (e.g. males and females), this is a potentially

important omission. However, the BLS Basic Micro-Data File, which is

used internally by the BLS, contains information on the identification of

the individual who answered the household questions. The person who

answered the household questions most likely self-responded to the

earnings question as well. We obtained the 1978 BLS Basic Micro-Data

File from the Census Bureau and merged it to the CPS-SER. Unfortunately,



   Two other widely used labor market surveyors, PSID and NLS, similarly
allow surveyors to examine tax records.
                                   —7—




because of inconsistencies in the BLS Basic Micro—Data File, comparable

information cannot be merged to the Demographic File for 1977.

Nonetheless, the additional information on the household respondent for

1978 gives some indication of the effect of self-response on the accuracy

of earnings data.

    We narrow the sample to private, nonagricultural workers with

positive CPS and Social Security earnings. Individuals who did not re-

port their earnings to CPS and were then assigned earnings via the "hot

deck" procedure are also eliminated from the sample.5 We further

eliminate from the sample workers who earned any self-employment income

during the year or were in occupations that are likely to receive tips.

Most importantly, to improve the accuracy of the Social Security earnings

data we restrict the sample to workers whose longest job during the year

was in a covered industry and occupation.6 Despite these final

restrictions, individuals who move between covered and uncovered

employment during the course of the year will have lower Social Security

earnings than true earnings. As a result, in specifications estimated in

section three we further limit the sample to employees who have only one

employer during the year. Earnings for these workers should •consist

entirely of covered earnings.




   See Lillard, Smith and Welch (1986) for a description and analysis of
the hot deck procedure used by the Census Bureau to impute incomes of
nonrespondents.

   Employees in the following occupations are eliminated from the sample
because they are not covered by the Social Security Act or because they
are likely to receive unreported tips: bartenders, busboys, waiters,
baggage porters, barbers, bootblacks, hairdressers, housekeepers,
laundresses, maids, taxicab drivers, newsboys, clergymen, religious
workers N.E.C., farmers, and agriculture and fisheries workers.

    The three-way link between the 1978 CL'S, Social Security, and 1977

CL'S, and the subsequent restrictions placed on the sample resulted in a

great deal of sample attrition (see Table 1). Since in the process of

matching observations over time and between data sources we have

eliminated from the sample individuals with inconsistent responses to the

age, sex, education or race questions, there is reason to suspect that

the final sample is biased in the direction of giving more accurate

responses than the typical employee.

     Despite the difficulty in matching the various data sets and the

imposed sample restrictions, the comparison between the means of several

key variables in the final sample and the population of privately

employed heads of households shown in Table 2 suggests that the sample

may be reasonably representative of its population.   In particular, the

mean age, education, weeks worked, and self-response rate in the final

sample and in the full March 1978 CPS are similar. On the other hand,

the average reported CL'S earnings for calendar year 1977 is 11% greater

for men and 21% greater for women in the final sample than in the full

CL'S. This difference in part reflects higher average earnings of covered

jobs than uncovered jobs, the deletion of workers with self-employment

income, and the restriction that workers in the CPS-SER sample have

positive earnings in two consecutive years.



II. Models of Measurement Error

     We assume an individual's reported earnings in natural logarithms in

year t. (CPS) equals his true log earnings (ri) plus an error


         CpSt =   r1 ÷ u.

In the case of "classical" measurement error it is assumed that          is

identically, independently distributed with E(v) =         cov(r1, v) = 0.    In

what shall be called mean reverting measurement error, we assume E(v)

0 and cov(q, v) 0]
    There are several plausible alternative measures of the accuracy of

economic data.8 First, the variance of v (at) is directly related

to the noise added to the residual variance of a cross—sectional

regression when the dependent variable contains an additive white noise

error component. If the dependent variable is specified in

first-differences and we assume that error variances are constant over

time, then the variability added to an OLS regression because of

classical measurement error is        =   2a2(l-p)   where p is the serial

correlation coefficient of V.    If   the measurement error in the dependent

variable is correlated with any of the independent variables, however,

the measurement error problem is more severe since the estimated

coefficients will be biased and inconsistent.

     Perhaps a more useful summary measure relates to the magnitude of

the attenuation bias imparted on an OLS regression coefficient because an

independent variable is measured with error. In the simplest case of a

cross-sectional bivariate regression where the independent variable

(earnings) is reported with an additive white noise error, the

proportional attenuation bias is given asymptotically by 1-X, where




   We refer to this case as "mean reverting" measurement error because as
shown below we find a negative correlation between    and
8
   See Fuller (1987) for a review of statistical models of the effect of
measurement error.

           A =
                         +




The quantity A is often referred to as the reliability of the data.

     If the independent variable is measured in first-differences and if

we assume that both true earnings and measurement error are stationary

series, then the reliability of CPSt is:

                         a2
                 2       2 (1-p)
              an+ , (1-r)

where r is the first order serial correlation in true earnings, and p is

the first order serial correlation in measurement error. If the

(positive) serial correlation in earnings exceeds the (positive) serial

correlation in measurement error, the attenuation bias will be greater in

longitudinal data than in cross-sectional data (Griliches and Hausman,

1986).

     In the more general case when cov(qt, v)           0, the simple

signal-to-total-variance formulas are no longer appropriate estimates of

the reliability of the data. It can easily be shown that a nonzero

covariance between            and v leads to the addition of covariance terms to

the numerator and denominator of the least squares attenuation bias

formula (1-A). However, the generalization of the reliability formulas

can be compactly written as



                     =   cov(CPS,
                              var(CPSt)
                                         —11—




for cross—sectional data, and as


                    =   cov(CPS,   &i)
                        var (CPS)


for first-differenced data.

       The reliability of a variable in the general case, it should be

noted, is just the slope coefficient from an OLS regression of the

correctly measured variable on the mismeasured variable.9 As a result, A

can also be interpreted as the proportion of a change in the observed

variable that translates into a change in the true, latent variable.



III. Results

       To implement the above formulas, we initially assume that Social

Security payroll records are an accurate measure of true earnings (or

that any error in Social Security earnings records is sufficiently small

that it can safely be ignored), and measure q by the log of

employer-reported Social Security earnings data denoted SSEt. We

calculate v by the formula               CPS - SSEt.   The subscript t refers to

wages in period 1 (1976) or period 2 (1977).

       If the measurement error is "classical" in the sense that


cov(flt, v) =    0, the sample of workers whose earnings fall below the
Social Security taxable maximum (K) yields a random sample of v. This

convenient result follows because selecting workers on the condition that

   <        is equivalent to sampling on an orthogonal variable. More
       Kt
generally, however, if       and Vt      are not independent, sampling on    will




   It should also be noted that these estimates of A are robust to the
presence of additive white noise measurement error in the variable used
to measure
                                     -12-




Leave us with a nonrandom sample of         We subsequently handle this

truncation problem by making the standard assumption of joint normality.

      Figure 2 presents a plot of the density of v for men who were below

the Social Security earnings limit in 1977, and Figure 3 Contains a

similar plot for women. Both plots show a symmetric, unimodal

distribution of errors. Although the distribution is bell shaped the

tails are thicker than one would expect with a normal distribution (the

standard deviation of       in each case is more than three times its

interquartile range). In addition, the plots display a large spike near

zero -- 14% of the women and 12% of the men report earnings that match

their Social Security Form 941 earnings to the exact dollar amount, and

more than 40% of male and female respondents are within 2.5 percent.

      The summary statistics given at the bottom of the figures indicate

that in these truncated samples, measurement error has approximately a

zero mean, although women have a slight tendency to under-report their

earnings. Furthermore, the magnitude of the error is substantial. The

error variance is slightly greater than .10 for men and .05 for women.

The error variance represents 27.6% of the total variance in CPS earnings

for men and 8.9% for women. Below we explore whether the seemingly

greater accuracy in earnings data for women can be explained by their

higher propensity to self-respond to the survey.

      We next turn our attention to the question of the potential biases

these errors might have on the estimation of economic relationships.

Using an error-ridden measure of earnings as a left-hand-side variable

will produce biased results only if Vt (or Vt) is correlated with a

right-hand-side regressor. Table 3 presents results of regressing V on

a   variety   of typical human capital and demographic variables. Tobit
                                      -13—




procedures are used to account for truncation of Social Security earnings

data. The results indicate, for example, that earnings of younger men

and married men tend to be under-reported.

      The magnitude of the coefficients reported in the table equals the

magnitude of the bias expected for these variables when earnings is the

dependent variable of a regression. Although the coefficients in each

Tobit are jointly statistically significant, the estimated bias for each

variable is small compared to its typical effect in an earnings equation.

The R2's implied by these equations are between .01 and .02 for men, and
                                 10
between .05 and .09 for women.        These results suggest that the

mismeasurement of earnings leads to little bias when CPS earnings are on

the left-hand-side of a regression.



Variance-Covariance Matrix of True Earnings and Measurement Error

      Next we estimate the variance-covariance matrix of        and v. This

matrix is of interest because it gives an indication of the magnitude and

covariance structure of measurement error over two years. Since Social

Security earnings reports in our data set are censored at the taxable

maximum, we must impute the latent variance-covariance matrix.         Below we

give a brief description of the limited dependent variable techniques

 that are used to account for the censoring problem. A rigorous

 derivation of our estimator is presented in the Appendix.

    The easiest way to describe our estimation procedure is as a three

step process. In the first step we estimate the parameters                                        of

the following two equation system:



                                                   +                 +
                SSE a1 + 1CPS1                         y1CPS2

                           =           +           +                 +
                SSE            a2          2CPS1       j2CPS2

where SSE is the latent, unobserved Social Security earnings record.
The equations are jointly estimated by maximum likelihood assuming a

bivariate Tobit likelihood function which allows for a covariance in the

error terms
              (a 12   ).



     Once the parameters of the system are estimated, in the second step

the following consistent formulas are used to derive the latent elements

of the CPS—SSE covariance matrix:



                                            +                        +                      +

     Finally, in the third step the resulting variance-covariance matrix

of CPS and SSE is used to derive the variance—covariance matrix of q and

v. For example, G                  =                            -                 The rest of these

        Table 4 reports the MILE imputed variance-covariance matrix of     and

      for the full sample of males. The table also reports the observed

variance—covariance matrix for the truncated sample of males who earned

less than the Social Security maximum. Table 5 contains the

corresponding estimates for the sample of female workers.

        As expected, the imputed variances of Social Security earnings

ca2     ) exceed the corresponding variances for the noncensored sample.
  Fit

Furthermore,    the first order serial correlation in Social Security

earnings increases from .635 in the noncensored subsample to .776 in the

imputed full sample for men, and from .689 to .914 for women.

        The limited dependent variable techniques were employed to allow for

a nonzero covariance between        and v. The results suggest that this

estimation technique was necessary since there are large negative

correlations between measurement error and true earnings for men,

exceeding - .40 in each year. However, for women the negative correlation

between measurement error and true earnings is quite small in absolute

magnitude. This result implies that measurement errors lead male

workers' reported earnings to regress to the mean earnings level)2

Because of the likelihood of mean reverting error, we will focus our

attention on the MILE results, although all of our qualitative conclusions

 are unchanged in the truncated sample.



     In practice, we found it more convenient to reparameterize the
 likelihood function in terms of the parameters of interest and estimate
 the variance-covariance matrix in one step. Although conceptually
 equivalent, this approach has the advantage of yielding the appropriate
 asymptotic standard errors.

     Duncan and Mathiowetz (1985) obtain similar results for a sample of
 (primarily male) workers in one production plant.

     The results strongly suggest that reporting errors in CPS earnings

are positively correlated from one year to the next. The implied

auto-correlation coefficient of    is .40 for men, and .10 for women.

This finding implies that a substantial portion of the measurement error

in CPS earnings will "cancel out" when earnings data are differenced.

Unfortunately, with only two years of data it is impossible to

distinguish an auto-regressive process in the measurement error from a

person fixed-effect or from other time-series processes.



Reliability of the Data

     We next turn to the magnitude of the attenuation bias that these

results imply. Table 6 presents maximum likelihood estimates of the

reliability coefficient (X) with and without taking account of the

covariance between    and v.13 The results for male workers are

reported for the full sample, and then for subsamples of self-respondents

(in period 2) and males who had only one employer over the year.

Unfortunately, a comparable disaggregated analysis for women is

infeasible because of the small sample size.

     First consider the cross—sectional results for the full samples.

Under the assumption of classical measurement error, the reliability of

CPS earnings data is in the low eighty percent range for men, and the low

ninety percent range for women. Allowing for mean reverting measurement

error substantially increases these estimates for men, but only slightly

for women. This is precisely the direction of the effect of mean

reverting measurement error on X that one would expect if   a2 <


13
    The reliability coefficients are just transformations of the
covariance matrix of CPS and SSE. This is described in the Appendix.
                                  —17—




     It is interesting to compare our estimate of A to that found by

Duncan and Hill (1985) in their evaluation study of the Panel Study of

Income Dynamics. Using self-reported earnings data and employer records

for the employees of one manufacturing plant, they estimate that the

signal-to-total-variance ratio (assuming classical measurement error) for

log annual earnings in 1982 is .76. The signal-to—total variance ratio

is somewhat smaller in Duncan and Hill's evaluation study than here, but

this difference may at least in part be attributable to the lower

variance of the signal inherent in studying one plant.

     The results in Table 6 further show that measurement error bias is

exacerbated by taking first differences of the CPS earnings data.

Nonetheless, the point estimates of the reliability coefficient for CPS

in the .78 to .85 range should give solace to those who feared that

little could be learned from longitudinal studies of earnings because

most of the observed changes in these panel data were due to noise. Both

the positive serial correlation and mean reversion in the errors increase

the reliability of first-differenced data relative to the case of

classical measurement error.

     To examine the effect of self versus proxy responses on the accuracy

of CPS data, we separately examine the subsample of male workers who

self-reported their earnings for the calendar year 1977 in the 1978 CPS.

 Interestingly, there is little evidence that this sample of workers has

more reliable data than the entire sample. Mellow and Sider (1983)

 similarly find that self—responded answers to a variety of CPS questions

 are not more accurate than proxy responses. This result is particularly

 relevant for comparisons between men and women because women heads of

households are far more likely to self—respond to the CPS than men (see

Table 2).

     The final subsample that we examine is the group of male workers who

were employed by a single firm in each of the two consecutive years

analyzed. We focus on this sub—sample because Social Security earnings

records are likely to be particularly accurate for these workers as they

were exclusively employed in covered employment. Interestingly, the

results show very similar estimates of the reliability of the data for

the single employer sample of workers and the full sample. This finding

suggests that possible bias in the estimates of X due to incomplete

coverage of Social Security earnings records is not an important problem.



IV. Potential Problems

        Our strategy has been to use Social Security earnings data as a

proxy for true earnings to estimate the nature and magnitude of

measurement error. It is worth asking how sensitive our conclusions are

to a variety of potential problems. We see three major ones. First,

Social Security earnings records may not be an accurate measure of

individuals' earnings. Second, the sample we use may be unrepresentative

in a number of important respects. Third, our estimates may be sensitive

to the distributional assumptions we make to account for the truncation

in Social Security earnings records. Although we believe that each of

these points has some force, we do not believe our conclusions are driven

by these potential problems. Below we consider each potential problem in

turn.
                                  —19—




a. Errors in Social Security Earnings Records

    Social Security earnings records may be inaccurate for our purposes

for a variety of reasons: Earnings records may be matched to the wrong

person; employer tax reports may be inaccurate; individuals might have

some income from uncovered or under-the-table jobs. Five factors lead us

to believe that our findings are not a direct result of measurement error

in Social Security data.

     First, we have chosen our samples to minimize errors in Social

Security data by requiring that administrative records match CPS records

on the basis of age, race, sex and Social Security numbers. Second, our

results are not qualitatively changed when we narrow the sample to males

whose only job was in covered employment over the year.

     Third, the cross-sectional estimates of measurement error implied by

our data are similar to those found by other researchers using different

data sets (e.g., Duncan and Hill, 1985, and Nellow and Sider, 1983).

Fourth, white noise measurement error in Social Security earnings would

 spuriously induce a negative covariance between    and fl. While a

 negative covariance is found for men, the corresponding covariance for

 women is virtually zero, and there is no obvious reason to suspect that

 Social Security earnings records are more accurate for women than men.

      Lastly, we should emphasize that additive white noise measurement

 error in Social Security earnings would lead the reliability statistics

 we report in the text to be either downward biased (when X equals the

 signal-to-total-variance ratio) or unbiased (when X is the slope

 coefficient from the regression of the true variable on the mismeasured

 variable).
                                        -20-




b.      RepresentativefleSS of Sample

         Of necessity, we restrict our samples to heads of households who

remained at the same address over two years, who are successfully matched

to their Social Security records, and who received earnings from covered

employment in two consecutive years. Imposing these restrictions might

generate a sample of individuals that is more reliable than the overall

population.14 While this is true, we doubt that the nature of our sample

can explain our results. As mentioned in section one, as far as

observable characteristics are concerned the sample is not very different

from the full CPS. Furthermore, many of the sample restrictions we

impose are similar to the ones imposed by other researchers in analyzing

longitudinal earnings data. Thus, the results are reasonably

representative of the kinds of samples often analyzed.



c. Normality

          We assume joint normality of CPS and SSE to estimate many of the

statistics in the paper. The spike at zero and the thick tails in the

distribution of         are indicative of non-normality. Nonetheless, there

are three reasons to believe that our conclusions are not due to this

a s S   umpt ion.
          First, when we re-estimate the models by maximum likelihood

 eliminating the spike at zero and the outliers, the conclusions are

 qualitatively unchanged. Second, our estimates are similar when we focus

 solely on the truncated sample. And most importantly, we believe that




 14
     On the other hand, we note that movers might experience relatively
 large true earnings changes. Therefore, excluding these workers may
 reduce the signal in the data.
                                     -21-




under plausible assumptions the truncated sample should give estimates of

the reliability of cross—sectional and first-differenced data that

understate the true reliability of the data. The intuition behind this

result is most easily seen when fl and V are uncorrelated. Since

truncation is based on r) and only indirectly affects v, we would expect

the truncation to reduce the variance of fl but not change the variance

of v. As a result, truncation leads the signal-to-total variance ratio

to increase.

     To examine the robustness of this result when q and V are

correlated, we performed a series of Monte Carlo simulations. In the

first case we assumed that the fl's and V's were distributed joint

normally, and in the second case we assumed that the v's represented

mixture of normals.

     Under the first assumption we generated samples of 4 random normal

                        and     with variances of .5, .5, .1 and .1
variables, fl] fl2
respectively. The samples were of size 1,000. We assumed that the fl's

and the V's were positively auto—correlated across time (p       > 0 and
                                                           flu 2
       > 0), while the fl's and v's were negatively correlated with each
  1' 2
other            < 0). We varied these correlations between .1 and .9 and
         5,fit
between -.1 and - .9 respectively.

     Under the second assumption (i.e., v distributed as a mixture of

                                                                 and
normals), we generated 6 random variables, I11 fl2, C1, C,

with variances .5, .5, .1, .1 and .01 and .01 respectively. Each sample

size was 1,000. We assumed that the fl's, the c's and the p's were all

positively correlated over time, but that the c's and the p's were both

negatively correlated with the q's. The c's and the p's were also

assumed to be positively correlated. Again, we varied the correlations
                                  -22—




from between .1 and .9 or from -.1 to -.9. From the 's and Ii's we

defined two new variables:     and V2. With equal probability, the

measurement error    was randomly set equal to either     or     while

was randomly set equal to either 2 or p2.

     In both of the above cases we calculated X's for both the full

sample and for those with fl's > 0. In all cases that X's calculated on

the full sample were closer to 1 than they were in the truncated samples.

This was true for both cross-sectional and first differenced data. We

conclude from these simulations that truncating on the fl's will typically

induce a downward bias on reliability measures. Therefore, the X's we

estimated on the truncated samples likely underestimate the reliability

of earnings data.



V. Conclusion

     This paper has estimated the properties of measurement error in

longitudinal data on earnings. Our estimates contain both good news and

bad news as far as longitudinal earnings data are concerned. The good

news first: Recent work using panel data has emphasized the fact that

differencing data can seriously exacerbate measurement error problems.

For earnings data in particular, common wisdom would seem to be that

changes are dominated by noise rather than signal. Our estimates suggest

that this view is too pessimistic. Fully 75% of the variation in the

change in earnings in CL'S data represents true earnings variation.

     The bad news is that our results suggest that the simple models that

have been used to characterize measurement error in past studies are not

appropriate. In particular, the standard (classical) assumption has been

that measurement error is pure white noise. Our results indicate,
                                     —23-




however, that measurement error in earnings data is positively

auto—correlated and negatively correlated with true earnings. A broader

range of measurement error models which allow for non—classical

measurement error might be necessary.

        The time-series properties of measurement error seem especially

important. Unfortunately, with only 2 years of data it is impossible to

distinguish a moving average process in the measurement error from an

auto-regressive process or from some other time-series process. A

valuable extension of this work, therefore, would be an examination of

the time—series properties of measurement error in a longer panel of

data.

                                           Appendix



      This appendix reviews the limited dependent variable methods we used

to calculate the variety of estimates reported in the text. First, it

should be clear that all the statistics reported in the paper -- X and

the variance-covarianCe matrix of r and                   —-   are straightforward

functions of the variance-covariance matrix of Social Security and CPS

earnings. Because of censoring problems this matrix is not directly

observable, but it can be imputed if we make distributional assumptions.

      Specifically, we assume that Social Security and CPS earnings are

distributed normally. Consider the following two equation system which

relates Social Security earnings to CPS earnings each year:


(1)         SSE = a1    +              +              +
                                CPS1       'j CPS2

(2)         SSE = a2 +      2   CPS1 +     2   CPS2 +


where SSE is the latent, unobserved Social Security earnings record.

SSE is only observed if SSEt is less than the earnings maximum (Kr).

This specification is not meant to be structural. Rather, it is used to

estimate the latent variance—covariance matrix of Social Security and CPS

earnings.

      Conditional on the CPS earnings, there are four additive components

to the log likelihood function describing this system. Each is presented

below.

      In particular, the following asymptotic formulas relate the

The variance-COvariaflce elements involving only CPS earnings are

estimated directly from the observed data.

      Once the variancecOvariaflCe matrix of Social Security and CPS

earnings has been estimated, it is straightforward to calculate the

variance-covariance matrix of '1 and v, and to calculate the various

reliability statistics. The variance-covariance matrix of SSE and CPS

may be written as follows:


                                                     +                                     +

             2                                                                    '12          r12V2         V2




       This system of equations represents a mapping                          from the

 variance—covariance matrix of q and v to the variance-covariance matrix

 of SSE and CPS. Specifically:
                                         -27-

where H is 16 x 16 matrix of l's, 0's, and -l's. H can be inverted to

solve for the variance-covariance matrix of q and v as an explicit

function of the variance-covariance matrix of SSE and CPS.

     The signal-to-noise ratios are easily calculated from the

variance-covariance matrix of q and V. The reliability statistics which

are robust to mean reverting measurement error are calculated as follows:




     cov(CPS, SSE)         and
          var(SSEt)


                                                                 -
        cov(CPS.,,SSE)                                               cov(CPS.,,SSE1)
    =          '.   '. ÷ cov(CPS1,SSE1)
                                     a
                                        - cov(CPS1,SSE2)                    '.    A



                                  +               ÷ 2 cov(CPS1,CPS2)
                      var(CPS2)       var(CPS1)


        Finally, we note that asymptotic standard errors are computed by

re—parameterizing the likelihood function in terms of the parameters of

interest using the transformations presented above. These parameters are

functions of, among other things, the variances and covariances of log

CI'S earnings. We account for the sampling variance of CPS earnings by

assuming that lOg CI'S earnings follow a joint normal distribution, and

add the joint marginal density of these earnings to the likelihood

 function.
