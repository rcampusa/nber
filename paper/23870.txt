                                           ABSTRACT

We contribute to the school-competition literature by evaluating a program that randomly
assigned private schools to underserved villages in Pakistan. Program schools were provided a
per-student subsidy to provide tuition-free primary education, with half of the treated villages
receiving a higher subsidy for female students. The program increased enrollment by 30
percentage points, and test scores by 0.63 standard deviations. The effects were similar across
genders, and across the two subsidy treatments. Program schools were of higher quality than
nearby government schools, and a structural model for the supply and demand of school inputs
indicates that program schools selected inputs similar to those of a social planner who internalizes
all the educational benefits to society.

1     Introduction

Although many countries have achieved considerable progress in increasing school enrollment in recent

decades, Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia continue to suﬀer from low student enrollment rates (UN-

ESCO, 2015a). In addition, average student learning remains dismally low in many developing countries

(UNESCO, 2014; Pritchett, 2013). In the face of these challenges, governments are increasingly resorting to

supporting private schools to more eﬃciently achieve their education aims (Patrinos, Barrera-Osorio, and
Guáqueta, 2009).

    This study evaluates, through a randomized-controlled trial, the short-term impacts of a public-private

partnership (PPP) program in Sindh province, Pakistan, called the Promoting Low-Cost Private Schooling

in Rural Sindh (PPRS) program. The program was funded by the provincial government, and designed and

administered by the Sindh Education Foundation (SEF), a semi-autonomous organization. The main, stated

program objectives were to increase access to schooling in marginalized areas, to reduce the gender disparity
in school enrollment, and to increase student learning, in a cost-eﬀective manner.

    The program oﬀered local private entrepreneurs who were qualified to participate a set of benefits to

establish and run tuition-free, coeducational primary schools in educationally underserved villages. The
benefits included a per-student subsidy, school leadership and teacher training, and teaching and learning

materials. The per-student subsidy amount was fixed at less than one-half the per-student cost for public pri-

mary and secondary education in the province. The provincial government provided SEF with full discretion

over the regulation of program schools, and program-school operators enjoyed some flexibility to decide how

to structure and run schools around the guidelines provided by SEF. The program was randomly assigned
to 200 out of 263 qualifying villages in selected districts with poor education outcomes in the province.

    An innovative aspect of the program we evaluate is that it expanded school choice in underserved villages
through the establishment of new private schools, in contrast to most evaluated PPP programs which provide

vouchers for children to enroll in existing private schools. Beginning with Friedman (1955), a large literature

has posited that greater competition in education markets would raise school productivity, potentially sub-

jecting even government schools to market discipline. The PPRS program provides a unique opportunity for

studying how the preferences of households and the incentives of school operators determine school inputs

in equilibrium, and to assess the social eﬃciency of the market-driven solution.

    Apart from presenting evidence on the impacts of publicly-funded private schools on school enrollment
and student test scores, the study examines three fundamental issues in the literature on education markets.

First, we present evidence on the test-score eﬀectiveness of such schools in comparison to nearby government

schools. Second, we show how school inputs are determined as an equilibrium outcome of the interaction of

optimizing producers and consumers. Entrepreneurs choose school inputs that maximize their profits; while


                                                      1
households demand school inputs that maximize their utility, whether directly as amenities, or for their

contribution to future labor market outcomes. A structural model is then used to disentangle the supply-

and demand-side determinants of school inputs. Third, the structural model is used to assess how closely

program-school operators come to the configuration of school inputs that would have been selected by a
social planner seeking to maximize total societal welfare.

   To address the large gender disparity in primary school enrollment in rural Sindh, 100 of the 200 program

villages were randomly assigned to a gender-diﬀerentiated subsidy scheme. Under this scheme, program

school operators in these 100 villages received a higher per-student subsidy for girls than for boys, with

the aim of more strongly incentivizing the schools to take steps to attract girls. Girls are less likely to

enroll in school than boys, especially among poor, rural, or socially disadvantaged households in many

developing countries (UNESCO, 2015b). While gender disparities in school enrollment in these countries
are often attributed to lower household demand for girls’ education, school supply factors—such as distance

and time from home to school, school infrastructural features and environmental conditions, and teacher

characteristics, attitudes, and behaviors—have also been documented to play an important role (Lloyd,
Mete, and Sathar, 2005; Burde and Linden, 2013; Adukia, 2017; Muralidharan and Prakash, 2017).

   After the random assignment was completed, SEF scaled down the original evaluation sample from 263 to

199 villages to correct for errors made in determining whether a given village qualified for the program. SEF’s

corrections were orthogonal to the assigned program status of the village. The eﬀective evaluation sample

consisted of 82 villages under the gender-uniform subsidy treatment, 79 under the gender-diﬀerentiated one,
and 38 as controls. Mean household and child characteristics, at baseline and follow-up measurement in

the 199 villages, were similar across the experimental groups. Follow-up measurement was conducted after

program schools had completed about 1.5 school years.
   The program appears to have been highly eﬀective. It increased school enrollment for children aged

6–10, the program’s stated target age group, by 30 percentage points, and that for children aged 11–17 by

12 percentage points. The program also raised total test scores by 0.63 standard deviations, and by two

standard deviations for children induced by the program to enroll in school. The gender-diﬀerentiated subsidy

treatment had similar impacts on girls’ enrollment and test scores as the gender-uniform one. Program-village

households were more likely to voice aspirations for their boys to become doctors and engineers, rather
than security personnel; and for their girls to become teachers, rather than housewives. Program-village

households also expressed desire for their boys and girls to attain higher levels of education.

   The relative eﬀectiveness of government versus private schools on student learning has been the subject of

significant interest in the education-economics literature. This literature includes growing empirical evidence

from developing countries (Angrist et al., 2002; Newhouse and Beegle, 2006; Desai et al., 2009; French and


                                                      2
Kingdon, 2010; Bold et al., 2014; Muralidharan and Sundararaman, 2015; Singh, 2015), including from

Pakistan based on cross-sectional and panel observational data (Andrabi et al., 2010, 2011; Amjad and

MacLeod, 2014). The main general concern, however, is the extent to which the estimates of private-

school eﬀectiveness are due to household selection—that is, by the types of children that enroll in private
schools—rather than actual private-school productivity.

   We contribute to the literature on private-school eﬀectiveness by comparing the test-score performance

of program schools and proximate government schools, and assessing the degree to which changes in stu-

dent composition are behind the result. We do this by comparing government-school students in program

and control villages at follow-up, which serves as our measure of potential sorting. We find that program-

school students performed better than government-school students, scoring 0.16 standard deviations higher

on the test, despite coming from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds. We also find that the composition
of government-school students remained largely unchanged in program villages. Education-production esti-

mates show that student test scores were driven by precisely those school inputs that SEF and individual

program-school operators can, and do, adjust – such as the characteristics of teachers. These inputs lie
outside the control of individual government schools, given their centralized administration by provincial

and district education oﬃcials.

   We also examine the eﬃciency of the input choices made by SEF and program-school operators vis-à-

vis the social planner’s solution, based on structural model estimations of schooling demand and education

production. Using information about household choices, we first estimate a demand model for school inputs.
We then use these estimates to bound the costs of school inputs. The intuition is that for schools which

provide a given input, the benefit must have exceeded the cost of the input, in terms of additional enrollment.

Conversely, for schools without that input, the opposite must be true. Finally, we estimate an education-
production function relating test scores to school inputs and student characteristics. We compute the optimal

set of school inputs that a social planner would have chosen, combining the input costs incurred by program-

school operators, the surplus accruing to students, and the social benefit of education.

   We find that SEF and program-school operators did remarkably well in choosing school inputs, capturing

approximately 90 percent of the total amount of possible surplus. The main diﬀerences between the program

schools’ and social planner’s solutions are that the latter requires schools to have toilets and/or drinking
water, and employs less-experienced, but more-educated, teachers. The social planner also better matches

the gender ratio of teachers with that of children in the village.

2     Pakistan and the PPRS Program

2.1     Schooling in Pakistan

School enrollment is low in Pakistan, even when compared to countries with a similar income level (Andrabi

et al., 2008). At the time the PPRS program was initiated in 2009, the primary-school net enrollment

rate (NER) for children aged 6–10 in Pakistan was 67 percent (72 percent for boys and 62 percent for

girls) (Government of Pakistan, 2009).1 In rural Sindh, where the PPRS program was implemented, the

primary-school NER was 56 percent for children aged 6–10. The gender disparity was even wider, with a

primary-school NER of 65 percent for boys and 46 percent for girls (Government of Pakistan, 2009).

    Pakistan has witnessed a dramatic growth in private schools.2 The number of private schools increased

from around 4,000 in the early 1980s to 36,000 in 2000 to 47,000 in 2005; much of the expansion in the 1990s

and 2000s occurred in villages and poorer urban neighborhoods (Andrabi, Das, and Khwaja, 2008). By
2010–11, one-fifth of children aged 6–15 in Pakistan were enrolled in private school (or one-third of students,

given the large share of unenrolled children) (Nguyen and Raju, 2015). These schools have succeeded both

in terms of cost and quality. At less than $20 in 2000, the mean annual cost of private primary school fees
represented about two percent of mean total household spending (Andrabi, Das, and Khwaja, 2008). Low

fees were enabled by few fixed costs, and low operational costs, specifically low teacher wages. Discussed in

section 3, low-cost private schools are also found to produce higher test scores than government schools in

rural Punjab province (Andrabi et al., 2010, 2011).

    However, large spatial diﬀerences exist in private-school enrollment rates across Pakistan. Thirty percent
of primary-school students were in private schools in the country, compared to only five percent in rural

Sindh in 2008–09 (Government of Sindh, 2009). Andrabi, Das, and Khwaja (2008) find that, as in the rest
of the country, private schools in rural Sindh tended to be found in larger villages with better infrastructure.

They argue that the main constraint to the further expansion of low-cost private schools is the lack of a local

supply of women with secondary education who can be hired as teachers.3
   1 The primary school net enrollment rate is defined as the number of children aged 6–10 attending school in grades 1--5

divided by the number of children aged 6–10.
   2 These schools are for-profit, fee-based, and secular. They are unregulated in practice, and do not receive any direct

government assistance.
   3 Andrabi, Das, and Khwaja (2013) find that villages with government secondary schools for girls were much more likely

to see low-cost private primary schools arise in later years. They argue that the main channel is the local supply of women
with secondary education. These women can be hired as teachers at low wages, as they face limited alternative employment
opportunities and restrictions on their geographic mobility.

2.2     Program

To address the education access, equity, and quality challenges in Sindh, the provincial government in 2007

initiated the Sindh Education Sector Reform Program (SERP), a multifaceted reform of public spending and

provision in primary and secondary education. Public-private partnerships in education, entailing public

financing and private provision, was a key component of SERP, aimed at increasing access to schooling and
the quality of education for socioeconomically disadvantaged children.

    Funded by the provincial government, the Promoting Private Schooling in Rural Sindh (PPRS) program

was designed and administered by the Sindh Education Foundation (SEF), a semi-autonomous organization

established in 1992 by the provincial government to undertake education initiatives targeting less-developed

areas and marginalized populations in Sindh province. The main, stated objectives of the PPRS program

were to increase access to schooling in marginalized areas, to reduce the gender disparity in school enrollment,

and to increase student learning, in a cost-eﬀective manner.
    The first phase of the program, which we evaluate in this study, was implemented in eight (out of, at that

time, 23) districts in the province. SEF selected the districts based on how they ranked in terms of the size of

the out-of-school child population, the gender disparity in school enrollment, and the percentage of households
located at least 15 minutes away from the nearest primary school. The eight poorest-ranked districts were

selected, excluding those that were viewed by the provincial government and SEF as experiencing heightened

law-and-order concerns.4

    Based on a budgetary assessment, SEF supported coeducational, private primary schools in 200 villages

in the selected districts. The main benefits that program-school operators received included a per-student

cash subsidy; free school leadership and teacher training; and free textbooks, other teaching and learning
materials, stationery, and bookbags.5

    Two types of monthly per-student subsidies were provided: a gender-uniform subsidy, where the school

received 350 rupees (approximately $5 in annualized 2008 US dollars) for each student; and a gender-
diﬀerentiated subsidy, where the school received 350 rupees for each male student and 450 rupees ($6.4) for

each female student. A total of 100 schools received the gender-uniform subsidy, and another 100 schools,

the gender-diﬀerentiated subsidy. All schools received the other benefits.

    The subsidy amounts were set at less than one-half of the per-student cost in public primary and sec-

ondary government schools in the province, and were not adjusted for price inflation over the evaluation
period.6 Provided on a quarterly basis, a school’s total subsidy was linked to the number of children in at-
   4 The district rankings were determined using district-representative data from the 2006–07 Pakistan Social and Living

Standards Measurement Survey (Government of Pakistan, 2007).
   5 The subsidies were transferred electronically to the bank accounts of the private entrepreneurs.
   6 Per-student costs in government schools were based on information from the provincial Education and Literacy Department’s

tendance multiplied by 1.25 to reflect an expected 20-percent student-absence rate. SEF gathered attendance

information through periodic, unannounced monitoring visits to program schools.

    Local private entrepreneurs were invited to apply to the program through an open call in newspapers, and

to propose educationally underserved villages in the selected districts to establish and operate schools. SEF
vetted the applications (ultimately, through visits to shortlisted villages) based on several criteria, including

written assent from the parents of at least 75 children of primary-school ages that they would enroll their

children in the school, should it be established; a school site in the village that was located at least 1.5

kilometers from the nearest other school; a building of suﬃcient size; and the identification of teachers with

a minimum of eight years of schooling (middle school completion), with at least two being female.7 Once

in the program, school operators would continue to receive the subsidy and other benefits, as long as they

provided free schooling to children, and provided and maintained school infrastructure and the schooling
environment consistent with SEF guidelines. SEF strictly enforced the free-schooling condition, but was

more lenient in enforcing the school infrastructural features and environmental conditions.



3     Potential mechanisms

In the basic human-capital acquisition model (Becker, 1962), households compare the present and future

costs and benefits of educating their children. School fees and transportation costs, both in terms of direct
payments and time, tend to be the largest costs of primary schooling for households. The PPRS program

reduces the cost of transportation by situating schools in underserved villages, and reduces school fees by

providing free schooling. The immediate eﬀect of these two changes should be an increase in household

demand for schooling, and, thus, higher school enrollment.

    International evidence on the eﬀects of distance from home to school on enrollment is strong, from
experimental evaluations (Burde and Linden, 2013) as well as from quasi-experimental evaluations (Foster

and Rosenzweig, 1996; Duflo, 2001; Berlinski, Galiani, and Gertler, 2009). These studies find that when
schools are introduced into underserved areas, household demand for schooling increases, often substantially.

Consistent with this evidence, Carneiro, Das, and Reis (2016) estimate household demand for alternative

primary schooling choices (private and government schools) in rural Punjab, Pakistan, and find that the

strongest determinant is distance from home to school. International evidence for the eﬀects of free schooling

on household demand for schooling is also strong, suggesting a negative association between price and
enrollment (Deininger, 2003; Barrera-Osorio, Linden, and Urquiola, 2007; Holla and Kremer, 2009; Borkum,
annual census of government schools and the provincial Finance Department’s records on recurrent budgets and expenditures
toward primary and secondary education.
   7 SEF viewed eight years of schooling as suﬃciently high that teachers would have the competency to teach primary school

content, but low enough that qualified individuals could be found locally.


                                                            6
2012; Lucas and Mbiti, 2012).

   As another supply-side element, the enrollment-related subsidy structure incentivizes program-school

operators to take measures to attract children to enroll in school. This feature is strengthened for girls in

the gender-diﬀerentiated subsidy structure, which potentially incentivizes private-school operators to take
stronger measures to draw girls, for example, through employing female teachers, providing safe transporta-

tion and a safe schooling environment, or even oﬀering a small, conditional cash transfer to girls.

   The positive eﬀects on enrollment from interventions that reduce the cost of enrolling in school con-

trast with the mixed eﬀects of the interventions on student learning, measured through test scores. For

example, early, international evidence from conditional cash-transfer programs suggests that exposure to

(more) schooling does not necessarily produce higher test scores (Fiszbein and Schady, 2009; Saavedra and

García, 2012). More recently, international evidence points to positive eﬀects on test scores, although the
results depend crucially on the specific design components of each individual program (Barham, Macours,

and Maluccio, 2013; Barrera-Osorio and Filmer, 2015). To address the challenge of raising test scores, the

program oﬀered training on school leadership and teaching, and supplied teaching and learning materials,
both free of cost. The program also supported local private entrepreneurs to establish and operate schools

(rather than SEF doing so itself). Program-school operators had greater flexibility than government schools

to determine their input mix and to account for specific local conditions of the communities and demands

from households (Hoxby, 2003; MacLeod and Urquiola, 2012), and were potentially more accountable to the

households that they served (World Bank, 2004).
   An influential literature argues for the potential gains from private schooling (Friedman, 1955; Hoxby,

2003; MacLeod and Urquiola, 2012). Evidence exists for Pakistan on the relative eﬀectiveness of private

versus government schools. Using an instrumental-variables approach, Andrabi et al. (2010) find that low-
cost private schools in rural Punjab have large, positive eﬀects on test scores and civic knowledge among

primary-school students. They attribute this to the fact that private schools adjust their inputs to meet

local conditions, whereas government schools do not. In the same setting, Andrabi et al. (2011) also examine

the eﬀects of enrollment in low-cost private schools on test scores, based on data for students who switch

from government to private schools, and vice versa. They find that students who move from government to

private schools see a large gain in test scores shortly after moving, while those who move from private to
government schools see a large decline. The estimated eﬀects from these studies may, however, be biased due

to demand-side selection into private schools by households and supply-side selection of students by schools.

These forms of selection make it diﬃcult to disentangle the eﬀect of school eﬀectiveness from that of the

composition of students in terms of ability.

   An important source of rigorous evidence on private-school eﬀectiveness comes from studies of private-


                                                      7
school voucher programs in developing countries. Based on vouchers oﬀered through lotteries to low-income,

government-school students for private secondary schooling in Colombia, Angrist et al. (2002) find positive

eﬀects of private-school enrollment on several outcomes, including grade progression and test scores. However,

these eﬀects potentially reflect both private-school eﬀectiveness and incentivized student eﬀort.8 Randomly

assigning vouchers at the village and household levels to government-school students for private primary

schooling in India, Muralidharan and Sundararaman (2015) find that private schools are highly cost-eﬀective

in raising test scores. They also find that private schools are more responsive in terms of matching what’s

taught to household demand, reallocating time away from subjects such as reading and mathematics, towards
English, Hindi, science, and social studies.9 In addition, the study did not find spillover eﬀects on government-

school students who were not assigned vouchers, nor students initially enrolled in private schools, in program

villages.
    This study is also linked to the literature on PPP programs in education (Patrinos, Barrera-Osorio,

and Guáqueta, 2009). Although these programs share many of the theoretical justifications discussed in

the private-school voucher literature (for example, private-school eﬀectiveness, market competition), they
diﬀer in important ways. Most conspicuously, PPPs enable higher-quality education for beneficiary students

through the terms of the contract between the program school and the government, with some programs

regulating school inputs (including teachers), and others selecting program schools based on measures of

quality.

    However, PPP programs can be structured such that they lose the market-based accountability mecha-
nisms at play in the private-school market. Schools under PPP programs may be less eﬀective than non-

program private schools in such cases. For example, some PPP programs require that schools oﬀer free

education, as is the case with the PPRS program. This condition cancels out the role that prices play
in informing market participants of the relative eﬃciencies of producers and the preferences of consumers

(Hayek, 1945).10 The eﬀect of PPP programs on learning then is theoretically ambiguous. Notwithstanding,

the available evidence from developing countries, including from Pakistan, generally indicates that PPP

programs have positive eﬀects on school enrollment and test scores (Kim, Alderman, and Orazem, 1999;

Alderman, Orazem, and Paterno, 2001; Alderman, Kim, and Orazem, 2003; Barrera-Osorio and Raju, 2015;

Barrera-Osorio et al., 2016).
   8 In addition to enabling private-school enrollment, the program stipulated that students would lose their vouchers if their

grades fell below a certain level.
   9 Test scores for Telugu and mathematics remained the same, despite significantly less time being spent on these topics; while

time allocated towards other topics yielded test-score improvements.
  10 Prices may, however, obscure broader problems of limited information in the education market (MacLeod and Urquiola,

2012).




                                                               8
4     Data

SEF administered a vetting survey to determine whether proposed villages qualified for the program. This

survey, which we refer to as the baseline survey, was conducted in February 2009. Following the baseline

survey, 263 villages that qualified for the program were randomly assigned to the two subsidy treatments, or

to the control group. However, after random assignment, SEF scaled down the original evaluation sample of
263 villages to 199 villages to correct for errors in determining whether a village qualified for the program.

The decisions taken by SEF were orthogonal to the assigned program status of the village. The eﬀective

evaluation sample consisted of 82 villages under the gender-uniform subsidy treatment, 79 under the gender-

diﬀerentiated one, and 38 as controls.

    Schools were established in summer 2009. Because the new school year normally commences in the

spring, program-school students had an abbreviated first school year. A follow-up survey was conducted in

April/May 2011, after the conclusion of the second school year under the program.
    The baseline survey consisted of a village survey answered by village leaders, a school survey of all schools

in the general vicinity of the village, and a household survey of 12 households randomly selected from the

list submitted by the entrepreneur of 75 households that had agreed to send their children to the proposed
program school. The household survey collected information on the household, the household head, and

on each child aged 5–9. In each village, the baseline survey also consisted of a survey of the entrepreneur

and proposed teachers, as well as physical checks by the survey interviewers of the proposed school site

and building. GPS data were collected from all schools, the proposed program-school site, and surveyed

households.
    The follow-up survey consisted of three instruments: a school survey; a household survey; and a child

survey, which included a test. The household and child surveys, and child tests, were administered at the

child’s home. The household survey was administered to households with at least one child aged 5–9. In
large villages, up to 42 randomly sampled households in the village were interviewed; in villages with fewer

than 42 households, which comprised the majority, all households in the village were interviewed. The survey

was multi-topic, and had extensive modules on past and current schooling and other activities for children

aged 5–17, answered by the household head or another primary adult household member.

    A child survey was administered to each child aged 5–9. It asked questions mainly on work activities

performed inside and outside the home, past and current schooling, and aspirations. Each child was then
administered tests on language (either Urdu or Sindhi, as preferred) and mathematics.

    The school survey gathered information from interviews of head teachers and all other teachers, and

visual checks by the survey interviewers of school infrastructural and environmental conditions. The survey



                                                        9
also collected student attendance information through a headcount, with the attendance lists used during the

household survey to verify the child’s enrollment status reported by the household. GPS data were gathered

from all surveyed households and schools.

    Table 1 reports sample sizes of the baseline and follow-up surveys, by treatment status. The baseline
survey interviewed 2,089 households and 5,556 children aged 5–9, and the follow-up survey interviewed 5,966

households and 17,720 children aged 5–17.



5    Empirical strategy

The primary outcomes of interest are child enrollment and test scores. We estimate the intention-to-treat

(ITT) based on the following specification:


                                          Yi =   0   +   1 Ti   +   2 Xi   + "ij ,                              (1)


where Yi is the outcome of interest for child i, Ti is an indicator variable indicating whether child i resides in a

village assigned a program school, and Xi is a vector of child and household controls. In other specifications,

we examine the diﬀerential impacts of the program by gender, by the two subsidy treatments, and by the

two subsidy treatments interacted with gender. Standard errors are clustered at the village level, j.
    Internal validity: The validity of our results depends upon the comparability of populations across the

experimental groups. Because the program was randomly assigned across villages, treatment status should

be orthogonal to household and child characteristics that might be correlated with the outcomes. Insofar as
this holds, it will be suﬃcient to compare outcomes across the treatment and control groups to evaluate the

impacts of the program.

    To assess comparability, we estimate the diﬀerences in mean household and child characteristics between

program and control villages, at baseline and follow-up. In table 2, columns (1) and (3) report mean charac-

teristics in control villages, at baseline and follow-up, respectively. Columns (2) and (4) report the diﬀerences

in mean characteristics between program and control villages, at baseline and follow-up, respectively.
    Diﬀerences in means in virtually all household and child characteristics between program and control

villages were small and statistically insignificant. As an exception, the percentage of girls in program villages
was slightly higher (4.2 percentage points and 3.0 percentage points at baseline and follow-up, respectively).

    Analogously structured to table 2, appendix table A1 reports the diﬀerences in mean household and child

characteristics between villages under the gender-uniform and -diﬀerentiated subsidy treatments. Diﬀerences

in mean characteristics between the two subsidy treatments were small, and always statistically insignificant.

6     Program impacts

6.1     Enrollment

School enrollment information was collected in two ways. First, the household survey respondent was asked

whether the child was enrolled during the just-concluded school term. Second, the enrollment of the child

aged 5–10 in a given school was verified using a student attendance list compiled through a headcount

conducted during the school survey.11 We discuss results based on both reported and verified enrollment

measures.

    Table 3 reports the pooled-treatment impacts on school enrollment and grade attainment. Panels A and

B report results for young children (aged 5–10) and older children (aged 11–17), respectively. Columns (1)
through (4) report impacts on reported enrollment, with diﬀerent sets of controls. Columns (5) and (6)

report impacts on verified enrollment and grade attained, respectively, with the full set of controls. Based on
the model with the full set of controls, the program increased reported enrollment among young children by

31.5 percentage points, and verified enrollment by 29.4 percentage points. In addition, the program increased

attainment by 0.4 grades.

    While older children were not the expressed target population for the program, we nonetheless find

significant increases in reported enrollment for them. The program increased reported school enrollment
among older children by 11.0 percentage points. We do not find an impact on grade attainment for these

children. The reason for this is a combination of the smaller impact on enrollment, as well as the fact that

the older children were enrolling in the grades oﬀered in program schools, which were at the primary level.


6.2     Test Scores

Test scores for children aged 5–9 are standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard

deviation in control villages. Table 4 reports the impacts of the pooled treatment on test scores. Columns (1)
through (4) report impacts, with various sets of controls. Based on the model with the full set of controls, the

program increased total test scores by 0.63 standard deviations. The impacts were similar for both subject

test scores.

    We also estimate the treatment-on-the-treated (TOT) impact of reported and verified enrollment on test

scores (reported in columns (5) and (6), respectively). For these estimates, we regress the respective enroll-
ment measure on pooled-treatment status in the first stage, and regress test scores on predicted enrollment

in the second stage. The program increased total test scores by two standard deviations among children
  11 The school surveys were conducted first, so that the school-attendance decision would not be influenced by the presence of

survey interviewers in the communities. Using the attendance sheets collected during the school survey, the survey interviewers
verified the child’s enrollment status reported by the household-survey respondent.


                                                              11
induced by the program to enroll in school. The impacts were similar for both subject test scores. The

results suggest that program schools were highly eﬀective in imparting basic numeracy and literacy skills to

students.


6.3    Diﬀerential impacts on school enrollment and test scores

We examine the impacts of the two subsidy treatments (table 5, panel A), the impacts of the pooled treatment

by gender (table 5, panel B), and the impacts of the two subsidy treatments by gender (table 6), based on

models with the full set of controls. We do not find diﬀerential impacts by subsidy treatment, by gender, or

by subsidy treatment and gender.


6.4    Aspirations

Given the impacts on school enrollment and test scores, it is unsurprising that households may have adjusted

their aspirations. In table 7, panel A reports impacts on aspirations for each child aged 5–17 conveyed by

the household, and panel B, on those conveyed by each child aged 5–9. Column (1) reports means in control
villages, and column (2) reports the diﬀerences in means between program and control villages. We also

examine gender-diﬀerential impacts on aspirations. Columns (3), (4), and (5) report regression coeﬃcients

for girls, the program, and the interaction of the two, respectively.
    Relative to their counterparts in control villages, program-village households were more likely to desire

that their boys become doctors (+5.8 percentage points) and engineers (+2.6 percentage points), and less

likely to desire that they become security personnel (-5.0 percentage points). They were also more likely to

desire that their girls become teachers (+6.5 percentage points), and less likely to desire that they become

housewives (-14.9 percentage points). Program-village households desired higher attainment for their boys

and girls (+1.5 and +1.7 years, respectively). In terms of age of marriage, program-village households had
similar preferences to control-village households, for boys and girls.

    Program-village boys were more likely to desire public sector employment (+12.2 percentage points).
Program-village children did not desire more years of education than control-village children. However,

children in both program and control villages desired more years of education than was desired by households

(11.3 years for children versus 7.4 years for households, in control villages).



7     Program cost-eﬀectiveness

SEF maintained records of all program costs under detailed accounting heads. Figure 1 depicts the dis-

tribution of program cost components in fiscal years 2008–09, 2009–10, and 2010–11. The fiscal year runs

                                                       12
from July 1 to June 30. In fiscal year 2008–09, the program was launched. However, subsidy payments to

phase-1 program schools, those under this evaluation, were only provided in the last quarter of that fiscal

year. Consequently, subsidies represented a small percentage of total program costs in fiscal year 2008–09,

while fixed costs and other variable costs such as those related to administering the first phase of entry
into the program represented large percentages. Costs in fiscal year 2010–11 are until April 2011, when the

follow-up survey was administered, but two months short of the end of the fiscal year.

   Over the evaluation period, SEF incrementally scaled up the program in phases, which aﬀected the level

and composition of costs. In fiscal year 2009–10, SEF administered a second phase of entry, with 97 schools

added to the program. By the time of the follow-up survey, SEF had provided eight subsidy payments to

phase-1 program schools. As school operators could not charge any fees, subsidy payments represented the

sole source of school revenues. Subsidy costs for phase-1 (all) program schools evolved from 30 percent (30
percent) of total costs in fiscal year 2008–09 to 67 percent (72 percent) in 2009–10 to 48 percent (73 percent)

in 2010–11.

   The scale-up of the program during the evaluation period also aﬀected how cleanly we could assign costs
to phase-1 program schools. The cost data allow us to distinguish between subsidy costs for phase-1 and

phase-2 program schools, but we could not separate out other types of costs in the same way. The cost data

for fiscal year 2010–11 include early expenses for administering a third phase of entry into the program,

which we also could not separate out. Given this, for the cost-eﬀectiveness calculation, we simply treat non-

subsidy costs to be fully assigned to phase-1 program schools. In addition, in July and August 2010, Sindh
experienced major floods, and some schools were damaged or their operations were disrupted. SEF incurred

costs helping to rehabilitate schools and restore school operations. The assignment of total non-subsidy costs

to phase-1 schools raises costs used in the cost-eﬀectiveness calculation. The natural disaster also raises costs
relative to what could be expected in more normal times. These two factors would work to bias downwards

the cost-eﬀectiveness of the program.

   All program costs are calculated in present value terms in 2011 US dollars following the method proposed

by Dhaliwal et al. (2013). SEF conducted its last unannounced monitoring activity before the follow-up

survey in February 2011. In that activity, for phase-1 program schools, SEF found 28,827 children enrolled

based on school registers, and 18,820 children in attendance based on a head count. Enrollment counts
obtained from school registers may not be reliable if, for example, the registers are not updated regularly

or schools perceive it is in their interest to inflate their enrollment counts. Assuming a 20-percent student-

absence rate in rural, remote Sindh, we estimate an enrollment of 23,525 children, which we presume to be

more accurate. Although the evaluation period runs over three fiscal years, program schools operated for

1.5 school years over the period. Depending on the year type (fiscal, school) and child (enrolled, attending),


                                                       13
the annual program cost per student ranges from a low of $77 to a high of $184.

    Program impacts on school enrollment and total test scores were 30 percent and 0.6 standard deviations,

respectively. Using the low and high values of annual cost per student, we estimate cost-eﬀectiveness values

of 16 percent to 39 percent in school enrollment and 0.3 to 0.8 standard deviations in total test scores, both
per $100 spent. Program cost-eﬀectiveness values associated with test scores appear to be at the lower end

of the range of similarly estimated cost-eﬀectiveness values for 14 education interventions reported by Evans

and Popova (2016), only superior to a conditional cash transfer program in Africa.

    Since the program impacts are measured with imprecision, following Evans and Popova (2016), we also

estimate cost-eﬀectiveness values at the lower and upper bounds of the 90-percent confidence intervals around

the impacts. At the lower bound, we estimate cost-eﬀectiveness values (associated with the alternative annual

cost per student values) of 11 percent to 27 percent in school enrollment and 0.2 to 0.5 standard deviations
in total test scores, per $100 spent. At the upper bound, we estimate cost-eﬀectiveness values of 22 percent

to 52 percent in school enrollment and 0.5 to 1.1 standard deviations in total test scores, per $100 spent.

    While the program had large impacts on school enrollment and test scores, these impacts were accompa-
nied by relatively large expenditures. Both the large impacts and expenditures are arguably due to the type

of intervention: introducing new schools. Most of the other interventions with comparable cost-eﬀectiveness

analyses—and with superior cost-eﬀectiveness results—were those introduced into (communities with) pre-

existing schools (Evans and Popova, 2016). SEF has continued to scale up the program, adding more schools

and upgrading some primary schools to middle schools (up to grade 8), which has contributed to falling
annual costs per student, as operating costs associated with such things as program administration and

teacher-training workshops are spread over increasing numbers of schools and students. However, we do not

know how program impacts have evolved in tandem with the scale-up.
    Our program cost-eﬀectiveness results only account for the costs borne by SEF which subsume all expen-

ditures made by program-school operators. The results do not include the net costs—including opportunity

costs—borne by households in choosing to send their children to program schools.



8     Program schools

8.1    Characteristics

We examine diﬀerences in mean characteristics between program and government schools, and between

program and private schools (table 8), as well as between program schools under the gender-uniform and
-diﬀerentiated subsidy treatments (appendix table A2), at follow-up. The means are estimated based on



                                                     14
student-school observations.

   In table 8, columns (1) and (4) report mean characteristics for program schools, and columns (2) and (5)

report the diﬀerences in mean characteristics between program and government schools. Columns (3) and

(6) report diﬀerences in mean characteristics between program and private schools. We find that program
schools were open 0.5 more days per week than government schools, indicating that they were generally

open six days per week. Program schools were more likely to use English as the medium of instruction

(+31.0 percentage points), and less likely to use Sindhi (-37.0 percentage points). The extent of physical

infrastructure was higher in program schools than in government schools, with more having an adequate

number of desks (+14.4 percentage points), drinking water (+30.7 percentage points), and toilets (+29.1

percentage points).

   Based on information from head teachers, we find that program schools were staﬀed with more teachers
than government schools (+1 teachers), with a larger number of teachers being female (+1.5 teachers). A

greater number of teachers at program schools had either less than five years of teaching experience (+2.5

teachers) or 5–10 years of teaching experience (+0.4 teachers), and fewer had more than 10 years of teaching
experience (-2 teachers).

   Based on information from individual teachers, we find that program-school teachers were more likely

to be female (+24.3 percentage points); they were younger (-13.6 years), and received lower monthly

salaries (-11,454 rupees). In addition, program-school teachers had fewer years of teaching experience (-

11.3 years). Program-school teachers spent a similar amount of time engaged in various classroom activities
as government-school teachers, save for an additional 0.9 hours per week testing children, and an additional

0.6 hours per week teaching small groups.

   In appendix table A2, columns (1) and (3) report the mean characteristics in program schools under the
gender-uniform subsidy treatment, and columns (2) and (4) report the diﬀerences in mean characteristics

between program schools under the gender-uniform and -diﬀerentiated subsidy treatments. We do not find

that program-school operators under the gender-diﬀerentiated subsidy treatment had structured their schools

diﬀerently from their counterparts under the gender-uniform one. The absence of diﬀerential impacts on

girls’ school enrollment and test scores across the two subsidy treatments discussed earlier is in line with the

findings here.


8.2    Quality

One reason for the program’s public-private partnership design was to take advantage of the potential private-

school eﬀect on test scores, for which evidence is found for low-cost private schools in larger, more-developed



                                                      15
villages in Pakistan (Andrabi et al., 2010, 2011). The operator had flexibility in how to structure and run

the program school around guidelines provided—but applied leniently—by SEF. To determine whether the

private-school eﬀect on test scores exists for program schools, we compare mean test scores of proximate

government (and private) schools, and program schools.
   In table 9, column (1) reports mean test scores for program schools, columns (2) and (3) report diﬀerences

in mean test scores between program schools and the indicated school type, and column (4) reports p-values

from tests of diﬀerences in mean test scores between government and private schools. Program schools scored

0.17 standard deviations higher on the total test than government schools (0.20 standard deviations higher

on the mathematics test, and 0.12 standard deviations higher on the language test). In contrast, diﬀerences

in mean test scores between program and private schools were small (about 0.01–0.02 standard deviations)

and statistically insignificant.
   These comparisons do not causally identify diﬀerences in quality between school types, as student-

composition eﬀects are likely to bias these estimates. If program schools attract students who would not

otherwise have been enrolled, and because these students come from more socioeconomically disadvantaged
backgrounds, the program-school eﬀect on test scores may be biased downwards. If, however, government-

school students are enrolling in program schools, and these students are more advantaged than other children

in the village, the program-school eﬀect may be biased upwards. Although it cannot be ruled out, we do not

find clear evidence supporting the latter possibility. Appendix table A3 reports diﬀerences in mean house-

hold and child characteristics by school type. As column (2) shows, program-school students were younger,
enrolled in a lower grade, and had first enrolled at a later age. They also had fathers who were less educated

and were more likely to be farmers, and resided in poorer-built dwellings.

   In addition, we find little evidence that program schools induced student sorting in proximate government
schools. As column (5) shows, mean characteristics of government-school students were largely similar across

control and program villages, with the exception that government-school students in program villages were

slightly older than their counterparts in control villages (and therefore in a slightly higher grade). This is

presumably because some share of the younger children who would have otherwise enrolled in government

schools absent the program selected program schools instead, skewing the age distribution slightly upwards.

   To understand the determinants of the program-school eﬀect on test scores, we estimate an education-
production function, by regressing test scores (for students in all schools) on a set of school inputs, controlling

for child characteristics. Table 10 reports estimates for total test scores; appendix table A4 reports esti-

mates for subject test scores. The results support the findings discussed above. Specifically, school inputs

significantly associated with test scores–such as the teacher’s education and teaching experience–are those

which program schools exercise greater, independent control over than government schools. This finding


                                                        16
holds even when we control for program schools in the estimations, indicating that the estimates of the

education-production function are not capturing some unobserved feature of program schools with which

they are correlated.


8.3    Eﬃciency

We assess the eﬃciency of the input choices made by SEF and program-school operators by asking whether

the social planner could have improved on the program solution, and if so, by how much and by what

mechanism. A simple model shows why SEF and program school operators (hereafter, simply the program

school operator) may have incentives that are not perfectly aligned with those of the social planner. Consider
the following model of a program-school operator deciding which school inputs to provide. As the program-

school operator is provided a subsidy based on enrollment, let child demand for the school be denoted by
q(x) > 0, where is x a vector of inputs and q 0 (x) < 0. The cost of providing the inputs is given by a positive

increasing function, c(x). The social value of providing the inputs is given by a positive increasing function,

h(x); this function captures both consumer surplus and broader societal benefits from children receiving an
education. The first-order condition for the program-school operator is:


                                                pq 0 (x)   c0 (x) = 0,                                        (2)


while the corresponding first-order condition for the social planner is:


                                           pq 0 (x)   c0 (x) + h0 (x) = 0.                                    (3)


The diﬀerence between these two first-order conditions is the inclusion of the marginal social benefit. In our
setting, that term is consumer surplus plus the social value of higher test scores. In general, the program-

school operator will fail to provide the socially optimal level of inputs because it does not capture the complete

rents generated by their provision. In contrast, the social planner will provide inputs if their marginal social

benefit exceeds their cost.

   Our exercise consists of four steps. First, we estimate a discrete choice model of household demand for

schools (referred to as “child” demand); it allows us to compute both the expected distribution of school
enrollment, which in turn determines school-operator revenues, and consumer surplus under both observed

and counterfactual school-input configurations. Second, we estimate the costs of providing school inputs
using a simple revealed preference argument; it allows us to calculate the cost of providing such input

configurations. Third, we estimate an education-production function relating student test scores to school


                                                           17
inputs; it allows us to calculate the counterfactual distribution of student test scores. Finally, we tie it

all together with a calculation of the social value of school-input configurations that accounts for surplus

accruing to students, school-operator input costs, and the broader societal value of education.

   We begin by estimating the demand for schooling by children in the villages. In turn, this allows us to
evaluate how that surplus changes with changes in school inputs. We model child demand for schools using

a standard logit random utility framework. Each child makes a single choice from a set of schools, J, where

the utility of choice j 2 J to child i is given by:


                                                uij = Xij + ✏ij ,                                           (4)


where Xij is a vector of child characteristics and school inputs,    is a vector of marginal utilities, and ✏ij

is an idiosyncratic preference shock distributed as Type I Extreme Value. We normalize the utility of not

going to school to zero.

   For the demand function estimation, we include a variety of school inputs and child characteristics shown
to be important in the education-production literature (Todd and Wolpin, 2003). Child characteristics

consist of gender, age, distance from home to the school, and interactions between the child’s gender and

school inputs. School inputs consist of toilets and/or drinking water (a single indicator variable); as well
as teacher characteristics, such as gender, teaching experience, frequency of absence from school, and time

spent teaching. We also include interactions of school inputs with an indicator variable for female students,

as a substantial body of research shows the importance of school-supply factors for girls’ enrollment and

learning – such as distance and time from home to school, school infrastructural features and environmental

conditions, and teacher characteristics and behaviors (Lloyd, Mete, and Sathar, 2005; Burde and Linden,
2013; Muralidharan and Sheth, 2016; Adukia, 2017; Muralidharan and Prakash, 2017).

   Table 11 reports the schooling-demand estimates. Column (1) reports results for a parsimonious specifi-
cation; column (4) reports those from our richest specification, which includes interactions and an indicator

variable for government schools. The coeﬃcients have the expected signs. Looking at column (4), boys

and older children were more likely to enroll in school. Children were more likely to enroll in school if it

had toilets and/or drinking water, had lower fees, was closer to their homes, had teachers who spent more

time teaching, and was not a government school. The coeﬃcient on girls’ interaction with the percentage

of teachers who were female is large and statistically significant, indicating that the enrollment decision for

girls was more sensitive to this dimension than that for boys.
   The demand estimates capture children’s willingness to pay for various school inputs. To understand the

role of program schools in producing learning, we regress student test scores on the same school inputs to


                                                       18
estimate an education-production function. Table 10 reports the results. Column (1) does not control for

school type; column (2) includes an indicator variable for government schools; and column (3) includes an

indicator variable for program schools. The key school inputs that influenced test scores were the percentage

of teachers with less than five years of teaching experience, and the percentage of teachers with post-secondary
education.

   Next, we use the demand curve to estimate bounds on school-input costs. We focus on those inputs

that are most relevant to the education-production function and that were under the control of the school

operator: provision of toilets and/or drinking water, the percentage of female teachers, percentage of more-

educated teachers, and whether teachers were frequently absent. We assume that schools will provide an

input, such as toilets and/or drinking water, if its cost did not exceed the additional revenue that it generates

through increased enrollment. Likewise, for schools that did not provide the input, the opposite must be
true. These two inequalities bound the cost of the input. This exercise requires the use of a structural model,

since we need to recalculate the expected distribution of students across schools under a counterfactual set of

inputs not observed in the data. Our demand model also corrects for the fact that in areas with competing
schools, providing an additional input may not be as profitable as in other areas.

   Table 12 presents the results. The first input is toilets and/or drinking water. Demand is apparent in

the costs incurred in providing the input. The next four inputs change the composition of teachers at the

school. The first estimate reflects the cost of replacing a male teacher with a female teacher. Male students

reacted negatively to the presence of a female teacher, while the opposite was true for female students. In
combination with the number of boys and girls in each village, the sum of these forces implies that enrollment

was lower when program schools substituted a female teacher for a male teacher. This, in turn, implies that

female teachers must have been less costly than their male counterparts. Evidence for Pakistan is consistent
with this finding. Andrabi, Das, and Khwaja (2008) find that female teachers in private schools earn 33-

percent less than their male counterparts, after controlling for other characteristics. As might be expected,

we also find that adding a teacher with post-secondary education was costly compared to adding one who

was less educated, as was adding a teacher who was frequently absent; and adding a teacher with less than

five years of teaching experience was less costly compared to adding one with more experience.

   Combining these pieces allows us to address a key question: are program-school operators providing
inputs that maximize child outcomes? To answer this question, we first parameterize the social welfare

function:

                                        W (x) = CV (x)        T C(x) + ⌧ g(x),                                 (5)

                 PN
where CV (x) =     i=1   CVi (x) is the sum of the consumer surplus over all children in the village, T C(x) is the



                                                         19
(total) cost incurred in providing inputs and subsidies, and ⌧ g(x) is the social value of higher test scores.12

We assume that the social value of education is related to overall test scores, given by g(x), and a scalar

multiplier, ⌧ .

    The logit model provides a basis for computing the consumer welfare generated by the school. Following

Small and Rosen (1981), the compensating variation of choice set under the logit model is:

                                                                P
                                                     ( + ln exp (      ij (x)))
                                             CVi =                                ,                                       (6)
                                                               ↵

where      ij (x)   is the deterministic component of utility of student i choosing school j, ↵ is the disutility of

school fees, and         is Euler’s constant. Our estimates above give the cost of each input, x.

    The last component of our welfare analysis is the social benefits of education that are not internalized
in the demand function. Since we do not know exactly the social benefits of education, we choose to

parameterize the social benefit function as h(x) = ⌧ g(x), where g(x) is the estimated education production

function. This specification assumes that the social benefits of education are only a function of test scores,
and ⌧ captures the marginal (social) utility of higher test scores. This approach allows us to: first, solve the

social planner’s solution, as total benefits of providing inputs can be consistently compared with their costs;

second, show how the social planner’s solution to providing inputs changes with ⌧ , a parameter for which

we do not have measurements; and, third, compute the eﬃciency of the observed allocation relative to what

the social planner would have done.
    The costs incurred in providing education are twofold. First, there is the direct cost of the inputs provided

by program-school operators. Second, there is a deadweight loss due to the taxes necessary for providing

subsidies to program-school operators.13 To estimate the latter, we assume a deadweight loss of 30 percent,

and multiply this by the total annual subsidy, which is a fixed per-student amount of 4,200 rupees per

year under the gender-uniform subsidy treatment, which rises to 5,400 rupees per year for girls under the

gender-diﬀerentiated one.

    We define the social value of education as the product of the student’s annual adult income and a social

externality multiplier. To estimate the eﬀect of education on labor earnings, based on estimates for Pakistan

by Montenegro and Patrinos (2014), we fix upper- and lower-bound wage gains from an additional year

of education at 10.8 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively. In addition, Bau and Das (2017) find that an
additional year of education in rural Punjab, Pakistan is associated with a test-score gain of 0.4 standard

deviations. Combining these two findings, we assume a test-score gain of 0.4 standard deviations to be
  12 The  profit of the program-school operator has been omitted from the social welfare function, as the income earned by the
operator is a transfer. Though in this case the funds came from international donors, we compute the social planner’s solution
treating these funds as if they had been raised from domestic sources.

equivalent to an additional year of education, and, therefore, to produce wage gains of 10.8 percent and

6.8 percent at the upper and lower bounds, respectively. The wage gain is calculated as a function of the

baseline wage and the labor force participation rate:

                                           zscore(test)
                 4wagegb = blwageg ⇥ (                  ) ⇥ percent4wageb ⇥ participationrateg ,                   (7)
                                               0.40

where the subscript g indicates the gender of the child, and b the upper and lower bound estimates of wage

gains. In rural Sindh, the baseline monthly wage (blwage) for men aged 15–34 is 6,600 rupees, and that

for women in the same age group is 2,000 rupees; and labor force participation rates for the two are 80

percent and 36 percent, respectively.14 We inflate the term with the multiplier above to account for social

externalities.

   For each program school in our sample, we solve the following social planner’s problem:


                                                     maxW (x).                                                     (8)
                                                       x



This problem is non-convex, due to the presence of discrete variables. We solve this problem by exhaustively
computing all outcomes for all possible school-input configurations. This is computationally feasible since,

by construction, there is only one program school in each village, and our structural model allows us to solve

for enrollment, test scores, and costs for every possible input configuration in program schools. We assume

that the inputs of other schools remained constant as the program school’s inputs adjusted. We think this

is reasonable, as the primary competition for most program schools were government schools, which were
centrally regulated by provincial and district education administrations, and did not adjust inputs across

program and control villages.
   Table 13 reports the levels and changes in school inputs across the solutions oﬀered by program-school

operators and the social planner. Program-school operators have proven remarkably successful at establishing

and operating schools that generated most of the possible surplus in the environment. Assuming a social

value of education equal to one, the social planner’s solution generates gains of slightly less than 10 percent

relative to that of program-school operators. Large variation exists across villages, from a lower bound of a

zero-percent increase (i.e., the program-school operator selected the same set of school inputs as the social

planner would have) to an upper bound of a 33-percent increase. The social planner achieves these gains
through various changes to program schools. First, under the social planner, all program schools have toilets

and/or drinking water (+10 percentage points relative to the program-school operator solution). The social
 14 Estimates are based on data from the 2010–11 Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement Survey (Government of

Pakistan, 2011).



                                                           21
planner employs teachers with post-secondary education only (+52 percentage points), and with less than

five years of teaching experience (+16 percentage points); and requires all teachers to be absent fewer than

two days per month (-37 percentage points). The composition of female teachers is relatively unchanged,

the social planner employing 47 percent female teachers (-3 percentage points), with substantial variation
across villages. Diﬀerences are driven by the gender composition of the child population. Specifically, in

villages with a relatively large number of boys, enrollment, and consequently, test scores, will suﬀer if the

school employs female teachers, while the opposite is true in villages with a relatively large number of girls.

   To understand why the social planner chooses these inputs, table 13 also reports the changes in consumer

surplus, enrollment, input costs, and test scores. On average, the social planner chooses inputs that lower

costs. While total costs decrease, test scores increase dramatically. This results from higher school enroll-

ment under the social planner, averaging 48 more students; and from higher test scores resulting from the
interactions among teachers, other school inputs, and students. The better match quality between students

and schools is reflected in the gains to consumer surplus, which are large and uniformly positive across all

villages. Finally, higher test scores have substantial income eﬀects, which translate into higher social welfare.
   One of the key parameters in our social planner solution is the social value of education. This parameter

does not come from any empirical or model-based foundation. Therefore, we are interested in understanding

how robust our results are when we vary the social value of education. In table 13, columns (3) through (6)

report the results when the social planner places weights of 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 2, respectively, on test scores.

The optimal education and teaching experience of teachers are invariant to the social value of education.
In contrast, the optimal provision of toilets and/or drinking water falls, while the optimal levels of teacher

absence and percentage of teachers who are female increase, as the social value of education falls to zero.

Interestingly, the program configuration generates a social surplus closest to that achieved by the social
planner when a weight of one is assigned by the latter to the social value of education.

   Two aspects of the above calculations deserve emphasis. First, because men have higher labor force

participation and labor earnings than women, factors improving enrollment and test scores for boys are

given greater weight than those that raise them for girls. This can be seen with respect to female teachers,

where increases in the social return to education lead to a decline in the optimal percentage of female

teachers, which is driven by the lower preference for female teachers by boys. Because the model being used
is static, it does not account for the possibility that female labor earnings and labor force participation may

increase over time, potentially due to the very increases in enrollment and test scores found in this study.

Second, the social planner’s solution is village-specific. This means that, while the statistics given in table

13 ostensibly indicate that program-school operators have provided inputs similar to those arrived at in the

social planner’s solution, the similarity in mean inputs does not necessarily imply that the village-specific


                                                       22
solutions are similarly close.



9    Conclusion

The program evaluated in this study has proven remarkably eﬀective in increasing school enrollment and

test scores, measured after 1.5 school years. Introduced into educationally underserved villages, the program

increased school enrollment by 30 percentage points, and total test scores by 0.63 standard deviations. For

children induced by the program to enroll in school, the impact on total test scores was two standard

deviations. Program impacts on school enrollment and test scores did not diﬀer by gender, or by the subsidy
treatment. We do not find that the gender-diﬀerentiated subsidy treatment had larger impacts on girls’

enrollment or test scores than the gender-uniform one. Program-village households were more likely to

express aspirations that their boys become doctors and engineers, rather than security personnel; and that

their girls become teachers, rather than housewives. Program-village households also voiced a desire for their

boys and girls to attain higher levels of education.

    The study also assesses the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of program schools. Consistent with existing
evidence for Pakistan from larger, more-developed villages, we find that program-school students had higher

test scores than government-school students, despite coming from more socioeconomically disadvantaged

households. While program-school operators only captured profits through enrollment, the equilibrium
social surplus is within 10 percentage points of the social planner. Compared to program-school operators,

the social planner adjusts the gender ratio of teachers to better match the gender ratio of children in the

village, ensures toilets and/or drinking water in the school, and hires less-experienced, but more-educated,

teachers. It is remarkable and reassuring that program-school operators have proven so successful in selecting

the most-essential inputs for their schools. The results suggest that, when the government provides adequate
support, enormous potential exists for local actors to find appropriate solutions to their challenges.

Note: This table reports education production estimates, relating standardized subject test scores to school inputs and student
characteristics, controlling for district fixed eﬀects. Columns (1) through (3) report estimates for language test scores, and
columns (4) through (6), estimates for mathematics test scores. Columns (1) and (4) report estimates without indicator variables
for program or government schools; columns (2) and (5) with an indicator variable for government schools, and columns (3)
and (6) with an indicator variable for program schools. Standard errors, reported in parentheses, are clustered at the village
level. *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the ten-, five-, and one-percent levels, respectively.
