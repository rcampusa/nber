                  Smuggler's Blues at the Central Bank:

                           Lessons from Sudan




                                ABSTRACT



     The ineffectiveness of real devaluation as stabilization policy does
not imply that the nominal exchange rate should be held constant in the
face of a domestic inflation. tn this circumstance, import duties and
export subsidies would have to be escalated to counter the potential
erosion of the trade balance. This escalation of trade barriers
generates a rising black market premium and offers increasing incentives
to smuggling, already a pervasive problem in the African countries. As a
consequence, the central bank would find it more and more difficult to
hold the nominal exchange rate constant. This leads us to consider a
passive exchange rate policy of stabilizing the real exchange rate by
moving the nominal rate in line with domestic inflation.

     If such passive policy is not accompanied by the elimination of
trade barriers, however, the black market premium will not disappear.
Unless exchange rate policy and trade policy are consistent with each
other, the smuggler's blues will reach the central bank. Indeed, this is
not just a theoretical possibility, it is the major lesson from the
recent experience of Sudan.

I.   Introduction: Real Devaluation and the Trade Balance

     The usual analysis of the effects of real devaluation on trade flows

assumes a high degree of substitutability among final goods in corisuinp—

tion and among uses of inputs in production. Thus the typical analysis

assumes that all goods are final goods with domestic production of

import-competing goods and domestic consumption of exportables. A real

devaluation, by reducing the relative price of domestic output, encourag-

es substitution from imports to home goods in consumption, and from pro-

duction for the home market to production for export. This high degree

of substitutability is usually reflected in an assumption that import

demand and export supply both have high elasticities with respect to the

real exchange rate. The result is a presumption that real devaluation

will improve the trade balance.

     The structure of trade in same developing countries, especially in

sub-Saharan Africa, suggests a different analysis and result, however.

This was previously argued by Branson (1985) in the case of Kenya, and is

also applicable in Sudan. These countries have as a high proportion of

their imports intermediate inputs (such as oil) and capital equipment.

In Sudan, this proportion is approximately 80%. These are inputs into a

production structure that is to some degree rigidified by the existing

capital stock, reducing the short-run price elasticity of demand for

imports. These countries' exports are dominated by agricultural output

whose supply is inelastic in the shortrun. In both Kenya and Sudan, 90%

of exports are agricultural goods.

     With inelastic import demand and export supply, a real devaluation

will tend to expand export revenues and import receipts proportionately

to their initial values in home currency, while leaving them unchanged in
                                   -3-




foreign exchange. If the trade balance is initially in deficit, the real

devaluation may increase the deficit in home currency, deflating domestic

demand, with little gain in foreign exchange. This makes real devalua-

tion potentially counterproductive as part of a stabilization program.

     This ineffectiveness of real devaluation as stabilization policy

does not imply that the nominal exchange rate should be held constant in

the face of a domestic inflation, however. In this circumstance, import

duties and export subsidies would have to be escalated to counter the

potential erosion of the trade balance. This escalation of trade barri-

ers generates a rising black market premium and offers increasing

incentives to smuggling, already a pervasive problem in the African

countries. As a consequence, the central bank would find it more and

more difficult to hold the nominal exchange rate constant. This leads us

to consider a passive exchange rate policy of stabilizing the real

exchange rate by moving the nominal rate in line with domestic inflation.

     If such passive policy is not accompanied by the elimination of

trade barriers, however, the black market premium will not disappear.

Unless exchange rate policy and trade policy are consistent with each

other, the smuggler's blues will reach the central bank. Indeed, this is

not just a theoretical possibility, it is the major lesson from the

recent experience of Sudan.

    The following section presents a basic model of the trade balance.

In this context, we show the consequences of rigidity in import demand

and export supply. We note as a by-product that wage indexation can

introduce a rigidity that replicates the results with inelastic export

supply and import demand.
                                   -4-




     Sections III and IV of the paper analyze the interaction of trade

barriers, smuggling and the black market premium. We first introduce

domestic inflation and trade barriers, to show the necessary escalation

of the latter to maintain the trade balance with a fixed nominal exchange

rate. We then show the effect of smuggling on legal as well as total

trade, and relate the rate of increase in the black market premium to the

rate of escalation of trade barriers. With a passive exchange rate

policy and a constant level of trade barriers, the black market premium

will be constant. We finally introduce capital account considerations,

showing they exacerbate the rise in the premium if the unreported trade

balance is in surplus, and conversely.

     Section V applies the analysis to recent policy in Sudan.

II. Devaluation in the "Rigid" Economy

      In this section we layout a simple model of export and import supply

and demand that illustrates the problems of the "rigid" economy. The

model is essentially the same as the one sketched in Branson (1972) and

developed in Branson and Katseli (1982). The duality with wage

indexation can also be easily demonstrated in this framework.

      Export supply and demand can be described by the following two

log-linear equations, normalized on the home-currency price of exports p

for supply and the foreign-exchange price q for demand.




(1)   Supply:     ln     =   ln p + s —1 in            X
                                                        S




                                        -l         d
(2) Demand:       ln q =   ln    q - d      ln X



Here X is the quantity of exports, p is the cost of production of home

goods, and q is the cost of foreign substitutes for our exports. We can

interpret p as the opportunity cost of exports in the home economy;

later we will identify the rate of growth of p as the domestic inflation

rate. Foreign inflation would be interpreted as growth in q. Stating

export supply in terms of the home currency price reflects the assumption

that costs of producing exports are given in home currency. Stating

demand in terms of the foreign exchange price reflects the assumption

that exports compete with foreign goods in demand.

      Supply and demand in the export market are brought together by the

exchange rate as "translator" between                  and q:



(3)    Translator: in        =   in   e +   in q.
                                                -6-




      The exchange rate is stated in terms of units of home currency per

 unit of foreign exchange: an increase in e is a devaluation of the home

 currency.

      The export supply and demand model of equations (l)-(3) can be used

 to track movements of export price and quantity as functions of the

 domestic inflation rate p, the foreign inflation rate q, and changes in

nominal exchange rate .        Total    differentiation of equations (1) -           (3)
gives the solutions for            and X.




(4)     x k Ce + q) + (1 - k) p             ;     Export price.



(5)     X = ks     Ce + q -   p)    ;             Export quantity.



Here the parameter k      d lCd ÷ s) > 0. The movement in the home-

currency price of exports is a weighted average of foreign influences

(e + q) and home influences p .          Alternatively,      the relative price of

exports in terms of home goods p/p is proportional to the real exchange
rate E =   eq/p,   and the same is true of the quantity of exports. If the

economy is "small" in the export market, dx -               and k -    1   also, so that

there are no home influences on relative prices and X =               sE.
      If we impose the "rigid" economy assumption that Sx =                0,   export

revenue is fixed in foreign exchange. In home currency, export revenue

moves proportionately to the change in e, with p and q constant:




(6)
                                                 —7—




       The duality result with domestic wage indexation can be obtained by

assuming that p = e + q with devaluation. This would be the result if

non-traded goods prices were a mark-up over wages, and wages are indexed

to the CPI. See Branson (1985) for the derivation. With p = e + q

from equations (4) and (5) we obtain again the result in equation (6).

This is the duality between wage indexation as commonly practiced in

Western Europe and the rigidity of s =                 0,   which may be more relevant in

Africa.

       We can re-interpret the duality result in a scenario of an on-going

domestic inflation with p =           the   rate of growth of domestic money. If

the economy is rigid, there is no fall in export quantity. However, the

profit squeeze that follows from the fall in p/p indicates that in the

long run resources will exit the export-producing sector.

       The "passivet' exchange rate policy sets e                  p = the   money

growth rate, with q assumed to be zero. This holds the quantity X con-

stant with e = p     in equation (5). The home-currency price of exports
                                                                         = e =
      rises at the same rate as p; from (4) with k = 1,
                                                                                 p.
This holds p/p constant, preventing the profit squeeze in the

export sector. The result is that the passive exchange-rate policy with

e = p     "insulates" the exportable sector from the domestic inflation.

       The analysis for imports follows by analogy, except that the

relevant rigidity is on the demand side. Import demand and supply are

given by


                                            -1       d
(7) Demand:        ln p =       in p -      d    in M



(8)     Supply: in     =   ln   q +   S—1in NS
                                          -8-




 Here p represents competition from import-competing home goods, and q

 represents foreign costs of production of imports. The small-country

 assumption sets S =   , whereas,    in the "rigid" economy, d = 0.   The
 translator between p and q gives us the third equation,



 (9) Translator: in p         in e + in
                                          q.


      The solutions for changes in import price and quantity m and M are

 obtained from total differentiation of equations (7) -   (9).   They are:

 (10) ;m =   k(e   + q) + (i_k);n



 (11) M =   - kd(e   + q -   p),

where k'     s/(s+d). The formal analogy to the export solutions is
obvious. In the small country, k' - 1 as Sm -    . In   the "rigid"
economy, d = 0 and k' = 1 also. Thus the rise in import payments is

equal to the devaluation. The same result can be obtained by again

imposing p = e in equations (10) and (11).

     The duality result can be obtained by again imposing   p =   e

in equations (10) and (11). As in the export case, this result can be

reinterpreted to study the effects of a passive exchange-rate policy in

the face of domestic inflation. With an infinitely-elastic supply of

imports, the rise in domestic costs relative to import prices,
                                                                  n'm'
squeezes profits in the import-competing sectors. If the economy is

"rigid," there is no increase in the quantity of imports in the short

run. But the profit squeeze in the import-competing sector, to the

extent it exists, would augur a longer-run rise in imports.
                                         -9—




       A passive policy that sets e =
                                         p     releases this pressure.

The home—currency import price p rises at the same rate as

       from (10) with k = p e =          p.    This holds p/p constant,

eliminating the profit squeeze in the import-competing industries, actual

or potential.

       Combining the equations for import payments and for export receipts,

both in terms of home currency, we see that in the "rigid" economy they

increase in proportion to the change in the exchange rate. This means

that the increase in import payments exceeds that in export receipts if

the trade balance showed a deficit at the time of devaluation. So in the

"rigid" economy, real devaluation may be counter-productive. However,

the passive policy would hold a balanced trade position in the face of a

domestic inflation, with the quantities of exports and imports constant:



(12)       p +   X =        + N =   =e    ; devaluation in the "rigid" economy.
                       ;m


Here, there is no movement in the foreign-exchange trade balance,

regardless of the initial condition: the passive policy insulates the

trade balance from the domestic inflation. This may be about the best we

can expect exchange-rate policy to do in a "rigid" economy.

111. Fixed Exchange Rates and Trade Barriers

       An alternative to the passive policy of moving the exchange rate

with domestic inflation is to hold the nominal exchange rate constant and

use escalating trade barriers to offset the effect on trade quantities.

The basic idea is that rising import duties and export subsidies could

offset the effects on resource allocation from the increasing divergence

between non-traded goods prices and export and import prices.

       The model of export supply and demand is modified by introduction of

a subsidy on top of the export price received by the seller. We

illustrate the case with ad valorem subsidy at rate s that multiplies the

export price      by a subsidy factor a =          1   +   s.   Thus the price actually

r-ceived by exporters is ap,        , and   export supply becomes:



(13)       in        in a =   in n +

       Equilibrium    in the export market is shown in Figure 1. The demand

curve is equation (2) of section II in non-log, or exponential, form.

The underlying supply curve, the one without a a term, is equation (1).

The subsidy factor a      shifts   this supply curve down to give the

equilibrium intersection at E0. This shows a higher export volume and a

combination of a lower price paid by the buyer abroad and higher price

inclusive of the subsidy received by the home producer

than at the unsubsidized equilibrium E0. The figure shows that if

p, the domestic price, is rising due to domestic inflation and if the

nominal exchange rate e is constant, the export subsidy a must rise at

the same rate to hold the quantity X0 constant.

       This result implies an increasing rate of growth of the actual

subsidy rate, since a =             s/(1+s),   where s is the increase in the

subsidy rate. The need for an increasing subsidy rate to provide a

constant rate of growth of the subsidy factor can be seen from a simple

example. If initially s = 0, imposition of a 10% subsidy will yield an

increase of 10% in a. But if the subsidy rate is 50%, so a =               1.5,   to

increase a by 10%, s will have to increase from 0.50 to 0.65, or 30%.

       The equilibrium between export demand and subsidized supply in

equation (13), (2) and (3), and in Figure 1, is expressed in equations

(14) and (15) for changes in export quantity and market price net of

subsidy:



(14)     p, = k Ce + q) + (1          -
                                          k)(p-   a),




(15)     X =
               ks[(e   +   q)   -
                                    (p - a)].
The subsidy factor a enters both solutions in tandem with the domestic

price index p. If an inflation driven by domestic money growth or other

domestic factors is driving the domestic price index p, and policy keeps

the nominal exchange rate e constant, then a growth rate of the export

subsidy factor a that equals the rate of inflation p would be needed to

hold the quantity of exports X constant.

       Thus in an environment of domestic inflation with rapid monetary

growth, a policy of fixing the nominal exchange rate would destabilize

the real exchange rate E; in particular, if p grows rapidly, an attempt

to fix the nominal rate would yield a real appreciation of the exchange

rate and shrinking exports. As we see below, this has been the policy
                                    -12-




response in Sudan- -stabilizing the nominal rate against movements in the

real rate.

       A regime that attempts to eliminate the effects of stabilizing the

nominal rate in the face of a major appreciation of the real rate

requires, from equations (14) and (15), a rate of increase of the export

subsidy factor equal to the domestic inflation. The subsidy factor a

would have to rise at the domestic inflation rate p to hold X = X
                                                  n              0

in Figure 1. The subsidy rate itself would have to grow at an

increasing rate to provide a =          This would, of course, create an
ever—increasing incentive to false invoice sales as exports to obtain the

subsidy. This is part of the problem we see in developing countries

attempting to hold nominal exchange rates in the face of domestic

inflation. The policy increases incentives to move transactions to the

illegal sector.

       The movement in an import tariff needed to hold the quantity of

imports constant in the face of a domestic inflation with a fixed nominal

exchange rate can be shown by analogy to the export subsidy model. With

an import tariff, import demand becomes:



(16)    in m + in t =   ln p -   d1ln   Nd.



       The demand curve gives the total price in home-currency that

importers pay, inclusive of the tariff factor t =    1   + t.   In equation

(16), p is the home—currency price the sellers of imports receive, t is

the ad-valorem tariff rate added by the government and tPm is the price

paid by the domestic purchaser.
                                     -13-




       The equilibrium in the import market with the import tariff factor t

is shown in Figure 2. The supply curve is equation (8) in section II in

exponential, or non-log, form. The non-tariff demand curve without a t

term is the demand curve of equation (7). These would yield the non-

tariff equilibrium E0. The tariff factor t shifts the demand curve

inclusive of the tariff down, giving the tariff-inclusive equilibrium at

E0. This shows a lower import quantity H0      than   without the tariff, with

a lower price received by the seller p, and a higher price paid by the

domestic buyer tPm•

       It is clear from Figure 2 that for a given foreign price index q,

tariff factor t and exchange rate e, an increase in domestic prices

represented by p would shift the demand curves up, increasing import

prices and quantities. To prevent the increase in import quantity in

the face of a domestic inflation given by p, the tariff factor t

would have to increase at the same rate. This would hold M at H as p
                                                              0      n
increases. So, analogously to the export case, the import tariff factor

t would have to grow at the same rate as domestic inflation to hold the

quantity of imports constant.

       As in the export case, a constant growth rate of the tariff factor t

requires an increasing rate of increase in the actual tariff rate, since

t =   t/(1+t).   To achieve a 10% increase in the tariff factor t (to

offset a 10% domestic inflation), if initially t        0 (no tariff), a 10%

tariff will do. If initially t =    0.50,   a 30% increase is needed.

      The equilibrium between import supply and demand inclusive of the

tariff in equations (16), (8), and (9), and in Figure 2, is expressed in

equations (17) and (18) for changes in import quantity and market price

net of the import tariff:

The tariff factor t enters both equations in tandem with domestic

inflation p. With a domestic inflation driven by money growth and with

a fixed exchange rate, a growth of the tariff factor r equal to the

inflation rate would be needed to hold the quantity of imports H

constant.

        Consider now the quota alternative to the tariff of Figure 2. If

the domestic price level is rising, the non-tariff demand curve shifts up

continuously. If a quota of H0 is imposed, the gap between the
                         d—1                                   s—i

demand price given by PmM    and the supply price given by eq M    grows

        Thus in an environment of a domestic inflation characterized by
                                                                          ri
both the tariff and the subsidy factors would have to grow at the same

rate given to hold trade quantities constant with a fixed nominal

exchange rate. If tariffs and subsidies grow more slowly, import

quantity will rise and export quantity fall. But, with the tariff and

subsidy factors growing at the domestic inflation rate

(a =    t = p),   the regime with a fixed nominal exchange rate would offer

ever-increasing incentives to smuggling, through false invoicing or other

means. This, in turn, would generate a rising black market premium,

which would make it unsustainable to fix the nominal exchange rate.

IV. Trade Barriers, Smuggling and the Black Market Premium

      Rising import tariffs induce smuggling and therefore provide an

extra obstacle to the fixed nominal rate policy. An importer will tend

to smuggle if the tariff is so high that it pays to purchase foreign

exchange in the black market at a premium it = eb/e greater than one,

given that the good imported may be confiscated by the government.

Denoting the probability of success in smuggling by z, if z t > it, the

importer will tend to smuggle more. We assume that the probability of

success depends on the ratio of smuggled to legal imports, denoted by m =

S/L      so that, given trade barriers and the premium, an importer will

choose
         m such that expected profits are maximized. Associated with the
optimal m, there will be a probability of success z(m) and a domestic

price which can be expressed as a weighted average of the tariff factor

and the premium, with r > it a necessary condition for import smuggling to

occur. Rising subsidies, on the other hand, reduce the incentive to

smuggle exports but if the subsidy is smaller than the black market

premium weighted by the probability of success, or 'Y < Z it, it will pay

to smuggle more. Profits will be maximized for a smuggling ratio x

S/L, associated to a probability of success z(x) and a domestic price

of exports which can also be expressed as a weighted average of the

subsidy factor and the premium, with a < it a necessary condition for

export smuggling to occur. As a consequence, smuggling requires that t >

a initially, a condition which is necessarily met when we have an export

tax since then a < 1. The nature of the smuggling equilibrium is

discussed in Macedo (1985), and can be adapted to our purposes.
                                             -16-




       Domestic prices, net of tariff or subsidy, differ from the domestic

currency value of foreign prices at the official exchange rate by the

difference between the premium and trade barriers:

              where      = n x z(x)/[cl + it x z(x)]




(20)          ;m = e +       -




             where m = nm/Ct +      itm).




       We   now interpret planned smuggled imports as flow demand for black

market foreign exchange and successfully smuggled imports as flow supply

of black market foreign exchange. This determines the long-run black

market premium consistent with balanced legal and illegal trade. As

before, we set foreign prices q at unity, then if legal exports equal

legal imports (L = Lm) and successfully smuggled exports pay for planned

smuggling imports (Z(X)S =         S),      the smuggling ratios must satisfy the

trade balance equilibrium are such that:



(21)         z(x) x = m



       Using (21) to solve for the black market premium and the smuggling

ratios in terms of trade barriers, it can be shown that these only depend

on the ratio p =      t/a,   with a coefficient capturing the inverse of the sum

of the elasticities of the demand for and supply of black market foreign

exchange with respect to trade barriers. An increase in t increases
                                              —17—




smuggling only if a does not increase in proportion. The premium,

however, increases with both, since it is a weighted average of t and a.

It can be expressed as:



(22)        Tt =    t - m'mx1
            where c(a) is the elasticity of demand for (supply of) black

market foreign exchange.

       Using (22) in (19) and (20), it is seen that an increase in the

tariff (subsidy) raises (lowers) the domestic net price of exports and

lowers (raises) the domestic net price of imports because of the induced

increase (decrease) in smuggling. Note also that in the benchmark case

where t    =a   =   it = 1,      the   coefficients become the share of import

smuggling (or of successful export smuggling) in total trade, denoted by

       We can then write the condition for the smuggling equilibrium to

exist as        >        >
            x        o       m
       The smuggling model summarized above can now be adapted to the model

of section III. Under the simplifying assumption that the government

does not resell confiscated smuggled goods, exports supplied by home

producers (XS) are greater than exports demanded by foreign consumers
  0
(X ) and greater than legal exports (L) whereas imports demanded by home

consumers (Md) are smaller than imports supplied by foreign producers

(MS) but still greater than legal imports CL). Since the differences

involve the smuggling ratios for               and N5 and those multiplied by the

probability of success in smuggling for X5 and Md,they can be expressed

as a function of the ratio of trade barriers:
                                        -18-

                           [o/xam)IP

(26)             = L   +   [/(a+cr)]p

       The equality of the wedge between between exports demanded and legal

exports on the one hand and between imports supplied and legal imports on

the other is a consequence of the long-run equilibrium condition

expressed in (21).

       Before substituting for quantities in the log differential of the

demand and supply equations from sections II and III and solving the

model for prices and legal quantities, we note that the solution will be

the same as above if p = 0, so that the rule Pu =     t=a   still keeps total

import and export quantities constant. The difference, of course, is

that the black market premium is growing at the same rate         =

independently     of the changes in the official exchange rate.

       It is convenient to write the solution relative to the no-smuggling

model of section III, denoted by a L superscript. We then have:



(27)       p =         + A[(1+ad)       -




(28)       L' =      jL+Al[d(aS_1)          -
                                                s]p
           where A = (a +a ) (d +s )
                 x           x m xx
                                     —19-




(29)             =     -A        (1s) -
(30)         1m = tiL+ Am1[mSm(dmam_1) _dmJP


             where A = (c +a ) (d +s ).
                   m         x m mm

       We see that the price of exports is always higher than without

smuggling, and, in the case of a small economy, the price of imports also

increases with rising tariffs. Quantities legally traded are ambiguous.

In the "rigid" economy, legal trade falls but a rise in the value of

imports and exports requires that the foreign exchange elasticities be

greater than one:



(31)             +     -p-        = x'xmx
(32)
             m   + L   -     -    = mxm)1m1
       Independently of legal trade, total trade may rise or fall, except

of course for the small, rigid economy. Thus



(33)             =     + x m)'[xo11 + ksx]p
(34)         Md = ML +     (a+ am'[ mo)(1l(') +

       It   is seen that for the small country total trade rises. The only

case where this would not obtain is for a country with monopoly power on

the import side, say k'O. A country with monopoly power on the export

side would still increase its total exports relative to the no-smuggling

situation.
                                       -20-




       The smuggling model shows therefore that, even in the "rigid"

 economy, legal trade will only fall if tariffs are rising faster than

 subsidies. However, the black market premium will be growing at the same

rate as trade barriers.

       To analyze this phenomenon we need to model the short-run black

market premium, which importers and exporters take as given because it

makes the stock of black market foreign exchange willingly held, as in

Macedo (1982).

       In this connection, the importance of a given short-term premium is

that in order for smuggling to exist, it must be such that t > Tt > a.

Alternatively put, the observed premium provides a lower bound for import

tariffs and an upper bound for export subsidies.

       The analysis is in Macedo (1985). For our purposes, it is

sufficient to stress that if the reported trade balance is zero, the

unreported trade balance in foreign currency is given by:



(35)        B "
                  QmSmk
                          -   - (1-a)r].

       When the premium is higher than the weighted average of trade

barriers, the unreported balance is in surplus and conversely. The

effect of capital flight is therefore to exacerbate the rise in the

premium.

V. Lessons from Sudan

       Exchange-rate stability is desirable in a developing country because

it eliminates a major source of uncertainty as the traded-goods sectors

develop. As we saw above, an attempt to stabilize the nominal exchange

rate in the face of domestic inflation will require increasing trade

restrictions and the rising incentives they provide for illegal activity.

An alternative objective is stabilization of the real exchange rate so as

to insulate the traded-goods sectors and the trade balance from domestic

inflation. To stabilize the real exchange rate, the nominal rate e

should be moved to offset the home inflation differential. For a con-

stant E, the nominal rate e would follow the rule



(36)
                            ep-q
       Once we have accepted, on principle, that the objective for

exchange-rate stabilization is the real exchange rate, we face the

question: to which nominal rate do we apply the rule given in equation

(36)? The dollar rate? The sterling rate? An average? Do we use

import or export weights in forming the average? The general answer to

these questions is that the real effective exchange rate can be

stabilized by applying the rule of equation (36) to a nominal effective

note, where the same set of weights is used in calculating the effective

nominal rate e and the effective traded-goods price q. The optimal

choice of weights is discussed in some detail in Branson and Katseli

(1982). In the absence of market power in either export or import mar-

kets for a small country like Sudan, the appropriate choice is likely to

be total trade weights. Thus the nominal effective rate and traded-goods
                                   -22-




 price can be formed by making a weighted average across the sum   of
 exports and imports by trading partner. The nominal exchange rate of a

 selected nulneraire currency such as the U.S. dollar can then be moved so

 that the effective nominal rate follows equation (36).

      The data on official effective exchange rates for the Sudan are

 summarized in Appendix Tables 1-3. The left-hand side of each Table

shows the export, import, and total trade weights for the Sudan's fifteen

largest trading partners, with data drawn from the IMF's

International Financial Statistics. Appendix Table 1 gives the weighted

relative price index p/q (1980 = 100) for the Sudan using export,

import, and total trade weights, and a three-country approximation

weighting Saudi Arabia by .5 and the U.S. and U.K. by .25 each. Appendix

Table 2 gives the same calculation for the nominal effective rate e, and

Appendix Table 3 (and Figure 3) shows the real effective rate E. In both

tables, an increase in the exchange rate index is an appreciation.

     After two decades of relative price stability, the relative price

index in Appendix Table 1 goes from 60 in 1976 to 64 in 1977 and 73 in

1978. This was the beginning of a period of accelerating inflation. As

the inflation began in 1977, the nominal rate was not allowed to move

until 1978. Subsequently, it was increased (depreciation of the Sudanese

currency) in irregular jumps, compared to the fairly smooth relative

inflation path.

     The combination of steadily accelerating inflation and irregular

movement of the nominal exchange rate resulted in the unstable movement

in the real effective rate, as shown in Figure 3. After the late 1960s,

the real effective rate fell in an unstable manner to 1980. This real

appreciation was bad for output of traded goods and the trade balance.

The instability of year-to-year movement in the real rate raises risk and

may reduce investment in the traded-goods sector.

     The situation worsened after 1980. A sharp real appreciation came

in 1981 as the nominal rate was held nearly constant against a rising

domestic inflation. The sharp devaluation in 1982 gave a large deprecia-

tion in the real effective rate, and the nominal appreciation (!) in 1984

resulted in an appreciation of the real rate back to its level in 1980.

     While the causes of the accelerated inflation of the seventies are

controversial, it is worth recalling that, after the first oil crisis,

the Sudanese authorities embarked on a development program designed to

make their country the "bread basket" of the Gulf states. The eagerness

of these states to provide development aid to the Sudan as well as the

significant migration of Sudanese workers toward the Gulf would seem to

have relaxed the foreign exchange constraint. Nevertheless, when Sudan

negotiated with the fliP in 1978, it was already in a very difficult

financial situation. Nashashibi (1980) illustrates the decline in the

competitiveness of major crops in the mid-seventies. Hussain and

Thirwall (1984) find the same tendency after the 1978 devaluation. It is

as yet unclear whether the deterioriation of Sudan's solvency in seven

years of agreements with the IMF is mostly attributable to errors in

policy and/or policy advice. An alternative hypothesis, put forth by

Brown (1984, 1985), argues that both the United States and the Arab

countries managed to use the IMF's "seal of approval" to continue lending

to a friendly government. The ability of Sudan to continue dealing with

the lilY despite arrears on its debt to the Fund is, of course, consistent

with Brown's hypothesis but is not sufficient to establish it. In any

event, the situation did deteriorate until negotiations with the HIP

broke down in late 1984. In early February 1986, the fliP announced it

was ceasing to lend to Sudan.

      The 1979 partial unification, rather than part of any agreement,

seems to have been an initiative of the Sudanese authorities. The

financial liberalization which accompanied the partial unification of the

exchange rate turned out to have very severe consequences because, while

broadening the market where a free exchange rate was determined, it did

not induce a more credible official exchange rate policy. As a

consequence, the free market premium became a signal of the inability of

the authorities to manage the economy and was accordingly viewed with

suspicion by the central bank. This may well have exacerbated the

potential of informal financial markets for bubbles and crashes, as

indeed became reality in 1984-85 (see Figure 4).

     Going back to the reforms, they continued to be implemented in 1980

and 1981. Further measures toward "the simplification and unification of

the exchange rate" are mentioned in the Annual Report of the Bank of

Sudan (1980, p. 50). In September, according to Awad (1985), the

official rate became 60 piastres per dollar, the special rate 80 piastres

while the free market rate was at 125 piastres, a premium of 2.08, much

higher than the average of 1.76 reported in Table 1.

     The unification of the exchange system is dated in BS (1981) in

November 1981, at a rate of 90 piastres per dollar. According to Awad

(1985), the premium was then 1.5, whereas a USAID document reports no

premium (i.e. 1.0).

     But the unification only lasted a few months. In March 1982, the

commercial rate rose to 135 piastres, only slightly below the free market

rate of 145. In November, the official rate was set at 130 piastres and

While the official rate remained at that level until February 1985 (when

it became 250 piastres) the commercial rate was raised to 180 piastres in

March of 1983, BS (1983, P. 64) and to 210 piastres in October 1984.

Before that, however, the official rate was only applicable to the

imports of petroleum and some pharmaceuticals because agricultural

exports were valued at a combined rate of 142 piastres (obtained by

weighing the official rate with 3/4 and the commercial rate with U.

Indeed, by then, the commercial rate itself was only applicable to

specific "priority" imports.

     While during the IMP-period there continued to be continuous changes

in exchange rate policy, the major difference with the previous period is

the decline in the premium and the real devaluation against the dollar.

This started in 1979 for the free market exchange rate and continued

until 1984. For the official rate, it is limited to the period

1981-1983. But, as before, the shift of transactions to the commercial

rate makes the true pattern look less volatile than the numbers reported

in Table 1 above.

    The "strong dollar" also causes problems of interpretation, but both

the 15 partner real effective exchange rate (using total trade weights)

and the simplified three partner rate mirror the evolution of the

official real dollar rate. There is of course a difference in magnitude.

To a real depreciation of 66% against the dollar in 1982-83, corresponds

a 40% depreciation against major trading partners. The real appreciation

of 1984 is also much larger relative to trading partners (15:23%, 3:20%)

than relative to the dollar (-13%). The free rate, on the other hand,
                                  -26-




depreciated by 10% in real terms, underscoring the substantial increase

in the average premium over the years, to almost 1.9.

     The decline in the premium during the period of IMF devaluations was

consistent with a smoother functioning of the free market than the

authorities were willing to acknowledge.

     Almost by definition, there is little information on quantities

transacted in the free, or "black", markets for foreign exchange. The

percentages reported in Appendix Table 4 are shares of total

transactions, based on data reported by private dealers to the central

bank and consolidated in Macedo (1986). The shares are considerable both

on the export and on the import side, especially if the premium is taken

into account by converting values into domestic currency. The data is

subject to caveats, since the authorizations to private dealers were

revoked from February 10, 1983 through end of January, 1984, at which

time the commercial banks virtually ceased to deal in foreign exchange

since they would not use the free market rate.

     Comparing various sources and methods, Appendix Table 5 reports the

share of unreported transactions. It shows smuggling ratios of .37

(27/100-27) for commodity imports and .49 for commodity exports. The

figures on the bottom panel show the importance of smuggling for

government transactions (cotton, oil, petroleum, sugar) as well as for

livestock.

    Appendix Table 6 analyzes the structure of the free market by

currency composition, showing a very dominant but variable share for the

U.S. dollar, and by firm concentration. While the number of authorized

dealers increases substantially during 1984, many of them had a very

small share of the market so that the average number equivalent
                                  -27-




Herfindahi index for the year is 5.6. This shows a degree of competition

far greater than generally believed. For example, Dixit (1985) computes

a similar number for U.S. auto firms and finds 2 or 8, depending on

whether divisions are counted as separate entities. Another indicator,

reported in the last column, is average transaction per authorized

dealer. The pattern is erratic, and it would be difficult to ascribe

declines to increases in competition in the usual way. But the size of

the market was very variable due to the emerging bubble and seasonal

factors tend to explain the Summer bulge.

     Another piece of evidence concerns remittances. Their importance

for the free market is evident from Appendix Table 5. The reported

figures show a smuggling ratio of about one, confirmed by the figures

based on potential savings reported below, which give 1.11. In a 1983

study of Sudanese workers abroad, discussed by Harris (1986), however,

the smuggling ratio for remittances is as high as 7.27, so that as a

share of output they would represent 37% rather than 5%. Even if such

figure is grossly exaggerated, it seems clear that the stock of foreign

exchange held by Sudanese determines the premium in the short run, as

postulated in our analysis.

     Appendix Table 7 shows that the intended use of these remittances

generally requires imports (the exception may be housing). As a

consequence, only a small part of the stock of foreign assets held by

Sudanese residents is directed to supply foreign exchange to the Khartoum

black market. This may account for the low level of net inflows or

outflows reported in Appendix Table 4. Harris (1986) also claims that

the stock - which he estimates at $2 billion -   is held   outside Sudan but

does not draw the implications for the price of foreign exchange.
                                  -28-




     Despite the caveats about the quality of the data, this evidence

strongly suggests that smuggling and the free market for foreign exchange

cannot be ignored in the design of official exchange rate policy in

Sudan: the smuggler's blues made its way to the central bank! The black

market has offset the effects of official exchange rate policy leading to

movements in the premium that were determined by stock demand for foreign

assets as well as smuggling activity.

     In sum, the failure to match movement in the nominal exchange rate

to relative inflation sharply destabilized the real effective rate after

1980. The attempts at stabilizing the nominal exchange rate destabilized

the real rate, discouraging investment in the traded-goods sectors and

providing inventives for illegal activity. The objective for exchange

rate policy in the Sudan may well be stability, but stability of the real

exchange rate and the black premium premium, not the nominal official

rate against the dollar.
