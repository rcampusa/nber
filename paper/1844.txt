replenish its stock of        foreign    exchange reserve throxrh            a   once—off open

narket sale     of   bonds.   Without    a   fundanental fiscal         correction (ie. a

decision      to reduce    the prinary (non-interesti deficit by an anuunt equal

i Introduction
       The purpose of this paper is to extend the recent literature on

coliapsing     ranaged exchange rate reqis         by allowing explicitly for the

ciouernirent   budget   constraint    and   especially for    the   interest   cost of

seriicing the public debt            The seminal    paper   of Salant and Henderson

11978]    analysed   the ialications of governuent attenpts to peq the price

of gold or to defend a price ceiling by mnaging                a   stockpile; it

denonstrated the        inevitability   of an eventual speculative attack and o

the   collapse   of such   schenes. Rrrinn [1979]           provided the     first
application of this analytical approach to the acroeconomic                    problem   of

defending a fixed exchange rate parity. Since then                  there   have been   iiny
other1    nxtinly theoretical1 studies of the viability of            a    variety of

ianaqed exchange rate reqines and of the            nature and      likelihood of

speculative attacks. [See e.g. Flood              and Garber [l983 1984a1        h11

Obstfeld [1984a1 b, c}, Connolly and Taylor [1984] and Dornbusch

[19811]).     Related   relevant   theoretical grk on speculative attacks1

runs1 etc. can     be   found in Salant 119831 ''iiich analyses price

stabilization schenes and       Dianrnd     and   Dybviq 11983] thich deals with

      The existing literature aintist invariably treats donestic credit

expansion     (dce) as the exogenous ciovernnent       control and fundanental
forcing     variable driving the     stock of reserves andlor        the    exchange rate

        In Sections 21 and 3)       I   analyse the consequences of a decision by

the go'ernnent to replenish its stock               of foreign   exchange reseres

fundanental fiscal correction (i.e a decision to cut the prirrary

deficit by an annunt equal to the increase in the interest cost of

seruicing the debt), the consequences of this decision to borrow f or the

timing arid nngnitude of the speculatiue attack that causes the collapse

of the fixed exchange rate reciine are as follows.                 In the deterministic

continuous    tine rrndel of Section 2), the          timing of the speculatiue

attack    is brought £orntrd if the        borrowing    takes    place sufficiently    long
before    the date   at s.kiich the collapse uld haue occurred absent            the

borrowing. It is delayed if             the borrowing takes place sufficiently
close    to the collapse    date without borrowing, The negnitude of the
attack (neasured by the size of the final stock-shift reduction in the

stock of reserues to their critical leuel) alsniys increases as               a result

the probability           of collapse k    periods or     less after the borrowinq            falls

this reflects the fact that because of the                     interest   cost of ser'icinq

the   newly incurred debt              an act of borrowinq redes the        level of the
stock   of   dcrnEstic credit (increases the             level   of the stock of reserves)
but   also    increases      the   rate of dowestic      credit expansion (increases the

rate   at cthich the stock of reserves declines).                 Finally4 under mild

conditions4 the expected leniith of               the   tine   interval   until   the   collapse

          Initially   the econcnw is on a fixed exchange rate          with   S = S       When

the stock of reserves falls below a threshold level 11* the authorities

stop defending the exchange rate and a free float of indefinite duration

ensis. Other          scenarios    have been   analysed   (e.g. by (Jbstfeld [1984b1)

but for     our   purposes   the   sinplest case suffices. The threshold level is

set   equal to zero. Following the new familiar argunent that                 efficient

financial nnrkets rule out anticipated future discrete or discontinuous

changes in the level of the exchange rate                   can   calculate   the date

t =   t   at 'irkich the fixed exchange rate reqine collapses and a free float

begins from the boundary           condition    that at t the exchane rate       that
wuld prevail if        the   exchange rate collapsed and floated at t S(t)3

equals the fixed exchange rate S               The exauple is chosen suoh that

reserves are lost continuously and a collapse in finite tine is certain.

in addition to the       loer bound       on reserves (ktich ien crossed        conpels a

      after the open nerket sale, no further borrowinq             occurs.. This       ney

        In   the    continnous        ti1 deterministic irodel              of this section the
effect of       the   open nmrket sale         on the       timing       of the   collapse   is

1Duld   ha''e   collapsed absent the borrowing, the collapse is postponed (t
increases)          If the borrowing occurs long enoiih before the exchange
rate regine vuld hac'e collapsed in the absence of borrowings the
collapse      is brought           F orrd (t declines). In the latter case the higher
rate   of decline            of   reserues dominates the       once—off increase            in the le"el

of the  stock of reserues in the F orner case the opposite holds.
      In the discrete tine stochastic nodel of Section 3 the probability
at t of collapse in or before period
    0                           -      t0+ i = 2 falls as a          -       l      -

intuition again is strong a stochastic 'ersion of liue now and pay
later.       For an act of borrowing             to    lover uniformly the              probability    of

collapse it n-txst be acconpanied               by   a fiscal correction! i.e. by a

sale, for iiich the probability of a collapse is reduced is inerseiy

related to the interest rate.

          It xuld be inforntiue to obtain an expression for the expected

duration           of the interual beten the open nerket sale and the collapse

of the        fixed exchange rate                                  regi1,        and to   analyse how       it      is affected by

the   sale.             The expected iting tin until the                                         collapse          is denoted
