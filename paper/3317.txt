                           WORLD REAL INTEREST RATES


                                   ABSTRACT

     We think of the expected real interest rate for ten OECD countries (our
counterpart of the world economy) as determined by the equation of aggregate
investment demand to aggregate desired saving. Stock-market returns isolate
shifts to investment demand, and changes in oil prices, monetary growth, and
fiscal variables isolate shifts to desired saving. We estimated the reduced
form for CDP-weighted world averages of the expected short-term real interest
rate and the investment ratio over the period 1959-88. The estimates reveal
significant effects in the predicted direction for world stock returns, oil
prices, and world monetary growth, but fiscal variables turned out to be
unimportant. Structural estimation implies that an increase by one percentage
point in the expected real interest rate raises the desired saving rate by one-
third of a percentage point. Simulations of the model indicated that
fluctuations in world stock returns and oil prices explain a good deal of the
time series for the world average of expected real interest rates;
specifically, why the rates were low in 1974-79 and high in 1981-86. The model
also explains the fall in real rates in 1987-88 and the subsequent upturn in
1989. The fitted relation forecasts an increase in the world average of real
interest rates in 1990 to a value, 5.6 %, that is nearly a full percentage
point above the highest value attained in the entire prior sample, 1958-89. We
estimated systems of equations for individual countries' expected real interest
rates and investment ratios. One finding is that each country's expected real
interest rate depends primarily on world factors, rather than own-country
factors, thereby suggesting a good deal of integration of world capital and
goods markets.

     We began this study with the challenge to explain why real interest rates

 were so high in the 1980s in the major industrialized countries.
                                                                       To try to
 address this challenge in a serious way we expanded the question to the

 determination of real interest rates over a longer sample, which turned out

 to be 1959-88. In considering how real interest rates were determined we

 focused on the interaction between investment demand
                                                        and desired saving in an
 economy (ten DECO countries viewed as operating on an integrated capital

 market) that was large enough to justify closed-economy assumptions. Within

 this "world" setting, high real interest rates reflect   positive shocks to

 investment demand (such as improvements in the expected profitability of

 investment) or negative shocks to desired saving (such as
                                                              temporary
reductions in world income). Our main analysis ends up measuring the first

kind of effect mainly by stock returns and the second kind primarily by oil

prices and monetary growth.

    Much to our surprise, we actually think that we have partial answers to

how world real interest rates have been determined, and, more specifically,

to why real interest rates were as high as they were in the 1980s.        The key
elements in the period 1981-86 appear to be favorable stock returns (which

raised real interest rates and stimulated investment) combined     with high oil

prices (which also raised real interest rates, but
                                                     discouraged investment).
    We focus in this paper on the behavior of short-term real     interest rates
since 1959 in nine OECD countries: Belgium (BE), Canada
                                                             (CA), France (FR),

Germany (GE), Japan (JA), Netherlands (NE), Sweden (SW), the United Kingdom

(UK), and the United States (US). These countries constitute the set of

industrialized market economies for which we have been able to obtain data

since the late 1950s on relatively open-market interest rates for assets that

are analogous to U.S. Treasury bills. For France and Japan, the available
                                                                    2




 data are money-market rates. We were unable to obtain satisfactory data on

 interest rates for Italy (IT) prior to the early 1970s, but we included

 Italian data on other variables. Therefore, parts of the analysis deal with

ten OECD countries. These countries accounted in 1960 for 65.47, of the

overall real GDP for 114 market economies, according to the PPP- adjusted data

that were constructed by Summers and Heston (1988). In 1985, the share was

63.47.. Thus, the sample of ten countries represents a substantial fraction

of the world's real GDP.

    We have concentrated thus far on short-term interest rates because of the

difficulty in measuring medium- or long-term expected inflation and hence

expected real interest rates. The quantification of expected inflation is

difficult even for short horizons, although we think the results in this

paper are robust to these problems. The patterns that we find in short-term

expected real interest rates reveal a good deal of persistence; for example,

the rates are much higher for 1981-86 than for 1974-79, with the rates in the

1960s falling in between. Given the ease with which participants in

financial markets can switch among maturities, the persisting patterns in

expected real short-term rates would also be reflected in medium- and

long-term rates. Therefore, we doubt that the limitation of the present

analysis to short-term rates will turn out to be a serious drawback. We

plan, however, to apply the approach also to longer term rates.



Exnected Inflation    Expected       Interest Rates

    Investment demand and desired saving depend on expected real interest

rates. The data provide measures of nominal interest rates and realized real

rates. We could carry out the analysis with the realized real     rates, relying
                                                                     3




on a rational-expectations condition to argue that the difference between the

realized and expected real rates, which corresponds to the negative of the

difference between the actual and expected inflation rate, involves a

serially uncorrelated random error. Because the divergences between actual

and expected inflation are likely to be large in some periods, we would

obtain much more precise estimates if we could construct reasonably accurate

measures of expected inflation and expected real interest rates. Thus, we

begin by estimating expected inflation rates.

       We have quarterly, seasonally unadjusted data on an index of consumer

prices for each country beginning in 1952.1. (For the United States, we used

the CPI less shelter to avoid problems with the treatment of housing costs in

the data prior to 1983.) The results reported in this paper compute expected

inflation for dates t = 1958.1 to 1989.4 based on regression forecasts for

CPI inflation. (Quarter 1 represents the annualized inflation rate from

January to April, and so on.) Each regression uses data on inflation for

country i from 1952.2 up to the quarter prior to date t. That is, the data

before date t are equally weighted, but later data are not used to calculate

forecasts.

       The functional form for the inflation regressions is an ARMA (1,1) with

deterministic seasonals for each quarter; thus, expected inflation is based

solely on the history of inflation. We considered forms in which inflation

depended also on past values of Ml growth and nominal interest rates, but the

effects on the computed values of expected real interest rates were minor.

(The nature of the relation between inflation and past monetary growth and

interest rates also varied considerably across the countries.) Within the

ARMA   (1,1)   form, the results look broadly similar across the nine OECD
                                                                   4




countries; typically, the estimated AR(1) coefficient is close to 0.9 and the

estimated MA(1) coefficient ranges between -0.4 and -0.8. Q-statistics for

serial correlation are typically insignificant at the 57. level, although

these statistics are significant in some cases. The pattern of seasonality

varies a good deal across the countries. Appendix Table Al shows the

estimated equations that apply for the nine countries over the sample

1952.2- 1989.3.

    We computed annual measures of expected inflation by averaging the four

quarterly values from the regression forecasts. Figure 1 compares the

constructed annual time series for U.S. expected inflation, TSt, with

values derived from the 6-month-ahead forecasts from the Livingston    survey
(obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia). The two series

move closely together, with a correlation of .92 from 1959 to 1988. The main

discrepancies are the more rapid adjustment of the regression-based series to

actual inflation in the periods 1973-75 (when inflation rose) and 1985-86

(when inflation fell).

    We calculated expected real interest rates,         for country i in quarter

t by subtracting the constructed value for        from the corresponding nominal

interest rate,       (The 3-month Treasury bill rate in January matches up

with the expected inflation rate for January to April, and so on.) We then

formed an annual series for     by averaging the four quarterly values.

    The calculated values for U.S. expected real interest rates for 1974- 77

are negative and average -1.27., whereas the values based on the Livingston

survey average 0.17. and are negative only for 1975-77. A plausible

explanation is that the regression estimates overstate the responsiveness of

expected inflation to actual inflation in the early 1970s. Many of the other
                                                                       5




eight OECD countries exhibit negative values of rt for some of the years

between 1972 and 1976, and an overstatement of T?t may also explain this

behavior. (If we had used the full sample of data to compute i,            rather
than just the data prior to period t, the calculated sensitivity of             to

past inflation would have been even greater. Thus, the tendency to calculate

negative values for r7t between 1972 and 1976 would have been even more

pronounced.) Except for the U.K. for 1975-77 (r,IJK =    - .115,   -
                                                                       .027, and
-
    .058, respectively), the computed negative values for r since 1959 never
exceed 27. in magnitude.'

      The subsequent analysis deals with the annual time series for expected

real interest rates,         The limitation to annual values arises because

some of the other variables are available only annually.2 In any event, the

high serial correlation in the quarterly series on       suggests that we may

not lose a lot of information by confining ourselves to the annual




'Economic theory would not rule out small negative values for expected real
interest rates on nearly risk-free assets. However, opportunities for
low-risk real investments without substantial transaction costs (including
storage of durables) would preclude expected real rates that were
substantially negative. It seems likely that at least the large-magnitude
negative values for r represent mismeasurement of expected inflation. It

would be possible to recompute r based on the restriction that the implied

value for r exceed some lower bound, such as zero or a negative number of
small magnitude. We have not yet proceeded along these lines.
2The main results that we report below turn out, however, to involve
variables that are available quarterly. We are presently working on the
results for quarterly data.
                                                                 6




observations. The use of annual data means also that we do not have to deal

with possible seasonal variations in expected real interest rates.

    We constructed a world index of a variable for year t by weighting the

value for country i in year t by the share of that country's real CDP for

year t in the aggregate real GOP of the nine- or ten-country sample.

(Henceforth, the term "world" signifies the aggregate of the nine- or

ten-country OECD sample.) In computing the weights, we used the PPP-adjusted

numbers for real COP reported by Summers and Heston (1988).   (For 1986-89, we

used the shares for 1985, the final year of their data set.) None of our

results changed significantly if we weighted instead by shares in world

investment. Table 1 shows the average of each country's Summers-Heston GD?

weight (WT) from 1959 to 1988. Note that the average share for the United

States was .45, that for Japan was .13, and so on. (In 1985, the U.S. share

was .44 and the Japanese was .17.)

    Figure 2 shows the world values (nine-country sample excluding Italy) for

actual and expected inflation from 1959 to 1989. (Because we had data on

actual inflation for some countries only up to the third quarter of 1989, the

value for actual inflation in 1989 is missing.) Expected and actual

inflation move together in a broad sense, but the expected values lag behind

the increases in inflation in 1969, 1972-74, and 1979-80, and behind the

decreases in 1982 and 1986. Figure 3 shows the corresponding values for

world actual and expected real interest rates. Although the two series move

broadly together, a notable discrepancy is the excess of expected over actual

real interest rates for 1972-74. The actual rates are negative over this

period (averaging -2.3Z), but the computed expected rates are positive

(averaging 1.17.).
                                                                               7




       Figure 4 shows the breakdown of the world nominal interest rate into two

components: the world expected inflation rate and the world expected real

interest rate. The graph makes clear that the bulk of variations in nominal

interest rates correspond to movements in expected inflation: the

correlation between the nominal interest rate and the expected inflation rate

is .79, whereas that between the nominal rate and the expected real interest

rate is .44. (The correlation of the nominal interest rate with actual

inflation is .62, whereas that with the actual real interest rate is .24.)

       Many authors have argued that expected real interest rates among OECD

countries differ significantly in terms of levels and time patterns (see, for

example, Mishkin, 1984). Although our findings do not dispute this

conclusion, we think nevertheless that a study of the movements of real

interest rates in the main OECD countries can usefully start by attempting to

explain the common elements across the countries. (Blanchard and Summers,

1984, take a similar view.) The comparison of U.S. behavior with that of the

other countries in Figure 5 suggests that the common factors are worth

investigating. The U.S. expected real interest rate moved similarly to the

average for the other eight countries; the correlation from 1959 to 1989 was

.73.


       A simple way to summarize the overall movements of the expected and

actual real interest rates, rWd and rWd, is to consider the means of the

two variables from Figure 3 over various sub-periods. The average values for

rWd (rWd,t) were 2.07.         (1.87.) for   1959-70, 1.27. (-1.07.) for 1971-73, 0.07.

(-1.07.)    for   1974-79, 2.47. (1.87.)   for   1980, 4.27. (5.37.) for 1981-86, 2.37.

(2.87.)    for   1987-88, and 3.57.   (3.47.) for   1989. These data suggest that it is

a meaningful question to ask why expected and actual real interest rates were
                                                                  8




high in the early 1980s.3 In our analysis of the full time series siace

1959, we effectively add the questions of why the movements in rates were

relatively moderate from 1959 until the early 1970s, why the rates were so

low in the middle and late 1970s, and why the rates fell after 1986 and rose

in 1989.




A Model of Investment Demand      Desired Saving

    We think of the9 world expected real interest rate, rWd, as determined

by the equation in period t of world investment demand to world desired

saving. This setting applies to the ten-country DECO sample if first, these

countries operated throughout the sample on integrated capital and goods

markets, and second, if the ten countries approximate the world, and hence a

closed economy. We get some insight later about the integration of world

markets by analyzing the extent to which real interest rates in individual

countries respond to own-country variables rather than to world variables.

The approximation that the ten countries represent the world and hence a

closed economy may be tenable first, because these countries constitute about

657. of the world's real QDP (for market economies), and second, because the

observed current-account balance for the ten-country aggregate has been very

small. We added up each country's nominal current-account balance (expressed

via current exchange rates in terms of U.S. dollars) from 1960 to 1987 and

divided by the total nominal GDP (also converted by exchange rates into U.S.




3The rates for 1981-86 would not look so high in an historical context that
went before World War II. Barro (1989, p. 242) shows that U.S. realized real
interest rates on assets comparable to prime commercial paper averaged about
87. from 1840 to 1900 (excluding the Civil War), 37. from 1900 to 1916, and 57.
from 1920 to 1940.
                                                                     9




dollars). The average value of the ratio of the aggregated current-account

balance to overall GD? was 0.1%. Moreover, the largest value from 1960 to

1987 (1971) was only 0.57. and the smallest (1984) was only -0.77..

    We now construct a simple model of investment demand and desired saving.

Although we use the model to interpret some of the empirical findings, the

general nature of the reduced-form results does not depend on this particular

framework. Hence, readers who are unimpressed by our theory may nevertheless

be interested in the empirical evidence.

    We measure real investment, I, by gross domestic capital formation

(private plus public, non-residential plus residential, fixed plus changes in

stocks). Thus       excludes purchases of consumer durables and expenditures on

human   capital.   Investment demand, expressed as a ratio to GD?, is determined

by a q-type variable:



    (1)               (I/Y)t = 00 +   a1.log[PROF/(r+p)]   +



where PROF is expected profitability per unit of capital, r is the expected

real interest rate on assets like Treasury bills,       is   a risk premium, and

          The error term u is likely to be highly persistent because first,

time-to-build considerations imply that current investment demand depends on

lagged variables that influenced past investment decisions, and second, there

may be permanent shifts in the nature of adjustment costs, which determine

the relation between investment demand and the q variable. In first-

difference form, equation (1) becomes
                                                                          10




    (2)         (I/Y)t =
                           a1.Mog[PROF/(r+p)]          +           +
                                                                       u-u1

Our analysis treats the error term, u-u1, as roughly white noise.

    We use the world real rate of return on the stock market through December

of the previous year, STOCKt        , to    proxy for the first difference of the q

variable, Mog[PROF/(r+p)] .             This   proxying is imperfect because of

distinctions between average and marginal q,5 because of failure to adjust

for changes in the market value of bonds and depreciation of capital stocks,

and because the stock market values only a portion of the capital that

relates to our measure of investment. (The investment numbers include

residential construction, non-corporate business investment, and public

investment.) For these reasons, the best estimate of Mog[PROF/(r÷p)]

would depend inversely on the change in r, for a given value of STOCXt1.6



4The stock-return variable for each country is the nominal rate of return for
the year implied by the IFS December index for industrial-share prices less
the December-to-December inflation rate based on the consumer price index.
We had broader stock-return measures readily available for three
countries—Canada, the U.K., and the U.S.—which together comprised 57% on
average of the ten-country GDP. The substitution of these numbers for the
IFS values had a negligible impact on the regression results that we report
later. We took this result as an indication that the IFS data are probably
satisfactory indicators of stock-market returns.
5See Hayashi (1982). He discusses, in particular, the adjustments of
marginal q for tax effects.

6Let STOCKt =
                Mog(q)     +
                               e,   where      =
                                                   [PROF/(r+pt)]   and et can be
interpreted as a measurement error. Assume that the prior distribution is
given by Mog(q) =           that    r is observed without error, and that no direct
information about      is available. Then the posterior estimate of Mog(q)

gives weights to STOCK and (as a linear approximation) to r-r1, where the

weight on r-r1 rises with VAR(e)/VAR(E). (Independent measurement error

in r would lower the weight applied to r-r1.) Our analysis uses data on
                                                                      11




Therefore, we approximate the relation for investment demand as



    (3)           = a0 + ai.STOCKi -   a2.(r-r1)        +           + Vt



where a1>0 and a2>0.7

    We assume that the desired saving rate (for the world aggregate of

national saving) is given by



    (4)     (S/Y)t =    +                                   1 + error term
                                   + /32r + /33.   (S/Y)t


where     is current temporary income, the /J1ts are positive, and the error

term is treated as white noise. Equation (4) adopts the permanent-income

perspective in assuming that permanent changes in income do not have

important effects on the saving rate. Temporary changes in income have

little effect on consumer demand and therefore have a positive effect on the

desired saving rate, as given by the coefficient fi. Given the

temporary-income ratio, (Y/Y)t, the saving rate would respond positively to

r in accordance with the coefficient        The variable (S/Y)ti picks up




stock returns only through December of the previous year (and thereby avoids
some simultaneity problems). The omission of contemporaneous data on stock
returns raises VAR(e) and thereby raises the weight applied to r-r1.

7The term (r-r1) is approximately linear if p>>r applies.
                                                                12




persisting influences on the saving rate. It turns Out in our empirical

estimation that 0</33<1 applies; that is, the desired saving rate appears to

exhibit less persistence than the investment-demand ratio, which has a

unitary coefficient on the lagged dependent variable in equation (3).

    We considered using measures of temporary government purchases,

especially defense expenditures, as influences on temporary income and hence

desired national saving rates. Up to this point, however, we have been

unable to isolate important temporary variations in the ratios of real

government purchases to real GDP over the period since 1959 for the ten OECE

countries that we are studying.

    We have had more success by thinking of the relative price of oil as an

indicator of world temporary income. Higher oil prices are bad for oil

importers, which predominate in the ten-country OECD sample. Because higher

oil prices tend to reflect more effective cartelization of the market for

oil, an increase in prices also represents a global distortion that is bad

for the world as a whole. Moreover, high oil prices may be a signal of

disruption of international markets in a sense that goes beyond oil;

therefore the effects on world income may be substantially greater than those

that could be attributed to oil, per Se.

    Our subsequent analysis of real interest rates provides some indication

that the level of the relative price of oil, rather than the change in this

relative price, is the variable that proxies for temporary income. This

result is reasonable if people perceive the relative price of oil to be

stationary; in this case, a high level for the current relative price signals

a temporarily high level. In the actual time series (Figure 7), the relative

price of oil did happen to return after 1985 to values close to those
                                                                           13




applying before 1973. But our direct analysis of the time-series properties

of the relative oil price is inconclusive about stationarity.8

    The empirical analysis uses the variable POILt
                                                           ,   which is the relative
price of crude petroleum for December of the previous year from the U.S.

producer price index. The results do not change significantly if we use

instead a weighted average of relative petroleum prices for each country.

The precise concepts for these prices varied across the countries and the

data for some countries were unavailable for parts of the sample. For these

reasons, we used the U.S. variable in the main analysis.9

    Thinking of POILt1 as an inverse measure of the temporary income ratio,

          the equation for the saving rate becomes




    (5)      (S/Y)t = b0
                           -
                               bi.POILi   +
                                              b2r +   b3.(S/Y)t_i   +   error   term



where the bk's are positive. We assume that, given the stock return,

STOCKt1, the variable POILt1 does not shift investment demand in equation

(2). That is, at least the main effects of oil prices on investment demand

are assumed to be captured by the stock-market variable. With this




8Even if the relative price of oil is non-stationary, the consequences of a
change in the price of oil for world income are likely to be partly
transitory. In particular, the effects on income would tend to diminish as
methods of production adjusted to the new configuration of relative prices.
9The results are also similar if we use the dollar price for Venezuelan crude
instead of the U.S. PPI for crude petroleum. (The Saudi Arabian price is
very close to the Venezuelan price, but the IFS does not report the Saudi
Arabian values after 1984.) The main difference between the Venezuelan and
U.S. series is that the Venezuelan one shows a much larger proportionate
increase in 1973.
                                                                    14




interpretation, the variable POILt      represents a shift to desired saving

that is not simultaneously a shift to investment demand.

    We also assume that the stock-market return, STOCKt         has primarily

permanent effects on income; that is, we neglect effects on the temporary

income ratio, (Y/Y), and thereby on desired saving in equation (4). Civen

this assumption, the variable STOCKt        reflects a shift to investment demand
                                        i

that is not simultaneously a shift to desired saving. In other words, the

variables STOCKi and POILi will allow us to identify the relations for

investment demand and desired saving.

    We might be able to quantify the interplay between stock returns and

temporary income by using measures of current profitability, such as

after-tax corporate profits. That is, we could estimate the implications of

stock returns for the part of temporary income that relates to the difference

between current and expected future profitability. We have thus far been

unsuccessful in obtaining satisfactory measures of corporate profits for some

of the countries in the sample, and therefore have not yet implemented this

idea. (The main data series available from the OECD, called operating

surplus," is an aggregate that is much broader than corporate profits.) The

limited data that we have indicate that current stock returns or other

variables lack significant predictive content for future changes in the ratio

of corporate profits to GDP. Therefore, it may be roughly correct that stock

returns have little interplay with the temporary income that corresponds to

gaps between current and expected future corporate profits.

   We now extend the analysis to consider the effects of monetary and fiscal

variables. We think of these variables as possible influences on the desired

saving rate in equation (4). In some models where money is non-neutral—such
                                                                                              15




as Keynesian models with sticky prices or wages—a higher rate of monetary

expansion raises temporary income and thereby increases the desired saving

rate.10 With respect to fiscal variables, many economists (such as

Blanchard, 1985) argue that increases in public debt or in prospective budget

deficits reduce desired national saving rates.

       Let DMi be a measure of monetary expansion and Fti be a measure of

fiscal expansion, each applying up to the end of year t-1. Then we can

expand the relation for the desired saving rate from equation (5) to



                           -               +         +

The coefficients are defined so that b > 0 applies in the theoretical

arguments discussed above.

      Given our closed-economy assumption (for the ten-country OECD sample), r

is determined by equating the investment-demand ratio, (I/Y) from equation

(3), to the desired saving rate, (S/Y) from equation (6). The reduced-form

relations for r and (I/Y)t are as follows:

'01n the analysis of Mundell (1971), higher monetary expansion leads to
higher expected inflation and thereby to a lower real demand for money. The
reduction in real money balances is assumed to lead to a decrease in consumer
demand and hence to an increase in the desired savin rate. Tobin (1965)
gets an increase in the desired saving rate in a similar manner.

      The reduced form of the model in equations (7) and (8) implies

           1.   Higher stock returns, STOCKt     , raise      r and (I/Y),
           2. Higher oil prices, POILi, raise r but lower (I/Y)t,

           3. Higher monetary growth, DMt1, lowers r and raises (I/Y)t (in

                models where monetary expansion stimulates desired saving),

           4. Greater fiscal expansion, Fri, raises r and lowers (I/Y)t (in

                models where fiscal expansion reduces desired national saving).

Two additional implications that concern lagged dependent variables are more

dependent on the dynamic effects built into the model structure:

           5. The lagged value r1 has positive effects on r and (I/Y)t

                 (because, holding fixed the other variables including

                a higher r1 effectively shifts up investment demand),

           6. The lagged value ('/)1 has a positive effect on

                because of the persistence built into investment demand and

                desired saving. The effect on r is positive if the

                persistence in investment demand is greater than that in

                desired saving; that is, if b3<1.



EmDirical Analysis j ExDected ji Interest Rates                   Investment Ratios
      Table 1 contains means and standard deviations for the main variables

used in the analysis. Table A2 in the appendix has definitions and sources

for the variables. The world ratio of real investment (gross domestic

capital formation) to real CD? appears in Figure 6. We use figures on gross
                                                                17




investment because the data on depreciation are likely to be unreliable. As

with the other world measures, the investment ratio is the GDP-weighted value

of the numbers from the ten OECD countries. World real stock returns

(December-to-December) are in Figure 7, the December values for the relative

price of oil are in Figure 8, and world growth rates of Ml (December-to-

December) are in Figure 9.

    Figures 10-13 show various measures of fiscal stance. Figure 10 plots

the ratios of real central government debt to real GD? for the United States

and the nine other OECD countries.'1   (We presently lack data for 1988 on the

debt of some of the countries.) Note that the pattern for the United States

is broadly similar to that for the average of the other countries. Note also

that the U.S. debt-QDP ratio peaked in 1987 and fell in 1988.

    We define the real budget deficit to be the change during the year in the

central government's outstanding real debt. Figure 11 shows world values for

this concept of the real budget deficit when expressed as a ratio to real

GD?. We plot the actual and cyclically-adjusted values of the ratio. The

cyclically-adjusted values are the residuals from a regression for each

country over 1958-87 of the real deficit-real GDP ratio on the current and

four annual lags of the growth rate of real GD?.

    Figures 12 and 13 compare the U.S. ratios for real budget deficits to

real GDP with those for the nine other countries. Figure 12, which plots




''We lack data on debt for consolidated general government on a consistent
basis for the ten countries in the sample. The figures that we used, which
were computed in most cases from IFS numbers on the par value of the

holdings by central banks, certain government agencies, and local
governments.

ratios for actual real budget deficits, shows that the recent U.S. experience

did not depart greatly from that for the average of the other nine countries.

Figure 13 shows, however, that recent values for the cyclically-adjusted U.S.

ratios were substantially higher than those for the average of the other nine

countries. On the other hand, the adjusted U.S. ratio fell from 4.07. in 1986

to 1.97. in 1987 and 1.07. in 1988.




Reduced-Form Estimates           World Expected Real Interest

    We begin the empirical analysis with reduced-form equations for the world

(nine-country) expected real interest rate, rd, over the period 1959 to

1988. Table 2, col. 1, shows a regression of the form of equation (7), but

with monetary and fiscal variables excluded. The estimated coefficients of

STOCKWdt1 (.041, s.e. = .011) and POILi (.029, s.e. = .009) are each

positive and significant, with t-values of 3.7 and 3.1, respectively. Not

surprisingly, the estimated coefficient of rdt1 is also positive and

highly significant (.58, s.e. =   .10).    The estimated coefficient of

(L')wd,t..1 is positive (.22, s.e. =      .15),   but not statistically significant

at the 57. level.

    Table 2, cól. 2 adds the monetary variable, DMWdt1, which is the

GDP- weighted average of world Ml growth through December of the previous

year.'2 We were surprised to find that DMWdt1 entered negatively and


'2We also examined the growth rates of currency and nominal GNP as
alternative measures of monetary stimulus. If the growth rate of currency
through the end of year t-1 is added to the basic regression from Table 2,
col. 2 (which includes Ml rowth for year t-1), the estimated coefficient of
the new variable is insignificant and the other results change little. If
the growth rate of world nominal GDP for year t-1 is added to the basic
regression, the estimated coefficient of the new variable is - .167, s.e. =
.093, t-value = 1.8. The other results change little; in particular, the
                                                                    19




significantly in the regression for rdt (- .251, s.e. = .054, t-value =

4.7).    (We were surprised because previous research suggested difficulty in

isolating these kinds of monetary effects; see, for example, Barro [1981].)

Moreover, when DMWdtl is added to the regression, the estimated

coefficients for the other variables become more significant: the t-values

are now 6.7 for STOCKWdt1 (.064, S.C. = .009)13 and 5.5 for POILi (.039,

s.e. =   .007).'4   The estimated coefficient of 1/)d,t-i also becomes

significantly positive (.49, s.e. =   .12),   with a t-value of 3.9.

    It is possible that the apparent effect of Ml growth represents some kind

of endogenous response of money to the economy, rather than the influence of

exogenous monetary growth on real interest rates. Our failure in the next

section to find the predicted positive relation between DMwdtl and the

investment ratio, (I/Y)t, may support alternative interpretations based on

endogenous money. We carried out some analysis of monetary reaction




estimated coefficient of DMwd       is -   .250, s.e. = .051, which is virtually
unchanged from that shown in Table 2, col. 2. (The world rowth rates of Ml
and nominal CDP are essentially orthogonal.) The nearly significant negative
coefficient on the lag of nominal GDP growth may indicate that exogenous
shifts in velocity have negative effects on expected real interest rates.
'3The estimated coefficient of STOCKwd         changes little if the individual
stock returns are weighted by each coutry's share of world investment,
rather than GDP. With investment weights, the estimated coefficient of
STOCKWdt1 is .060, s.e. = .010.

l4Jf we add the second lag value, POILt2, the estimated coefficient is
-
 .023, s.e. = .020. The hypothesis that only the change in the relative
price of oil, POILt1-POILt2, matters is rejected at the 57. level (t-value =
2.7).  If we replace the U.S. relative price of oil by a GDP- weighted average
of individual country relative prices, the estimated coefficient of POILi

becomes .042, s.e. = .010 (and the ft2 of the regression falls from .892 to
.875).
                                                                 20




functions; these results indicate a negative response of monetary growth to

oil prices axid stock returns, but not to lags of expected real interest rates

or investment ratios. (DMwd,t is itself serially uncorrelated; see Figure

9.) Because we already held fixed the stock market and oil prices in the

regression for rdt, we do not see how our findings about monetary reaction

can explain the relation between DMwdtl and rdt based on a story about

endogenous money. Monetary growth would have to be reflecting information

about future real interest rates that is not already contained in the other

explanatory variables.

    The explanatory power of DMWdt1 for rwdt reflects in part the well-

known cutback in world Ml growth in 1979 and 1980 (6.87. and 5.37.,

respectively, compared with a mean of 8.07. for 1959-88). This monetary

contraction matches up well with the increase in rwdt from 0.97. in 1979 to

2.47. in 1980 and 4.77. in 1981. (With the monetary variable excluded in Table

2, col. 1, the fitted values of rd for 1980 and 1981 are 2.07. and 3.47.,

respectively. With the monetary variable included in col. 2, these fitted

values become 2.57. and 4.47..) On the other hand, the significance of

DMwdtl in the regression for rWd does not depend on the inclusion of the

observations for 1980-81. If these two years are omitted, the estimated

coefficient of DMwdtl becomes - .233, s.e. = .066, and the other results do

not change much from those shown in column 2.

    We have carried out the estimation using the realized real interest rate,

       rather than our constructed measure of the expected rate, rdt. The

error term in the regression can then be viewed as including the discrepancy

between the actual and expected real rate. Under rational expectations, this

expectational error would be independent of the explanatory variables, which
                                                                 21




are all lagged values. The estimates would therefore be consistent, but

inefficient relative to a situation where rd,t is observed directly and used

as the dependent variable. Although the standard errors of the estimated

coefficients are substantially higher where rWd replaces     rWd as the
dependent variable, the basic pattern of the results remains the same. Thus,

the findings do not depend on our particular measure for expected inflation.

    Overall, the regression equation in Table 2, col. 2 does a remarkable job

of explaining the variations in expected real interest rates from 1959 to

1988; see Figure 14 for a plot of actual values against fitted values and

residuals. Note that the out-of-sample forecast of Fwdt for 1989 is 3.27.

compared to an actual of 3.57.; for 1988, the estimated value was 1.97. and the

actual was 2.37..   (We promise that we generated the forecast for 1989 before

finding the data on the actual value.)

    We will discuss more features of the results later, but some key elements

for the 1980s are the generally favorable stock-market returns combined with

high oil prices. (Blanchard and Summers, 1984, argued that improved

prospects for profitability—which we pick up in the stock-market returns—

were an important element in the high real interest rates of the 1980s.) The

experience for-the 1980s contrasts with the extremely poor stock returns and

lower oil prices that prevailed in the mid 1970s. On the other hand, the

1960s featured still lower oil prices, but better stock returns than in the

mid 1970s.

    Columns 3 and 4 add fiscal variables to the regression for           Column

3 shows a positive but insignificant coefficient on the world debt-GDP ratio,

RDEBTYWdt1, and a negative but insignificant coefficient on the world ratio
                                                                   22




of real budget deficits to real CD?, RDEFYWdt1.'5 The F-statistic for the

inclusion of the two fiscal variables jointly is F2 =    1.6   (57. critical

value =   3.4).   Column 4 replaces RDEFYWd   with the cyclically-adjusted

variable, RDEFYAWd,t_l. The adjustment of real deficits for cyclical factors

would be desirable in the present context if the removal of these factors

raises the forecasting power for future ratios of real deficits to real GD?.

The estimated coefficient on RDEFYAWdt1 is close to zero, and that on

RDEBTYWdt1 remains positive but insignificant. The F-statistic for the

inclusion of the two fiscal variables is now only F2 =   0.3.
    The real budget deficit is effectively an adjustment of the nominal

deficit for the effect of actual inflation on the outstanding nominal debt.

An adjustment for expected rather than actual inflation is likely to be

preferable from the standpoint of forecasting future real budget deficits

(because unexpected inflation is unpredictable). We calculated ratios of

real budget deficits to real CDP (adjusted or unadjusted for cyclical

fluctuations) in this manner, but the results differed negligibly from those

found with actual inflation.

    We also held fixed the ratio of government consumption purchases to GD?

(which entered insignificantly) and experimented with the inclusion of

current or future real budget deficits. In all cases we obtained similar

results; the measures of fiscal stance that we have considered do not help

significantly in explaining the time series for expected real interest rates.

We are forced to conclude that the evidence supports the Iticardian view,



'5Negative estimated effects of budget-deficit variables on interest rates
were reported previously by Evans (1987) (for nominal rates in six OECD
countries) and Plosser (1987)(for nominal and real rates in the United
States).
                                                                  23




which deemphasizes the roles of public debt and budget deficits in the

determination of real interest rates.

    Column 5 in Table 2 uses the world nominal interest rate, Rwdt, as the

dependent variable and adds the constructed measure of world expected

inflation, Twdt, on the right side. Measurement error in               would bias

the estimated coefficient toward zero, but the estimated value (.89, s.e. =

.09) differs insignificantly from one. Of course, to the extent that
countries levy taxes on nominal interest payments, the predicted coefficient

would be somewhat above unity.

    We tested for the stability of the relation between rdt and the

explanatory variables by estimating the specification from Table 2, col. 2

separately for 1959-72 and 1973-88. Thus, we split the sample before the oil

crises and the main changes in the international monetary system. The

estimates for the two sub-periods appear in columns 6 and 7 of the table.

The test for stability leads to the statistic F8 =   0.2;   thus, we do not

reject the hypothesis that the same equation applies over both periods. To

some extent, the failure to reject reflects the high standard errors that

apply to the estimated coefficients for 1959-72 (col. 6). For example, the

standard error for the estimated coefficient of POILt1 is enormous because

of the small variations in relative oil prices from 1958 to 1971 (see Figure

7).16 On the other hand, the data for 1959-72 do generate marginally




16The estimated coefficient of POILt1 differs insignificantly from zero for
samples that bein in 1959 and end as recently as 1979; for the 1959- 79
sample, the estimated coefficient is - .003, s.e. = .034. If the sample ends
in 1980, the estimated coefficient becomes .029, s.e. = .018. For samples
that end between 1981 and 1988, the estimated coefficient is very stable,
varying between .038 and .040 with a standard error between .007 and .010.

Reduced-Form Estimates IQL World Investment Ratio

   We now consider the reduced form for the investment ratio in equation

(8). Table 3 shows regressions over 1959-88 for the world ratio of real

investment to real GDP,              The explanatory variables in these

equations are the same as those used in Table 2. In the regression shown in

Table 3, column 2, the main results are a significantly positive effect from

STOCKwdt1 (.034, s.e. =   .011),'7   a significantly negative effect from

P0ILi (- .017, s.e. = .008), and a significantly positive effect from the
lagged dependent variable "wd,t-1 (.79, s.e. = .14).        The estimated

coefficients of rWd1 (.00, s.e. = .08) and DMwdtl (.022, s.e. = .060)

are insignificant. Figure 14 plots the actual values for "1wd,t along

with the estimated values and residuals.

   The results on the world investment ratio are consistent with the

hypothesis that more favorable stock returns raise investment (along with

raising real interest rates) and that higher oil prices reduce investment

(along with increasing real interest rates). On the other hand, although we

found before that the expected real interest rate was negatively related to

last year's monetary growth, the results do not reveal the expected positive

response of the investment ratio.




'7Previous results of a similar nature for the United States were reported by
Faxna (1981). Barro (1990) reports analogous findings for the United States
and Canada.

   Columns 3 and 4 of Table 3 add the fiscal variables that we considered

before; col. 3 uses the world variable for ratios of real budget deficits to

real GDP, and col. 4 the variable for cyclically-adjusted ratios. The

estimated effect of the debt-GDP ratio, RDEBTYWd,t1, is negative but

insignificant in both cases. The estimated effects of the budget-deficit

variables, RDEFYWd,t1 and RDEFYAWd,t1, are each significantly positive;

that is, the sign opposite to that predicted by models where fiscal expansion

lowers the desired national saving rate. The positive effect for the

unadjusted variable, RDEFYWdt1, accords with the negative coefficient for

this variable in the interest-rate equation (Table 2, col. 3). However, the

cyclically-adjusted variable, RDEFYAWdt1, had a coefficient of about zero

in the interest-rate equation (Table 2, col. 4). The fiscal variables

considered are jointly insignificant for the investment ratio at the 57.

level. In the regression shown in Table 3, col. 3, the statistic is

    = 3.2 (57. critical value =   3.4).   For that in col. 4, the statistic is

F2 = 2.6.   Thus, as with the expected real interest rate, the fiscal

variables do not have much explanatory power for the investment ratio.

    We fit the equation for the investment ratio (Table 3, col. 2) separately

over 1959-72 and 1973-88. A test of stability for the coefficients yields

the statistic F8 =   1.7   (57 critical value =   2.7).   Columns 5 and 6 show the

estimates obtained over the two sub-periods. The standard errors for the

estimated coefficients from the 1959-72 sample tend to be high; however, the

estimated coefficient of STOCKWd,t1 is positive (.018, s.e. =         .011).

equations (7) and (8) for the expected real interest rate and investment

ratio. In the previous sections, we estimated the two reduced-form equations

separately, ignoring the overidentifying restrictions that came from the

structure. In this section we estimate the two equations as a joint system,

allowing for the imposition of the model's restrictions as well as for

correlation of the error terms across the equations. Table 4 shows the

resulting estimates for the structural coefficients that appear in equation

(3) for investment demand and in equation (6) for desired saving. Columns 1

and 2 apply to a system that includes monetary growth but excludes fiscal

variables. Columns 3 and 4 add two fiscal variables: the debt-GDP ratio,

RDEBTYwdtl and the cyclically-adjusted real deficit-real GDP ratio,

RDEFYA
         wd,t- 1
      We also fit the joint systems for the expected real interest rate and the

investment ratio without the restrictions imposed by the structural model.

Thereby we were able to compute likelihood-ratio tests of the overidentifying

restrictions. For the model without fiscal variables, the test statistic

(for -2log[likelihood ratio]) of 9.9 compared to a 57. critical value from

the       distribution with 5 degrees of freedom of 11.1. In the model with

fiscal variables, the test statistic of 13.7 compared to the 57. critical

value (with 7 d.f.) of 14.1. Thus, the model's restrictions were not

rejected at the 57. level in either case. Table 4 also compares the fits (in

terms of R2 and o values) for restricted and unrestricted forms of each

equation separately. The fits for the investment equation appear

substantially more sensitive than those for the interest-rate equation to the

imposition of the model's overidentifying restrictions.
                                                                       27




      The two fiscal variables are jointly insignificant when added to the

restricted joint system (likelihood-ratio statistic of 5.3 compared to a 57.

critical value of 6.0). Since the other results are not sensitive to the

exclusion of the fiscal variables, we focus now on the estimates from the

model that excludes the fiscal variables (columns 1 and 2 of Table 4).

      If one takes the structural model seriously, then two interesting results

are the estimated responsiveness of the desired saving rate to the expected

real interest rate (.34, s.e. =         .07 from Table 4, col. 2) and the estimated
reaction of the investment-demand ratio to the expected real interest rate

(-   .44,   s.e. =   .13,   from col. 1). The last coefficient has to be interpreted

as the effect of r:d,t on the investment-demand ratio while holding fixed the

value of the stock market. (Recall that, when the stock return is an

imperfect measure of Aq, the variable r-r1 provides some independent

information about Aq.) The dependence of the stock return on rwdt-rwdtl

suggests that the estimated coefficient -        .44 would underestimate the
magnitude of the response of the investment-demand ratio to rwdt while

holding fixed expected profitability, PROF, and the risk premium,              but
not the value of the stock market.'8

      The estimated model implies that desired national (gross) saving rates

rise by .34 percentage points for each percentage-point increase in r.

Although this form provides a natural unit for thinking of the responsiveness

of saving rates to real interest rates, it appears to be more common to think

in terms of elasticities. Because the sample mean of 11Wdt is .23, while

that for rd,t is only .020, the implied elasticities are small; only .03 at

the sample means. The calculated elasticities would, however, tend to be

substantially greater for net saving rates.

    Column 1 of Table 4 shows that the estimated effect of STOCKWdt1 on the

investment-demand ratio is .051, s.e. = .010.        Since the sample standard

deviation of STOCKwdt1 is .16, the result means that a 1 s.d. move in the

stock market changes the investment-demand ratio by .008 compared to a sample

s.d. for 11wdt of .013. The estimated effect of POILt_i on the desired

saving rate in col. 2 is -   .033, s.e. = .006.    Given the sample s.d. for

POILt1 of .21, a 1 s.d. move in the relative oil price implies a shift in

the desired saving rate by .007.

    Columns 1 and 2 show that the estimated effects of the lagged dependent

variable, 11flwd,t-1' are 1 for the investment-demand ratio (as constrained

by the model) and .58, s.c. =    .08,    for the desired saving rate. The greater

persistence of investment demand than of desired saving generates the

positive relation in the reduced form between rWd, and (1/)d,t-i If the

coefficient on (1I)d,t-i in the investment-demand equation is freed up, the

estimated value is .93, s.e. =    .11.     In this case, the estimated coefficient

   '/)i,-1 in the saving-rate equation becomes .55, s.c. = .09.            Thus,

this unrestricted version of the model does indicate significantly greater

persistence in investment demand than in desired saving.

    Column 2 shows the positive estimated effect for DMWd,t1 on the desired

saving rate (.183, s.c. =    .037).     The previous discussion of the reduced form

indicated that this estimate stems from the negative relation between rd

and DMwdtl, and not from any relation between (1/)Wdt and

    Column 4 of Table 4 shows that the estimated effect of the debt-GOP ratio

on the desired saving rate is negative but insignificant (- .026, s.e. =

.015).     The cyclically-adjusted deficit variable has a positive and

marginally significant estimated effect on desired saving (.144, s.e. =

.077).     This "wrong sign accords with the results discussed before in

Table 3.

    We can use the estimated model for the expected real interest rate and

the investment ratio to assess the frequently-asked question: "why have real

interest rates been so high in the 1980s?" We approach this question by

comparing the period, 1981-86, during which the average value of rdt was

4.27., with an earlier reference period of equal length, 1975-80, during which

the average of rd,t was 0.37.. Hence we seek to explain the increase in the

average expected real interest rate from 1975-80 to 1981-86 by 3.9 percentage

points.

    According to the model, the differences in averages of expected real

interest rates should be explicable mainly in terms of differences in

stock-market returns, oil prices, and monetary growth. Some role would also

be played by differences in initial conditions for rdt1 and ('/)wd,t-1

(in 1981 compared to 1975). Note from Table 5 that the averages for

STOCKwd,t_l were 7.7% in 1981-86 versus -6.27, in 1975-80, those     for POILi
were 0.93 in 1981-86 versus 0.61 in 1975-80, and those for DMWd,t1 were
                                                                    30




7.917,   in   1981-86 versus 8.807. in 1975-80. The differences in initial

conditions were .0245 for rd,t1 in 1981 versus .0061 in 1975, and .226 for

                 in 1981 versus .249 in 1975.

    We can simulate the estimated model to estimate the extent to which the

higher average for rWdt in 1981-86 than in 1975-80 can be attributed to

differences in STOCKWd                              and the initial conditions for
                                 POILt 1 DMw
rd1 and                       We consider the restricted version of the joint

model as reported in Table 4 and also the unrestricted version that does not

impose the overidentifying restrictions from the structure. We also neglect

any interplay among STOCKWdt, POILt, and DMWdt; that is, we treat the time

paths of these three variables as exogenous.'9

    Given the actual time paths for STOCKWdt, POILt, and DMWdt, and the

actual values for rdt1 and (1/)d,t-i in 1981 and 1975, dynamic

simulations of the restricted model for 1981-86 and 1975-80 predict an

increase in the average of rd of 3.8 percentage points compared to the

actual increase of 3.9 points (see the columns labeled "simulated total" and

"actual" in section I of Table 5). We then dynamically simulated the

restricted model for 1981-86 with the values of STOCKwdt1 from 1975-80

substituted year by year for those in 1981-86. This simulation implied that




'9We do find a significant negative relation between stock returns for year t
and the change in oil prices during year t. Also, Ml growth has significant
negative reactions to the contemporaneous change in oil prices and to lagged
stock returns. We can filter the stock returns to compute the component
exogenous to oil-price changes, and we can filter Ml growth to calculate the
part exogenous to oil-price changes and lagged stock returns. In the
discussion below we attribute changes in expected real interest rates and
investment ratios to the behavior of stock returns, oil prices, and monetary
rowth. The breakdown aznon these three variables would change if we shifted
from gross numbers to the filtered values.
                                                                31




2.5 percentage points of the increase in the average of rd from 1975-80 to

1981- 86 derived from the higher average for stock returns in the latter

period (see the column labeled "STOCK" in the table).2° Similarly, we found

that 1.9 percentage points of the rise in the average of rd resulted from

the increase in average oil prices (the column "POlL"), 0.3 points from the

lower average monetary growth (the column "DM"), and -0.9 points from the

differences in initial conditions. The main change in the initial conditions

is the much lower value for (")wd,t..1 in 1981 than in 1975; this effect by

itself would have lowered real interest rates for 1981-86. The results from

simulations of the unrestricted model, shown in Table 5, are basically

similar.

    Table 5 also indicates the simulated results for investment ratios. The

restricted model predicts that the average of "wd,t for 1981-86 would be

0.9 percentage points below the average for 1975-80, compared to the actual

shortfall of 1.1 points. The simulations attribute 0.9 percentage points of

the decline in the average investment ratio to higher oil prices, -1.4 points

to the more favorable stock returns (which, by themselves, would have raised

the investment ratio), 0.2 points to lower monetary growth, and 1.2 points to

differences in initial conditions. The main element in the initial

conditions is again the lower value for (1/)d,t-1 in 1981 than in 1975.

The results from the unrestricted model are again similar.




20The results depend not only on differences in the average value of
STOCKWd
             but also on differences in the time pattern. It is possible for
the similated effects to go in the direction opposite to that suggested just
from a comparison of means.

        were expected xe.i   interest   rates i .jii   1975- 80?

    We now compare the low average for rd in 1975-80, 0.37., with the

higher value, 2.57., that prevailed during an earlier reference period of the

same length, 1965-70. (The results are similar if we pick alternative

six-year reference periods in the 1960s or early 1970s.) Section II of Table

5 shows that simulations of the restricted model predict a decline of only

1.3 percentage points in the average of rdt from 1965-70 to 1975-80

compared with the actual decrease of 2.2 points. The model attributes 1.8

percentage points of the decline to lower stock returns, -1.1 points to

higher oil prices (which, by themselves, would have raised expected real

interest rates), 0.7 points to higher monetary growth, and -0.1 points to

differences in initial conditions. The results from the unrestricted model

are similar.



    Overall, the largest factor behind the differences in expected real

interest rates among the three periods, 1965-70, 1975-80, and 1981-86, is the

variation in stock returns. The fall in real interest rates from 1965- 70 to

1975- 80 goes along with a worsening of stock returns (from 0.97. to -6.27.),

and the steep rise in rates in 1981-86 reflects sharply higher stock returns

(7.77.). The movements in oil prices are also important, although higher oil

prices in 1975-80 compared to 1965-70 partially counteract the movement to

lower real interest rates. The increase in oil price in 1981-86 compared to

1975-80 reinforces the stock market in generating a shift toward higher real

interest rates.
                                                                   33

    The average of rd,t fell by 1.7 percentage points from 1985-86 to

1987-88 and then rose by 1.1 percentage points from 1988 to 1989. Sections

III and IV of Table 5 contain simulations for these periods. The dominant

factor behind the decline in real interest rates in 1987-88 is the fall in

oil prices. The main element underlying the rise in real rates in 1989 is

the much more favorable stock return in 1988 (15.07.) compared to 1987

(-8.27.).

    We have assembled nearly complete data for 1989 on the variables

STOCKWdt, POIL, DMWdt, 11d,t' and rd,t. Using these values, we can
use the model to forecast the expected real interest rate and investment

ratio for 1990. Remarkably, the restricted model implies a predicted value

for rWd of 5.67. (5.57. from the unrestricted model). The forecast from the

restricted model for 1990 not only constitutes an increase by 2.1 percentage

points in rwd,t from the value prevailing in 1989, it also represents a level

that is almost a full percentage point above the highest value of the entire

previous sample, 1958-89. The five determinants of rWd in the model turn

out all to point in the direction of higher real interest rates in 1990: the

favorable stock return (17.47. in 1989 versus 14.87. in 1988) accounts for 0.1

percentage point, the increase in oil prices (.525 versus .406) for 0.5

percentage point, reduced monetary growth (3.27. versus 6.67.) for 0.8

percentage point, and the change in initial conditions (the rise in

from .242 in 1988 to .247 in 1989 and the increase in rdt from .023 in 1988

to .035 in 1989) accounts for 0.9 percentage point. Needless to say, this

prediction of a rise in the expected real interest rate to a range not seen

at least in the last thirty years will provide a severe test of the model.
                                                                 34




With respect to the investment ratio, the restricted model predicts little

change from 1989 (.246 in 1990 versus .247 in 1989), whereas the unrestricted

model projects an increase by 0.3 percentage point.



    Given the stress on fluctuations in the stock market, we would like to

know what fundamental factors underlie these fluctuations. (We would, of

course, also like to understand the forces that lead to changes in oil prices

and monetary growth.) We interpret stock returns as reflecting changes in

the expected profitability of investment, PROF, and in the risk premium,

We plan to use data on actual profitability to separate the influences from

these two channels. At this point, we can only note that the fluctuations in

stock prices could derive from technological innovations, changing conditions

of labor markets or international competition, shifts in government policies

with regard to taxation and regulation, and so on. Although we have not

isolated the main forces that influence stock returns, the findings suggest

that these forces are crucial for the determination of expected real interest

rates and investment ratios.




Systems     Individual Countriest Expected Real Interest Rates

    In the world model with an integrated capital market, "the" expected real

interest rate depends on world variables, which include world aggregates of

stock returns and monetary growth and the world price of oil. Thus, the

reduced form in equation (7) gives an expression for r in terms of these

world variables. In practice, we observe individual time series,       for

each country i. In the previous analysis we combined these observations into

a world index,        that gives more weight to countries with higher shares
                                                                 35




in world real GDP. Then we related this world index to the world influences

suggested by the structural model.

    We can think of each country's expected real interest rate as determined

by the hypothetical world rate—which depends on world variables in the

manner suggested by the structural model—plus some own-country factors.

That is,



    (11)                        rt =   r   +




where      represents variables particular to country i and r depends on the

world variables as in the previous analysis. Unless the        are random

errors that are perfectly correlated across the countries, we would get more

efficient estimates of the determinants of r by using all the individual

observations on the     for the nine countries, instead of combining

everything into the world weighted average, rdt. That is, we can think of

equation (11) as a system of nine equations, and we can estimate the

variance-covariance structure of the error terms,        along with the

estimation of the coefficients for the variables that determine r.

    When we look empirically at the values of       for an individual country,

we typically find a good deal of serial persistence about the rate, r, that

can be explained by worldwide forces. We can allow for this effect more or

less equivalently by including ri as an element of x1 or by treating

as an error term that is serially correlated. Because it is simpler in the

systems discussed below and also delivers somewhat better fits (at least

relative to an AR(1) model for the xt), we take the approach of including
                                                                 36




rti as a regressor.2' We do not make any structural interpretations for

the statistical significance of this lagged dependent variable. It could

reflect a variety of own-country forces that we do not hold constant,

including serially-correlated measurement error in nominal interest rates or

expected inflation and persisting differences across countries in riskiness

of real returns or the tax treatment of these returns.

    If the world capital and goods markets are fully integrated, shifts to a

single country's investment demand or desired saving affect the expected rea1

interest rate only to the extent that these shifts affect the world aggregate

of investment demand or desired saving. Therefore, own-country variables

like country i's stock return and monetary growth would matter for rt only

to the extent that they contribute to the world aggregates of stock returns

and monetary growth. With the world variables held constant, the importance

of these own-country variables for rt will provide some evidence about the

extent of country i's integration into world markets. If the own-country

variables are unimportant for country i, we cannot conclude unambiguously

that country i is well integrated. That is, country i could be isolated from

the rest of the world, but rt may nevertheless be insensitive to the

own-country explanatory variables that we consider. We get clearer evidence

from observations in the reverse direction. If rt depends in an important

way on the own-country variables for country i, then we have an indication

that the country is not well integrated into world markets.




2tOnce we hold fixed         the determinants of r1 (which are second lags

of the world variables) are insignificant in the equations for
                                                               37




   Table 6 contains system estimates for      for nine countries over

1959-88. The estimation is by generalized least squares, which allows for

estimation of each country's error variance and of contemporaneous

covariances across the countries. Roughly speaking, the method of estimation

differs from that in Table 2 in that the weight for each country now depends

mainly on the estimated error variance, rather than on the relative GDP.

    We begin with a model that, aside from        and individual constants

for each country, includes only the world variables that we considered

before; STOCKWd,t1, POILt1, "'wd,t-1' and DMwdtl. These results are
in column 1 of Table 6. The estimated coefficients on each of the

independent variables, including the lagged dependent variable, are

constrained to be the same for each country. In this form, the estimates are

similar to those from the comparable equation for rwdt (Table 2, col. 2).

The main difference (with the increase in the overall number of observations

from 30 to 270) is the reduction in the standard errors for the estimated

coefficients.

    Column 2 of Table 6 adds three own-country variables: STOCKti,

            and DM,t_i. (We assume that POILt1 takes on the same value for

each country; therefore, we cannot distinguish world from own-country values

in this case.) We constrain the coefficients of the three own variables to

be the same across the nine countries. In this form, a test of the

hypothesis that the coefficients on the three own-country variables are all

zero leads to the likelihood-ratio statistic 2.7 compared to the 57. critical

value of 7.8. Thus, we accept the hypothesis that own-country expected real

interest rates depend on the world variables and not on the own-country
variables (aside from the individual constant and the lagged dependent

variable).

    Column 3 of Table 6 retains the three own-country variables added in

column 2, but deletes the corresponding three world variables, STOCKWd,t1,

             and DMWdt1. A test of the hypothesis that the coefficients of

these three world variables are all zero leads to the likelihood-ratio

statistic 27.8 compared to the 57. critical value of 7.8. Therefore, the data

reject the hypothesis that own-country expected real interest rates depend on

the own-country variables and not on the world variables.

    Overall, the results in columns 1-3 provide evidence that individual

country expected real interest rates depend more on worldwide forces than on

own-country forces. In this sense, the results suggest that the nine OECD

countries were operating to a considerable extent on integrated world

markets. Note, however, that the results presented thus far apply when all

countries are constrained to have the same coefficients on the world and

own-country variables (aside from an individual constant term).

    Se tested whether the system regression in Table 5, col. I was stable

over the periods 1959-72 and 1973-88. The test for equality of coefficients

over the two samples is accepted (likelihood-ratio statistic of 8.8, 571

critical value with 14 restrictions of 23.7.).

    Column 4 of Table 6 constrains the constant terms to be the same across

the countries. The hypothesis of equality is strongly rejected: the

likelihood-ratio statistic is 48.1 compared to a 57. critical value of 15.5.

In this sense, we confirm the general belief that the average levels of

expected real interest rates differed significantly across the nine

countries.
    Columns 5 and 6 of the table add the world fiscal variables, which we

considered before. The results are similar to those found for the world real

interest rate in Table 2: the debt variable is insignificant, the unadjusted

deficit variable is significantly negative (-   .23,   s.e. =   .07   in Table 5, col.

5), and the cyclically-adjusted deficit variable is insignificant (col. 6).

   Column 7 of Table 6 uses nominal interest rates, Rt, as dependent

variables and adds the expected inflation rate, i1, on the right side. The

estimated coefficient on r (constrained to be the same across the

countries) is now significantly less than one:     .562, s.e. =       .034.   To some

extent, this result is sensitive to the U.K. data, which exhibit sharply

negative values for      in the mid 1970s. If the U.K. is allowed to have its

own coefficient on wkt, the estimated coefficient on zkt is .42, s.e. =

.05, and that on      for the other eight countries rises to .68, s.e. =          .04.

Our conjecture is that the departure of this estimated coefficient from unity

reflects measurement error in the construction of expected inflation.

    Columns 1 and 2 of Table 7 provide statistics (ft2 and )          for   the

individual countries for the system regression from Table 6, col. 1. Note

that the model explains virtually none of the variations in expected real

interest rates for Japan. For the U.K., the high value of             seems to reflect

mainly the large negative numbers for rk in the mid 1970s. The model

cannot explain these values; a finding that is reasonable if these

observations reflect incorrect estimates of

    We tested the hypothesis that the nine countries have the same

coefficients on the four world variables, STOCKWdt1, POILt1, (1/d,t-i'

and DMWdt1, and the lagged dependent variable,                   If we relax this

restriction for one country at a time (with the other eight still restricted
                                                                  40




to have equal coefficients), we get the likelihood-ratio statistics shown in

column 3 of Table 7. At the 57. critical level (with 5 restrictions), the

hypothesis of equality is rejected for only two countries, Canada and

Germany. For Canada, the main reason for rejection is that, unlike the other

countries, the unrestricted coefficient estimate for the lagged dependent

variable is close to zero (-   .05, s.e. = .08).
    An overall test for equality of coefficients across the nine countries

(40 restrictions) leads to the likelihood-ratio statistic of 83.1 compared to

the 57. critical value of 55.5. Thus, the model fails to pass the test that

each country's expected real interest rate reacts in the same way to the four

world variables and the lagged dependent variable. Columns 4 and 5 of Table

7 show the fit statistics (R2 and o) for each country in the unrestricted

form. The largest changes from columns 1 and 2 (Canada, Germany, Japan, and

the U.K.) correspond to the likelihood-ratio statistics shown in column 3.

    We also allowed each country to depend in an individual way on its own

variables. We constrained the coefficients on the world variables and the

lagged dependent variable to be the same across the countries, but we allowed

country i to have its own coefficients on the three variables: STOCKti -

STOCKWdt1, ('/),-1       - (1/)d,t-1'     and DM1
                                                    -
                                                        DMWdt1.    By entering

these variables as deviations from their world counterparts we constrained

each country to react in the same way to equal changes in world and own

variables; for example, to an equal increase in STOCKWd,t1 and STOCKIt1.

But we allowed       to react in an individual way to a shift in the

own-country variable, say STOCK,ti, for a given value of the world

variable. Presumably, the more a country is isolated from world markets the

greater will tend to be the reaction of rt to the own variables.
                                                                   41




   We first introduced the own-country variables for one country at a time.

Own variables (except for the constant and the lagged dependent variable)

were excluded for the other eight countries. (Recall that the coefficients

of the world variables and of the lagged dependent variable were constrained

to be equal for all nine countries.) Column 6 of Table 7 shows likelihood-

ratio statistics for tests of the hypothesis that the coefficients of the

three own-country variables are all zero. We accept this hypothesis at the

57. critical level for all countries except Japan and the U.K. Thus, the

results suggest   that   these two countries were particularly isolated (for at

least part of the sample) from international markets.

    We also introduced the three own-country variables simultaneously for all

nine countries. Individual coefficients on these variables were estimated

for each country. An overall test that all of these coefficients were zero

(27 restrictions) led to the likelihood-ratio statistic 74.4 compared to the

57. critical value of 40.1. Thus, the model fails to pass the test that

own- country expected real interest rates are unresponsive in an individual

way to own-country variables (given common reactions to world variables and

the lagged dependent variable). Columns 7 and 8 of Table 7 show fit

statistics (R2 and u) for each country in the model that allows individual

coefficients for all countries on the three own variables. The largest

changes from columns 1 and 2 (Japan and the U.K.) correspond to the

likelihood-ratio statistics shown in column 6.



Systems j Individual Countries' Investment Ratios

    We now relate the investment ratio for each of the ten countries,

         to world and own-country variables. Unlike for the expected real
                                                                       42




interest rate,        the null hypothesis under integrated world markets is not

that (I/Y)t depends only on world variables. (I/Y) would depend on any

variable that influences own-country investment demand—notably, the

own-country stock return, STOCK1,t1, and the lagged investment ratio,

(I/Y),ti_and on world variables through their influence on the world

expected real interest rate. Given the world variables (and hence the world

expected real interest rate), (I/Y)1t would be independent of influences on

country i's desired saving rate. Because POILt 1 is a common influence

across countries, the only variable of this type in the previous analysis was

own-country monetary growth, DMi. (The own-country fiscal variables
would also be in this category, but the fiscal variables were found to be

unimportant in general.)

    Table 8 shows the results for (I/Y)t for the ten-country system of

investment ratios over the period 1959-88. The independent variables are

POILti; the world and own-country lagged values of STOCK, (I/Y), and DM;

            and   individual constant terms. The regression in column 1 shows a
rWd, i;22
significant, positive effect for STOCK1          (.017,   s.e. =   .003).   This result

can be interpreted as an effect from changes in the expected profitability of

investment in country i (or possibly changes in the risk premium applicable

to these investments). On the other hand, the estimated coefficient of

STOCKWdt1 is also positive:       .017, s.e. =   .008.    If the own-country stock




22Because the expected real interest rate is unavailable for Italy we entered
rd1 for each country. The results change little if we also include

ri in the nine-country system that excludes Italy. That is, lags of
expected real interest rates are unimportant in general for the investment
ratios.
                                                                        43




return holds constant the expected profitability of investment

(risk-adjusted), then the world stock return would influence (I/Y) only

through its effect on world expected real interest rates; that is, the effect

of STOCKWdt1 on (I/Y) would be negative. It is possible, however, that

stock returns in other countries provide information about the profitability

of investment in country i, even for a given value of country i's stock

return.23 This outcome might arise if ownership extends across countries or

if the stock-price data for some countries are poor measures of the expected

profitability of investment in those countries.

    As in previous results, the regression in Table 8, col. 1 indicates a

significantly negative effect of POILt1 on the investment ratios (- .020,

s.e. =    .006).   One puzzle is that the estimated coefficient for own-country

monetary growth, DMitl, is significantly positive (.039, s.e. =              .010),
whereas that on world monetary growth, DMWdtl, is negative but

insignificant (-    .049,   s.e. =   .042).   We found before an inverse relation

between        and the lag of world monetary growth, not own-country monetary

growth (Table 6, col. 2). Thus, the interest-rate effects suggest a positive

connection between DMwdtl and (I/Y)t, but the results indicate instead a

positive coefficient on DMi. (Recall that, for the world variables in

Table 3, DMWdtl had an insignificant effect on                         There may be an

endogenous-money story to explain these results, but we have not yet come up

with it.




23As a related matter, Barro (1990) finds that Canadian investment responds
more to the U.S. stock market than to the Canadian stock market.
                                                               44




   Column 2 of Table 8 eliminates three world variables from the regression:

STOCKWdt1, "Twd,t-1' and DMWdtl. Theoretically (abstracting from the
possible informational role of world stock prices for own-country

profitability), these variables would affect (I/Y)1t only through their

effects on the world expected real interest rate. The three world variables

turn out to be jointly insignificant; the likelihood-ratio statistic is 2.9

compared to the 5% critical value of 7.8.

    It would be possible to consider the system of equations for investment

ratios jointly with the system for expected real interest rates. The

restrictions imposed by the structural model could be imposed on this overall

joint system. We plan eventually to undertake this grand system estimation.



Summary Qj        Results

    We thought of the expected real interest rate for the major

industrialized countries as determined by the equation of aggregate

investment demand to the aggregate of desired national saving. We used

stock-market returns to isolate shifts to expected profitability of

investment (or risk premia) and hence to investment demand. We used oil

prices to capture shifts to temporary income and hence to desired national

saving. In some models, monetary expansion would appear as a positive shock

to desired national saving, and in others, fiscal expansion would enter as a

negative shock.

    We used the structural model to determine a reduced form for the "world°

expected real interest rate and ratio of investment to GDP. The main

predictions are that more favorable stock returns raise the real interest

rate and investment, higher oil prices increase the real interest rate but
                                                                45




decrease investment, higher monetary growth lowers the real interest rate and

stimulates investment, and greater fiscal expansion raises the real interest

rate and reduces investment.

    e estimated the reduced form of the model on data for ten OECD countries

over the period 1959-88. Thus far, the results pertain to annual data on

short-term interest rates. (Because of data problems with Italy we included

only nine countries in the equations for interest rates.) The results for

world (DP-weighted) expected real interest rates reveal significant effects

in the predicted directions for world stock returns, oil prices, and world

monetary growth. Fiscal variables turned out to be unimportant. The

behavior of the world investment ratio was also consistent with the model,

except that the hypothesized positive effect from monetary growth did not

show up and fiscal variables were unimportant.

    Estimates of the reduced form that were constrained by the structural

restrictions led to estimates of structural coefficients, such as the

responsiveness of desired national saving rates to the expected real interest

rate. We find that an increase in the expected real interest rate by one

percentage point raises the desired saving rate by about one-third of a

percentage point.

    We simulated the model to try to explain why expected real interest rates

were high for 1981-86 (averaging 4.27.) and low for 1975-80 (averaging 0.37.).

The dominant influence was the variation in stock returns; these returns were

very low for 1974-79 and much higher for 1980-85. The increase in oil prices

from the early 1970s until 1986 is also an important factor. We attributed

the drop in expected real interest rates for 1987-88 (to an average of 2.37.)

mainly to the decline in oil prices, and the rise in the rate for 1989 (to
                                                               46




3.57.) mainly to the improved stock market in 1988. The model also forecasts

a dramatic rise in the expected real interest rate to 5.67. in 1990. This

value is almost a full percentage point above the highest value that occurred

during the period 1958-89.

    We estimated systems of equations for expected real interest rates for

nine OECD countries. (We also estimated systems of equations for investment

ratios for ten OECD countries, including Italy.) These systems include world

and own-country variables as regressors. One finding is that each country's

expected real interest rate depends primarily on world factors, thereby

suggesting a good deal of integration of world markets. We do find, however,

significant effects of own-country variables for Japan and the U.K. Our

interpretation is that these countries were significantly isolated from

international markets, at least over part of the period 1959-88.

    The research carried out thus far suggests a number of avenues for future

work. The possibilities that we are presently pursuing are the analysis of

longer term interest rates, the inclusion of measures of the profitability of

investment, the addition of variables such as defense expenditures that

represent exogenous shifts to desired saving, consideration of tax effects

related to interest income and expenses, and the estimation of equations for

expected real interest rates and investment ratios with quarterly data. We

are also considering a division of investment into components that would be

especially sensitive to the stock market (business non-residential

investment) and those that would be less sensitive (residential investment,

public investment, and purchases of consumer durables). Finally, we are

looking into the possibilities for adding more countries; Switzerland and

Australia appear to be the most promising in terms of the availability of

data.

Note: The sample period is 1959-88. The estimated coefficients apply to the
model that is estimated subject to the structural restrictions.     For the
investment demand equation, the constant is set to 0 and the coefficient of
            is set to 1.  Cols. 1 and 2 apply to a model that excludes fiscal
               1
variables; cols. 3 and 4 to a model that includes the two fiscal variables
shown. The fit statistics apply to the restricted model and to an unrestricted
form that relaxes the constraints from the structural model.

Note: The column labeled "simulated total" refers to the change in the
average simulated value of rWdt or (1/)d,t from the reference period to
the study period. These dynamic simulations use the actual values of

STOCKWdt..l, POILt ,
                     and DMwdtl, and the actual initial values of
and 11d,t-i at the beginnings of the reference and study periods. The
column labeled "STOCK" shows the part of the change in the simulated values
that is attributable to differences in the time series of STOCKWd      for the
study and reference periods. The other columns give the corresponding
information for differences in the time series of POILt1, DMWdtl, and the

values for rdl and 1/)d,t-i at the start of the study and reference
periods. The value of                    for 1989 is based on incomplete data.

Note: Cols. 1 and 2 provide fit statistics for individual countries for the system
regression shown in Table 6, col. 1.           Cols. 3-5 deal with systems in which
individual countries have separate coefficients on four world variables (STOCK,
POlL, I/Y, and DM) and the lagged dependent variable.     Col. 3 ives the
likelihood-ratio statistic (-2log[likelihood ratio]) when these individual
coefficients are introduced one country at a time.  Cols. 4 and 5 give fit
statistics for each country in a system where all countries have individual
coefficients on the five variables noted above.       Cols. 6-8 deal with systems in
which individual countries have separate coefficients on three own-country
variables (STOCK, I/Y, and DM), each expressed as a deviation from the
corresponding world variable.   Col. 6 gives the likelihood-ratio statistic when
these individual coefficients are introduced one country at a time. Cols. 7 and 8
ive fit statistics for each country in a system where all countries have
individual coefficients on the three own-country variables.

R        3-month Treasury bill rate for January, April, July, October, except
         money-market rate for France and Japan, from International Financial
         Statistics (IFS) and OECD, lain Economic Indicators.

P        Consumer price index (1980=1.0), seasonally unadjusted, for January,
         April, July, October, from IFS.

         price inflation (December-to-December) was subtracted from the
         nominal returns to calculate the real returns.

POlL     Ratio of U.S. PPI for crude petroleum to overall U.S. PPI (1982
         base), from Citibase.

DM       Growth rate of Ml, computed from December values for Ml from IFS.

RDEBTY   Ratio of end-of-year real central government debt (nominal debt at
         par value divided by the December CPI) to real CDP. For BE, CA, FR,
         GE, IT, and NE, the debt figures are the sum of domestic and foreign
         debt from IFS. For JA, the data are from lonthly Statistics of

         Statistical Office, Annual Statistics; for US, Economic Report of
         the President.

RDEFY    Ratio of real budget deficit to real GD?. The real budget deficit
         is the change in the real debt for the year. The real debt is the
         ratio of the nominal debt to the December consumer price index.

RDEFYA   The residual from a regression of RDEFY for each country over
         1958- 87 on the current and four annual lags of the growth rate of
         real GDP.

WTXX     Share of country XX in the ten-country Summers-Heston (1988) real
         GDP.
