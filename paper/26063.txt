This paper examines the reliability of survey data on business incomes, valuations, and rates of
return, which are key inputs for studies of wealth inequality and entrepreneurial choice. We
compare survey responses of business owners with available data from administrative tax records,
brokered private business sales, and publicly traded company filings and document problems due
to nonrepresentative samples and measurement errors across several surveys, subsamples, and
years. We find that the discrepancies are economically relevant for the statistics of interest. We
investigate reasons for these discrepancies and propose corrections for future survey designs.

1    Introduction
Representative surveys of households and firms have become an important
source of data on business owners and their activities and are now used ex-
tensively in economic research. This paper examines the reliability of data on
business incomes, valuations, and rates of return based on surveys--key statis-
tics for studies of wealth inequality and entrepreneurial choice. To do this, we
first compare survey responses to questions about businesses with correspond-
ing administrative tax data and document problems due to nonrepresentative
samples and measurement errors, both in the aggregate and across the distri-
bution. We then demonstrate that the discrepancies are economically relevant
for the statistics of interest but not systematically correctable given current
survey designs.
    The scope of our analysis is four widely used surveys: Survey of Consumer
Finances (SCF), Current Population Survey (CPS), Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID), and Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
The SCF is the best survey design for our analysis; it asks households with
actively managed businesses to report both the legal form of their business and
amounts on specific lines from the relevant business tax forms--thus provid-
ing a valuable test of the survey regardless of whether misreporting of taxable
income occurs. The survey includes questions for pass-through entities (sole
proprietorships, S corporations, and partnerships) and privately held C cor-
porations. We have less detailed information from the other surveys but can
compare statistics for noncorporate businesses with the SCF and IRS.
    Averaging across survey years, we find that the SCF significantly overstates
aggregate business incomes and business incomes per tax return for all business
types. If we consolidate all businesses, we find an overstatement in total SCF
aggregate business income of 156 percent relative to the IRS data and an over-
statement of 434 percent when we compare business incomes per return. We
also find a significant understatement of the number of tax returns across most
business forms, which is worsening over time in the case of sole proprietorships
and S corporations. Importantly, the overstatement of per-return and aggre-
gate business incomes relative to IRS counterparts varies significantly in the



                                       1
cross section and year by year. We document that large differences between
the SCF and IRS incomes exist even after adjusting the IRS data using in-
formation on tax audits to account for underreporting of incomes to the tax
authorities. Averaging across all business types and all years, we again find an
overstatement of aggregate business income and business income per return in
the SCF relative to the IRS by 57 percent and 229 percent, respectively.
    If we restrict attention to noncorporate businesses, we can compute com-
parable statistics across all four surveys. We find large differences in business
income per owner across surveys in every available survey year. Futhermore,
no survey provides reliable estimates for aggregate business income or per-
owner income, regardless of whether we adjust the IRS data for misreporting.
For example, if we do adjust for misreporting, the range of errors between IRS
and survey incomes per owner is -16 percent (SIPP) to 481 percent (SCF).
    More relevant for economic research are possible issues with survey-based
estimates of business valuations, since there are no measures of total valua-
tions for ongoing businesses other than publicly traded C corporations. To
assess the accuracy of the survey responses, we construct net income-to-value
ratios and compare them with available income yields from brokered private
business sales in the Pratt's Stats database and from publicly traded com-
pany reports--both small and large--in the Center for Research in Security
Prices (CRSP) database. The valuations from the survey data are based on
self-reports of the value of their share of the business, net of all loans, if the
owners were to sell. For virtually all subsamples, all years, and all surveys that
ask about valuations, the income yields are significantly higher than compa-
rable measures from Pratt's and CRSP. The overstatement in yields is even
greater than for incomes, implying an understatement in business valuations.
For example, the SCF average value-weighted income yield is 19 percent, much
higher than the Pratt's estimates of 2 percent and the CRSP estimates of 7
percent for all businesses or -9 percent for those in the bottom quintile when
ranked by total assets. We also find that the SCF distributions are more
right-skewed than those based on Pratt's or CRSP data.
    Given the significant issues with business income and wealth in the sur-
veys, we investigate the likely sources of sampling and measurement errors and



                                        2
possible corrections. A natural hypothesis for the overstatement of business in-
comes per return is that the coverage of businesses in the surveys is different,
and perhaps intentionally so, from the administrative data. To begin with,
such a view is clearly inconsistent with our observation that aggregate busi-
ness incomes are overstated in the SCF relative to the IRS for all legal forms
and most years. However, we further explore this hypothesis by exploiting a
unique feature of the SCF survey design: business incomes are recorded twice
for many proprietorships-- once in response to questions about individual in-
comes on Form 1040 asked of all tax filers and again in response to questions
about business incomes on Schedule C asked of owners with actively managed
businesses. We find more business income--in the aggregate and per return--
for proprietors who do not report that they have Schedule C income. While
puzzling in its own right, this observation leads us to reject the view that
owners with little business attachment drive our finding of an overstatement
of business income per return in survey data. The findings call for a survey
redesign that makes the notion of actively managing a business precise and
verifiable and enforces an internal consistency check across survey responses
wherever possible.
    A hypothesis for the overstatement of incomes that cannot be rejected is
that the incomes and numbers of unsuccessful businesses are understated. We
compare business incomes after ranking households by total income and find
that low-income businesses are in fact underrepresented, which leads to an
overstatement of business incomes if total and business incomes are positively
correlated. We also provide evidence of measurement errors that arise from
the framing of questions. For example, there are many IRS businesses with net
losses but few in the survey data, possibly because the respondents answered
that they had no net income rather than a negative net income. These issues
affect cross-sectional statistics, which are key inputs for studies of income and
wealth inequality. A survey redesign that links questions about tax forms to
administrative data would alleviate problems in framing. Such a redesign is
also warranted given that most owners never reference tax or financial docu-
ments when surveyed.
    We also investigate proposed corrections for measurement errors discussed



                                       3
in previous work.1 For example, Johnson and Moore (2008) have noted that an
overstatement of income could be the result of miscategorizing income in the
surveys. We provide evidence that miscategorization does not explain the large
discrepancies that we find by using the broader definition of business income
recommended by Johnson and Moore (2008). For example, business owners
might confuse incomes on Schedules C, E, and F, overstating one category
and understating another. When we combine these categories into a broader
concept of business income, we still find incomes to be significantly overstated.
Respondents are not miscategorizing incomes but are often overstating all
categories of business income. Here again, we would argue for a survey redesign
that links questions about tax forms to administrative data.
    Our findings have implications for several active areas of economic research.
Survey data on businesses are a central input to studies of wealth inequality
since rising business incomes account for most of the growth in the top 1 per-
cent share. (See Bricker et al. 2016, Kuhn and Rios-Rull 2016, and Smith et
al. 2017.) Even for researchers that use administrative IRS data and capitalize
taxable incomes, survey data serve as the only check on distributional assump-
tions and capitalization factors. (See Saez and Zucman 2016.) We find issues
with both and therefore conclude that there is currently no reliable estimate
of wealth inequality for the United States.
    Survey data on businesses are a central input to studies of entrepreneurial
choice, for both model calibrations and predictions. In many of these studies,
parameter estimates--including key estimates for entrepreneurial span of con-
trol and borrowing constraints--are based solely on survey data. (See, for ex-
ample, Evans and Jovanovic 1989, Quadrini 2000, Cagetti and De Nardi 2006,
and Buera 2009.) Across different surveys and samples, there is a wide range of
parameter estimates and, as a result, a wide range of predictions for business
income shares and self-employment rates--key statistics when addressing nor-
mative issues. (See, for example, Meh 2005, Kitao, 2008, Bruggemann 2017,
and Imrohoroglu, Kumru, and Nakornthab 2018, who use the survey-based

    See Johnson and Moore (2008) for comparisons of business incomes in the SCF and IRS,
Saez and Zucman (2016) for comparisons of a broader capital income measure in the SCF
and IRS, and Kennickell, Kwast, and Pogach (2017) for comparisons of business counts in
the SCF and US Census Bureau.

calibrations of the earlier literature.)
    Users of survey data have also come to very different conclusions about
the payoffs to entrepreneurial activities. For example, some find puzzlingly
low payoffs and conclude that entrepreneurships has large non pecuniary ben-
efits (see Hamilton 2000, Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen 2002, and Hurst
and Pugsley 2011), whereas others find high payoffs and conclude that severe
financial constraints hinder entrepreneurship (see Evans and Jovanovic 1989,
Quadrini 2000, Cagetti and De Nardi 2006, and Buera 2009). Our findings
cast doubt on the facts that have been uncovered in the empirical literature--
specifically those related to business incomes and rates of return--and thus
raise issues concerning the theoretical developments and policy analyses that
have been designed around them.


2     Business Incomes
In this section, we compare data on business incomes from surveys with cor-
responding data from the IRS. We document significant overstatements of
aggregate business income as well as business income per tax return across
all legal forms of organization and show that these discrepancies vary across
years. We then evaluate reasons for the overstatements and suggest possible
corrections.


2.1    Evidence
We start with a comparison of SCF and IRS. All SCF respondents are asked
about incomes on the first page of the Individual Income Tax Form 1040 (Codes
X5702­X5751). Respondents that own privately held businesses are asked if
they have an active management role in any business (code X3104). If so,
they are asked to report the legal form organization for up to three businesses
(codes X3119, X3219, X3319), gross receipts (codes X3131, X3231, X3331),
net incomes before taxes (codes X3132, X3232, X3332), and ownership shares
(codes X3128, X3228, X3328). Information on business receipts and incomes
is obtained from the respective business tax forms: Form 1040, Schedule C,



                                      5
for sole proprietorships, Form 1065 for partnerships, Form 1120S for S corpo-
rations, and Form 1120 for C corporations. In the SCF interviews, specific
instructions are provided on which tax forms and line numbers to report. In
each survey year, we use the SCF sampling weights and ownership shares for
multiowner businesses to compute the aggregate business income and the ag-
gregate number of business tax returns by legal form weighted by ownership
shares of the business.2
    Figure 1 plots aggregate business incomes for tax years 1988­2015. The
shaded regions for the survey data are 90 percent bootstrapped confidence
intervals using SCF replicate weights. The solid lines are the comparable IRS
aggregates. If we construct percentage errors (that is, 100(SCF-IRS)/IRS),
we find that they are large, significantly different from zero, and vary consid-
erably across all business types and all years. For all businesses (panel F),
the average error is 156 percent with a range of 40 to 208 percent across sur-
vey years. In the case of pass-through businesses (panel D), which include
sole proprietorships, partnerships and S corporations, the average error is 168
percent with a range of 61 to 263 percent across survey years.
    Although the SCF asks respondents to report on specific lines of IRS tax
forms, we also compare survey data with IRS business incomes adjusted to
include estimates of unreported income. The estimates we use are based on
imputations from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and estimates from
Johns and Slemrod (2010) and the Government Accountability Office (GAO)
based on tax audit data. For the years 1988­2015, the BEA estimates that
reported noncorporate tax incomes are lower by roughly 50 percent and cor-
porate tax incomes lower by 23 percent because of misreporting. Johns and
Slemrod (2010) document underreporting of 18 percent for Schedule E income,
which includes all supplemental income from S corporations, partnerships,
   2
    To be consistent with the IRS statistics, we assume that a business owner with multiple
proprietorships files one return. The SCF only surveys owners of partnerships who are
individuals, whereas the IRS includes other legal entities such as corporations. Therefore, we
adjust the IRS data using an estimate of 32 percent for the fraction of total income generated
by individual partners based on Cooper et al.'s (2016) study of 2011 administrative tax data.
Finally, the SCF only surveys privately held C corporations, and we use information from
Schedule M3/M1 filed by publicly listed corporations to obtain the IRS counterparts of
business income and number of returns for privately held C corporations.




                                              6
rental real estate, and royalties. The GAO estimates misreporting margins for
S-corporation incomes on the order of 15 to 20 percent. We use this informa-
tion to construct a measure of adjusted IRS income by adding back estimates
of misreporting separately for each business form and year. The adjustments
mitigate the overstatement of survey incomes, but large differences between
the SCF and IRS data remain. The average error for all businesses in this case
is 57 percent with a range of -8 to 95 percent across years. Except for sole
proprietorships, the overstatements are present across legal forms and years.
In the case of sole proprietorships we find a significant understatement of in-
come in the SCF when we compare it with audit-corrected IRS data. Overall,
the SCF answers are not consistent with either incomes reported to the IRS
or actual incomes.
    For studies relying on per capita information, a more relevant comparison
is with business income per tax return. In Figure 2, we plot aggregate business
incomes divided by the number of business tax returns for each business type
for tax years 1988­2015, along with comparable data from the IRS and the
audit-corrected measure that adds back underreported income. For all cat-
egories of businesses, we find a significant overstatement of SCF income per
return and large year-to-year variation.3 Our headline estimate for all busi-
nesses as shown in Figure 2, panel F, is an average error of 434 percent with a
range of 254 to 567 percent when compared with data actually reported to the
IRS. If we adjust the IRS incomes using audit data, the error is 229 percent,
with a range of errors of 134 to 293 percent over the sample.
    Our finding that errors in per-return incomes are higher than errors in total
incomes is indicative of the fact that the number of returns filed by businesses
is understated in the SCF, which turns out to be true for all business types
except partnerships. In the case of sole proprietorships and S corporations,
the understatement is significant and has worsened over time as the number
of IRS filings has grown and the number reported in the SCF has not.4
   3
     In principle, the exclusion of corporate partners in the SCF should not affect the busi-
ness income per return. Here, we are operating under the assumption that the SCF is
representative and that partnerships with all corporate partners (which are entirely missed
by the SCF) either are small in terms of their share of aggregate business income or are not
systematically different from the rest of the partnerships.
   4
     The SCF reports ownership shares for only up to three actively managed businesses



                                             7
    If we restrict attention to noncorporate businesses, we can evaluate the
accuracy of estimates in the CPS, PSID, and SIPP and compare the results
with the SCF. In this case, we compare the results with the IRS data adjusted
for misreporting since only SCF respondents are asked about specific lines on
their tax returns. In Figure 3, we plot total noncorporate incomes in panel
A and noncorporate income per owner in panel B. The results show large
inconsistencies across surveys. The SCF overstates total noncorporate income
relative to the IRS data adjusted for misreporting, whereas the CPS, PSID,
and SIPP data understate by varying degrees. Differences across surveys and
across time are large--with errors ranging from -71 to 106 percent--and may
reflect differences in intended focus across surveys (for example, high versus
low income or wealth households). When we divide by numbers of owners, we
again find large differences across surveys and relative to the IRS data adjusted
for misreporting. In this case, all surveys overstate business incomes, with the
exception of the SIPP. Errors range from -16 to 481 percent when compared
with IRS data adjusted for misreporting.5


2.2     Hypotheses
Next, we consider possible reasons for the large differences between survey and
IRS data and some possible corrections.

2.2.1    Owners with low income are underrepresented

The overstatement of income per return and understatement of business re-
turns in the SCF could arise because of differences in coverage between the
SCF and the administrative IRS data. Suppose owners with little business
attachment--say, part-time Uber drivers--might respond that they have no
(and two after 2007), but the fraction of households with three businesses is tiny (roughly
0.4 percent).
    5
      Hurst, Li, and Pugsley (2014) infer estimates of "true" income for households with
self-employed male heads using Engel curve estimates for wage and salary workers and
expenditure data for the self-employed. For the PSID, they find evidence that income per
household of self-employed heads is underreported in the survey relative to their measure
of true income, whereas we find that business income per owner is overreported relative to
the IRS data adjusted for misreporting.




                                            8
active management role in a business when interviewed. The survey would
undercount the number of businesses and overstate income per return if the
owners with an active management role earn higher incomes. If this was in-
tended in the design of the survey, such an overstatement of incomes per return
would be inconsequential for applied research on businesses.6 Although such
a view is clearly inconsistent with the systematic overstatement of aggregate
business incomes across years and legal forms documented in the previous
section, we investigate this issue for sole proprietorships in more detail by
exploiting the structure of questions in the SCF.
    Sole proprietors in the SCF are asked to report their income from business
twice--first as a part of questions about the components of their individual tax
forms (Form 1040, lines 12 plus 18 coded as X5704) and then again for those
reporting they actively manage a business as a part of questions about line
items on the business tax form (Schedule C, line 31 coded as X3119, X3219,
X3319). The implicit intent of the design was to gather more information
from households with a high business attachment. Using a Venn diagram and
SCF data for 2015, we show in Figure 4 that 16.2 million proprietors reported
nonzero business or farm income on Form 1040, lines 12 plus 18, but only 6.3
million of them reported that they actively managed a business, with most of
the rest (9.3 million) reporting neither actively managing a business nor having
an "interest" in a business without an active management role.7 Kennickell,
Kwast, and Pogach (2017) explain that "there is often not a clear distinction
between self-employment and business ownership," which might make sense if
the 9.3 million earned very little business income. But as we show in Figure 4,
the SCF reports that these sole proprietors, who do not claim to be managing
a business, earned more than half of all proprietorship income for 2015 ($303
billion out of the $583 billion) and have comparable per-return incomes to
those who report actively managing a business.
    Although the evidence in Figure 4 clearly shows that incomes per return for
those actively managing a business are not higher than average, it does not rule
   6
    See Kennickell, Kwast, and Pogach (2017) for such a view.
   7
    Respondents are asked separately if they are "self-employed" without any reference to
tax filings. The self-employed who also claim to have proprietorship income account for
roughly 90 percent of income coded as X5704.



                                           9
out underrepresentation of low-income owners more generally. In the case of
sole proprietors, we further investigate by computing both numbers of returns
and income shares for subgroups after ranking them by their adjusted gross
income (AGI). For example, we can split the sample into below- and above-
median AGI groups. If we do this for those claiming an active management
role, we find that the SCF estimate for the number of returns filed by the
below-median group is roughly 2 million for the entire period, whereas IRS
data show a rise from 5 million in 1988 to over 12 million in 2015. Even if we
compute the statistics for all sole proprietors in the SCF, that is, those who
claim to be actively managing a business and those who do not, (using code
X5704), the total below-median group is only 6.2 million in 2015, roughly half
of the IRS data. These findings suggest a significant underrepresentation of
low-income businesses, which leads to an overstatement of business incomes if
business income is positively correlated with AGI. If we analyze income shares
over time, we find that the share of income for those with below-median AGI
is nearly doubled or halved from one survey to the next, whereas the IRS share
has steadily grown.
    These observations call for several survey redesigns. The SCF should make
precise the notion of actively managing a business, implement internal consis-
tency checks mid-interview, and, if possible, link future surveys to administra-
tive data. This redesign is especially warranted since only a tiny fraction of
respondents refer to their tax documents or any business financial statements.
In 2015, for example, 75 percent of business owners in the SCF never refer-
enced tax documents, 2 percent rarely did, 9 percent sometimes did, and 14
percent frequently did.8 In the case of other financial documents, 64 percent
never referenced any other financial documents, 6 percent rarely did, 15 per-
cent sometimes did, and 15 percent frequently did. To correct the problem of
underrepresentation, the SCF needs to expand the sampling frame in future
surveys.
  8
      We found virtually no difference in behavior when conditioning on income.




                                            10
2.2.2   Owners misreport business losses

Business incomes can be overstated if losses are understated. We find this
to be the case for the SCF. To demonstrate this, we group businesses with
profits and losses separately. For pass-through businesses, the SCF overstates
the income per return for profitable businesses by an average of 278 percent,
with the year-to-year errors in the range of 151 to 446 percent. The SCF
understates the losses per return for businesses with negative net incomes by
an average of 82 percent, with the year-to-year errors in the range of 66 to 94
percent. Both the overstatement of profits and the understatement of losses
affect the errors in cross-sectional statistics in quantitatively important ways.
If we decompose the percentage errors in aggregate business income into the
fractions arising from overstatements of profits and understatements of losses,
we find nontrivial errors for both in all survey years.
    Part of the problem may be in the framing of questions about business
incomes. For example, the question "What is your net income?" could be
misinterpreted as being a question about positive net income. As evidence,
consider the distribution of losses by AGI bins. In tax year 2015, the IRS data
show all AGI subgroups had nontrivial net losses, whereas the SCF data show
10 out of 19 AGI subgroups--accounting for 23 percent of total returns and 26
percent of all IRS losses--recorded an aggregate net loss of exactly zero. Such
framing issues can easily be corrected in future surveys by clarifying that net
income might be negative.

2.2.3   Owners misclassify business incomes

Another source of measurement error in the SCF is the respondent's possible
confusion about closely related categories of business income. For example,
when asked about income from a sole proprietorship appearing on Schedule C,
business owners might also include income appearing on Schedule E, which in-
cludes income from real estate, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, estates,
and trusts, or they might include farm income on Schedule F. From our previ-
ous analysis, we know that business incomes from Schedule C are overstated
in the SCF. If the overstatement was due to classification errors, we should



                                       11
see an understatement in categories of income corresponding to Schedules E
or F.
    To test this hypothesis, we compare Schedule E incomes per return and
again find that the SCF estimates are overstated relative to the IRS data,
especially in recent years. The average error is 121 percent, with a range of 50
to 221 percent over the sample. Furthermore, if we sum all business incomes
from Schedules C, E, and F and compare the totals with the IRS data, we find
errors averaging 90 percent with a range of 47 to 180 percent over the sample.
If we follow the recommendation of Johnson and Moore (2008) and broaden
the concept of business income even further by adding capital gains (which
includes non business incomes), we still find an overstatement: the average
error is 47 percent with a range of 18 to 115 percent over the sample.
    One could further broaden the concept of business income to include all
nonwage income, thus lowering the discrepancies between datasets. But such
aggregation is not useful for applied work--neither for research on US busi-
nesses nor for research on US capital. For research on businesses, the residual
income measure would be inappropriate because significant nonbusiness in-
come is included with interest payments, capital gains, pensions and annuities,
alimony, trusts, and government transfers. For research on capital, the non-
wage income in AGI would be inappropriate because a significant fraction of
capital income is untaxed and the corresponding assets are held by fiduciaries.


3    Business Valuations and Rates of Return
Overreporting of incomes would lead to an upward bias in estimates of business
rates of return. In this section, we combine net income with self-reported
business valuations to construct income yields that are comparable to available
yields from brokered private business sales and from small and large publicly
traded firms. We first document that for virtually all subsamples and all
years, the survey yields are significantly higher and more right-skewed than
comparable measures. We then evaluate possible reasons for the discrepancies.




                                      12
3.1     Evidence
In Table 1, we report statistics for net income yields using different universes
of businesses and different data sources (listed in rows). In columns, we report
mean yields using two weighting schemes, namely, equally weighted and value
weighted, and we report various percentiles of the income yield distribution.
    We start by comparing the survey yields with yields based on broker data
from Pratt's Stats.9 We compute the income yield in Pratt's by dividing
the pretax income earned by the business in the year before the sale by the
sale price. The advantage of Pratt's is that it records the price at which the
business was actually sold; thus, it is conceptually close to the ideal answer to
the survey questions on business valuation.
    First, we can compare yields for all businesses in the SCF and Pratt's
data. The results of this comparison are shown in Table 1. The differences
are dramatic: the Pratt's equally weighted yield is 27 percent compared to
102 percent for the SCF, and the Pratt's value-weighted yield is 2 percent
compared to 19 percent for the SCF. The larger discrepancy in the equally
weighted yield relative to the value-weighted yield suggests the presence of
discrepancies in the distribution of yields. This can also be seen by directly
comparing the percentiles of the income yield distribution across data sources.
Here, we see that the 75th percentile yield in the SCF is substantially higher
than the counterpart in Pratt's. In other words, the SCF overestimates the
right-skewness of the cross-sectional distribution of business returns.
    A direct implication of the overstated SCF yield is an understated SCF
valuation. If the Pratt's yields are representative of pass-through businesses,
then the SCF average net income yields are too high by a factor of 10. We
documented earlier that the net incomes for pass-through businesses (in the
numerator of the yield) are high by a factor of roughly 2, implying that self-
reported valuations are significantly underestimated.10
   9
     The Pratt's database has transaction-level data on sales of private and public businesses
over the period 1988­2017. The dataset includes financial information about the target
business and other attributes of the sale including payment terms, purchase price allocations,
and employment agreements.
  10
     The results are similar for other surveys if we restrict attention to noncorporate busi-
nesses. (See Bhandari et al. 2019.)




                                             13
    Next, we compare income yields for all businesses in the SCF with those
for the CRSP database (merged with Compustat). The income yield for a
firm in CRSP is computed by dividing pretax income by the firms' end-of-year
market capitalization. In Table 1, we see that the CRSP equally weighted
income yield for the full sample is actually negative (-9 percent), and the
CRSP value-weighted income yield, while positive, is much lower than that
for the SCF (7 percent). Considering the distribution, we again find that the
SCF yields are more right-skewed than those in CRSP. For example, at the
75th percentile, the SCF C-corporation yield is 36 percent, whereas the CRSP
yield for all businesses is 10 percent.
    These findings appear to be inconsistent with those of Moskowitz and
Vissing-Jorgensen (2002), who constructed private business returns using SCF
data and concluded that they were surprisingly low when compared with those
of publicly traded firms. The main difference is the concept of return. Their
measure is equal to the sum of a value-weighted income yield and an imputed
capital gain.11 In theory, one would need a panel of firm valuations to com-
pute a value-weighted capital gain. Given that the SCF survey is triennial
with virtually no panel aspect (other than two surveys), there is no way to
compute the change in value firm by firm. Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen
(2002) instead compute the ratio of aggregated firm values across consecutive
surveys and then annualize it to obtain a measure of capital gains. Compar-
ing their estimates to the value-weighted mean holding period returns on the
CRSP index portfolio, they find private returns that are similar in magnitude
to the returns for listed public firms.
    Replicating the exercise of Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002) for
our full sample with income yields and capital gains compared separately,
we find that the capital gain imputation drives the differences between our
findings and theirs. (See Bhandari et al. 2019.) Combining overstated yields
and imputed gains from the survey confounds two discrepancies and results
in similar estimates for private and public returns: 26 percent for SCF and
21 percent for CRSP. However, if we were to compute capital gains in CRSP
  11
    Kartashova (2014) also finds that a longer sample raises the SCF-CRSP return gap but
uses the same concept of return as in Moskowitz and Vissing-Jorgensen (2002).




                                          14
and SCF in a comparable manner, we would find a lower average return of 16
percent for CRSP. Thus restricting attention to income yields or comparable
total returns, we conclude that the rates of return are significantly higher for
private businesses when compared with public returns, not low as previously
thought.


3.2     Hypotheses
Next, we consider possible reasons for the overstatements of income yields--
and implied understatements of business valuations--in survey data relative
to yields of private businesses that sold or publicly traded businesses.

3.2.1    Yields in Pratt's and CRSP are biased downward

Returns on businesses in Pratt's broker data could be biased downward if
sales are triggered by distress, say, because of health-related issues facing the
owner. Similarly, sales of technology- or research-intensive businesses would
imply lower yields because of the significant expensing done by these firms.
We test this hypothesis by ignoring transactions in which the target company
is in technology- and research-intensive sectors (that is, with NAICS codes 51,
5415, or 5417) and those for which the stated reason for the sale was health
related. In Table 1, we report the data for this subset of firms and find that
the results are nearly the same as for all businesses.
    CRSP yields could be biased downward because the typical firm in CRSP
is much larger than the typical firm in the survey data. To test this hypothesis,
we compute yields for small firms in CRSP that are more comparable to those
in the survey samples and report them in the last row of Table 1. Our baseline
definition of "small" is a firm that belongs to the bottom quintile of firms
ranked by the book value of assets.12 Given that we have data on all business
types for the SCF, we also compute yields for S and C corporations since
they are most similar to businesses in CRSP. Here again, the differences are
dramatic. The equally weighted income yield for small firms in CRSP is -27
  12
    The results are similar for other definitions of "small" -- for example, based on gross
sales or market capitalization.




                                            15
percent, whereas the yield is large and positive for both C corporations (57
percent) and S corporations (76 percent) in the SCF. Interestingly, yields for
the small business subsample in CRSP are lower than the full sample across the
distribution, implying an even larger discrepancy between survey and CRSP
yields for small businesses.

3.2.2    Survey valuations understate intangible assets

Our main hypothesis for the upward bias in the rates of return is that respon-
dents underreport valuations of intangible assets used in businesses. From
Pratt's data, we know that roughly 60 percent of the purchase price upon
sale is the value of intangible assets. (See Bhandari and McGrattan 2019.) If
business owners do not include the value of these assets when reporting busi-
ness net worth, the returns would be biased upward by even more than the
incomes. A constructive way to deal with the measurement issues in the SCF
and estimate aggregate and distributional statistics for business valuations is
to rely more heavily on a theory that is disciplined by the flows measured
from the IRS and business sales data such as Pratt's Stats. A theory featuring
business sales would take a stand on the selection bias and also provide a way
to impute the valuations for ongoing concerns.


4       Conclusion
Theories and policies are being developed around survey "facts," but the evi-
dence suggests that these should be treated with great caution. We hope and
expect that our analysis will lead to improved measurement in future surveys.
Measurement problems related to business incomes are surmountable given
that respondents are asked about specific lines on tax forms. Measurement
problems related to business valuations and returns may be insurmountable
without data on actual business sales transactions or a theoretical framework
and a method of indirect inference.

Note : This figure plots aggregate business income using the SCF, IRS. and IRS data adjusted for misre-
porting. In the SCF, business income is obtained by the weighted sum of households' share (X3128, X3228,
X3328) of net business income (X3132, X3232, X3332) for each legal status (X3119, X3219, X3319) over
time. For partnerships, the IRS data (solid black line) is adjusted based on Cooper et al.'s (2016) study of
administrative tax data so that it only covers income generated by individuals. For all business types, we
calculate the IRS income adjusted for misreporting (dashed black line) by using the imputations from the
Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) and estimates from Johns and Slemrod (2010) and the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) based on tax audit data. The shaded region for the SCF shows the 90 percent
confidence interval.

Note : This figure plots business income per tax return using the SCF, IRS, and IRS data adjusted for tax
misreporting. In the SCF, business income is obtained by the weighted sum of households' share (X3128,
X3228, X3328) of net business income (X3132, X3232, X3332) for each legal status (X3119, X3219, X3319)
over time. Similarly, the number of business tax returns is calculated by the weighted sum of households'
share of each legal status over time. For partnerships, the IRS data (solid black line) is adjusted based on
Cooper et al.'s (2016) study of administrative tax data so that it only covers income generated by individuals
and their number of tax returns. Finally, to be consistent with the IRS statistics, we assume in the SCF that
a business owner with multiple proprietorships files one return. For all business types, we calculate the IRS
incomes adjusted for misreporting (dashed black line) using the imputations from the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) and estimates from Johns and Slemrod (2010) and the Government Accountability Office
(GAO) based on tax audit data. The shaded region for the SCF shows the 90 percent confidence interval.

Note : This figure plots the aggregate business income and business income per owner for unincorporated
businesses in the SCF, PSID, CPS, SIPP, and IRS adjusted for tax misreporting. For partnerships, the IRS
data (dashed black line) is adjusted based on Cooper et al.'s (2016) estimate that 73.9 percent of the partners
are individuals and the rest are corporations that are not surveyed in the SCF. Finally, to be consistent
with the IRS statistics, we assume in the SCF that a business owner with multiple proprietorships files one
return. Before 2004, the SIPP does not provide information about an individual's own share of business
income from an unincorporated business. Instead, it contains information about the total income of the
business, which is not enough information to calculate the aggregate business income of unincorporated
businesses.

                           Sole Proprietor Responses in the SCF




Note : This figure shows incomes and counts for three sets of sole proprietors. In red are those who have a
nonzero line 12 plus 18 on Form 1040, in blue are those who report to be actively managing a business, and
in green are those who report owning a business or having an interest in a business without having an active
management role. Some of the groups overlap and in such cases we use incomes from Form 1040, lines 12
plus 18. The counts and incomes of passive owners without income on Form 1040, lines 12 plus18, are not
available (NA) because the SCF stopped identifying the legal form of organization for passive owners after
2007. In the online Appendix, we provide details for other survey years.

Note : This table shows moments of the net income yield distribution from the SCF, PSID, SIPP, Pratt's
Stats, and CRSP-Compustat for different subgroups. For the "nontech and nondistressed" businesses in
Pratt's Stats, we exclude those in technology- and research-intensive sectors (NAICS codes 51, 5415, or
5417) and those for which the stated reason of sale was health related. For the CRSP-Compustat sample,
small businesses refer to publicly traded firms in the CRSP database that belong to the bottom 20 percent
when ranked by total assets.
