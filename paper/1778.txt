                  R&D and Productivity Srowth:
         Comparing Japanese and US. Manufacturing Firms

                               ABSTRACT

     We compute rates of growth in labor     productivity    during the
1973—80 period for samples of individual
both Japan and the                           manufacturing   firms, in
                   u.S., and relate them to differences in the
rates of growth in their capital—labor ratios and ir! their
intensities of R&D effort. Japanese firms spent about as much of
their own money on R&D, relative to sales, as did similar U.S.
firms. An econometric analysis of R&D performing firms leads to
the acceptance of the hypothesis that the contribution of such
expenditures to productivity growth was about the same in both
countries. Hence, the rather large differences on the observed
rates of productivity growth between the two countries cannot be
accounted for by differences in either the intensity or fecundity
of such expenditures. We do find two important differences
between the two countries which help to explain a significant
fraction of the observed differences in productivity but require
in turn, an explanation of their own: 1) Japanese firms reduced
their employment levels significantly during this period while
U5 firms were increasing theirs This, by itself,    accounts for
the twice as fast growth in capital—labor ratio in Japanese
manufacturing 2) The estimated effect of the growth in the
capital—labor ratio on firm productivity is approximately twice -as
large in Japan than in the US. The two factors together can
account for about half of the observed differences in the average
rates of productivity growth   between the two countries.

                  R&D AND PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH:
        COMPARING JAPANESE AND U.S. MANUFACTURING FIRMS*

               Zvi Griliches and Jacques Mairesse


I. INTRODUCTION

     In economic terms Japan is a large country with a large
internal market in addition to its export potential. In an

area that is one twenty—fifth of the U.S., it has a population
slightly over a half and a total GNP above one—third of the U.S.

Its manufacturing sector is somewhat larger relatively, total

employment in manufacturing being around 42 percent of that in
the U.S. One of the most important differences between the two

countries has been in their rates of productivity growth.
Although the oil crises o-f 1973 and 1979 affected both economies

severely and output and productivity growth slowed down in both
of them, the productivity of labor in manufacturing continued to

increase much faster in Japan than in the U.S. during the 1970s.

(Economic Report of the President, 1984, Table 3.3). These
events elicited many comments and studies but mostly at the
at the aggregate—macro level.   Also, while there has been much
discussion of the possible involvement of R&D policies in the
two countries in these events, there has been little quantitative

examination of the R&D—productivity growth relationship and what
there has been has focused largely on aggregate data and single
country analysis.(l) It is our intention to look at these issues


                           1
using Japanese and U. S. company data in attempt to assess the

contribution of R&D to productivity in both countries.
        This paper can be viewed as a continuation of our previous
work on R&D and productivity growth at the firm level in the

U.S. and in France. In analyzing the data -for French and U.S.
manufacturing we found that one cannot account for much of the

observed difference in the average rate of productivity growth
or in the distribution of these differences across industrial

sectors or firms by differences in their respective R&D efforts.
(See Griliches and Mairesse, 1983 and 1984; and Cuneo and

Ilairesse, 1984.) The availability of similar data for Japan
led us to extend these comparisons also to Japan and the U.S.,
where the contrasts are even larger.
    Our work differs from much of the productivity comparisons
literature by taking the individual firm data as its primary
focus. Firm data have the virtue of providing us with much
more variance in the relevant variables and a more appropriate
level of analysis, the level at which most of our theories are
specified. By working with micro data we escape many of the
aggregation problems that plague macro economics. On the
other hand, these benefits do not come without' cost. Our data
bases rarely contain enough variables relevant to the specific
circumstances of a particular firm, and the available
variables themselves are subject to much higher relative error
rates, errors which are largely averaged out in aggregate
data.

        The basic approach we follow in this paper is to compute



                              2
 simple productivity growth measures for individual manufacturing
 firms both in Japan and the U.S for the relatively recent 1973--
 1980 period and relate them to the differences in the   intensity
of R&D effort. We start by describing our data sources and the
overall pattern of R&D spending in manufacturing in both

countries and by reviewing the major trends in productivity
growth across different industrial sectors. We then turn to the
discussion of a regression results which attempt to account for

the differences in labor productivity growth by the differences
in the growth of the capital—labor ratio and in the intensity of
R&D effort across different firms for total manufacturing as a

whole and also separately within specific industrial sectors.
     Since, as we shall point out in some detail later on, the
Japanese R&D data at the firm level turn out to be especially

incomplete, we cannot provide a definitive solution to the

original puzzle of differential growth rates, but we still have
some interesting facts and several new puzzles to report.


II. COMPARING R&D EXPENDITURES

     Before we look at our R&D data at the firm level, it is

useful to compare the industrial distribution of R&D expenditures
in both countries. In Tables 1A and 15 we present comparative

statistics on the magnitude and industrial distribution of R&D

expenditures for manufacturing in both countries, focusing on the
role of 'large' firms, firms with more than a 1000 employees. (2)

We look primarily at the large firms both because they account
for most of the R&D done in either country and because our micro
data concern them mainly.


                            3
    Comparing the two tables we can see that large firms are more

numerous in the U.S. and that on average they are also larger
(about 10 thousand employees versus 3.5 thousand in Japan). Large
firms account for 70 percent of total sales and 65 percent of total
employment in manufacturing in the U.S. versus 52 and 41 percent
respectively in Japan. Similarly, large firms do almost all of
the R&D in U.S., 94 percent, but only about three quarters in

Japan. (3)

     Allowing for differences in the size of the countries and

the size distribution of firms, there is very little difference
either in the intensity or the sectoral distribution of company
financed R&D expenditures in the two countries. There is a big

difference, however, in the involvement of government in the
financing of R&D performed in manufacturing. In the U.S. over
a third of total R&D has been federally financed while in Japan
the state accounts for less than 2 percent of the total.(4)
Because our micro data pertain only to company financed R&D we
shall also restrict our discussion to it.

       While in absolute terms large Japanese manufacturing
companies spend only about a third of the amount that U.S.

companies do on R&D, the ratios of these expenditures to their
sales are remarkably similar, about two percent in both countries.
So is also their sectoral distribution.(5) The distributions of
total company R&D by industry and of the intensity of R&D
effort are also very similar in the two countries. Most of the

R&D is done in three sectors: electrical equipment, transportation
equipment, and chemical industries. The highest R&D to sales



                             4
 ratios are to be found in the drug, electrial equipment, and

 instrument industries, the only noticeable difference being

 the somewhat higher relative expenditure in the instruments
 industry in the US.
       We turn now to the consideration of our firm—level data

sources., In both countries the responses to the official R&D
surveys are confidential and not publicly available. What is
available are reports on the R&D expenditures made by individual
firms as part of their public annual reports or filings with the

respective securities markets regulatory authorities (10 K
statements in the U.S.). In Japan such data are collected and
organized by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun Corporation and are known
as the NEEDS data base. In the US. the equivalent is the
Compustat data base created by the Standard and Poors

Corporation. We have worked previously with the Compustat data
and have created a consistent panel data set based on it.(6)
This is our first experience with the NEEDS data, however, and

we had to invest heavily in cleaning them up and in trying to
understand their construction and provenance. Except for the
R&D numbers, as we shall see below, these data seem of

comparable quality to those of the U.S.

       The general characteristics of the parallel firm samples

that we have constructed are depicted in Table 2. If we insist
on   continuous data from 1972 through 1980 with no major
mergers or major jumps in the series and require also consistent

reporting of R&D expenditures throughout this period we have
complete data for about 'p00 R&D firms in Japan and slightly
over 500 RD firms in the US.(7) The U.S. firms are



                            5
significantly larger, by a factor of four on average. They

also seem to be doing much more R&D, even relatively.
Here we stumble on our major difficulty with the NEEDS data.
The R&D data appear to be badly underreported in thi5 source.
If we compare the numbers in Table 1A with those   in Table 1B,
we observe that the overall company financed R&D to Sales

ratio is roughly similar in both countries and only slightly
lower in Japan (1.9 vs. 2.3 percent in the U.S. for large
R&D performing firms) while the numbers in Table 2 imply

that the U.S. firms are twice as R&D intensive.

     It does not take very long to convince oneself that indeed
the NEEDS data are heavily deficient in their R&D coverage.
Table 3 reports coverage ratios for 1981 of the NEEDS R&D

numbers relative to the official Japanese R&D Survey. While
the large firms in the NEEDS sample account for close to 80

percent of the relevant employment and sales totals, the

coverage of R&D expenditures is only slightly above a
third.(8) Looking at the distribution by industrial sector
we see that coverage is good to reasonable for the chemical,
drugs and instruments industries, but that it is abysmal for
motor vehicles and transportation equipment and poor for the
rest of manufacturing. The magnitude of the problem can be
appreciated when it is realized that neither Toyota, Hitachi,
Nissan or Honda report positive R&D expenditures in the NEEDS
data base.

     Using information published by the OECD (1984) on the 20
largest R&D performers in Japan in 1979 we find that of the 18
firms that should be within our definition of manufacturing and


                          6
 are indeed in the NEEDS file, 10 report no R&D whatsoever, three
 report about the same amount of R&D in both sources, and, what
 may be even more worrisome, five companies report significantly
 less R&D in the NEEDS data base than is reported by the OECD.

 For example, the reported R&D expenditures of the Sony Corporation
 differ by a factor of two in these different sources,. If the
 OECD information is added to the NEEDS data set, total R&D

 expenditures come close to doubling and the coverage ratio rises
 to a respectable 73 percent. Thus the problem we face is not
only that R&D is missing for some firms, that we could either
ignore or adjust for in some way, but that the reported figures
themselves appear to be inaccurate. They reflect not only
real differences in this variable but also differences in

reporting practices. Since there was nothing else that we could
do at this point we complemented or adjusted the R&D figures
for the 18 very large R&D firms for which we had OECD

information and proceeded to analyze these data as if they
actually mean what they say. The best we can hope for is
that the reported R&D numbers are still acceptable proxies

for the true figures (9). We will come back, however, to
this issue in interpreting the results of our analyses.
     A few words should be said also at this point about the
U.S. R&D data. They seem indeed better. Even though they are
not exactly conceptually equivalent, the 10K based reports and
the NSF collected numbers are not very far apart, especially as
far as industry totals are concerned. A recent analysis by the
NSF (1985) of data for the 200 largest R&D performers finds the



                            7
totals in 1981 remarkably close, within 3 percent, though this

covers up significant individual variability. Forty—seven
percent of the firms reported totals within 10 percent in both
sources, 22 percent were within 10 to 25 percent and only 13

percent were off by more than 25 percent. Eighteen percent
were not included in the Compustat based data base, primarily
because they were either privately or foreign owned. Using 1976
totals and adjusting for differences in definition and coverage,
we ourselves estimated that the Compustat based universe
contained about 85 percent a-f total R&D reported to the NSF,

the major discrepancy arising from the above mentioned absence
o-f privately and foreign owned firms in these data.(10) At

the same time, our selection of "continuous R&D" firms
preserves about 80 percent of the total R&D reported in the

1976 large Compustat cross—section. Thus, roughly speaking,
the firms contained in our U.S. sample account for about 70
percent of the total company financed R&D as reported to the
National Science Foundation.


III. COMPARING TRENDS IN PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH
      Bearing in mind the limitations of the R&D data, we look
now at the productivity record of the firms in our samples for
both countries during the l970s. Table 4 lists the sample
sizes, averages, and standard deviations for some of our major
variables by industrial sector and for manufacturing as a whole.
The construction of the major variables is similar for both
countries except that in the U.S. we were able to use 3—digit
SIC level deflators and business segment information to construct



                               8
 individual firm sales deflators while for Japan we had to use
 general B—digit level deflators.(l1) In both countries the gross
 plant figures were converted from historical to constant prices
 using the information contained in the net versus gross plant
distinctjon..(12) In neither data set do we have information on

hours worked, and materials purchases are only available for
Japan. (13)

     There are a number of interesting observations to be made

on the basis of Tables 4A and B, some less obvious than others.
The major contrast between the two countries is in the

employment story and the associated productivity movements. In

Japan total employment declined on the average in 8 out of the 9
industrial groupings. In the U.S. it rose in all sectors. In
fact, real output per firm as measured by deflated sales grew
at about the same rate in the U.S. as in Japan, 3.5 percent per

year on average, the big difference in the productivity numbers
coming essentially from the behavior of the employment series.
The same thing is also true for the growth in the capital—labor
ratio, which grew twice as fast in Japan than in the U.S.,
while the capital stock was growing at roughly similar rates in

both countries during this same period. What is also interesting
in both countries is that the growth of the capital—labor ratio
was very similar for the different industrial groupings, varying
much less than the growth in the output—labor ratio. This is
consistent with the hypothesis that the real wage—capital user
cost ratio moved differently in the two countries but essentially
similarly for the different industries within these countries.



                            9
     If one looks at the estimate of total fartor productivity

growth that one gets by assuming a common capital input weight
of .25 for all firms in both countries one   finds   several

commonalities and also same contrasts. In both countries the

high R&D industries 5plit in their productivity experience:
electric equipment and instruments have the highest productivity
growth rates while chemicals are among the lowest ones.        The

major contrasts occur in the machinery, transportation
equipment and drugs industries where there was significant
productivity growth in Japan but not in the U.S.(l') Only in
the -food industry did the U.S. do significantly better than

Japan as far as total factor productivity growth is concerned.
     One cannot compare these numbers directly to similar macro
estimates, both because the numbers we report are unweighted
firm averages and because in both countries many of the firms are

multi—nationals with neither their employment nor productivity
restricted entirely to the country of origin. Nevertheless, the
fragmentary macro evidence that we have examined to date is not

inconsistent with these findings. For example, Jorgenson and
Fraumeni (1985) find that the TFP growth between 1973 and 1979

was among the highest in the electrical equipment industry in
the U.S. and among the lowest in the chemical industry as is

also true for the Japanese data examined by Jorgenson, Kuroda,
and Nishimizu (1985).



IV. R&D INTENSITY AND PRODUCTIVITY GROWTH AT THE FIRM LEVEL
     The model we consider can be thought of as a modified


                           10
 version of the Cobb—Douglas production function in its growth
 rate form, with labor productivity being a function of the
 physical capital—labor ratio and research capital. Because e
 have only a very short history of research expenditures for
most of these firms it is difficult to construct a reliable

research capital measure. We use, therefore, the R&D
 intensity version of this model instead, substituting the
beginning period R&D to sales ratio for the unavailable R&D
capital variable.(15)
      Let the true equation be

                  (q—2) =   A   + c(c-2) + yk + u



where small lettered variables stand for rates of growth of
logarithmic changes; q, £ , and c represent output, employment,

and physical capital respectively;, 1< is a measure of accumulated
research capital; c ,            ,y     are the elasticies of output with
respect to physical capital, labor and research capital.
  =   1   —   —
                  , A is a constant which reflects among
other things disembodied technical change, and u is a,
hopefully, random disturbance standing in for all other

unspecified effects affecting measured productivity growth.

The research capital elasticity y is equal by definition to
(dQ/dK)*(K/Q) and k is dKIK. We can then simplify the Y*k
term to r*(R/Q), where r=dQfdK is the marginal product of
research capital and R is the level of R&D expenditures.

      Two points need to be made about this type of simplification:
Firstly, it is assumed that R is a good proxy for net investment
in R&D capital. This can be only true i-f there is no or little


                                   11
depreciation of research capital or if we are in the
beginning phases of accumulation and the initial stocks of K

are small. Secondly, it is assumed that r rather than

y    is constant across firms, that is, the elasticity '               is
variable but that the rate of return r is the parameter that
is more or less equalized across firms.(16)
     The equations that we estimate are then                the form

               (q—2)   =X+   (c—i) +   p2 +   r(R/Q) + u

where the rates of growth of (y—), (c—fl,                  are generally

computed for the seven year period 1973—80. Several
alternative measures of R/Q were tried with largely
similar results. The final variable chosen AR/S relates the
average amount of deflated R&D during 1972—1974 to the mean
(geometric) levels of deflated sales for the period as a whole

(average of 1973 and 1980 sales). The numerator of this ratio

relates to the beginning of the period and allows, implicitly,
for an approximate three year lag in the effects of R&D.(17)
The denominator is positioned in the middle of the period to
reduce the spuriousness which may arise when a growth rate is
related to a ratio whose denominator is in fact the initial level
from which the growth rate is measured(l8) Instead of a unique
trend term we include, usually, separate industry dummy variables
which allow for differential industrial trends of disembodied
technical change, and also for deflator errors and industry

wide changes in capacity utilization. Such equations were
also estimated separately for each industrial grouping.
     Table 5 summarizes our main econometric results. The

                              12
 estimated R&D coefficients in the productivity grOwth

 equations are of similar magnitude in both countries. The
 major difference is that once separate industry trends are
 allowed for, this coefficient for Japan is not statistically

significant at conventional significance levels. In both
countries, the coefficient of the R&D variable falls

substantially when industry dummies (trends) are allowed for,
implying, possibly, the presence of significant inter—firm R&D
spillovers. On the other hand, the contribution of the R&D
variable to the explanation of the variance in productivity
growth across firms is rather small, the fit barely improving
in the second decimal place. Nor can R&D account for the mean
difference in growth rates between the two countries. Both
the average R&D intensities and the estimated coefficients
are quite close to each other. Nevertheless, if these

coefficients are taken at face value, they imply that R&D
contributed on the average between 0.4 and 0.6 percent per

year to productivity growth in both countries. Not a small
matter after all.

     What is most striking in our results is the lower

estimated contribution of physical capital to output growth in
the U.S. It is about half of what is estimated for Japan. In
fact, if we apply the coefficients in Table 5 (regression 3)
to the first row of Table 4, we can account for about half of

the Japan—U.S. difference in productivity growth by the twice
as fast rate of growth of the capital—labor ratio in Japan and
its twice as large effect on productivity there. The reasons


                          13
for both of these remain to be elucidated.(19) On the other
hand, the Japanese data seem also to imply a much sharper rate
of diminishing returns. This last estimate (the —.24 coefficient

in regression 5) seems rather difficult to believe; it could

be due to errors in the Japanese labor variable or to our

inability to take properly the problem of varying capacity
utilization and hours of work properly into account. In any
case, since the Japanese firms reduced their average employment
during this period such "diminishing returns" could not serve

as a brake on their productivity growth..
     Table 6 summarizes our attempts to look at the same

issues for the individual industries. Given the high error
rates in the data at the firm level and the relatively small
sample sizes there is little to be seen there. Consistent
with our earlier finding of an overall not statistically
significant R&D coefficient in Japan, the individual industry
estimates are about half positive and half negative and only
three of them have both the right sign and exceed their
estimated standard error. In the U.S. data matters are only
slightly better: seven out of the nine industries have
positive R&D coefficients and four of them are larger than
their estimated standard errors. There is little
relationship, however, in the relative size of these
coefficients across the the same industry groupings in the
two countries (see Panel S of Table 6>.

     We made several efforts to improve matters by redefining
variables and changing the time periods somewhat but to litte
effect. The results are quite robust to the use of net rather


                         14
 than gross physical capital measures or to changes in the
averaging procedures for the R&D data.. Changing time periods,
however, makes more of a difference. Using the slightly

shorter 1974—79 period improves matters somewhat in Japan
but deteriorates them in the U.S. This leads us to a

disappointing finding: the instability of the productivity—
R&D relationship and its sensitivity to the business cycle and
macro supply shocks..

     Table 7 presents annual estimates of the R&D coefficients

using approximate TFP growth as the dependent variable. We
use TFP here to avoid adding another source of variation which
would come from allowing also the physical capital elasticity

to vary from year to year.(20) What is striking is that in
both countries the oil shock induced sharp recession of 1974—5
hit the R&D intensive firms disportionately hard, though the
exact timing was a bit different in the two countries.. It is
not clear, however, whether what we see in this table
represents a real phenomenon or is just another reflection of
the thinness of our data and our inability to estimate such

effects precisely..



V. TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONS

     Japanese manufacturing firms spent about as much of their
own money on R&D, relative to their sales, as did similar U.S.
firms; about 1.9 versus 2.3 percent respectively in 1976. On
the basis of the econometric analysis of our sample of R&D
firms we cannot reject the hypothesis that the contribution of



                           15
these expenditures to productivity growth was about the same
in both countries. Hence there is no indication that
differences in either the intensity or the fecundity of R&D
expenditures can account for the rather large difference in

the observed rates of growth of productivity between the two
countries.(21) The reasons for this difference must be looked

for elsewhere.
     We do find two important differences between Japan and the
U.S. which help to account for some a-f this difference but

require an explanation of   their   own:

     1.   In spite of their success in growing and exporting,

Japanese firms reduced their employment levels significantly
during this period while U.S. firms were increasing theirs. This
alone is enough to account for the twice as fast growth in the
capital—labor ratio in Japanese manufacturing since the capital
stock itself has been growing at roughly similar rates in both

countries.
     2. For not well understood reasons, the estimated effect
of growth in the capital—labor ratio on firm productivity in
manufacturing appears to be twice as large in Japan than in the
U.S. An exploration a-f the reasons for this difference awaits

better data, another occasion, and perhaps a different approach

to the problem.
     There are a number of other puzzling findings which we
hope to return to in the future: Why did the chemical industry
perform so badly during this period in both countries? Why
did the drug industry do so badly in the U.S. during these

same years?      Is this a real fact or an artifact of poor


                            16
 deflators? While the oil—price shocks provide some
 explanation for the poor performance of the chemical firms
 along lines outlined by Bruno and Sachs (1985) it is doubtful
 that they can also explain the experience of the

 pharmaceutical firms in the U.S. Why does the effect of R&D

 intensity on productivity growth vary so much over the cycle?
 Is it because it should only be observable at or near full

capacity? How can such consideration be incorporated into a
more complete analysis of our data?

     An improved analysis of the role of R&D expenditures in
the growth of Japanese firms will require better data than is
currently available to us. The Japanese Statistics Office has
collected much more extensive and presumably more reliable data

on R&D expenditures of firms for many years but as far as we
know these data have not been accessible, nor have they been

used in their detailed micro form. In the U.S. similarly

collected data by NSF—Census have been matched for different
surveys and brought together in a usable data file. The
confidentiality problem was solved by performing all of the
major data assembly and cleaning operations within the Census
and by releasing only variance—covariance matrices for the
major variables across firms and years without disclosing any

individual firm information.(22) It would be certainly
interesting to launch a similar effort in Japan. Another
way of dealing with the confidentiality requirement is to
carry out the econometric analysis within the National
Statistical Office itself, as was the case for our studies


                            17
for France.(23)
     We cannot expect, however, that having better and more
reliable data will solve all the problems What we are looking
for are effects which are at best variable, uncertain and more or
less long term in nature, and which are also relatively small in
magnitude. This does not mean, of course, that these effects are
unimportant or that we should not devote more effort in trying to
analyze them. ut we cannot expect to account for much of the

observed growth in productivity by focusing only on the firm's
own R&D investments. The role of research spiliovers between
-firms, sectors and countries and the impact of other, less

formal, ways of generating technical progress, are both likely
to be quite large and remain still to be measured.

 *We are indebted to T. Tachibanaki for providing us with the

 Japanese data and helping in their interpretation, to A. Neff for
 help with Japanese price indexes, to 1. Abbott and M. Sassenou
 for very able research assistance, and to the National Science

Foundation (PRA81—08635 and 9ES82—08006), CNRS and the National
Bureau of Economic Research Program on Productivity and Technical
Change studies for financial support.



1. One exception at the macro level is Mohnen, Nadiri and

Prucha, 1984. After this paper was written we became aware also
of   the   work of Odagiri, 1983, and Odagiri and Iwata, 1985, who use
the same Japanese data base to construct value—added based TFP
growth measures and relate them to firm R&D intensities.

Their results for Japan are similar to ours but they do not make
cross country comparisons, however.
2. These numbers come from the national R&D surveys conducted
by the Statistics Bureau in the Prime Ministers Office in Japan and
the National Science Foundation in the United States.
3. Some of this contrast may be an artifact of different

reporting conventions in the two countries. A perusal of the
individual firm data seems to indicate that there is less

consolidation in Japan, with more units which in the U.S.
would be treated as subsidiaries appearing as independent
firms in the Japanese sources.

4. See Peck, 1985, for more discussion of this difference.

5. Because we try to have reasonably sized samples in the
various "industries," we have aggregated some of the more


                              19
detailed available statistics into nine industrial "sectors."

Thus, sector 2 includes chemical and rubber firms, but not

pharmaceutical ones, sector 6 includes computers, electrical

machinery, and electrical and communication equipment, while

sector 9 brings together the textile, paper, wood, glass, and
miscellaneous manufacturing industries. Petroleum refining is
excluded from our definition of "manufacturing."
6. See Bound et al, 1984 and Cummins at al, 1984 for a
discussion of the construction and description of this data set
which includes also a match to the Patent Office data on the

number of patents granted to these firms.
7. Because of the significant and intermittent non—reporting of
R&D one cannot assume that the other firms, the not included
ones, are truly "zero—R&D" firms. Thus one cannot separate our
samples clearly into R&D doing and non—R&D firms and compare the

results. This has only been possible in a study for France,
because it was conducted within the National Institute of
Statistics and we had access to the individual data 0f the French

R&D survey (see Mairesse and Cuneo, 1985).
8. The coverage ratios in Table 3 are for the most recent year
that we had data on in both the NEEDS and R&D surveys (1981) but
they are not much different in the earlier years. There has
been little improvement in R&D reporting in the NEEDS data base.

The coverage ratio for the large firms were 30 and 35 percent in
1976 and 1981 respectively. Firms that do report their R&D in
the NEEDS data base do so continuously and apparently on a

consistent basis.



                            20
 9. Even i-f the total R&D levels are about right (after

 correction) and comparable in the two countries, if the

 individual observations are subject to much error and

differences in reporting practices (especially for the smaller

R&D performers), our subsequent regression based estimates of
the "importance" of R&D may be significantly biased downward
as the result of such errors.

10. See Bound et al, 1984, for more detail.

11. In previous work, we were able to verify that using 2—
digit de-flators in the case of the U.S. had very little effect on

the regression estimates.

12. See the appendix of Griliches and Mairesse (1984) for more

detail on the adjustment of the gross plant numbers for

inflation. Using alternative measures for physical capital had
little effect on our results.

13. For Japan we were able to experiment using a value added
instead of a sales based output measure. Although deflated value
added has grown much faster than deflated sales over the seven
years of our study period, our R&D related regressions results
did not change much.

14. Using a more appropriate price deflator for the drug
companies in Japan results in a significant rise in their

estimated productivity growth relative to the earlier version
of this paper but has no effect on regression results which

allow for separate industry constants.
15. A number of issues are ignored in this formulation, not

because they are unimportant, but primarily because there is
little that we can do about them in this context. Much of the



                            21
Japanese progress may be based on imported technology.   We have

no data on this. To the extent that R&D expenditures are
required to absorb borrowed or imported technology, this may
still be captured, in part, by our measures. We can also do

little about the role of government R&D support (there are no
data on this at the firm level in either data base) or
spillovers in this context. (See Griliches, 1979, for a

discussion of these and other caveats.)
14. See Griliches 1979, and Griliches and Lichtenberg 1984 for

a related discussion of such models.
17. We tried also shorter lags, i.e., defining the R&D measure
as of 1976, the middle of our period, with significantly worse
results in both Japan and the U.S. We could not really try
for longer lags within the framework of these data bases.
18. Using sales in 1973 or an average of 1972 and 1974 sales

as a base does indeed make our results look significantly
better. Using the R/673 (est) ratio Ne., 2R73/(S72 +      674)]
in equation 5 of Table 5, for example, we get for its
coefficient .36 with a t—ratio 3 in Japan and .42 with a

t—ratio of 6 in the U.S. These are significantly higher than
the comparable numbers in Table 5. Since the R&D numerator is
the same in both measures, this does imply that our worries about

potential spuriousness may not be groundless.
19. The higher capital elasticity estimate in Japan is consistent
with the higher capital share in output reported by Jorgenson,
Kuroda and Nishimizu (1985).
20. The estimated physical capital elasticity also varies from




                               22
year to year.. But since the physical capital growth ratio

and R&D intensity variables are nearly uncorrelated, the
R&D coefficients are almost unaffected by the constraining

of the capital coefficient implicit in the TFP equations.
21. Siven the high standard errors associated with the Japanese

estimates, they are also consistent with the possibility that
such differences are indeed present and important.
22. See Griliches 1982 and 1984 and Griliches and Hall 1982 for
more detail on these data and their construction and for results
of analyses using them.
23. Since this was first written we have been informed that
such efforts are indeed underway by researchers associated with

the Economic Planning Agency in Japan..

Notes:

1. From the NEEDS (Nihon Keizai Shimbun) database. Converted to dollars
   at $1=300 yen.

2. In addition to the 394 continuously R&D reporting firms, in the Japanese
   sample, there are also 338 firms which reported nonzero RD expenditures in
   one or more years in the 1972-1980 period.

3. The data on largest R&D performing firms in Japan reported in OECD (1984)
   were used to fill in some missing values and adjust others for apparent
   underreporting.

4. In addition to the 525 continuously R&D reporting firms in the U.S. sample
   with no major jumps, there are also 129 firms which reported nonzero R&D
   expenditures in one or more years in the 1972-80 period.

5. Average of individual firm R&D to sales ratios.

            R/S 73 (est.) - 1972 through 1974 average deflated R&D divided by the average
            of deflated sales in 1972 and 1974.

            Approximate TFP (Total Factor Productivity) = growth in deflated sales per
            employee - .25 x growth in gross plant per employee.

            1OECD data (for 1979) based corrections raise this number from .011 to .016 and
            from .004 to .009 for electrical and transportation equipment industries
            respectively. For the total sample, however, these corrections raise R/S only
            by .001.

   Equations 3 through 5 contain an additional 13 industry dummy variables and
   include also the average 1972-74 employment level as a control variable for
   initial size. Its coefficient is small, positive and significant for the
   U.S. and essentially zero for Japan.

   C/L -     growth rate of gross-plant in constant prices per employee.
       L -   growth rate of employment.
   AR/S -    average R&D to sales ratio. R&D averaged for the years 1972-4,
             sales at mid-point of the period: geometric average of beginning
             (1973) and end period (1980) sales. Both variables are deflated.
   MSE -     Mean square error of regression residuals.

   Approximate TFP growth: (percent growth in deflated sales per employee) —
             .25 (percent growth in gross plant per employee).

  All equations contain an additional set of industry dummies and a base
             year (1973) size variable.

  The AR/S variable is the average of 1972—1974 R&D divided by the average
             (geometric) 1973 and 1980 sales (both deflated). It is the same
             for all years.
