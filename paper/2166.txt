                   Central Policies for Local Debt:
                     The Case of Teacher Pensions



                                 ABSTRACT




      The recent debt crises in New York City and Cleveland, the deterioration
 of public infra-structures in certain of our states and larger cities, and the
 occasional bankruptcy of smaller pension plans suggest that not all of local
 finance stands on a sound fiscal base. This paper examines the trends in
 funding for one form of state and local government debt--teacher pensions
 underfundings--and asks what a central government might do to check any
 unwanted growth in these liabilities. The analysis concludes (i) that this
 form of state-local debt is sizeable and growing, (ii) that state and local
 governments have an implicit pay-as-you-go bias in pension financing which
 encourages the growth of debt, but (iii) central government benefit and
 funding regulations or debt relief policies can slow, or even reverse, that
  growth.

     The New York City and Cleveland bond defaults, the closing as unsafe of

the bridges and roadways in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, and Cleveland, and

the declared bankruptcy of local employee pension plans in Michigan and

Pennsylvania are each a warning sign that the local fiscal sector may not, as

is often assumed, be resting upon a bedrock of fiscal surpluses. Even the

states of Texas and Alaska, once considered invulnerable to the threat of

fiscal collapse, have recently been forced to enact emergency tax measures to

insure their bills could be paid. While each of these instances has its own

unique history and may appear by itself to be an isolated event, there is a

common logic to the stories. The logic is one of fiscal competition between

local and state jurisdictions, a competition which induces local politicians

to maximize services for, and to minimize taxes upon, the current generation

of taxpayers. Yet as services rise and taxes fall for current residents and

firms, the local budget constraint requires someone to pay the shortfall.

That someone is a future taxpayer. The increased use of short-term borrowing

followed by debt roll—overs, a neglect of public infra-structures, and a

failure to adequately fund public employee pensions are all mechanisms for

shifting the current costs of public services onto future taxpayers. When

future taxpayers are unable to cover these local debts, or if they refuse, we

observe a default, a detour, or a bankruptcy.

     While it is premature to announce today a state and local fiscal crisis,

it does seem wise to begin exploring what we might propose as policies if

local debt does prove to be a problem. Significant local debt unmatched by

assets may have important long-run allocative and equity implications. To

limit such adverse effects we must look for policies today to stem its

growth. Two regulatory strategies are available to limit the growth in local

debt: reduce spending but hold taxes fixed or increase taxes but hold

spending fixed. If neither of these regulatory alternatives work——or if we

now face the problem of what to do about past debt--we might wish to consider

a debt "bail—out" strategy which more equitably distributes the burden of past

underfundings. This paper examines all three policy options for local debt

management——regulate spending, regulate taxes, or offer bail-outs——for one

particular, but important, case: public debt from underfunded teacher

pensions.

     Section II presents estimates of the current stock of unfunded pension

debt for teacher pensions and discusses the possible implications of this debt

for the efficient and fair allocation of public resources. Section III

specifies and estimates a model of debt creation via teacher pension

underfundings and, given this model, predicts the likely trends in

underfundings to the year 2000. Section IV outlines three policy strategies

for the management of teacher underfundings--(i) a reduction in promised

pension benefits (a "control spending" policy), (ii) an increase in required

contributions (a "tax increase" policy), and (iii) a federal pension

assistance program (a "debt bail-out" policy)--and then simulates the relative

impact of each reform on the future trend in pension underfundings. Section V

summarizes our results.


II. The Funding Status of Teacher Eensions

     Teachers comprise the largest single group of state and local public

employees. They are compensated, as are most public employees, through direct

wage payments and through the promise of a pension upon retirement. Teacher

pensions are defined benefit pensions which give each retiree an annuity upon


16.11.3
                                     —3—



retirement equal to a fixed fraction, called the replacement rate, of the

teacher's pre-retirernent salary. The replacement rate is defined as the

product of the annual benefit accrual rate (typically .02 per year) times the

number of years of teacher service. More recently, states have supplemented

this fixed annuity with a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) to protect the real

value of the annuity in times of high inflation.

     The accumulation of these pension obligations constitutes a fiscal

liability for which the taxpayers of' the state are responsible. To relieve

this liability, taxpayers can adopt either of two funding strategies. First,

taxpayers can save an amount each year such that those savings plus earned

interest will be just sufficient to pay the promised pensions of the teachers

when they retire. This strategy, called full—funding, insures that at the end

of each fiscal year, existing pension fund assets plus expected future

contributions are just equal to the expected pension obligations. The second

strategy, called pay—as—you-go, makes no explicit contributions for future

pensions but simply budgets for those expenditures when they fall due as part

of a current accounts allocation. The funding status of a pension fund

measures the gap between the present value of the promised pension obligations

and the present value of future employee contributions plus current plan

assets. Projections of pension benefits are based upon the growth in teacher

wages, the growth in the number of teachers who reach retirement, the

longevity of retired teachers, and the replacement rate (plus COLA protection,

if any) of the pension plan. Projections of future contributions depend upon

existing state laws for required employee contributions (usually as a fraction

of teacher wages) and the expected growth in teacher wages and employment.

This gap between the present value of promised obligations and the present

value of expected contributions and existing assets is called the unfunded



16.11.3

liability   of the teacher pension and measures the implicit public debt created

for taxpayers by the pension system.

     What is the present funding status of teacher pensions? Inman (1986a)

provides one set of estimates for the decade 1971-1980 for the forty-eight

mainland state teacher plans. Table 1 summarizes the main results. Three

conclusions emerge from the analysis. First, the trend in the average level

of real underfundings has been steadily upward over the decade, measured

either from the perspective of taxpayers (column 1) or teachers (column 3).

Second, the real level of implicit public debt is significant, approaching 8%

of taxpayer real income by 1980 (column 2) and 60% of the promised pension

wealth to the average teacher (column U). Third, there is great variation in

the level of pension—created public debt; some plans are in real trouble with

debt levels over $500/resident (column 6) while other plans are well funded

with debt levels of only a $100/resident or less (column 5).

     If allowed to grow, these underfundings of teacher pensions may have

significant consequences for economic efficiency and fiscal equity. First,

increases in the stock of public employee pension debt may have adverse

effects on private savings in a manner fully analogous to increases in social

security debt; see E'eldstein (1974). If increases in public employee pension

debt are viewed by current employees and taxpayers as a transfer of' wealth

from future taxpayers to themselves, the "created wealth" may induce a decline

in today's rate of private savings; Inman and Seidman (1979) have found some

tentative evidence for this hypothesis using aggregate time series data for

the United States. Second, underfunded state and local pensions may create an

incentive to over-provide state and local services or to adopt a less than

efficient, more labor-intensive technology for service provision. Public

employees are compensated for their effort with a wage and a pension. If the

pension is underfunded by current taxpayers, it is possible for some of the

costs of current period labor to be shifted onto future taxpayers. If current

taxpayers then escape this burden--for example, by re-locating before the

pension debt falls due--then an implicit subsidy results in which future

taxpayers support a fraction of the labor costs of public services received by

current taxpayers. The resulting subsidy may stimulate a less than efficient

provision of state and local services; Inman (1982, 1986b) provides some

evidence that the purchase of public employee services is sensitive to the

degree of pension underfunding. Third, if pension underfunding precipitates a

fiscal crisis-—as is may have in the case of New york City--cities or states

may be forced into austerity budgeting with adverse consequences for the

provision of services. Such crisis fiscal management discourages the location

of economic activity to the possible detriment of long-run spatial efficiency.

     The consequences of significant pension underfundings for fiscal equity

may be no less important. tjnderfundings benefit current taxpayers at the

possible expense of future taxpayers, future retirees, or future consumers of

public services. While aggregate income will be rising over time and the

average future taxpayer will be richer than the average current taxpayer, it

is not clear that state-local pension underfundings will automatically involve

a transfer from a rich future taxpayer to a poorer current taxpayer. If

underfundings can be avoided by re-locating and if the wealthy are more likely

to know the level of' underfundings and have a wider set of possible re-

location choices, then it may be that it is the richer current taxpayers who

escape high underfundings and leave the burden for relatively poorer future

taxpayers. This burden may be shared with future retirees if the promised

pension is not fully paid or with future public service recipients (e.g.,

children) if services are curtailed. Balancing these resulting transfers of



16.11.3
                                       —6—




wealth will require an explicit welfare judgment, but the fact remains that

sizeable underfundings create potentially significant, and possibly unwanted,

redistributions of social resources.

     There is one important check to all of these adverse consequences of

public pension debt, however. There is for public pension debt--and for

state—local debt generally—-a Ricardiari neutrality result which insures that

current taxpayers will bear the burdens of any state and local underf'undings.

If future taxpayers recognize the burden of the underfundings, they will

demand a fully compensating reduction in the price they pay for land when they

move into the state or local jurisdiction. This reduction in land price

insures that the current, not future, taxpayers bear the full burden of the

created public debt. Not only are any adverse redistributive effects avoided

by this capitalization process, but so too are the efficiency effects of

underfunding. Current taxpayer wealth, once increased by underfunding, is

returned to its original levels through capitalization; the disincentive to

private savings is thereby removed. Further, current taxpayers now bear the

full responsibility for the costs of hiring public employees; thus, efficient

labor hiring will result. Finally, while public employee pension debt still

exists on the books of the state or local government, the asset position of

future taxpayers has been increased by an equal amount thereby mitigating the

risks of a fiscal crisis. Through the capitalization of underfunded pension

debt, the private sector can neutralize the excesses of the public sector.

The important question is: Does it? Here the evidence is meager. Epple and

Schipper (1981) find evidence of full capitalization, but Iriman (1982, 1986b)

finds that employees and taxpayers budget as if only partial or no

capitalization occurs. The definitive resolution of this issue remains a

central research question.

      In the meantime, it seems prudent to address the question of what can be

done to control the future growth of state-local debt generally, and teacher

pension debt in particular. That is our task here. When the economic

interests of future taxpayers go unrepresented in the political arena, or

stand unprotected in the market place, then central government intervention

may be desirable. To examine the relative effectiveness of a central

government policy towards local debt, we must first determine the causes of

that debt. Section III provides the needed analysis for teacher pension

underfundirigs.


III. Teacher Pension Underfundings: Causes and Trends

      A. Pension Accounting

      The unfunded liability of a public employee pension system, of which

teacher pensions are typical, is defined as expected plan liabilities less

expected plan contributions and existing plan assets. Under plausible

specifications for the structure of plan benefits and plan required

contributions, the present value of expected liabilities less expected

employee contributions can be defined as an actuarial constant, Q, times the

current wage bill, wZ, paid to today's employees, 2., receiving a wage of w;

see Inman (1986a). Subtracting the level of assets accumulated to today will

define the remaining unfunded liability, U, due to be paid by taxpayers:1


(1)                               U2w2.-A

From the perspective of taxpayers, the actuarial constant 2 can be defined as

a positive function of the plan's benefit replacement rate (8) and the plan's

degree of COLA protection against inflation (specified as the rate of

protection, p,    times the rate of inflation, ) and a negative function of the
plan's required rate of contribution from employees (1e)     c2 will also depend



16.11.3
                                          -8-




upon the years of employee service before retirement (R) and the expected rate

of growth in employee wages        LJo   clear a priori predictions for the

effects of R and u on 2 are possible, however. Both variables increase the

level of benefits and the level of employee contributions; if the benefit

effect dominates (is dominated by) the contribution effect then c2 will rise

(fall) as R or w increases. Formally, we specify 2 as:


(2)                        c2
                                c2(, ' 0e'          R, w)


      The asset position of the pension plan is given by the level of assets

accumulated prior to today, A1, plus net contributions made today (n):


(3)                                      n +   A1

Net contributions in turn equals taxpayer contributions, plus interest

earnings, plus additional employee contributions above their required

contributions, less benefits paid from the plan to current plan members. In

the case of teacher pensions, taxpayer contributions come from two sources.

The first is the contribution that taxpayers make as local taxpayers

responsible for teacher salaries. Local contributions are often legally

required at a rate 1g of teacher wages; supplemental contributions above
                                                                                flg

are also possible. These payments are made by the local school district to

the state teacher pension plan. The second contribution is made by taxpayers

through the state legislature's decision to supplement the local

contributions. We shall denote the total of' local school district

contributions as Cg and the state legislative contribution as p.         In addition

to their required contributions (at rate '1e of wages), employees may be asked

to make supplemental contributions to the plan; these supplemental

contributions from employees we denote as             Interest earnings equal the



16. 11.3
                                                 -9—




plan's rate of return (r) times the level of last period's assets—-that is,

rA1. Finally, benefits paid to plan members (denoted b) go to current

retirees and to other members for disability or as lump-sum payments upon

withdrawal from plan. Formally, n can be specified as:


                               np+c g+s e÷rA-1 —b.
       In fact, the net contribution relationship may be more than a mere budget

identity. The institutions which administer the pension system may allow for

the possibility of a less than dollar for dollar relationship between gross

and net contributions. A dollar that flows into the pension system from 0g

and 5e may not be fully allocated to the accumulation of pension assets via an

increase in n. Taxpayers may instruct their elected representatives

administering the pension to circumvent plan regulations and syphon off a

portion,     of (cg + Se) for use elsewhere in the state budget.2 If so,

only (1 -              ÷   will be finally allocated to assets via n.             It is also
            )(cg
possible for current taxpayers to tap into interest earnings. Most state laws

only require that interest earnings up to a pre-assigned interest rate to

remain within the pension fund; "excess" earnings, denoted as (rA1), may be

allocated to other state activities.3 If so, then only (1 -                    )(rA1)   remains

within the pension accounts for accumulation via n.                  If in fact state—

administered pension plans can be so manipulated for the benefit of the

general state budget, then the net contribution equation becomes a behavioral

relationship of the general form:


                   n       —   b}   +   (1 —          +   + (1   —
                                                                     .)(rA1)
(14)
                                               )(Cg
Equation (4) will be estimated as part of our behavioral model of pension

uriderfundings.




16.11.3
                                        -10-



      Equations (1)-(14) define the dynamic    path   of pension underfundings. For

this analysis the pension plan's replacement rate (s),       the rate of COLA
protection (p),   the required rates of employee and local taxpayer

contributions (Tie and flg) and the typical number of years of service CR) are

taken as given. The rate of inflation () is also exogenous. Endogenous to

the analysis and specified as part of a behavioral model of pension

underfundings are teacher wages (w), teacher employment CL), state government

contributions (p), total local government contributions (Cg) supplemental

employee contributions          the average rate of return on pension assets Cr),

and total benefits paid (b).


      B. A Behavioral Model of Underfundings

      Three groups have a vested interest in the outcomes of the pension

benefit and funding decisions: current teachers (and retirees), current

taxpayers (and their children), and future taxpayers. However, only two of

these groups have a direct say in the final allocations. Benefits and

fundings are decided by current teachers and current taxpayers within the

state and local fiscal process. Yet future taxpayers are not without

influence. To the extent current taxpayers become future taxpayers by

remaining within the state, the voices of future taxpayers will be heard by

proxy. Further, future taxpayers may simply refuse to pay for pensions over

which they had no direct say. Finally, future taxpayers can demand a

compensating reduction in land prices equal to any unfunded pension

liabilities created by the decisions of current taxpayers and teachers. The

first strategy-—proxy voting——requires a low rate of resident turnover in

the state. If a majority of current taxpayers move before the pensions fall

due then the voice of future taxpayers, even if heard, will most likely go

unheeded. The   second   strategy--refusal to pay—-has been effectively removed

by the courts in most states; the pension agreement is now viewed as a

contractual obligation.5 It is the third strategy—-capitalization of

underfundings—-WhiCh offers future taxpayers their best hope of influencing

the current pension decisions of present taxpayers and teachers.

     Against the backdrop of voter turnover, court enforcement, and potential

capitalization, current taxpayers and teachers negotiate the level of' pension

benefits and pension funding. Negotiations take place within three distinct

institutional settings. The first-—pension fund regulation and

administration—-enforces existing rules as established by the fund's enabling

legislation. A pension board, composed of current taxpayers (generally

appointed by the governor or state legislature) and current teachers

(generally elected by plan members), sets benefit levels (b), determines

contributions from teachers      and local taxpayers (Cg) and defines the

plan's investment policy and hence the rate of return on assets (r). The

second institutional level-—the state legislature——defines a supplemental

contribution (p) for the funding of the pensions. The allocation p from the

state legislature is set as part of the general state budgetary process and is

meant to meet any special financial needs of the fund, defined in most cases

by a recent actuarial evaluation of the plan's funding status. At the third

level of decision—making, the local school district level, current taxpayers

and current teachers bargain over the level of teachers' salaries (w) and

employment (t). Decisions by taxpayers and teachers within these regulatory,

legislative, and local bargaining institutions define the seven endogenous

variables (b, Cg Se r, p, w, and c) needed to predict--along with the four

funding equations in (1) to (14) above—-the future path of pension debt.6

period i971-1980. Benefits (b) and contributions (Cg Se ) are defined in

real (1967) dollars per taxpayer. The fund's rate of return Cr) is defined as

the plan's current investment earnings divided by last year's level of' assets,

both measured in 1967 dollars. Teacher wages (w) are measured in real (1967)

dollars per teacher while teacher employment (9W)   is   specified as the number of

public school teachers per 1000 taxpayers. Equations (5)-(8) of Table 2 and

equations (9)-(11) of Table 3 were estimated jointly by three—stage least

squares because of possible correlation of error terms across the seven

behavioral equations; the variables b, Cg 5e' r, p, w, and 9.     are    endogenous.

     Benefits are paid to current retirees and to disabled teachers or to

teachers who withdraw from the plan during the year. The pension regulation

board is responsible for setting benefits according to a previously legislated

benefit structure for retirees and disabled workers——defined here by a state

specific constant term times the lagged wage bill, O(wz) 1--but the board may

offer supplemental benefits to eligible members if it wishes. These

supplemental benefits are hypothesized to depend upon the level of private

good prices in the state (CPI) and the availability of income to the fund from

contributions (Cg + Se) and investment earnings (rA_1). Estimated

eq. (5) does show state pension boards will supplement statutory benefits in

times of rising prices and as contributions and investment earnings

increase. The significant positive effect of (cg +          and (rA_1) on benefits

is important for it shows a willingness on the part of the pension board to

channel current income into current benefits.

     The contribution equations specify employer (Cg) and supplemental

employee      contributions to be a fixed rate times the expected wage bill.

The expected wage bill is specified as last period's wage bill per taxpayer

plus the expected growth in the wage bill:   (1 +
                                                    w)(wZ)1,   where w    is   the




16. 11.3
                                       —13—




annual rate of growth in the wage bill over the decade 1971-1980. For
employers (i.e., school districts), the rate of contribution consists of the

statutory rate of contribution (n) plus a supplemental rate of contribution

set by the pension board. This supplemental rate is assumed to depend upon

the level of state prices (CPI), the level of lagged underfunding per

taxpayer (U1), the expected growth in the wage bill (1 +    ),   whether the plan

is integrated with social security (if so, SS     1, 0 otherwise), whether the

plan is a teacher-only plan (if so, TEACH     1, 0 otherwise), the percent of'

the pension board which is elected by the members (%ELC), the percent of last

year's taxpayers who remain within the state (STAY), and whether the governor

(to whom the board generally reports) is a Republican (if so, REP      1, 0

otherwise). For employees, the supplemental rate of contribution is also

specified to depend upon the CPI, U1, (1 +    w), SS, TEACH, %ELC, STAY and REP,
though we may see different effects of these variables on cg and 5e because of

the desire of the pension board to shift the funding burdens between teachers

and current taxpayers. Note that the statutory contributions by employees at

rate      are not included here for they have already been specified within the

model as part of the actuarial constant c; see equation (2).

       Four general points emerge from the estimated contribution

equations (6) and (7). Rising private good prices elicit a higher rate of

taxpayer contributions but leave teacher contributions (given real wages)

unaffected. When seen in conjunction with the benefit equation, it appears

teachers are able to extract real transfers from current taxpayers in an

inflationary environment. Second, the insignificant effect of U_1 and the

significant negative effect of real wage growth and STAY on contributions

implies a strong pay-as-you-go bias to contribution behavior. Third,

participation in social security and the fact that a plan may be for teachers



16.11.3
only both reduce the rates of employer and employee contributions. We

interpret both effects as an indication that perceived future plan security by

employees will encourage less funding. Finally, politics matter. Increased

representation by teachers on the pension board and the political inclination

of the administering agent--the governor--both have important effects on

contributions. The effects, both negative, may seem counter-intuitive, but

there are good reasons for believing the results. If teachers are confident

that they will receive their pensions, then it is in their interest to

minimize current taxpayer funding of pensions. The released dollars can then

be allocated to current period wage and employment growth. This is exactly

the behavior we observe here. The negative effect of Republican governors on

funding, all else equal, reflects the general tendency of Republicans to be

the party of tax control in the 197Os.8

        In contrast to contribution behavior, investment performance seems

largely immune to overt political manipulation. Equation (8) estimates the

determinants of portfolio performance measured against the risk-free rate of

return on Treasury Bills (rf) for the year, (r -       rf).   The pension's

performance is compared to the return on a "market portfolio" of stocks,

bonds, time deposits, and mortgages, similarly measured against the risk-free

rate, (rm -   rf).9    If the return on the pension portfolio is perfectly

correlated with movements in the market portfolio, then the coefficient on

                      the beta coefficient——will be 1; if the two portfolios are
(rm —   rf)__called
uncorrelated then the coefficient on (rm —     rf)   will be zero. In fact, for the

decade 1971-80, teacher pension portfolios appear irnmuned from movements in

the returns of a general market portfolio. Rather, teacher pension portfolios

largely tracked the risk-free Treasury rate. Furthermore, a specification

which allowed the beta coefficient to vary across states could be rejected in



16.11.3
                                         —15—



favor of a common coefficient.° All states seem to play a conservative

investment strategy.

     Table 3   details   the influence of the determinants of state pension

funding via legislative allocation (p) and teacher wages (w) and employment

(.t) via local school district labor bargaining. The model specified here is a

linear, reduced form model of legislative bargaining and local labor

negotiations; Inman (1986b) presents the underlying structural model.

Supplemental pension funding by the state legislature-—p in eq. (9)-—is seen

to depend upon exogenous fiscal resources available to the state budget

(income, non-matching federal aid, and any spill-overs to the general budget

from contributions to the pension budget from 5e' Cg or rA_1); the net—of-

federal-deduction tax price for state spending (1 -    tf   where t is the

marginal tax rate for the state's median income); the relative bargaining

position of teachers versus taxpayers in the legislature, measured by the

political resources of the National Education Association lobby (NEA dues per

teacher, the presence of an NEA legislative liaison, and the power of the ally

public union AFSCME); the potential voice of future taxpayers in the state

legislature, measured by the percent of taxpayers who stay within the state

from one year to the next (STAY); and the stock of pension underfunding per

taxpayer in the previous year (U_1) whose influence on p may vary if there

exists a court-enforced pension guarantee. State legislative decisions on p

may also be influenced by the expected levels of teacher wages and

employment. If so, the exogenous determinants of w and L should also be

included in the pension funding equation as well as in the wage and employment

equations. Those variables include the likely determinants of' the demand for

education such as state income and the net-of-federal-deduction tax price as

well as such tastes—for-education variables as the percent of local taxable

property which is commercial-industrial, the percent of' the population over

the age 65, the number of school age children per family, and the percent of

school age children in public schools. Also important to the local

determination of wages and employment is the local labor bargaining

environment, specified here by the percent of school districts with more than

2500 teachers, the percent of teachers covered by collective bargaining

agreements, the alternative private sector wage (measured by the state's

average wage earned in retail and wholesale trade and selective services) and

its interaction with the percent of' teachers covered by bargaining, and an

actuarial constant (denoted t) which measures the current period cash value of

future retirement benefits specified as the ratio of required full-funding

contributions to current wages (the mean    equals .17 for our sample).

Finally, local school wages and employment will also be strongly influenced by

state-to-local school aid, a variable determined as part of the legislative

deliberations which set state pension funding. Thus all the exogenous

determinants of p--which also define state school aid—-will have a role to

play in setting w and z.

     The model's specification also allows for a direct influence of' the

state's private good price level (denoted CPI) on the nominal levels of state

pension contributions (p) and on teacher wages (w). While an effort is often

made in bargaining and budget negotiations to track a state's cost-of-living

with nominal adjustments in fiscal variables such as p and w, there is no

reason to think the process does so perfectly. To capture this direct effect

of price adjustments on the real values of p and w, we first specify these

equations in nominal terms. All variables are then deflated by the state

price index (CPI). While CPI does not appear directly in the real p and real

w equations, the intercept term in those equations will measure the direct



16.1 1.3
effect of price changes on p and w. These results are reported in Table 3 as

the direct CPI effect. For the teacher equation (9.), all exogenous variables

are measured in real terms and the state CPI is entered directly into the 9.

equation.11 Table 3 reports the influence of all exogenous variables on p

(eq. 9), w (eq. 10), and 9. (eq. 11).

     State income, federal aid, and the net-of-deduction tax price have no

significant effect on legislated pension funding. What does influence

legislated funding are the dollar flows into the regulated pension accounts

via 5e' °g' and rA1. Additional payments by local taxpayers through cg are

offset by a $.52 per dollar reduction in spending on p. Increases in teacher

contributions to funding through Se lead to an insignificant increase in p of'

$.05 per dollar. Finally, a one dollar increase in interest earnings

increases p by $.38. Together, however, there is a small net decline in

legislative contributions (p) of $.03 as total regulated contributions rise by

one dollar ($.33 from Cg 5e and rA1, respectively). This tiny cutback in

legislative spending on p is allocated to increased expenditures on other

state activities or to state tax relief; not shown here, but see Inman

(1986b).

     Just as with administratively set pension contributions (eg and e' the

lagged stock of pension underfundings (U_1) has only a small effect on the

legislated contributions (p) and the subsequent accumulation of pension

assets. For example, from Table 3 a $100 increase in the stock of pension

underfundings per taxpayer has no effect on legislated contributions in states

without a pension guarantee (Pension Guaranteed   0) and only a $.50/taxpayer

effect on p ($.50 = (-.000 + .005) x $100) in states where pensions are

guaranteed (Pension Guaranteed    1). If continued for 30 years (a typical

repayment period for new pension debt), this $.50/taxpayer flow will



16. 11.3
                                       -18-



accumulate (assuming a real rate of return of .03) to about $25/taxpayer in

pension assets by year 30, the present value of which (discounting at .03) is

$10.30. Thus an exogenous increase of $100 in pension debt stimulates at most

a $10.30 increase in pension assets from legislative contributions. Again, we

observe a preference for pay—as-you-go financing for teacher pensions, now on

the part of elected legislators.

     The teacher coalition does not seem to be a strong counterforce to the

apparent pressure from taxpayers to ignore underfundings. Teachers do not

allocate their state political influence-—measured here by the variables 'JEA

Dues and NEA Liaison-—to pension funding; both variables are statistically and

quantitatively insignificant. What does seem to help pension funding is

pressure from current taxpayers who stay within the state. An increase of' .03

in the percent of state residents who do not move in a given year (a one

standard deviation increase from a mean of' .89) will increase funding by about

$3.22 per taxpayer adjusted for the level of' state prices. Interestingly,

AFSCME membership also matters. A doubling of the percent of state employees

in AFSCME (from a mean of .10 to .20) increases pension funding for teachers

by about $.62 adjusted for state prices.12 Finally, the demographic downturn

in the number of school age children and an increase in private education have

also helped state funding. As the number of children in public schools

decline, there is less pressure on the current education budget and hence less

need for state school aid. This frees a few dollars for pension funding.      A

10% decline in the number of' children in public schools increases real

spending on p by $1.13/taxpayer through the variable School-Age Kids and by

$.83/taxpayer through the variable I   Enrolled in Public Schools.3
     In contrast to pension funding, teacher wages (w) and employment () do

seem to attract economic resources and political capital. Residential income

                                            —19—



and federal aid both have positive effects on wages (the income elasticity

equals .25 while the aid elasticity is .08). Federal aid also stimulates

local teacher employment (the elasticity is .10). Income has a statistical

significant, but quantitatively unimportant, negative effect on employment

(the elasticity equals -.05). Measures of the net tax costs of the teacher

budget-—(1 -    tf)   and % Commercial Property--are generally insignificant.

Inflation, however, significantly increases real wages, an increase which is

offset in part by a significant decline in teacher employment; on balance, the

teacher wage bill (wL) rises with inflation. States with more large school

districts (%    Districts   >   2500 teachers) also have higher wages and

employment. Increases in the number of teachers covered by collective

bargaining (%   Collective      Bargaining) is a two-edged sword for teachers. The

results show teachers wages are initially lower in unionized as opposed to

non—unionized states. That is, non-unionized states offer a wage premium for

teachers not to organize. But once organized, unionized states do better in

protecting the teachers' relative wage position vis a vis the private

sector. In more unionized states wages rise with the private wages; in non—

unionized states they do not. These results also show a weak positive effect

of unionization on employment. The strongest influence of teacher

organizations appears to be at the state level, however. Teacher

organizations active in state politics——in this case the NEA--can have a

significant positive effect on teacher wages and employment through the

organization's ability to increase state—to—local school aid. Those effects

are seen in this reduced form model as the positive effects of NEA Dues and

the FlEA Liaison on w and £.         Finally,   while the demographic downturn in

school. age children in the last decade helped to stimulate increased state

pension funding (p), equations (10) and (11) reveal that it has also prompted



16. 11.3
                                          -20-



an increase in pension liabilities via an increase in teacher wages and

employment.

      The structure of the pension system is also a potential influence on

teacher wages and employment. But perhaps the most important result is the

non-effect of lagged pension underfundings (U1) on w and 2. Even when

pensions are not legally guaranteed, teachers do not receive a significant

increase in wages as U_1 increases; underfundings are not capitalized into

higher wages. Similarly, underfundings do not affect employment. What does

seem to influence w and 9. are the level of promised pension benefits, measured

here by ratio of required full-funding contributions to wages (a). As

rises, there is a compensating decline in teacher wages, but the amount of the

decline is less than dollar for dollar of benefit increase and is not

statistically significant. Benefit increases therefore mean an increase in

the total wage plus benefit cost (: (1 +     i)w)   of hiring a teacher. This

increase in labor costs via the increase in z induces a small, and

statistically significant, decline in employment; the elasticity of 9 with

respect to      is - .07.   However, the combined effect of an increase in   on the

total compensation paid to teacher ((1 + A)w2) is slightly positive.15

Finally, the regulated pension accounts can feed back to influence teacher

wages and employment. Increases in pension contributions from teachers (via

Se), taxpayers (via cg) and assets (via rA_1) do not--as we show below in

equation ()-—remain fully within the pension accounts. These dollars leak

out for expenditures elsewhere in the fiscal system. One outlet is increased

state-to—local school aid which in turn can be spent on increasing teacher

wages and employment. This appears to be what happens. Teacher contributions

(Se) increase      and and 2, taxpayer contributions (Og) have no effect, while

asset earnings (rA_1) have a negative effect on 2. and an insignificant effect



16. 11.3
                                             -21—




on w. Their joint effect is to increase teacher wages and to leave teacher

employment largely unchanged. For each dollar increase in exogenously

regulated pension funding ($.33 from 5e plus $.33 from cg plus $.33 from

rA_1), there is a final $.1O increase in the teacher wage bill.16

       The future consequences of these changes in funding, benefits, teacher

wages, and employment are realized through the process of asset accumulation

and liability creation for the pension fund. Equation (14) describes net

savings behavior for the fund:17


(14)    n    .9146 ( — b} + .627     (Cg +          +
                                                        .089(rA,1)   ,
                                                                         2
            (.109)*        (.086)*                      (.115)



If the fund administrators simply pass dollars into the fund from

contributions and withdraw dollars to pay brief its, then all the estimated

coefficients in eq. (14) would be 1. This is in fact the case for state

contributions less total benefits paid, (p —            b),   whose coefficient is not

significantly different from unity. The coefficients on required

contributions and on interest earnings, however, are both significantly less

than 1, and indicate that only $.627 of every regulated dollar of

contributions         +and only $.089 of every dollar of investment income
                   Og)
(rA1) are retained within the fund for future asset accumulation. Where do

the remaining $.373 of contributions and $.911 of investment earnings go? The

answer is into the general state budget for expenditure on state-to—local

school aid (and ultimately on w and 9.), for other state expenditures, or for

general tax relief. As we saw above, state legislated pension funding (p)

does not increase as (s + a + rA ) rises.
                       e    g     -1

     The final link in the behavioral model is the specification of the

actuarial constant fl which connects current wages and employment to the



16.11.3
                                               -22—



expected liability of the fund.         A linear specification for c2 gives:18


(2)         5.L1a +   96(pi)   -
                                   105e    +    .079R + 12.62u   -   3.1O(TEACH),   p2875
            (.87)* (2.61)*         (5•50)* (.007)* (6.30)* (.22)*


As expected, pension liabilities increase as the benefit replacement rate (a)

increases, as COLA protection (pu) improves, and as the required rate of'

employee contributions             declines. Liabilities are also shown to rise, on

balance, as years to retirement (R) increase and the rate of wage growth (w)

rises;    for both variables their positive influence on benefits dominates their

effects on added required contributions. Finally, a constant term for

teacher—only plans (TEACH) is included to capture the systematic differences

between the actuarial experiences of teachers and the general state employee

(e.g., longevity, work histories) or any systematic differences in plan

benefits not measured by a and pu; see, for example, the results in Quinn

(1982).

      The pension underfunding identity in equation (1), the estimated 2

specification in (2), the asset accumulation identity in (3), the net savings

equation in (Li), the regulated benefit and funding equations in (5)-(8), and

the legislative and local bargaining equations in (9)-(11) together define a

reduced form model of teacher underfundings. Given starting values for the

stock of underfundings (U_1) and pension assets (A_1), the model is capable of

predicting the future path of teacher pension debt for alternative paths of

the model's exogenous variables. Section C maps the pattern of underfunding

to the year 2000 for five such future regimes.

Simulation Regimes;

      1. Base Case:                      Demographic trends in Kids per family and the %    65 years of age are based on U.S. Bureau of Census projections to
                                         2000.  Real income per taxpayer is projected from the state's 1980 value using the actual rate of growth in state income
                                         to 1984. an a:3sumed rate of .02 thereafter.  Real private sector wage is projected from the state's 1980 value using the
                                         actual rate of growth in the private sector wage to 19811, an assumed rate of .0141 thereafter.  Rate of returns on pension
                                         fund assets assumed to equal the real rate of return on Corporate Aaa bonds until 1985, and then set equal to .05 in 1986
                                         and then .011 thereafter. Real federal aid per resident is projected from the state's 1980 value using the actual rate of
                                         growth in federal aid to 1984, assumed to equal 0% thereafter.   Price levels grow at the actual national Inflation rate to
                                         1985, assumed to grow at .03 per annum thereafter.   Republican governorship are equal to actual governorships to the end
                                         of terms based upon the 1986 elections, thereafter, assumed to remain In Republican control until 2000. All other
                                         exogenous variables of the model are set to equal their 1980 state values for each year to 2000.

      2.    Baby Boom:                   The Census demographic trend in school—age Kids per family is replaced by a "baby-boom" growth in Kids per
                                                                                                                                                    family
                                         beginning in 1990. The "baby—boom" growth rate is the historical growth rate in school-age Kids per family from 1950 to
                                         1960.

      3.    6% Inflation:                Price level growth equals the historical rate to 1985 and            is   then increased to .03 in 1986.           .0145   in 1987, and set equal to
                                         .06 from 1988 to 2000.

      4.    Full Unionization:           The percent of teachers covered by collective bargaining is increased                for each state from the state's 1980 rate of
                                         coverage by a linear trend until 100% coverage is achieved by 1990.

      5. Increased       Aid:            Real Federal   id   is assumed     to grow at actual rates until     1986, at which time the high historical growth rate in aid from
                                         1970 to 1980 applies.


t"At—risk" states include Idaho, Maine, North Carolina, South Carolina. Virginia and West Virginia.  "Near—risk" states include Alabama, Colorado,
Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Massachusetts. New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, and Wyoming. All other states qualify
as "well-funded" plans.

case," Bureau of Census projections (1984) for future population growth are

used to define the growth in school age children per family (Kids per Family)

and the percent of the population over 65 (% > 65 years). The recent

historical record is the basis for projecting future incomes (Income), private

sector wages (Private Wage), interest rates (r       the Treasury Bill rate),

inflation rates    and the level of the state CPI), federal aid (Federal Aid),

and Republican control of governorships (REP); see Table 4 for details. All

other exogenous variables of the model are fixed at their 1980 values for the

duration of thesiu1ations We then examine the effects of four potentially

important deviations from the base case trends: a new baby boom, a high

inflation rate, a move to full coverage of all teachers under collective

bargaining agreements, and a return to the 1970's levels of federal aid for

state-local government. For each simulation we report the average 1980 level

of underfundings for our sample of the 148 mainland states (U(1980)), the

average level of underfundings in the year 2000 (U(2000)), and the annual rate

of growth in underfundings from 1980 to 2000 (c').    The simulation results are

also reported for three subsamples of states. The first group consists of all

states whose ratio of underfuriding to income in 1980 was .10 or less; this

group is called the "well—funded" subsample. The next subsample consists of

all states with 1980 underfunding to income ratios between .1 and .15; these

states are called the "near-risk" states. The final group, called the "at-

risk" group, is the small subset of poorly funded plans with 1980 underfunding

to income ratios greater than .15.19

     Perhaps the single most important conclusion from the results in Table 14

is the fact that teacher pension underfundings will not go away by

themselves. If the funding and benefit behavior exhibited during the 1970's

continues for the next twenty years, the average level of underfundings in our



16.11.3
sample states for the base case simulation will grow at a rate of' 1.53% per

year, from $249 per taxpayer to $337 per taxpayer. The upward trend is

observed for all three state subsamples as well. Simulations 2-5 in Table 4

show how sensitive the future path of underfundings is to four, possibly

damaging, structural changes. Neither a new baby boom in 1990 nor a moderate

increase in the rate of inflation is likely to affect the pattern of

underfundings very much. In fact, both tend to lower the growth rate slightly

from that seen in the base case. What does matter are structural changes that

drive up the overall wage bill for education. Increased unionization and

increased federal aid do Just that. By the year 2000, underfundings per

taxpayer have increased over their 1980 values by 1414% with full unionization

and by 59% with a return to the 1970's levels of federal-to-state aid.

     We conclude that a hands-off approach to the issue pension

underfundings--barring the saving grace of capitalization--may only lead to

larger problems in the future. The revealed inclinations of the present

benefit and funding process is to channel resources to current teachers and

taxpayers. Existing state government regulations for employer, employee, and

legislative contributions are, it seems, easily and willingly circumvented.

It is important therefore to consider the effectiveness of alternative,

central government regulations of these pension systems.


IV. Central Policies for Local Debt

     The central government can adopt one, or more, of' three policies towards

the control of local debt, each of which has a specific formulation for the

management of pension underfundings. The first strategy--control local

spending——appears here as a control of pension benefits. The second

strategy——require added local taxation-—becomes a central government

requirement for   increased pension funding.   The final strategy--the central


16. 11.3
                                     -25-



assumption of excessive local debt——can be specified as a central government

program to "bail-out" those pension plans on the verge of bankruptcy.


A. Central Policies for Underfundings2°

     1. Control of Pension Benefits: Available evidence suggests state and

local government employees receive significantly better pensions than their

colleagues in the private sector. Recent research by Quinn (1982) estimates

that a typical member of a state pension plan has a promised pension wealth

(even after adjustments for employee contributions) which is as much as 80%

larger than the wealth available to an identical worker in the private

sector. Members of local government plans have pensions which are on average

30% more valuable than those available to a comparable private worker. Given

these facts, it is useful to consider central government regulations which

reduce pension benefits paid to public workers. Two reforms are considered

here. The first policy reduces the promised rate of benefit accruals to new

employees by 50% from their current levels, the net effect of which is to

reduce the replacement rate for benefits paid upon retirement. Since this

benefit reduction policy will be limited to new employees only, for a time the

state will be required to administer two pension plans. We assume that

funding for the new pension plan will be under the funding rules now in force

for the original state plan. To the extent those rules are followed as before

(a favorable assumption), aggregate pension underfundings should decline. The

second policy to reduce pension benefits is to cut the COLA protection for all

employees through a reduction in the rate of inflation coverage, .   Eor these

simulations here, a 50% cut in rate of inflation protection is considered.

     2. Increased Contributions: The analysis above, and in Inman (1982,

1986b), show a strong bias in state and local funding practices towards pay-

as—you-go behavior. While state pension enabling legislations do contain


16.11.3
                                        -26—




minimal required rates of contributions by employees and taxpayers as well as

explicit provision for actuarial evaluations and subsequent full-funding, most

states have devised fiscal strategies to escape these regulations. In the

face of such behavior, the central government can adopt one or both of two

contribution regulations. First, the central government can simply require

more money be collected from employees and taxpayers, but leave to the state

all responsibility for allocating those dollars into pension funding. We

should expect——from eq. (14)-—that a fraction of the required increased

contributions will be "lost" before they become pension assets.

Alternatively, the central government could adopt national standards for

pension funding and then monitor state contributions to insure that these

required dollars are in fact allocated to pension assets. We shall simulate

the effects of both strategies. The first policy will simply require states

to increase contributions to a level which in theory would remove the existing

level of pension underfunding and any new accruing underfundings within forty

years. The second policy supplements these required contributions with a

central government enforcement effort to insure that all new contributions are

in fact allocated to pension savings.

     3. Debt Relief: Funding relief for obviously troubled pension plans is a

final policy alternative. Such a program would provide central government

assistance in the form of federal contributions to the troubled state plan,

contributions which could then be given immediately to retirees (if plan

assets are not sufficient to cover even current benefit obligations) or saved

to lower underfundings. Such a policy will require an explicit definition of

what constitutes a state plan "in trouble." Without such a standard, all

states would have strong incentives to simply let the central government fund

their pensions. For the debt relief simulations presented here, we define a



16.11.3
                                          —27—



state plan as "troubled"--and thus eligible for federal pension aid--if the

yearly level of steady-state contributions required to fully-fund the pension

plan over a forty-year horizon exceed 30% of the current year's wage bill for

plan employees. The choice of .30 as an upper limit to a state's full-funding

rate of' contribution--beyond which federal aid is possible—-is, of course, a

policy decision. A higher limit will mean that fewer states will qualify as

"troubled." Once a state plan qualifies, the central government is assumed to

cover all of the needed contributions above the .30 limit through federal

pension aid--that is, Pension Aid     C - .3w2., where C is the required full—

funding contribution and Aid      0. There will, of course, be a moral hazard

problem with such a policy; offering federal aid to pension plans in serious

trouble may only further discourage own contributions. To offset this

difficulty, the central government can offer bail—out aid which is directly

related to the state's own level of contributions. To illustrate the point,

we therefore consider a second pension aid program which not only covers the

gap of full-funding contributions above 30% of the wage bill but also matches

each state's own contributions dollar for dollar—-that is, Pension Aid

Match     C — .3wL +
                       'e"' + 5e + cg +          0.

     There is, unfortunately, no exogenous variable called federal pension aid

in our model of state funding behavior. To simulate the effects of pension

aid we therefore assume that federal pension aid influences pension funding

decisions like an extra dollar of pension fund investment income--that is,

like (rA_1) in Table 3 and equation (14).21 If that observed behavior is in

fact how federal pension aid performs, then only $.469 of each aid dollar will

actually be allocated to net asset creation; $.089 of each dollar goes

directly into assets (eq. (Li))   while   an additional $.380 of each dollar

arrives via legislatively set contributions (p). The remaining $.531 is



16.11.3
                                          -28-


allocated    to other state activities. To prevent such re-allocations, the

central government can attempt to regulate the allocation of pension aid

relief to insure that each dollar of pension aid is in fact saved. To

simulate the effects of such a pension aid plus enforcement policy, we

exogenously impose the constraint that all aid be saved. We report the

results as a pension aid with match plus enforcement policy.

           A "PERISA" Program: Reform to effectively control the funding status

of public employee pension plans has been a Congressional concern since

1976. Legislation entitled the Public Employee Retirement and Income Security

Act (PERISA) has since been introduced to insure a stronger funding basis for

state and local pension plans. While these bills have emphasized centrally

enforced reporting and monitoring of funding status (an obvious first step),

we could well imagine a more extensive PERISA policy. Following the lead of'

its private pension counterpart (ERISA), such a PERISA program might well

include benefit regulations, contribution regulations, and pension debt

relief. To test for the effects of such a PERISA program, we will simulate

the path of underfundings for two combined policy packages. Under PERISA-1 we

combine contribution regulations with the pension aid plus match program for

any states which fall within the previously-specified "troubled" category.

PERISA-2 adds a 50% reduction in the pension benefit replacement rate for new

employees only to the PERISA—1 package. For both the PERISA-1 and PERISA-2

reforms, we assume the federal government adopts the strong enforcement

structure needed to insure contributed dollars and pension aid are allocated

to pension savings.

Speeification of Reform Simulations:

1.    Benefit Reduction:   COLA reductions reduce the rate of COLA protection, p. by 50% for each year beginning in 198'. The simulation
                                                                                                                                           model
                           adjusts 1) in each year for the decline in p to .5p. piacement rate reforms involve a 50% reduction in 6 for new
                           employees. Beginning in 1981, new employu'e are assumed to replace exioting employees at the rate of 5% per year. By the
                           year 2001) all employees are covered by the new lower benefit plan. The simulation model adjusts ci in each year for the
                           decline in the system-wide, weighted average replacement rate .,croso the two piano.
2.    Full-Funding:        A  full-funding level of contributions was estimated for each state sufficient to amortize the existing pension debt
                           new debt over a forty year period.                                                                                   plus
                                                                It was assumed new debt would occur at the state's growth rate in U from the "base
                           case" sim'ilations. The eontrlbution—onlI simulation allocates the responsibility for the full—funding contributions as
                           one-quarter from employees (i.e., via an Increase    .s
                                                                                ), one quarter from employers (I.e., via an increase in c ) and one
                           half from state taxpayers (via an increase in p). he contribution plus enforcement simulations assume all      othe full—
                           funding contributions are allocated as state contributions p, which enters directly into pension savings (see
                           equation (Ii)).

3.    Debt   Relief:       Federal pension aid is calculated as the difference between the
                                                                                            full—funding level   of contributions (as estimated in
                           policy regime 2 above) and .30   (wQ.). where wt is the year's predicted wage bill,   before aid. Federal           aid plus
                           match calculates aid as the difference between full funding contributions and                              plon
                                                                                                          .30     (wt) plus an additional dollar of aid
                           for each dollar of contributions raised from employees (nwL +                         or state taxpayers (p). The pension
                                                                                            e'  employers (cg)
                           aid simulations allocate these aid dollars as an increase                             aid plus enforcement simulations, all
                                                                                      (rA1).   For the pension
                           federal pension aid Is allocated   as p which enters directly into pension savings (see equation (U)).

U.    PERISA:              The PERISA-l simulation combines the specifications for contributions plus enforcement (reform 2b) with the specification
                           for pension aid plus match plus enforcement (reform 3c).

                           The PERISA-2 simulation combines the specifications for the 50% cut in

underlying economic and political structure of the "base case" simulation

presented in Table 4, the results of which are repeated in Table 5. Table 5

also details exactly how each policy reform is implemented within the

structure of the simulation model. For each policy simulation, Table 5

reports the initial 1980 level of underfundings U(1980), the post-policy level

of underfundings by the year 2000 U(2000), and the annual rate of growth in U

from 1980 to 2000 (u). Results are for the full sample of mainland states and

for each of the three pension risk subsamples.

        The results in Table 5 are instructive. Central government policies

which regulate benefits or contributions or which offer pension aid to reduce

excessive underfundings do reduce the level of locally created pension debt.

In all cases considered here, the central government reform reduced

underfundings in the year 2000 below what they would have been in the base

case without reform. It is also important to note that among the three risk-

group subsainples of states, each reform has its strongest effect for those six

states whose 1980 levels of underfundings place the state pension most "at—

risk."

        Among the separate reform options, the most effective policy is

regulation of contributions (reforms 2a and 2b). The least effective policies

are cuts in the rate of COLA protection (reform la) (primarily because we

assume only modest levels of inflation in the future) and pension debt

relief. Pension aid with a matching provision to minimize moral hazard

(reform 3b) performs better than simple pension aid (reform 3a). Pension aid

with a match and with federal enforcement to insure aid dollars are actually

saved (reform 3c) is the most effective of the debt relief policies considered

here.

     Of the PERISA—type reforms, the PERISA—1 policy (reform lla)——fully

regulated contributions (reform 2b) combined with enforced pension aid plus

match (reform 3c)-—performs about as well as the fully regulated contribution

policy (reform 2b) alone. This is not surprising as contribution regulations

move most states below the underfunding cut-off needed for the receipt of

aid. Adding benefit regulations (reform ib) to the PERISA package to create

PERISA-2 (reform Lb), reduces underfundings still further. The two regulatory

policies-—reforms lb and 2b-—are roughly additive in their effects on the

levels of underfundings. Pension aid adds little to the effectiveness of

these reforms in reducing U, except in the few "at-risk" states. In the end,

PERISA-l and PERISA—2 make significant in—roads toward reducing the stock of

state-local government pension debt.

     Table 6 summarizes the incidence effects of the major, alternative reform

strategies. The impact of' benefit reductions (reform lb), contribution

regulations (reform 2a), pension debt relief (reform 3a), and a strong PERISA

policy (reform 14b) are reported for teachers and retirees, current and future

taxpayers, and public school-age children. The position of current teachers

is defined by teacher wages (in 1967 dollars) less supplemental contributions

to the pension plan                   and by their net pension wealth per

teacher (W      nw). The position of present retirees is defined by benefits

paid per retiree (B, in 1967 dollars). The position of current taxpayers is

specified by each taxpayer's after—tax income (y          Income — (1 -
                                                                          tf)   {all

base case and for each policy reform in Table 5; we compare the position of'

each group in 1980 before reform to their position in the year 2000 after

reform.

     Comparing the base case and reform outcomes reveals that the annual

income position of teachers is not much affected by reform. The only modest

change is the increase over the base case in teacher income in the year 2000

with full-funding contributions. This occurs because the spill-over of

pension funding into state school aid and finally into wages is larger than

the teachers' specified share of increased contributions. Ps expected,

teachers' pension wealth is most significantly affected in the year 2000 by

the 50% cut in the replacement rate (reforms lb and Lb), while an increase in

contributions or in pension aid leaves teachers' pension wealth largely

unchanged. Retirees lose most under the benefit reduction reform (reform ib)

and gain most under a full contribution reform (reform 2a), where some of'

those contributions spill—out into retiree benefits. On balance, and not

surprisingly, teachers and retirees benefit most with full contribution

reforms, are not much affected by pension aid bail-outs, and lose the most

with those reforms which lower pension benefits.

     Taxpayers looking ahead to the year 2000 see their current income

position virtually unaffected by pension reform. First, pension aid policies

are limited to a few crisis situations; thus federal taxes to run the aid

program are trivial. Second, benefit reductions cost taxpayers nothing

directly and have only a very small (in fact slightly negative) compensation

effect on wL through the variable 1; see the discussion of   in III.B above.

Third, contribution reforms will lower the average taxpayer's income as °g and

p are increased, but some of these monies are returned as state tax relief

(see III.B above); the net effect is a small reduction in y. Taxpayers today



16.11.3
                                     -32-



do benefit from reform, however, in that unfunded pension debt (U) is reduced

by the year 2000. As we saw from Table 5, regulated contributions (reform

2a), reduced benefits (reform lb), and the two reforms together (reform 14b)

have significant effects in reducing U.

     Finally, public school children are hurt by each reform strategy as the

student to teacher ratio rises over what it would have been (the base case)

without reform. The effect is most significant for the reform requiring full—

funding of existing pensions; here increased contributions make teachers more

expensive on the current accounts and thereby discourage the hiring of new

teachers. Note, however, that the continued demographic downturn in the

number of school-age children over the next twenty years more than offsets the

effects of any pension reform.

     Two primary conclusions emerge from these simulations of pension

reform. First, central government benefit regulations and regulations to

insure full-funding contributions can significantly reduce the stock of

outstanding state teacher pension debt. Pension "bail-out" aid relief can

slow the growth of debt but will not reduce the stock of existing

underfundings. Second, of all the reform strategies, a central government

policy to regulate contributions (reforms 2a and 2b) may be the most

acceptable to all parties involved. Current teachers and retirees are not

much harmed, in fact they are slightly better off under reform 2a. Current

taxpayers lose a small amount of real income but gain in that they avoid a

growing pension debt to be paid as future taxpayers. The only constituency

who loses are school..age children as fewer new teachers are hired under

reform. But the general decline in public enrollments for demographic reasons

softens this consequence.

     If this full-funding policy is so attractive, then, why hasn't it already

been adopted as a reform strategy for growing pension debt? To answer this

question is to return to our opening theme: The incentives in a decentralized

fiscal system are against it.   In an economy with less—than—fully informed yet

mobile taxpayers, the incentives at the state and local levels are to

underfund and run. Why pay for your current public employees' pensions when

you may have to pay again when you relocate in another state? While we may

all be better off with full—funding, the micro-motives in our decentralized

fiscal system are to underfund. Like any prisoner's dilemma situation, only

an imposed (i.e., regulated) strategy can insure a favored outcome. In this

case, the regulator is the central government, and the imposed strategy is

full-funding.


V. Summary and Conclusions

     Without proclaiming a state and local fiscal crisis, this paper has

sought to raise the issue of growing local government debt and to ask what a

central government might do, if anything, to check that growth. The analysis

has focused on one form of state and local debt: underfunded teacher

pensions. We have presented evidence that this form of debt is sizeable and

growing and have argued that such debt may have significant adverse

consequences for economic efficiency and equity. While the private market may

be able to neutralize the consequences of excessive borrowing through land

value capitalization, there is as yet no clear evidence for, or against, this

hypothesis. Nor is there any reason to believe the problem of growing state—

local debt will correct itself. As we have seen here, the motivations of the

major players in a decentralized political economy are to create not reduce

such debt. It seems prudent, therefore, to examine the possible effectiveness

of alternative central government reforms for the control of local debt

unmatched by assets. Of the three pension reform strategies considered

here--reduce spending through benefit reductions, increase revenues through

regulated contributions, or grant debt relief via pension aid--each can ease

the growth in pension debt and one approach-—regulating contributions--does so

with only modest burdens on employees and taxpayers. Of course, the fact that

our analysis was limited to only one form of local debt qualifies these

conclusions. Whether these results generalize to other forms of excessive

state-local borrowing and to the aggregate level of such debt remains to be

Pennsylvania. This research has been supported by grants from the National

Institute of Education (G-83-0033) and from the Fishxnan-Davidson Center for

the Study of the Service Economy. The authors made equal contributions to

this project and bear joint and full responsibility for the analysis and

conclusions presented here. The comments on an early draft by Mike Boskin,

Dutch Leonard, Wally Oates, and Torn Romer at an NEER Conference on State—Local

Finance were most helpful.

     1This specification of U is based upon the "plan continuation liability"

of the pension, under the assumption that the plan will be offered into the

foreseeable future. In contrast, the unfunded liability of a private pension

may more appropriately be measured by what is called the plan termination

liability, under the assumption that the firm has the right to pay off all

future pension obigations to existing employees at any time; see Bulow (1982).

     2The reason for this fiscal sleight-of-hand is that pension

administrators face de jure regulations for pension fundings which on the

surface, at least, must appear to be met. The plan's pension enabling act

often contains explicit contribution rules which require employees to

contribute 1e of their salaries and employers to contribute an additional

   of salary. Further, the enabling laws may also require a periodic

actuarial evaluation; if the required contributions above are not sufficient

to fully fund the pensions then supplemental contributions from employees,

employers, and state taxpayers will be required. Administrators can legally

meet these formal requirements by insuring that sufficient dollars are paid

into    the system. But there are no requirements that these dollars actually be

saved as net addition to assets. That is what we are testing here.

        3Legally, interest earnings may be allocated back into the pension system

as a contribution to net savings (n) or may be allocated to pay for current

benefits or be spent in the general state budget. See Mote, Harvard Law

Review (1977) and the recent Wall Street Journal article (October 22, 1985, p.

33)    entitled,   "Movel California Pension Plan Provides an Inflation Antidote."

        The analysis developed here is presented in more detail in Inrnan

(1986b). This model stands as the reduced-form equivalent of Inman's

structural model.

        5See Mote, Harvard Law Review (1977).

        6The three institutional settings function sequentially. Generally, the

pension board will reach its decisions on employee (Se) and employer (cg)

contributions, on benefits (b), and on portfolio investments Cr) near the end

of the calendar year as part of administrative decisions—making. Given

cg b, and r, the state legislature meets in January to March to decide p.
Then in May and June, before the start of the new fiscal year, local school

districts decide w, Q. The structural model in Inman (1986b) makes use of the

sequential nature of this budgeting process.

        7Excluded from this sample of pension plans are the plans in Hawaii and

Alaska whose unique fiscal institutions do not allow an easy comparison to the

L8 mainland states. Also excluded are the few large city teacher pension

plans. The analysis covers 95% of all teachers in pension plans in 1980.

        8See, for example, Taylor (1986, p. 71) who quotes from an interview with

a Democratic state legislator on pension contributions and benefits:       "there

are Just a few who care about (pension costs) and they are mostly Republicans

who look for ways to cut costs."

         9The market rate of returns is unique to each state and is defined by the

state-specific weighted average of' national returns of those investments which

are legally available to the state pension board for investment.

         10An F—test for the equality of the state B coefficients could not reject

the null hypothesis of equal coefficients. It should be noted that this

common B coefficient is likely to be biased towards zero because of

measurement error in the specification of r. The rate of return for state

portfolios is calculated from reported plan asset values which include an

(unknown) fraction of assets valued at book, not market, value. The

measurement errors in r will likely be correlated with the independent

variable (rm -     r).   Despite this bias, there are good political reasons to

believe our result that B is near zero and that states adopt conservative

investment strategies for pension assets. Risky investments offer little gain

to current teachers and taxpayers if they pay-off, yet expose the pension

board to public embarrassment if they fail. For additional evidence on the

conservative bias in pension investment, see Kotlikoff and Smith (1983, p.

143L).


         11Forrnally, the nominal wage and pension contribution equations are
specified as:

                  (w•CPI) or (p.CPI) c + BCPI          SX i-   ( . CPI)

and estimated as:


                         w or p   (a/CPI) +   B +   S(X/CPI) +


where        are state—specific constant terms, X is the vector of all exogenous

variables (with fiscal variables measured in nominal terms), and c is the

equation's normally distributed error term. The teacher equation is specified




16. 11.3
                                                -38-



to include CPI directly in the equation with all other exogenous variables

again deflated by the CPI:


                            z           + CPI    + o(X/CPI) +


     12pl    exogenous variables have been deflated by the state's cost-of—

living price level, the mean value of which is $1.89 over the sample period.

Thus the marginal effect of a .03 increase in the "% Who Stay" on funding (p)

will equal, on average, dp         203.16 x (.03/1.89) z $3.22.             similar

calculation applies for the marginal effect of changes in AFSCME membership:

dp   11.79     (.10/1.89)       $.62.

     13Again, adjusted for the level of the state's cost—of-living ($1.89 at

the mean), the marginal effect on p of a 10% decline in school age kids per

family will equal, on average, dp           —22.174      (1.13     -.10)11.89     $1.33,

where 1.13 is the mean number of school—age kids per family. The marginal

effect on p of a 10% decline in the percent of kids enrolled public schools

will equal, on average, dp         -15.570 x (-.10/1.89)          $.83.

     The effect on real wages of a $9 (one standard deviation) increase in

real DUES from its mean value of $17/teacher is dw                11.86 x $9     $105. The

effect on real wages of introducing an NEA liaison will be dw                   157.08

(1/1.89)     $83, adjusted for price deflation. The joint effect of these two

changes will be to increase real wages by $188 per teacher, or by 3.1% from

the mean real wage of $6020/teacher over the 1971-1980 period. Employment

also rises, but marginally, for a $9 increase in DUES; employment increases by

1% ( d/9.      (.009   $9) teachers/11.81 teachers). With the introduction of a

legislative liaison, employment rises by 1.L% (dQ./z               .167 teachers/11.81

teachers). The joint effect of all these changes is to increase the real

teacher wage bill by a bit more than 5% (:3.1% +            1%   + 1.4%).

      15The average value of      for our sample is .17. Thus, the fully—funded

level of pension contributions for a teacher with an average wage of $6020 is

$1023. A 10% increase in        implies a $102.3 increase in fully-funded

contributions. A 10% increase in           decreases teacher wages by

-$31.13 (: (.10 x .17)(-1831)). Thus a $102.3 increase in the present value

of pension benefits only reduces wages by $31.13, or about $.30 on the dollar.

     Further, as $102.30 increase in benefits is only offset by $31.13 decline

in wages, the full cost per teacher rises by $71.17 for each 10% increase in

.   This    increase in full labor costs reduces employment by 7/10's of 1% or

-.083 teachers/1000 taxpayers (:(.10 x .17)(—LL905)). The small effect on Z

is likely due to the fact that current taxpayers do not anticipate paying the

full increase in labor costs due to the increase in pension benefits.

     Overall, the present value of total compensation to be paid to teachers

by taxpayers (: (1 +   A)wt)   rises from $83.18/taxpayer

C: (1 +    .17)(6020)(11.81/1000))   to $83.51/taxpayer

 : (1+.187)(6020—31)(11.83—.083)/1000} for a 10% increase in            from its mean

value of .17.

      16A $.33 increase in 5e increases the mean w9. by $.20 [: .33        x


(dw/ds)L+.33(dZ/ds)w:.33x32.51x(11.81/1000)+.33x( .036)x(6020)}; a $.33

increase in Cg increases the mean w by $.O1 (calculated as above using

dW/dCg and dQ./dcg); and a $.33 increase in rA_1 decreases the mean w2, by $.11

(calculated as above using dw/drA          and d/dr1). The combined effect is a
                                       1


$.1O increase in the mean teacher wage bill per taxpayer.

      '7The net savings equation (ii) has been estimated by three-staged least

squares as part of the full fiscal system involving equations (4)-(11);

see above. The reported         is from the first-stage estimate of the net

savings equation. Standard errors of coefficient estimates are within



16. 11.3
parentheses; an *   indicates   the coefficient estimate exceeds the standard

error by at least 1.65.

     l8Estimation was by ordinary least squares. Standard errors of

coefficient estimates are within parentheses; an *     indicates   the coefficient

estimate exceeds the standard error by at least 1.65. Data for c2      are   from

Inman (1986a).

     9The choice of .15 as the "critical" pension debt/income ratio to

indicate "at-risk" states follows the convention in the bond industry to "red—

flag" governments whose ratio of all debt to market value approaches 10

percent. Since market value is usually 2.0 times income, the implied critical

or "red-flag" ratio of total debt to income would be around .20. Since non-

pension debt will usually be .05 to .10 of income, a pension debt to income

ratio     .15 will be "critical" and a ratio 2 .10 will be "worrisome." See

Lamb and Rappaport (1980), pp. 112-115.

    20A policy which we could not examine in this model--but which should be

seriously considered in any reform debate-—is to move all teacher pensions

from their current status as defined benefit plans to a new status as defined

contribution plans. In defined benefit plans annuities are based upon

worker's pre—retiremerit salary. In a defined contribution plan annuities are

based upon workers' and employers' contributions only. By definition, defined

contribution plans cannot be underfunded, and thus we avoid all of the

allocative and equity disadvantages of'    underfunded pensions. We do so at a
cost, however. Defined contribution plans do not offer the worker a stable

retirement income relative to his or her pre—retirement salary; workers are

exposed to the risk of a sharp fall in their real living standard at

retirement if inadequate contributions had been made or if returns on the

invested portfolio have not kept pace with income growth; both are possible

problems in inflationary economies. Indexed bonds, if they are available,
could solve the problem, however. For general discussion of the relative

advantages and disadvantages of defined benefit and defined contribution

pension plans, see Bodie, Marcus, and Merton (1985).

     2Since there is no currently existing Federal—to—state pension aid

program, we must assign one of the model's available independent variables to

stand as a "proxy" measure for the effects of this program. Four variables

are possible candidates: Federal Aid, 5e' cg or (rA_1). The variable (rA_1)

seems to us to be the preferred choice. The variables s and Cg which measure

teacher contributions and local taxpayer contributions compound the effect of

new pension dollars and the taxation of teachers and taxpayers. Both 5e and

Cg involve "compensation effects" at the state and local level which may not

be observed with pension aid. The Federal Aid variable is the sum of all

lump-sum grants to the state. These are not pension dollars and thus Federal

Aid will not capture any pension specific effect of such aid. On the other

hand, investment earnings (rA.1) are pension fund dollars and do not involve

any present period taxation. Thus r(A1) seems the best variable to proxy for

the effects of true federal-to-state pension aid.

    For comparison purposes, simulations based upon an increase in Federal

Aid are given in Table !.   As we see there, an increase in suchassistance

will clearly do little to ease the pension debt problem.
