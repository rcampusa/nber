Abstract
Traditional cross-sectional estimates of hedonic price functions can recover marginal willingness
to pay for characteristics, but face endogeneity problems for estimating non-marginal welfare
measures. I show that when panel data on household demands are available, one can construct a
second-order approximation to non-marginal welfare measures using only the first-stage marginal
prices. With repeated cross sections of product prices, the measure can be set identified or, under
a single-crossing restriction, point identified. Bounds also can be constructed when there are mo-
bility costs. Finally, a variant remains valid when individual preferences shift over time.


1. Introduction

For decades, the hedonic model has been the starting point for understanding people's values for
differentiated products (see Palmquist 2005 for a review). Its applications include willingness to
pay (WTP) in higher housing prices for local public goods and spatial amenities, compensating
wage differentials for attributes such as job safety, pricing of quality-differentiated consumer prod-
ucts such as computers and cars, and quality-adjustments in national accounting.

       Part of the hedonic model's appeal has always been the simple relationship between he-
donic prices and consumer demand: the derivative of a hedonic price function with respect to a
characteristic is equal to a household's marginal WTP for the characteristic. This aspect of the
model is highly appealing because price functions can feasibly be estimated with simple, transpar-
ent research designs, yet they also have a clear welfare interpretation. However, the marginal WTP
potentially observed from only the hedonic price gradient is generally viewed as inadequate infor-
mation for welfare evaluations of large policy shocks. Accordingly, since Rosen (1974), econo-
mists have sought to identify households' willingness-to-pay functions for amenities in a second
stage. But recovering these willingness-to-pay functions from a single cross section has proved to
be a challenge. Because only one point on each individual's demand function is observed (where
marginal WTP is equal to the derivative of the hedonic price function), the only variation in the
data comes from the way different households sort across choice alternatives in equilibrium. The
standard solution is to model heterogeneity in individual demands. Unfortunately, the unobserved
components in demand (e.g. tastes) systematically vary both with levels of amenities and their
marginal prices. This correlation gives rise to a well-known endogeneity problem (Bartik 1987,

                                                                                                    1
Epple 1987, Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim 2010a, Bishop and Timmins 2019).

       Proposed solutions to this problem combine, in one way or another, the economic logic of
sorting along with some structure imposed on heterogeneity in tastes. In the hedonic model,
Ekeland, Heckman, and Nesheim (2004) note that nonlinearities in the equilibrium price function
justify using nonlinear functions of observed demand shifters as instruments for the observed quan-
tities demanded. Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim (2005, 2010a) and Bishop and Timmins (2019)
discuss strategies for imposing functional form restrictions that allow one to map quantities of
characteristics into demands. Departing somewhat from the continuous world of the hedonic
model, structural models of discrete choices follow a similar basic strategy (see Kuminoff, Smith,
and Timmins 2013 for a review). In general, because the economics of the models imply a partic-
ular mapping from households' preferences to the way they sort in equilibrium, the logic can be
inverted to recover preferences from observed sorting, conditional on the assumed structure. Typ-
ically, this involves imposing distributional assumptions about unobserved tastes. For example,
they may be assumed to have an extreme value distribution (e.g. Bayer, Ferreira, and McMillan
2007) or a log-normal distribution (e.g. Sieg et al. 2004); similarly, WTP functions may be as-
sumed to have errors following some known distribution (e.g. normal in Bishop and Timmins
2019). Alternatively, one can relax these distributional assumptions but forego point identification
of the underlying parameters (Kuminoff 2012). This literature has provided a tremendous advance
on our ability to model general equilibrium counterfactuals as well as non-marginal welfare ef-
fects. However, these advantages come at the price of imposing additional structure and compli-
cation—thus losing some of the simple reduced-form appeal of the hedonic model.

       As Bajari and Benkard (2005), Kuminoff and Pope (2012), and Bishop and Timmins
(2018) have pointed out, the problem becomes considerably easier when individuals are observed
in multiple settings, as then individuals' willingness-to-pay functions can be fitted to two or more
points. To my knowledge, however, the literature has not noticed that when households are ob-
served two or more times, their observed choices, together with knowledge of the first stage he-
donic price functions, are sufficient to estimate welfare measures that are proportional to second-
order approximations to a change in utility for any constant utility function—without explicitly
modeling heterogeneity at all and without imposing any distributional assumptions on unobserved




                                                                                                  2
demand parameters. 1 With the advent of "big data," such panels are becoming increasingly avail-
able, even in the context of housing markets. For example, in the United States, researchers have
made use of data available under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) to match house-
holds to the houses they live in over time (e.g. Palmquist 1984 and, more recently, Bayer et al.
2012, and Bishop and Timmins 2018). In principle, such data may be even easier to come by in
other contexts, such as automobile or computer purchases.

        In this paper, I show how such data provide an opportunity to reinterpret the hedonic model
in the spirit of calls from Chetty (2009) and Heckman (2010) to seek compromises that combine
the clarity of reduced form econometric models with the ability of structural models to speak to
welfare effects. With multiple time periods, it is possible to combine the logic of the hedonic
model with estimation of only the first stage hedonic price function to identify non-marginal wel-
fare effects under minimal assumptions about demand functions. This is in contrast to the standard
view that knowledge of the hedonic price function alone is insufficient to analyze welfare effects
of large policy shocks with general equilibrium effects. The logic parallels Harberger's (1971)
argument for thinking of consumer surplus in terms of an index number, averaging ex ante and ex
post marginal values. Information from only the first stage can produce a "sufficient statistic" for
welfare measurement.

        In particular, I consider monetary measures, constructed from the first-stage hedonic
model, of the change in welfare associated with a change from one hedonic equilibrium to another,
where exogenous amenities, price functions, and even incomes potentially differ. This change is
of interest in at least two contexts. First, we may be interested in comparisons of welfare between
two scenarios, as in cost-of-living indices or comparisons of real income. Banzhaf (2005), Tim-
mins (2006), and Quintero, Epple, and Sieg (2019), among others, consider hedonic approaches to
such questions. 2 Second, we may be interested in the general equilibrium effect of specific policy

1
 Kuminoff and Pope (2012) suggest using exogenous shifts in the supply of amenities to derive within-
market instruments for Rosen's "second stage." Although their suggestion is based on the same basic insight
of this paper (that exogenous supply shocks can trace out a demand curve), in contrast I am suggesting that
a similar procedure replace the second stage entirely, to identify a sufficient statistic for welfare measure-
ment without estimating the deep structural parameters.
2
  This application is different from the goal of identifying partial equilibrium welfare measures of (poten-
tially) out-of-sample policies. In this sense, this paper follows somewhat in the tradition of the capitaliza-
tion literature (Lind 1973, Starrett 1981, Kuminoff and Pope 2014, Banzhaf 2018), in which one looks to
changes in the hedonic equilibrium to evaluate in-sample shocks.
                                                                                                            3
or information shocks that represent a sudden change in conditions, such as discovery of a cancer
cluster (Davis 2004) or the release of school report cards (Figlio and Lucas 2004). If these involve
exogenous shocks to g or income, we can find the welfare effect of the shocks, even when there
are endogenous changes to hedonic prices and other amenities. This second context is a special
case of the first: if there is one exogenous shock, then the change in conditions can be attributed
to it.

         I first show that when one can track households over time, one can construct a second-
order approximation to a Hicksian welfare measure by taking the change in the amenities experi-
enced by the household multiplied by an average of the derivatives of the hedonic price function
over time. The basic model assumes no transactions costs and constant demand functionals (of
hedonic price functions) over time.

         I next show that even if one cannot track households over time, one can bound the approx-
imation by "searching" over all possible ways that households sort, using a simple linear program
that respectively minimizes or maximizes the welfare measure. Alternatively, one can impose
additional structure (in particular, a single crossing property) to impute how households sort. As
I discuss in the paper, even if this property is not taken as literally true, as long as sorting patterns
are correlated over time, errors from the assumption largely cancel out, so it makes for a reasonable
approximation.

         Finally, I relax the assumptions of no transactions costs and constant demands. In the case
of no transactions costs, I again derive bounds on the welfare measure of interest in the case where
households are myopic. If they are forward-looking, the recent results of Bishop and Murphy
(2019) apply. In the case of constant demands, I show how the approach of the paper can be re-
interpreted as evaluating welfare from a single time period's perspective, a paradigm suggested by
Fisher and Shell (1972) and Pollak (1989).

         Additionally, I demonstrate these results using both simulations of hedonic equilibria and
an empirical application. The results of the simulations are consistent with the predicted relation-
ships to true values. The sufficient statistic approach is a compromise between two Hicksian wel-
fare measures, compensating variation (CV) and equivalent variation (EV). I also find that, when
we relax some of the required assumptions, the bounds on welfare hold. The empirical application
illustrates how hedonic data, such as those in a recent application to reductions in violent crime

                                                                                                       4
(Bishop and Timmins 2019), can easily be used to compute welfare estimates. The results are
similar to estimates from the more structural model of Rosen (1974).

          To fix ideas, I specifically discuss the example of housing markets with spatially varying
amenities and I primarily discuss connections to that literature. However, the implications of this
paper are not limited to that setting and apply equally to labor markets or to other contexts with
differentiated commodities.

2.    Model Basics

Consider a closed city (or region) with a constant set of households. 3 Let ℋ denote the set of
houses with typical element h and let ℐ denote the set of households with typical element i. Equi-
librium at each point in time consists of a bijective mapping of households to houses (all house-
holds occupy a house and all houses are occupied by a household). For expositional purposes,
residents and landlords can be thought of as two separate groups, but there is nothing requiring
this assumption.

          Houses are differentiated by price p, an exogenous amenity g, and a vector of continuous
housing characteristics x with characteristics indexed by r={1,…,R} (lot size, dwelling size, and
so forth). (The variable g may be thought of as an index of public goods, or alternatively other
public goods of secondary interest may be thought to be embedded in x.) Notationally, it will
sometimes be more convenient to work with a more parsimonious notation with the vector z' = [g,
x'] and with the elements of z indexed by j.

          At any point in time t, households differ by their income y and by their current-period
preferences, which can be represented by a twice differentiable quasi-concave conditional indirect
utility function 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 -ph, gh, xh), with 𝜕𝜕𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 /𝜕𝜕𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 > 0 and 𝜕𝜕𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 /𝜕𝜕g ≠ 0 everywhere ∀ i. Note that
−𝜕𝜕𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 /𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕 = 𝜕𝜕𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 /𝜕𝜕𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 ≡ 𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖 , the marginal utility of money.

          On the supply side of the market, the profit function for house h is πh = ph - ch(xh), where
the cost function ch( ) is twice differentiable. For convenience, ch( ) is constant over time, although
this assumption could be relaxed.

  The area modeled does not literally need to be one city (or housing market). Nor need it coincide with
the area affected by the policy of interest. However, as always, economists modeling demand must make
judgments about the set of relevant substitutes.

                                                                                                                       5
          Consider two moments in time, with t=0 in the initial situation and t=1 in a later situation.
Let Ft( ) be the distribution function of g at time t. Prices of houses are determined by the amenities
and the equilibrium price function: 𝑝𝑝ℎ𝑡𝑡 =𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 (g 𝑡𝑡ℎ , 𝐱𝐱 ℎ𝑡𝑡 ). The time superscript on the hedonic price
function indicates that equilibrium hedonic prices may shift over time, because of changes in g, in
income, or other aspects of the economic environment. In the initial situation, the household max-
imizes utility over a continuous choice set defined by the continuously differentiable hedonic func-
tion p0=p0(g0, x0). There is then an exogenous shock to the distribution of g available in the city,
and/or to incomes. Consequently, the equilibrium price function adjusts to p1=p1(g1, x1), with the
set of other available characteristics x possibly changing endogenously. It is this change in the
hedonic environment that will be evaluated.

          Initially, I make the standard hedonic assumption that households are in a static equilibrium
at both points in time, either because they choose a new product regularly (as would be fitting for
applications to consumer products) or because they can costlessly re-optimize. 4 Maximizing util-
ity at time t, the household satisfies the first-order condition:

                                    𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡    𝜕𝜕𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 �𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗   𝜕𝜕𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 �𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗
    (1)                                    = − 𝑡𝑡              =                  .
                                    𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗    𝜕𝜕𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 ⁄𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕              𝜆𝜆𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖

Equation (1) represents the standard tangency condition, in which the derivative of the hedonic
function with respect to an amenity is equal to marginal WTP for the amenity at the optimal point.

          Similarly, the landlord's first-order condition for profit maximization is

                                                  𝜕𝜕𝑐𝑐ℎ    𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡
    (2)                                                  =        .
                                                  𝜕𝜕𝑥𝑥𝑟𝑟   𝜕𝜕𝑥𝑥𝑟𝑟

That is, the endogenous amenities x are supplied according to similar tangency condition, with
marginal cost of supply equal to the marginal revenue.


4
  This assumption continues to underlie the vast majority of work on hedonic markets (e.g. Ekeland, Heck-
man, and Nesheim 2004, Bajari and Benkard 2005, Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim 2010, Bishop and
Timmins 2018) as well as structural sorting models of locational choice (e.g. Sieg et al. 2004 Bayer, Fer-
reira, and McMillan 2007, Kuminoff 2012). However, recent work is beginning to consider dynamic opti-
mization in the context of transaction costs, which may be substantial in applications to housing (Kennan
and Walker 2011, Bishop 2012, Bayer et al. 2016, Bishop and Murphy 2019). The labor literature has a
longer tradition of considering such dynamic optimization (e.g. Keane and Wolpin 1997).
                                                                                                          6
         The basic problem is to make inferences about non-marginal welfare effects from these
primitive conditions.

3. Non-Marginal Values when Demands are Constant and a Panel of Households Is Availa-
   ble: The Hedonic Harberger Triangle

As a starting point, consider the arguably restrictive case covered by the following three assump-
tions.

ASSUMPTION A1 (Panel of Households). Panel data on household choices are available, so that p
     and 𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡 �𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗 can be evaluated for each household at each point in time at their choice of z.

ASSUMPTION A2 (No transactions Costs). There are no transactions costs, so the household always
     satisfies the first-order condition given by Equation (1).

ASSUMPTION A3 (Constant Preferences). Households' preferences are constant over the time pe-
         riod considered: 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 -ph, gh, xh) = 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 (𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 -ph, gh, xh) ∀ t, so that the optimal vector x and g
         are unchanging functionals of income and the hedonic price function.

         In this subsection, I show that, under Assumptions A1-A3, a second-order approximation
of the general equilibrium welfare effects of a change in conditions can be constructed using only
estimated marginal prices from the first stage hedonic price regression and aggregate changes in
income. The assumptions essentially guarantee that observed shifts in the hedonic price function
trace out the marginal value function (A2 and A3), and that points on the function are observed
(A1). In subsequent sections, Assumptions A1-A3 will be relaxed in turn.

         Following Harberger (1971), consider a second order approximation to a change in utility
for an individual in the hedonic model given Assumption A2:

                       𝜕𝜕𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖                       𝜕𝜕𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖            1 𝜕𝜕 2 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖
               ∆𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖 ≈        (∆𝑦𝑦          )
                                  𝑖𝑖 − ∆𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 + �           ∆𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 +         2
                                                                                  (∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − ∆𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 )2
                        𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕                     𝑗𝑗 𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗            2 𝜕𝜕𝑦𝑦

                                         𝜕𝜕 2 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖                           1          𝜕𝜕 2 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖
                                  +�               (∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 − ∆𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 )∆𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 + � �                     ∆𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 ∆𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗′ ,𝑖𝑖 ,
                                     𝑗𝑗 𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗                           2 𝑗𝑗′ 𝑗𝑗 𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗 𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗 ′


where ∆𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖 = 𝑝𝑝1 (g1𝑖𝑖 , 𝐱𝐱1𝑖𝑖 ) − 𝑝𝑝0 (g 0𝑖𝑖 , 𝐱𝐱 𝑖𝑖0 ) is the household's change in expenditure and ∆𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 is the
change in amenity j experienced by household i after all adjustments. These changes stem from a
number of sources. At the household's initial optimal location, g may change exogenously (e.g.
from a policy shock) and the price of the home may capitalize this change. Incomes also may


                                                                                                                              7
change, exogenously or indirectly in equilibrium. Additionally, p changes as the hedonic function
shifts. Finally, p, g, and x may all change from any readjustments by the household as it re-opti-
mizes, and x also may change from any supply-side investments as landlords re-optimize. What-
ever the source of the changes, the welfare effects are evaluated taking all of them into account.

           Harberger's strategy reduces the problem of measuring non-marginal willingness to pay
to an index number, that is, to an average of marginal Marshallian WTP along the path between
[p0, g0, x0, y0] and [p1, g1, x1, y1]. Although it is based on a Marshallian construct, he showed that
it also could be interpreted as a valid approximation to an exact welfare measure. 5 More recently,
Chetty (2009) has suggested that Harberger's approach can be thought of as setting a paradigm for
sufficient-statistic welfare measurement.

          Equation (3) leads to the following lemma.

LEMMA 1. Given Assumptions A1-A3, a second order approximation to the change in welfare for
each consumer, ∆wi, from an exogenous change in the distribution of g, can be constructed from
observed prices and estimated marginal prices as follows:

Proof: See the appendix.

          This expression is proportional to the utility change ∆v, which is converted to the measur-
ing rod of money using the average marginal utility of income, averaged between the starting point
and ending point. Lemma 1 states that this monetary value of the change in welfare for a consumer
is given by the change in income, the change in rents ∆p, plus the change in housing attributes and
public goods experienced by the household after all adjustments, multiplied by the average mar-
ginal WTP, again averaged between the starting point and ending point. The expression might be
thought of as a "hedonic Harberger triangle" (or trapezoid). It is a compromise between two Hick-
sian measures, CV and EV.

          On the supply side of the market, landlords are directly better off by the change in rents
∆p. This change in rents stems from shifts in the price function and from exogenous changes in g,

    See Banzhaf (2010) for a discussion of this approach to welfare measurement in a historical context.

                                                                                                                8
but also potentially from adjustments to x that are costly to supply. Consequently, the cost of
producing the change in x must be netted out of the change in profits. The change in profits from
any change in g, the price function p( ), or endogenous adjustments to x is ∆π = ∆p - ∆c. We can
in turn take a second-order approximation to ∆c as follows.

This fact along with the first-order conditions leads to the following lemma.

Proof: See the appendix.

        LEMMA 2 says that the change in profits is just the change in price, net of an adjustment
accounting for changes in costs due to endogenous changes in x, which can be approximated from
marginal prices.

        Let the change in aggregate welfare W be given by aggregating over the changes in con-
sumer surplus and profits:

By lemmas 1 and 2, we can integrate over Expressions (4) and (6) and substitute them into the
respective terms in Equation (7). Additionally, we can combine these into one integral, but doing
so requires some additional notation, because Expression (4) is evaluated at the choices made by
a single household i (regardless of location), whereas Expression (6) is evaluated at a particular
house h (regardless of who lives there). Let 𝒛𝒛𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖(𝜏𝜏) represent the characteristics, in time t, of a house
                                                                   𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝𝑡𝑡

it is not currently living there.

           Equation (7) together with this notation lead to the following proposition.

Proof: The proposition follows from Lemmas 1 and 2, simply integrating (4) over ℐ and (6) over
ℋ, adding the two together, fixing our indices so h = i(0) (which we can do given the bijective
mapping between them), and re-arranging terms. 6

           Expression (8) consists of four terms. The first is the change in income. The second is the
change in g experienced by a household (across houses if it moves) evaluated at the average of the
partial derivatives of the hedonic price function at those two points. This term accounts for
changes in exogenous amenities, which don't involve decisions by suppliers. The third and fourth
terms together account for the effect of endogenous housing characteristics on both the demand
and supply side. The third term is the change in x experienced by the household, accounting for
the fact that it may change houses, but holding x fixed at any given house (i.e. netting out any
supply adjustments), but with these changes again evaluated by the respective average partial de-
rivatives experienced by the household (across houses). The fourth term is the supply response at
the household's initial house, multiplied by the difference in the ex post partial derivatives between
the final location and the initial location. The changes in prices ∆p which appear in Expressions (4)

                                                                                                                                          10
and (6) cancel out as transfers between households and landlords.

        Proposition 1 is the key result of this section. It says that, under our assumption that we
observe a panel of housing attributes and our initial assumption that we can track households across
locations, a second-order approximation to welfare can be estimated with only the derivatives of
the first-stage hedonic price function at the two points in time, plus aggregate changes in income.
The approach essentially relies on the fact that the policy shock induces a new equilibrium, which
allows demands to be approximated by tracing out the optimized points.

        Even if the city is not closed, Proposition 1 would apply to the sub-set of households we
can track over time, as well as for the landlords in the area being tracked.

        Expression (8) can be simplified if we are willing to assume that the supply side of the
market is highly competitive and that profits (and rents to fixed factors) from adjustments to x are
approximately zero. Denote this as Assumption A4:

ASSUMPTION A4 (No change in profits). The change in profits due to adjustments in x are approx-
        imately zero: ∫ℎ �𝑝𝑝1 �g1ℎ , 𝐱𝐱1ℎ � − 𝑝𝑝1 �g1ℎ , 𝐱𝐱0ℎ ��𝑑𝑑ℎ ≈ ∫ℎ �𝑐𝑐�g1ℎ , 𝐱𝐱1ℎ � − 𝑐𝑐�g1ℎ , 𝐱𝐱0ℎ ��𝑑𝑑ℎ.

Thus, the change in profits consists only of the change in rents to land and to the inherited capital:
                                   0
∫ℎ 𝑑𝑑π𝑑𝑑ℎ ≈ ∫ℎ �𝑝𝑝1 �g1 , 𝐱𝐱 � − 𝑝𝑝0 � 𝑔𝑔𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑ℎ = ∫ℎ �∆𝑝𝑝 − �𝑝𝑝1 − 𝑝𝑝1 (g1 , 𝐱𝐱0 )��𝑑𝑑ℎ. That is, the land-

lord may receive higher (or lower rents) from the exogenous change in amenities, but the equilib-
rium adjustment to the endogenous characteristics x do not add to profits.

        For simplicity, I will use Assumption A4 for the remainder of this paper. I will also assume

that there are no aggregate changes of incomes: ∫ℐ ∆𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 = 0. However, except for Section 4.2,
these choices plays no substantive part of the results later derived, and parallels could be derived
based on the more general results as well. In this case, we would have the following variant of
Proposition 1:

PROPOSITION 2. Given Assumptions A1-A4, and assuming no changes in aggregate income, a
second-order approximation to the change in hedonic conditions, when prices, households, and
landlords adjust to the change endogenously, is:

real costs of adjustments in x.

Expression (10) is just the individual household measure from Expression (4) summed over house-
holds, but with the ∆p terms cancelling as transfers between residents and landlords. It is similar
to the partial equilibrium measure recently suggested by Bishop and Timmins (2018).

           Figure 1 illustrates this measure, or equivalently this portion of the Expressions (8) and (9).
The figure shows the derivatives with respect to g of both the t=0 and t=1 hedonic functions; these
derivatives are positive and continuous but unrestricted as to slope or curvature. The line bid(g)
represents the linearized approximation to the Marshallian marginal WTP function. 7 The points
g0 and g1 represent the levels of the public good selected by the consumer in each scenario. Alt-
hough it is a Marshallian measure, the area under the linearized marginal WTP function represents
a second-order approximation to the welfare change associated with the change in equilibria. The
figure illustrates this measure only in the dimension of g, but note Expressions (8) to (10) require
summing over all attributes j. Even if there are no adjustments to x in the housing stock as a result


7
  The interpretation of the Marshallian bid functions requires some nuance. As noted above, the marginal
values for g are along a path where non-linear prices and, potentially, incomes are changing. Thus, it is not
like a Marshallian demand curve at constant income. Even if incomes are constant, in the hedonic context,
as other non-linear pricing contexts (e.g. Wilson 1993), the Marshallian quantity demanded of a character-
istic depends on the entire price function, not just the marginal price at the quantity demanded. Consider a
consumer at some optimal point in characteristic space. If there is now a shift in the infra-marginal portions
of the hedonic price function, in a way that leaves the marginal prices unchanged, the consumer may still
re-optimize because of the income effect associated with the infra-marginal expenditure. These and any
other income effects are incorporated into the welfare measure derived in this paper.
                                                                                                           12
of the policy, the welfare measure for this change in g still requires taking these terms into account,
weighted by the average marginal WTP of the household. The measures are no different if people
are owner-occupiers. In that case, the wealth effects still cancel and the dz terms incorporate the
wealth effects on demand for attributes, as would be appropriate. Regardless, a valid welfare
measure can be obtained simply by adding up experienced changes in characteristics, weighted by
the average marginal values.

4. When Households Panels are not Available

The previous subsection involves Assumption A1, that panel data on households' choices are avail-
able. Though increasingly available, they are not always. This subsection considers what we can
learn if we relax this assumption.

        First, to see the role of Assumption A1, note that Propositions 1 and 2 introduce expres-
                     1 𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝0         𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝1
sions involving ∑𝑗𝑗 2 � 𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧 |𝐳𝐳0 + 𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧 |𝐳𝐳𝑖𝑖1 � ∆𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 for each household i. This expression involves ob-
                           𝑗𝑗   𝑖𝑖      𝑗𝑗

serving (i) in which house each household lives at both points in time; (ii) a panel of house attrib-
utes (g, x) or, if we are willing to assume ∆x=0, a panel of g together with data on x at one time
period; and (iii) either a panel of house prices (as in a repeat sales model) or repeated cross sections
of housing prices sufficient for predicting ph at each location. Of these, the first is the most difficult
to observe: in many cases analysts may observe housing characteristics and a sample of prices,
but have no information whatsoever on who is occupying those houses. Unfortunately, in general
such data are not sufficient to use the strategy outlined in the previous sub-section. Expression (9)
requires information on the household's change in amenities, ∆zi. In general, information on the
change in amenities at a fixed house h, ∆zh, is not sufficient. The problem is depicted in Figure 2.
The figure shows two points respectively chosen by two households at the first point in time and
two at the second. However, which household sorts into which house is unobserved. Conse-
quently, the two households' demand curves may be the two solid lines or alternatively the two
dashed lines. But the sums of the areas under those respective pairs of demand curves are not the
same, differing by area (B-A) depicted in the figure.

        Without the information on households' micro choices required for the results in Section 3,
we can pursue two alternative strategies. The first is to acknowledge we can no longer point-
identify the second-order approximation, and to instead identify bounds on welfare. The second


                                                                                                          13
is to impose more structure. The following two sub-sections consider each strategy in turn.

4.1. Non-parametric bounds on welfare

As depicted in Figure 2, the fundamental problem when we do not observe a panel of households'
choices is that we do not know how to connect the points across equilibria. Choice patterns could
follow the dashed lines or the solid lines in the figure. However, a basic market clearing condition
is that they must connect in some way: all households are in a house in each period, and all houses
are occupied.

             This basic insight suggests a way to bound welfare: simply search across all possible ways
to "connect the dots" and find those that yield the lowest welfare estimate and the highest welfare
estimate respectively.               In particular, let ℋ and ℐ now be finite countable sets indexed by
h={1,…,H} and i={1,…,I} with H=I. In Figure 2, H=2, and there are two possibilities, the dashed
lines or the solid lines. In general, there are H! ways to connect the dots between H houses. How-
ever, this "search" can be solved with a simple linear program. Let 𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ be an indicator variable
for whether some household (hypothetically) lived in house h at t=0 and in house h' at t=1. We
then have the following proposition.

PROPOSITION 3. Under Assumptions A2-A4, a lower bound on aggregate welfare for a change in
conditions, when prices, households, and landlords adjust to the change endogenously, can be
found by solving the linear program:

An upper bound can be found by instead maximizing the objective.
Proof: see the appendix.

             Note the objective being minimized (or maximized) is the welfare approximation defined
by Expression (9), simply changing the points of evaluation to an arbitrary pair h,h', multiplying
by the indicator, and summing over both indices h and h'. The constraints represent the fact that
each house is only chosen once at each point in time.

                                                                                                                   14
4.2. Identification using single-crossing

        An alternative to the bounds is to impose additional structure on the problem, namely a
"single-crossing" restriction on any two households' indifference curves. If we additionally as-
sume incomes are constant over time, then single crossing amounts to a restriction on preferences
such that households' Marshallian marginal WTP functions for some observed amenity do not
cross. That is, households can be ordered by their marginal WTP for the amenity, and the ordering
will be the same evaluated at any level of the amenity and under any equilibrium price function.
Because households always sort in the same order, if we have single crossing on g then in Figure 2
we can infer that the sorting is that of the dashed lines, ruling out the solid lines. Essentially, the
logic of single crossing provides a way to impute households' pattern of sorting, even when their
actual locations are not observed. This property is formalized in Assumption A5:

ASSUMPTION A5 (Single Crossing). Let Vji(yi, p( ), zj) be the indirect function conditional on one
     attribute zj given the price function p(), with the other attributes optimally chosen subject to
     zj, y, and p() to determine the utility level. Let ℐ be a simply ordered set and let the distri-
                                                                                           𝜕𝜕𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ,𝑝𝑝( ),𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗 ��𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗
       bution of demands be such that, for some amenity zj, 𝑣𝑣𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡 /𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗 ≠ 0 ∀ i and
                                                                                            𝜕𝜕𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ,𝑝𝑝( ),𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗 �⁄𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
       is everywhere non-decreasing in i. Furthermore, either 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 is constant over time, or utility is
       quasi-linear in y.

        Assumption A5 requires single crossing in only one dimension of the characteristic space,
zj. 8 A public good of particular interest like g may be a natural choice for that attribute, but that
choice is not necessary. It could be any characteristic or any scalar-valued index of characteristics.
Even though we are modeling multidimensional characteristics, induced assortative matching
along any one dimension is enough to impute households' choices. The single-crossing assump-
tion, sometimes called the Spence-Mirrlees condition when written this way, guarantees that the
level of zj chosen by households is always increasing in i. See, e.g., Milgrom and Shannon (1994)
and Athey, Milgrom, and Roberts (1998 Ch. 3) for proofs. To see this intuitively, note that we
                                                                                     𝜕𝜕𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ,𝑝𝑝�( ),𝑧𝑧̂ 𝑗𝑗 ��𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧̂ 𝑗𝑗
could write A5 alternatively as follows. For any two households i, i' if                                                         ≥
                                                                                      𝜕𝜕𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ,𝑝𝑝�( ),𝑧𝑧̂ 𝑗𝑗 �⁄𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕

 As Chiappori, McCann, and Nesheim (2010) discuss, extensions of the single-crossing property to the
multi-attribute case lose the interpretation of inducing assortative matching. Although we are working with
a multi-attribute model, Assumption 5 involves single-crossing of the WTP functions in the dimension of
only one attribute, not multiple attributes.

                                                                                                                                 15

Thus, if a household selects more zj than another household in the baseline scenario, it will do so
in the ex post scenario as well. 9 However, this requires ruling out income effects.

                  All this suggests a simple approach for identifying Expression (9) without panel data on
households. Let 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡 ( ) be the distribution function of some continuously distributed amenity zj at
time t. Given that zj is continuously distributed, for each observed percentile θ ∈ {1/H, 2/H, …,
1} of the distribution of zj, there will be a unique vector zt(θ) at t. Let 𝑧𝑧𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡 (θ) be the value of the kth
attribute of this vector. Note that for k=j, 𝑧𝑧𝑘𝑘𝑡𝑡 (θ)=(𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗𝑡𝑡 )-1(θ). Then we can now state the following
proposition.

PROPOSITION 4. Under Assumptions A2-A5, aggregate welfare for a change in conditions, when
prices, households, and landlords adjust to the change endogenously, can be computed from ob-
served prices and estimated derivatives as follows:

                                                                           ℎ


Proof: Consider the initial equilibrium described by the hedonic price function p0(g, x). For any
θ ∈ [1/H, 2/H,…,1], consider a household which chooses zj in the initial equilibrium such that
𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗0 (zj)=θ. By Assumption A5 (single crossing), when facing the new equilibrium price function
p1(g, x), the household would choose zj such that 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗1 (zj)=θ. The remainder follows by Proposi-
tion 2, simply evaluating each household at the z corresponding to a constant percentile of the
distributions of zj.

                  Proposition 4 states that one can rank the houses by one amenity zj in each scenario, find
the change in all attributes at a constant percentile of the zj distribution, and evaluate the derivatives
of the hedonic price function at the z falling at this percentile of the zj distribution. The final term
is the same price adjustments as in Expression (9). In practice, note that as long as one knows the

9
  Intuitively, given that the Marshallian demand functions do not cross, this obviously must be so if the
implicit price of zj is increasing in zj (i.e. if the hedonic price function is convex in zj). However, even if
the implicit price is decreasing in zj over portions of the range, the second-order condition for utility maxi-
mization requires that it cut the demand curves from below. In other words, the economics of the model
require that the slope of the price function be greater than the slope of the demand curve in the neighborhood
of the optimal choice. Thus, households will always "sort" across zj in the same order, even if they are
changing consumption of other attributes or the numeraire.

be predicted for each house from the hedonic pricing model.

        This single-crossing condition is routinely imposed in the literature on non-linear pricing
(e.g. Athey, Milgrom, and Roberts 1998, Wilson 1993), including models of monopoly screening
as well as locational sorting. Although imposing this property is undoubtedly a restriction relative
to the more general treatment up to this point, it is actually less restrictive in this respect than many
structural models, which employ the same single crossing property plus additional functional form
restrictions or parametric restrictions on the distribution of unobservable demand shifters. For
example, consider the common class of models which allow households i to differ in two dimen-
sions, income y and a parameter α reflecting tastes for g. Many hedonic and sorting applications,
including Bajari and Benkard (2005), Heckman, Matzkin, and Nesheim (2010b), and Bishop and
Timmins (2019) impose the additional restriction that WTP is strictly increasing in α and that
preferences are quasi-linear. These models implicitly impose Assumption A5: households are
totally ordered by α, with increasing α implying increasing g.

        This is not to say that all papers impose these conditions. Other models impose only a
partial ordering on i rather than a total ordering. For example, Sieg et al. (2004), Epple, Peress,
and Sieg (2010), and Kuminoff (2012) order households by α conditional on y, and vice versa.
However, pairs of households where one has higher α and the other higher y need not be ordered:
one household may choose higher g than the other household in one equilibrium but not necessarily
in another equilibrium. In this sense, Assumption A5 is stronger than the related single crossing
assumptions imposed in those papers. However, in other respects the approach of this section still
imposes weaker assumptions about heterogeneity. Sieg et al. (2004), Epple, Peress, and Sieg
(2010), and Kuminoff (2012) compensate for their weaker single crossing assumptions by impos-
ing additional functional form restrictions on v() and/or parametric assumptions on the joint distri-
bution of (α, y).

        Of course, single crossing is only a modeling assumption. In practice, Expression (11) may
be a reasonable approximation to Expression (9) even when households are not truly totally or-
dered, in violation of Assumption A5. In the simulations reported in Section 7, the matching-by-
percentiles approach of Expression (11) gives results quite close to the matching-by-households

                                                                                                            17
approach of Expression (9), even when households are not totally ordered. To see why, note that
if the hedonic price functions were linear, so that marginal prices were constant, then any matches
would give the same aggregate welfare measures, namely the average of the two marginal values
times the sum of changes in the attributes. So, when single crossing does not hold, even if house-
holds do not sort in exactly the same order in different scenarios, their rank orderings are still
correlated. Consequently, violations of Assumption A5 create errors in the imputation of z that
are only local. If the hedonic price functions is approximately linear over the range of the errors,
then the errors offset (with area A approximately equal to area B in Figure 2). In this sense, esti-
mates based on Expression (11) can be thought of as approximations to Expression (9).

4.3 Matching by group

       Whereas Section 3 assumed complete knowledge about where individual households sort
over time in the product space, this section so far has assumed no knowledge about that whatso-
ever. In between these two cases are a variety of intermediate ones where partial information is
available on the households locating at a house. Such partial information would allow us to either
further restrict the bounds of Section 4.1 by ruling out some possible matches, or alternatively to
partially relax the single-crossing assumption of Section 4.2.

       For example, suppose we can track where types of households live but not the individual
household. Perhaps we can observe the race of a household occupying a given house, or its in-
come, or some other characteristic or combination of characteristics. Then the bounds of Sec-
tion 4.1 can be tightened by imposing the additional restriction that 𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ = 0 whenever the observed
characteristics of households at h in t=0 and h' in t=1 do not correspond.

       Alternatively, the structure imposed in Section 4.2 can be relaxed, as we would now only
require that the single crossing property hold within observable type. In particular, the required
single-crossing condition may be modified as follows.

ASSUMPTION A5' (Single crossing within type). Let 𝒯𝒯 be a set of observable types which partitions
     the set of households H. Let τ ⊂ 𝒯𝒯 be the set of households of a specific type with measure
     µτ, ∑τµτ=1, and let each τ be a simply ordered subset of the partially ordered set ℐ. For
     each τ, let the distribution of demands be such that, for some amenity zj, at fixed 𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ,
       𝜕𝜕𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ,𝑝𝑝( ),𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗 ��𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗
                                              is everywhere nondecreasing in i ∈ 𝜏𝜏.
        𝜕𝜕𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 �𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 ,𝑝𝑝( ),𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗 �⁄𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕


This property guarantees that, after conditioning on the observed type, households sort along zj in

                                                                                                   18
the same order. Thus, if a household selects more zj than another household of the same type in
the baseline scenario, it will do so in the ex post scenario as well. This approach allows households
to be partially ordered overall but totally ordered within type, as in the Epple-Sieg approach, where
households are totally ordered after conditioning on income.

        In this case, Expression (11) can be modified as follows. Let Iτ be the number of observed
households of type τ and let θτ={1/Iτ, 2/Iτ,…,1} be the observed percentiles of the distribution of
zj among type τ. Then by the same argument as given in Proposition 4, aggregate welfare is

                                𝐻𝐻


That is, for each type, one can take the set of houses occupied by that type and rank them by zj in
both scenarios, find the change in zk at a constant percentile of the distribution, and evaluate the
derivatives of the hedonic price function at the same percentile of the distribution. Then, one can
take the weighted sum over types. Moreover, if the type is observed income, then we no longer
need to rule out income effects, as we can condition on them.

5. Transactions Costs

So far, we have assumed that there are no transactions costs from re-optimizing (Assumption A2).
This assumption may be most fitting for consumer goods such as computers (Bajari and Benkard
2005) or groceries (Griffith and Nesheim 2013), which are purchased regularly. For applications
to housing or to labor markets, the transaction costs of moving homes or changing jobs may be
much higher.

        With transactions costs, Propositions 1 and 2 are no longer valid, because the first-order
condition of utility maximization represented by Equation (1) no longer need hold in both periods
(see Bishop and Murphy 2019 for discussion). Instead, the transactions costs create a wedge,
turning the equalities of Equation (1) into inequality constraints.

        However, we can still bound the results. First, return to the case where Assumption A1
holds, so we observe whether households move or not. In addition, suppose that households my-


                                                                                                                     19
opically optimized in the baseline period (without anticipating changes). Finally, suppose the an-
alyst has an estimate of the average moving cost among those who actually move, MC. (Alterna-
tively, we can always make what-if statements along the lines of: "if average moving costs are MC,
then the bounds would be such-and-such.")

         For movers, we then can still use Propositions 1 or 2 to form point estimates of their wel-
fare, subtracting out aggregate moving costs, which is MC times the number of movers. For non-
movers, when conditions improve, we can create an upper bound on compensating variation by
assuming constant marginal WTP from the baseline condition. Essentially, this uses a rectangle
instead of the trapezoid. By the same token, for non-movers we can create a lower bound of zero.
When conditions worsen instead of improve, the rectangle at baseline marginal WTP is now a
lower bound on damages. Adding up the welfare for the movers and non-movers creates a bound
for the whole group. The bound involves a mix of first-order approximations and second-order
approximations suited to the situations observed.

         If, instead of being myopic, households are forward-looking, then the recent results of
Bishop and Murphy (2019) apply. They develop a model in which households make a single
choice of a house to which they're committed. Households maximize expected utility at the house,
given the current price functions and expectations about future amenities. To see the connection
between the Harberger approximation and their results, suppose, momentarily, that households are
not only forward-looking but perfectly prescient about the future and, furthermore, that WTP func-
tions for amenities are linear. Then, in the model of Bishop and Murphy, households would set an
average of (discounted) marginal WTP over time equal to the marginal hedonic price at the time
of purchase, and Lemma 1 above would hold exactly if we applied a discount rate to the second
period terms. Essentially, the conditions holding across two time periods with no transactions cost
are the same as the conditions that hold at a single point in time when there are transactions costs.
As Bishop and Murphy show, when households are not perfectly prescient but still right "on aver-
age," the hedonic estimate would still be unbiased when amenities are increasing or decreasing.
They further show that when WTP functions are non-linear, there is a bias from a static hedonic
model. The results of this paper can be applied to their bias term to suggest that the bias is third-
order.

         Next, relax Assumptions A1 and A2, so that there are moving costs and we do not observe


                                                                                                  20
household movements. Unfortunately, the lower bound from the linear program of Proposition 3
is no longer valid, because with moving costs we can no longer assume that the quantities de-
manded even trace out a demand curve at all, even the demand curves implied by the lower-bound
algorithm.

        However, the upper bound from Proposition 3 does remain valid. The intuition here is
simple: By Proposition 3, the expression is an upper bound on welfare when there are no moving
costs. Because moving costs can only reduce the true welfare of a change in the economic envi-
ronment, the expression remains an upper bound. This result is quite general.

        Moreover, it may be possible to find tighter bounds. In particular if a household is assumed
to move from h to h', it must be that they are willing to pay the transactions cost to move to h'
rather than stay in h under the new conditions, given the preferences implied by the move from h
to h'. Accordingly, if we know individual MC (or assume homogeneous moving costs), we can
impose the additional restriction in the linear problem associated with Proposition 3:

6. When Preferences Shift

In all the models to this point, we have relied on Assumption A3, that households' preferences are
constant over the time period considered, so that a household's optimal choice of the vector z is an
unchanging functional of the hedonic price function and income. As with Assumption A2 (moving
costs), Assumption A3 may be most fitting for hedonic applications to consumer goods such as
computers or groceries. It may be less fitting for applications to housing if taste changes are im-
portant in that context or, to put it differently, when there are important changes in parameters
affecting current-period utility, such as family status. In such cases, even when we observe points
for two equilibria for a single household (Section 3), they may be on two different utility functions.
Likewise, even if household preferences exhibit the single crossing property (Section 4), if prefer-
ences are shifting then there is no reason to believe households are still sorting in the same order.

       In this section, I consider relaxing Assumption A3 as well as Assumption A1. That is, we
do not observe a panel of households and, moreover, an individual's household's WTP for attributes
may be changing anyway. Such changes in demands of course will have implications for equilib-
rium hedonic prices. But more importantly, they raise fundamental questions about what perspec-
tive to take when evaluating changes in conditions (Stapleford 2009). I take the approach of Fisher
and Shell (1972) and Pollak (1989), who suggest that welfare comparisons can be made in such
situations from the perspective of one or the other of the two preference relationships. This basic
approach also is implicit in simulation exercises such as those in Sieg et al. (2004), Bayer et al.
(2011), or elsewhere, where general equilibrium welfare effects are estimated for policy shocks
under an assumption of constant preferences, even though preferences may well change over the
time periods envisioned. Essentially, these simulations evaluate the policy shocks from the per-
spective of ex ante preferences.

       From this perspective, we can again use the single crossing property along with a weaker
version of Assumption A3:

ASSUMPTION A3'. The distribution of pairs (vt(), yt) is the same as it would have been if v() were
     constant. Consequently, the distribution of demand functionals z(pt( )) is the same.

Assumption A3' is implied by A3 but not the reverse. It says that although individual households'
demand functions may change over time, the distribution of demand types remains constant. This
assumption is probably most valid for short time windows, such as those considered by Figlio

                                                                                                   22
(2004), Lucas (2004), or the 1999-2000 change in crime recently considered by Bishop and Tim-
mins (2019).

        With this weaker assumption, all the results of Section 4 flow through, but now interpreting
the result as the welfare measure from the perspective of a single time period. For example, when
single crossing holds, we can now state Proposition 5.

PROPOSITION 5 Under Assumptions A2, A3' and A4-A5, aggregate welfare for a change in he-
donic conditions, evaluated from the perspective of constant preferences for each household, can
be computed from observed prices and estimated derivatives as given by Equation (11). Moreover,
the aggregate evaluation is the same whether using ex ante or ex post preferences (though the
distributional effects may be different).

Proof: See the appendix.

        Proposition 5 says that we can still use the same measure for aggregate welfare as given in
Proposition 4 under a weaker version of Assumption A3, in which individual household demands
may shift due to changes in preferences or incomes, as long as the distribution of demands does
not change. However, the welfare estimates are now from a single period perspective, or alterna-
tively are counterfactual estimates "as if" preferences had remained constant.

        The intuition of Proposition 5 is fairly straightforward. We wish to estimate welfare "as
if" preferences had not changed between periods. However, if the joint distribution of preferences
and incomes are the same as if preferences hadn't changed, the observed equilibria are the same as
they would have been under the missing hypothetical. Therefore, any welfare measures we con-
struct from the observed equilibria are consistent with what we'd want under the missing hypo-
thetical.

        Moreover, if single crossing is considered too strong an assumption, we can still construct
the bounds of Section 4 by the same argument.

7. Illustrative Simulations

In this section I illustrate the results from the previous two sections using simulated data, which
allows us to compare the constructs to "true" welfare values. In particular, I simulate 100 hedonic
housing equilibria, each with 1000 households and 1000 houses. Households sort over two varia-
bles, a lot of fixed size with an exogenously supplied amenity g, which is shocked between two
time periods, and housing capital x, which is sold endogenously by suppliers. Households update

                                                                                                 23
their purchase of x between scenarios.

        The public good g is uniformly distributed on (1, 3) in the baseline scenario. In the ex post
scenario, one-third of the houses are treated by a policy. If a house is treated, its level of g improves
such that g1 = g0 + (3-g0)/3 + 1. Panel A of Figure 3 illustrates the levels of g in one representative
simulation. It shows the cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of g in each scenario, indicating
that the ex ante scenario is uniformly distributed, while the ex post scenario, which 1st-order sto-
chastically dominates it, is not.

        I use two functional forms for utility. First, I use a functional form introduced by Epple
and Sieg (1999), variants of which have been used by Sieg et al. (2004), Epple, Peres, and Sieg
(2010), Kuminoff (2012), and others. In particular, indirect utility is given by:

                                                                                         1
                                                                          𝜂𝜂+1        𝜌𝜌 𝜌𝜌
                                                (𝑦𝑦−𝑝𝑝(g))1−𝜈𝜈 −1      𝛽𝛽𝛽𝛽    −1
 (13)                                                                 − 𝑥𝑥
                            𝑉𝑉 = �𝛼𝛼g 𝜌𝜌 + �e         1−𝜈𝜈          e      𝜂𝜂+1   �    �


where y is income, p(g) is the hedonic price of a lot with public good g, 𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥 is the supply-price of
x, 𝛼𝛼 is an individual-specific taste parameter for g, and 𝛽𝛽, 𝜂𝜂, 𝜈𝜈, and 𝜌𝜌 are additional parameters.
This indirect utility function has no closed form for utility, but one can interpret it as involving a
constant-elasticity of substitution between private and public goods, and a constant income and
price elasticity of demand for x. With this model, demand for x is independent of g, except through
the effect of g on prices. I set 𝛽𝛽 = 3, 𝜂𝜂 = -0.963, 𝜈𝜈 = 0.75, and 𝜌𝜌 = -0.02. I let income be distributed
log-normal with μy = 11.1 and σy = 0.4 (and truncated at $25,000 and $200,000). Finally, I let 𝛼𝛼
be log-normal with μα = -0.25 and σα = 0.97. Single crossing does not strictly hold in this model,
though it holds in 𝛼𝛼 conditional on y and vice versa.

        Second, I use the cross-packaging model, discussed and analysed by von Haefen (2007).
In particular, I assume indirect utility is given by:

                                             𝑦𝑦 − 𝑝𝑝(g) + 𝜃𝜃 ln(g)
                                    𝑉𝑉 =                               1+𝛽𝛽
                                                                                  .
 (14)                                            exp(𝛼𝛼 + 𝛿𝛿g)𝑝𝑝𝑥𝑥
                                           exp �                              �
                                                       1 + 𝛽𝛽




                                                                                                         24
In this model, g enters utility in two places. It enters as an additively separable term in the numer-
ator. It also enters in the denominator, in a term that shifts the demand for x. In particular, the
demand for x is given by:

 (15)                            𝑥𝑥 ∗ = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽ln(𝑝𝑝) + ln(𝑦𝑦) + 𝛿𝛿𝛿𝛿.

Thus, g is valued directly as well as indirectly through increasing the consumer surplus for x. I let
𝛼𝛼 ~u(-2.2, -1.8), 𝛽𝛽 = -1.1, 𝜃𝜃 ~u(750, 1050), and 𝛿𝛿 distributed triangular with points (0.004, 0.006,
0.012). Income is distributed as before. These parameters are calibrated so that the median mar-
ginal willingness to pay for g is approximately equal to that from the first model.

        Given the distribution of g and of household characteristics, market-clearing prices were
solved for, along with equilibrium levels of the endogenous characteristic x, for each of the 100
simulations and for each utility function. Panel B of Figure 3 shows land prices, after netting out
the value of capital x, for one representative scenario using the Epple-Sieg utility function. It
shows that price levels increased in the ex post scenario. However, as scene in Panel C, marginal
prices (or marginal WTP) for g fell in the ex post scenario, largely because of the increased supply
of g. The marginal price function is quite convex, with an extremely sharp up-turn in the right-
hand tail.

        Equilibrium prices in each scenario were then perturbed by an error term, normally and
independently distributed and calibrated such that the standard deviation of the error was equal to
1% of the mean price. This error term can be interpreted as either measurement error in price (the
dependent variable) or as an unobserved characteristic of the home that enters preferences as a
perfect substitute for the numeraire good.

        Hedonic price functions were fitted to this noisy data using three methods. The first uses
semi-parametric methods, partially out x using linear regression and estimating the residual price
as a function of g using quadratic local regressions. The second uses a fifth-ordered polynomial
function. The third uses a translog function, regressing logged prices on logs of g and x, their
squares, and an interaction. Figure 4 shows the estimated partial derivatives with respect to g,
plotted against the true marginal WTP, for one representative simulation, for both the ex ante and
ex post scenarios, for the Epple-Sieg utility function. The local regression and the polynomial are
able to fit the data over most of the support, but badly under-predict in the right-hand tail, as they

                                                                                                     25
cannot fit the sharp turn seen in Figure 3C. Nevertheless, those mistakes are over a range of the
data with little density, so the functions capture mean marginal values well. The translog function
does a much poorer fit overall, finding some negative values at low levels of g. It also does a poor
job of adjusting for changes in x. The equilibrium value of capital is separable in this model, but
the log transformation forces interactions in the value of g and x.

       Finally, from these price functions and their derivatives, true welfare measures and the
empirical approximations were computed. Table 1 reports the results for baseline models, with no
transactions costs. The table shows mean values across the 100 simulations, as well as the 5th and
95th percentiles across simulations. The first two rows show the Hicksian CV and EV for the
improvement to g. EV is lower than CV in these scenarios because of the increase in prices, which
actually puts households on lower indifference curves. (However, net welfare still increases be-
cause these price increases are income to landlords.) The difference between EV and CV is greater
for the Epple-Sieg model at these parameter values.

       In the third row, the table shows the value of Equation (9), when households can be tracked
over time. The first column computes the expression using the true marginal values from the utility
function. It shows that the second-order approximation falls between EV and CV, as expected.
The next columns compute the expression using the derivatives from the three respective estimated
price functions. With both utility functions, the semi-parametric and polynomial gradients do quite
well, giving values close to those using the true marginal values and close to the range of EV and
CV. The translog function badly overstates the values.

       The remaining rows show the results from Section 4, which is applicable when households
cannot be tracked over time. The first two rows give the lower and upper bound respectively,
using a linear program to find the allocations over time that respectively minimize and maximize
total welfare. By construction, the values bracket those using Equation (9). They also bracket the
true EV and CV, with a reasonable range, again except for the translog function. The final row
shows the results when consumption patterns over time are imputed using the single crossing prop-
erty. Although the Epple-Sieg utility function does not impose single-crossing globally, house-
holds tend to sort in similar patterns over time. As a consequence, the errors from imposing single
crossing tend to be small and to cancel out. The welfare estimates using this imputation are almost
exactly the same as those constructed under the assumption that we can actually track households


                                                                                                 26
over time.

       To explore the reasons for this result, Figure 5 illustrates the sorting patterns observed in
one illustrative simulation. The first panel shows the level of g households choose in the ex post
scenario, against the marginal WTP for g of each household evaluated at the "average house."
That is, it shows the household's optimal g as a function of an index of its demand-type for g. If
bid functions never crossed, this figure would show an increasing function. While it is not strictly
increasing, it is nearly so, indicating the any crossings in the bid functions are only very local. The
second panel shows the households' level of g in the ex post scenario versus the ex ante scenario.
It illustrates that households sort approximately in the same order, though not exactly. Finally, the
third panel shows the level of g imputed for a household in the ex post scenario using single-
crossing, against its actual level of g in the scenario. It shows that the errors from imposing the
single-crossing assumption are fairly small. Consequently, the hedonic price function is approxi-
mately linear over the range of these errors, and the overall bias is minimal. Thus, even when
household sorting is not observed, and even when the single crossing property does not truly hold,
models based on this property potentially can still be quite useful.

       Tables 2A and 2B report the results from imposing transactions costs in the equilibrium.
In particular, from an initial optimal point, households adjust to the shock in g subject to a moving
cost annualized to be $200 and $400 respectively in the two tables, which, at a 5% discount rate,
equate to one-time costs of $4,000 and $8,000. The true EV and CV are lower in these scenarios,
as households can no longer take advantage of the shock by re-optimizing as easily, and as real
resources are used up on transactions. Moreover, Equation (9) is no longer valid, as there is now
a wedge between the hedonic gradient and marginal values. As shown in the tables, the expression
gives values that now fall outside the range of EV and CV.

       However, as discussed in Section 5, when we can track households, we can bound the true
values using a mix of first-order approximations for non-movers and Equation (9) for movers (net
of transactions costs). The fourth and fifth rows of the table show these results. Finally, when
households are not observed over time, we can still use the upper bound from Section 4, and even
tighten it somewhat by requiring the gain from any move to exceed transactions costs. The final
two rows in the table illustrate these bounds. The bounds are fairly tight in the simulations using
the Epple Sieg utility function, but are somewhat higher using the repackaging model.


                                                                                                    27
8.     Empirical Application and Comparison

To illustrate how the methods introduced in this paper can be used on real-world data, and to
compare the results to estimates from other structural models, I apply the methods to data previ-
ously studied by Bishop and Timmins (2019). They consider the value of reductions in violent
crime in the San Francisco area between 1999 and 2000. Over that period, average violent crime
rates fell by about 1.7%, though they increased at about one-third of housing locations.

           Using housing data from 1994-2000, Bishop and Timmins estimate hedonic gradients for
crime, first partialling out the effects of structural characteristics, then estimating the gradient for
crime using local polynomial regression. They then estimate demand curves using Rosen's (1974)
two-step method, regressing marginal values from the first-stage price function on the level of
crime plus household level variables, including income and race, and year dummies (interpreted
as annual demand shifters). They also introduce a new maximum likelihood method in the spirit
of Heckman et al. (2005). This approach involves parameterizing utility, including unobserved
heterogeneity, and re-writing the problem to isolate the unobserved heterogeneity as a function of
marginal prices, crime and other observables, and the parameters. Values of the parameters that
maximize the likelihood can then be computed. See Bishop and Timmins (2019) for details.

           Households are not tracked over time in these data. However, using the hedonic gradients
and crime levels, one easily can compute the values of Equation (11), using the single crossing
assumption. One need only sort the data by the 1999 crime level (or other attribute), then by the
2000 crime level, and merge the data back together. Averaging the 1999 and 2000 gradients and
multiplying by the change in crime gives the value of Equation (11). 10 Table 3 gives the results.
The average value for the shift from the 1999 equilibrium to the 2000 equilibrium, including both
the change in crime and the shift in the hedonic price function, is $236. As discussed in Section 4,
instead of imposing single crossing, one can solve the linear program to bound the possible values.
The bounds using this approach are $235 to $568. Interestingly, in this application the single-
crossing approach identifies a point quite near the lower bound, unlike with the above simulations.
In general, where the single crossing estimate fits within the bounds will depend on the correlations
between changes in marginal prices and changes in amenities in the data.



10
     Because the price effect of x is assumed to be linear, the terms involving it in Expression (11) cancel.
                                                                                                            28
        These results can be adjusted to make them more comparable to the results of Bishop and
Timmins (2019). In particular, Bishop and Timmins estimate a shift in demand for amenities
between 2019 and 2000 and then net out that shift in their welfare estimates (evaluating changes
from the 2019 perspective, not unlike the proposal in Section 6 above). They also cut off changes
in crime at a point where their estimated marginal willingness to pay falls to zero. For comparison
purposes, I adjust the 2000 marginal values downward by their estimated 2019-20 difference in
marginal values and use the same change in crime as they use after censoring. These adjusted
values are shown in the next three rows of the table. The average values fall by about $50.

        Interestingly, these adjusted values are quit close to those using the more structural ap-
proach of Rosen (1974), as reported by Bishop and Timmins (2019). This suggests it may be
possible to approximate the results from more structural approaches using much simpler, reduced
form methods. Whereas the approach based on Equation (11) matches marginal values over time
based on a single crossing assumption, Rosen's approach essentially matches them over time by
matching on observed demographics. In this case, the results are quite similar. On the other hand,
at an average value of -$156, the new approach of Bishop and Timmins gives a very different
value. They find very negative values for the one-third of households who experience an increase
in violent crime, which more than offset the gains to other households. This difference is most
likely because the two approaches answer different questions. Whereas the approach suggested in
this paper values a change between general equilibria, including price changes, their approach
isolates the partial equilibrium value of a change in crime, netting out price effects. 11

9.   Conclusions

For decades, economists have used the hedonic model to estimate demands for the implicit char-
acteristics of differentiated commodities, including the demands for otherwise unpriced local pub-
lic goods and amenities. The traditional cross-sectional approach to hedonic estimation has recov-
ered marginal WTP for amenities when unobservables are conditionally independent of the amen-
ities, but has faltered over a difficult endogeneity problem when attempting non-marginal welfare
measures. In this paper, I show that when marginal prices can be reliably estimated, and when
panel data on household sorting is available, one can construct an approximation—using only the
first-stage marginal prices—which is a "sufficient statistic" for non-marginal welfare measures.

  An additional difference is that I use only 1999-2000 data, whereas they use the full 1994-2000 data set.
                                                                                                        29
With this approximation, Rosen's second-stage estimation can be replaced with a simple average
of first-stage parameters.

       Moreover, even when panel data on household sorting are unavailable, the sufficient sta-
tistic approach can be used to create bounds on the welfare measures using only repeated cross
sections of housing data. Alternatively, point identification can be established using a single cross-
ing restriction. In practice, this approximation appears to perform well in these simulations even
when this restriction does not strictly hold.

       Future work might consider hybrids between the approach taken here and other work. Per-
haps the approach introduced here could be used to model baseline heterogeneity, while more
structural approaches could be introduced to model changes in preferences, semi-parametrically.
Perhaps it could be combined with quasi-experimental methods for identifying the hedonic price
function in panel data settings (Kuminoff and Pope 2014, Banzhaf 2018). Finally, perhaps it can
be combined with dynamic models to approximate or bound welfare when households anticipate
future changes (Bishop and Murphy 2019).

APPENDIX. PROOFS OF LEMMAS AND PROPOSITIONS.

Proof of Lemma 1.
Since the marginal utilities are functions of p and z, we can write Equation (3) in terms of

         Taking the total derivative of the household's first-order condition given by (1) we have

Writing the last term as 4 ∑𝑗𝑗 ∆ �𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧 � ∆𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 ∆𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 + 4 ∑𝑗𝑗 ∆ �𝜕𝜕𝑧𝑧 � ∆𝑧𝑧𝑗𝑗,𝑖𝑖 ∆𝜆𝜆𝑖𝑖 , and combing the first of

these two parts with the previous term, we have:

Re-arranging, and ignoring the remaining third-order terms (as we are taking a second-order ap-
proximation), we have the desired expression. Note to compute this expression, we need As-
sumption A1, that the price derivatives and ∆z terms can be computed for each household across
time.



Proof of Lemma 2.

The proof follows a similar outline as that for Lemma 1. Since the marginal costs are functions
                                                                                      𝜕𝜕𝑐𝑐
of x, we can write Equation (5) in terms of changes in marginal costs ∆ �𝜕𝜕𝑥𝑥ℎ �. With this nota-
                                                                                             𝑟𝑟

tion, Equation (5) can be re-written as:

                                                     𝜕𝜕𝑐𝑐ℎ 1 𝜕𝜕𝑐𝑐ℎ
 (20)                           ∆𝑐𝑐ℎ ≈ � �                 + ∆�      �� ∆𝑥𝑥𝑟𝑟,ℎ .

Substituting the first-order condition (2), we now have:

                                             𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝0       1    𝜕𝜕𝜕𝜕
                         ∆𝑐𝑐ℎ ≈ � �                |𝐱𝐱0 + ∆ �      �� ∆𝑥𝑥𝑟𝑟,ℎ
                                        𝑟𝑟   𝜕𝜕𝑥𝑥𝑟𝑟 ℎ 2 𝜕𝜕𝑥𝑥𝑟𝑟
 (21)
                                                   1 𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝0        𝜕𝜕𝑝𝑝1
                                             = � �         |𝐱𝐱0 +       | 1 � ∆𝑥𝑥𝑟𝑟,ℎ
                                                𝑟𝑟 2 𝜕𝜕𝑥𝑥𝑟𝑟 ℎ     𝜕𝜕𝑥𝑥𝑟𝑟 𝐱𝐱ℎ

Substituting this expression into the equation ∆π = ∆p - ∆c completes the proof.



Proof of Proposition 3.

Let S be the set of all feasible ways households could sort over the two time periods (i.e. all sets

                                                                                                       44
�𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ � meeting the two constraints in the Proposition). Let f(�𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ �) map these feasible sortings
into the welfare measure given in the Proposition (in square brackets). As S is compact, there is
              𝐿𝐿        𝑈𝑈                           𝐿𝐿                          𝑈𝑈
some �𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ � , �𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ � ∈ S such that f(�𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ � ) ≤ f(�𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ �) ≤ f(�𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ � ), for all �𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ �. From
                                                          ∗
Proposition 2, there is one (unknown) set �𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ � ∈ S for which the expression in brackets gives
                                                                           𝐿𝐿             ∗              𝑈𝑈
the second order approximation to welfare. Therefore, f(�𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ � ) ≤ f(�𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ � ) ≤ f(�𝐼𝐼ℎ,ℎ′ � ).

Proof of Proposition 5.

Consider the initial equilibrium described by the hedonic price function p0(g, x; F0). Now con-
sider a change in the distribution of g and allow preferences for individual households to change,
but such that they are still distributed the same (Assumption A3'). Denote the new equilibrium
price function by p1(g, x; F1). Now consider a counter-factual scenario where the distribution of
g is still given by F1 but all households have their original incomes and preferences. By As-
sumption A3', the equilibrium price function would still be p1(g, x; F1) since the distribution of
demands would be no different in this counterfactual and g and x are unchanged (though the as-
signment of households to houses may change). But by Assumption A5 and the argument in
Proposition 4, any household choosing zj in the initial equilibrium such that 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗0 (zj)=θ will choose
zj in the counterfactual equilibrium such that 𝐹𝐹𝑗𝑗1 (zj)=θ. Moreover, these choices are consistent
with the price equilibrium. The rest of the argument follows from Proposition 4.

        Finally, note that the same argument could be made, mutatis mutandis, starting with p1( )
and going back to p0( ) under ex post preferences. Thus, the aggregate welfare evaluation is in-
variant to the perspective taken.

        The proof of the extension of Proposition 3 is similar. However, we now no longer need
a constant joint distribution of {vt, yt}; instead, we only need the same distribution of v1 condi-
tional on y1 as we would have had if v was unchanged.
