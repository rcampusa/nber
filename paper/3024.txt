   COLLATERAL, RATIONING, AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION IN CREDIT MARKETS


                                  ABSTRAfl


     This paper analyzes the effects of government intervention in credit

markets when lenders use collateral, interest, and the probability of

granting a loan as potential screening devices.    Equilibria with and without

rationing are examined.   The principal theme is that credit policies operate

through their effect on the incentive compatibility constraint, which

inhibits high-risk borrowers from mimicking the behavior of low-risk

borrowers.   Any policy that loosens (tightens) the constraint raises

(reduces) efficiency.

     Most government credit programs explicitly attempt to fund investors

that cannot obtain private financing.    In the model presented here, these

subsidies increase the extent of rationing and reduce efficiency.     In

contrast, policies that subsidize the nonrationed borrowers, or all

borrowers, are efficiency enhancing, and reduce the extent of rationing.

1.   Introduction

     The federal government is the largest single lender in the country.        As

of the end of 1988, direct loans outstanding exceeded $222 billion, while

outstanding loan guarantees were approximately $550 billion (Office of Man-

agement and Budget 1989) .   Federal credit assists borrowers across a wide
variety of sectors, including housing, agriculture, small business, and

education, in a bewildering array of over 100 programs)

      In order to analyze the effects of these policies, this paper focuses

on two salient characteristics of virtually all credit programs.     First,

federal credit is usually intended for those who could not obtain private

financing.   For example, "a direct loan is best justified when the federal

objective could not be met with financing from private sources     (Office of

Management and Budget, 1988, p. F-15).     Other programs, such as Small

Business Administration loan guarantees, reauire applicants to prove that

they could not obtain private financing.

      Second, federal credit is provided on easier terms than comparable

private credit.     These terms can include reduced interest or collateral,

longer maturities, grace periods, etc.     These provisions are estimated to

reduce the discounted value of borrower payments by amounts that vary widely

across programs, but typically range between 10% and 25% (Office of

Management and Budget 1989).

      This paper analyzes the effects of policies with these characteristics

in a model where rationing arises endogenously.2     The underlying model is
                                        2




described in Section 2 and is closely related to Rothschild and Stiglitz

(1976) and Besanko and Thakor (1987).       Investors are divided into two

groups, high-risk and low-risk, and have a choice of investing in a safe

project, or borrowing to invest in a risky project.       For each group, lenders

specify a probability of issuing a loan, an interest rate, and a collateral

requirement.

     Any given amount of collateral is assumed to be worth less to lenders

than to borrowers.   This feature implies that the use of collateral will

generate an efficiency loss.     In addition, all projects have expected gross

returns greater than their social opportunity cost.       Therefore, any amount

of rationing represents an additional efficiency loss.       The full information

equilibrium arises when borrower type is known ex ante, and implies no

rationing and no collateral, and is thus efficient.

     Section 3 analyzes situations where each borrower's type is private

information.    Now, lenders must collectively offer sets of contracts that

induce borrowers to self-select into the appropriate contract.        In equilib-

rium, high-risks choose a contract with a relatively high interest rate and

a zero collateral requirement.     Low-risks signal their type by choosing to

pay high collateral in exchange for a lower interest rate.       As long as low-

risks have sufficient wealth to post as collateral, the equilibrium involves

no rationing.    Nevertheless, because of the efficiency loss created by the

use of collateral, there is a potential role for government.

     The principal result of this section is to show that credit policies

operate through their effects on the incentive compatibility constraint,

which constrains the set of adinissable contracts such that high-risk

borrowers do not apply for the low-risk contract.       For example, a guarantee

to low-risk borrowers reduces their interest rate.       Since the high-risk
                                       3




contract has not changed, the low-risk collateral requirement must xi.a      in
order to restore incentive compatibility.   The increase in collateral means

that guarantees to low-risks reduce efficiency.

     In contrast, a guarantee to high-risk borrowers makes the high-risk

loan more attractive, thereby allowing lenders to reduce the collateral

requirement on low-risk loans.    Consequently, guarantees to high-risks raise

efficiency.   Equal guarantees to both groups have similar negative effects

on the collateral requirement and positive effects on efficiency.

     The major results of the paper are presented in Section 4, where it is

assumed that borrower wealth is too low to support the collateral require-

ment in Section 3.    Because the high-risk contract involves no collateral,

it does not change.    However, since low-risks can only post a small amount

of collateral, the low-risk contract must somehow be made less desirable in

order to restore incentive compatibility.    The only option is to reduce the

probability of granting a low-risk loan; that is, to introduce rationing of

low-risk borrowers

     With the existence of rationing, it is now possible to analyze credit

policies with the two salient features described above.     Suppose the govern-

ment agrees to offer subsidized credit (either direct or guaranteed loans)

to some proportion of the (low-risk) borrowers who are turned down by the

private market.   The key point is that in the absence of any further

changes, these subsidies make the low-risk contract more attractive to high-

risk borrowers.   Therefore, some other aspect of the low-risk contract must

become less desirable to restore incentive compatibility.     Since the

collateral requirement cannot rise, the only alternative is for the overall

(public and private) probability of obtaining a loan to fall.     That is,

increased subsidies to the rationed borrowers         the extent of rationing.
Private lending is crowded out on a more than one-to-one basia.      It ahould

be emphasized that this is an equilibrium response, and is due to the

existence of the incentive compatibility constraint.

        Although the subsidies increase the extent of rationing, they raise the

cx ante expected utility of low-risk borrowers.      This occurs because the

benefits of the added cheap government loans outweigh the costs of the in-

creased probability of being rationed.      Thus, subsidies to low-risks make

the representative low-risk borrower better off cx ante, but actually reduce

the utility of some low-risk borrowers cx post.      Since they increase the

extent of rationing, the subsidies to low-risk borrowers reduce overall

efficiency.

        In contrast, subsidies to high-risk borrowers loosen the incentive

compatibility conatraint.     As a consequence, the extent of rationing of low-

risk borrowers falls and efficiency rises.

        Section 5 is a short conclusion.   The Appendix provides derivation of

the various equilibria and proofs of the propositions.


2.   The Basic Model

A.   Description

        The model describes a competitive credit market with many investors,

but even more lenders.     All agents are assumed to be risk-neutral, thus

eliminating any insurance role for federal credit, and there is no aggregate

risk.

        Investors can invest their initial endowment in a safe project that

yields a gross return of     Z.4   Alternatively, each investor can borrow $1

and invest that and the initial endowment in a risky project.      Investors

fall into two categories, which differ according to the probability of
                                                           5




having a risky project succeed,                     ir.,       and the gross return to that project

if    it   is successful,            R1.   I assume              > IT2,      so that type     l's are low-

risk borrowers.              Projects that do not succeed yield a gross return of zero.

The expected gross return to all projects are equal:                                  PiRi — k,       i —   1,2,
where       k    is a constant.            Investors have a certain end-of-period endowment

W.     I assume the existence of a sufficient enforcement technology such that

W     is acceptable to lenders as collateral.                          The proportion of borrowers that

are low-risk is given by .

           Lenders have an alternative safe investment that earns                             p.      They offer

loans characterized by an interest rate                            (r),      a collateral requirement

(c),       and a probability of issuing the loan to any particular applicant

(p).       Following several authors,5 I assume there is a cost to collateraliza-

tion.       Specifically, the lenders' valuation of $1 in collateral is given by

fi,    0     $   <    1.   Therefore,       1   -   $>0         represents the social cost of

transferring the collateral or realizing its value.                                   Competition among

lenders generates the following zero profit condition on loans to each

group :6


                           p —   Rr    +   (l-r)$c              i —   1,2.

Investors are assumed to be able to apply for only one loan.                                   The expected

utility of an investor in group                     i      applying for a loan contract meant for

group       j    is


(2)                              —   Pj(Iri(Ri_rj)*(l_Ir)cjZ)                 i,j —    1,2.

           Lenders always know the value of .                         In   the full information

equilibrium described below, lenders also know each borrower's type.                                         In the

asymmetric information equilibria, information on borrower type is

unavailable to banks on an ex ante basis.
       The Nash equilibrium concept is used throughout this paper.                        A set of

contracts is a Nash equilibrium if no contract in the set earns negative

profits, and there is no additional contract which, if offered, would make

positive profits, holding the current set of contracts fixed (Rothschild and

Stiglitz 1976)


B.     Full Information Equilibrium

        Although subsequent analysis will focus on markets with asymmetric

information, the full information equilibrium is presented first as a

benchmark.     Because the types are identifiable cx ante, lenders face two

distinct loan markets.             In each submarket, optimal contracts maximize

expected borrower utility U1,                       given in (2), subject to (1).


Equilibrium I:     The full information equilibrium is characterized by


(3a)              p —       1,      i —      1,2,        (No rationing)


(3b)              c       — 0,      i —      1,2         (No collateral)


(3c)              r —               i    —   1,2,


        With full information, all borrowers receive loans.                      In addition, since

borrowers are indifferent between committing to a dollar of expected

interest payments and a dollar of expected collateral, while lenders prefer

the former, equilibrium involves complete elimination of collateral.

Formally, from (1), the slope of isoprofit curves in                       r-c    space is given by

the isoprofit curve is flatter than the indifference curve.                                             Curves for

high-risk borrowers are steeper than those for low-risk borrowers.                                              The full

information equilibrium is given by contracts a and                                          a2         along with

Since     p + Z     is the social opportunity cost of investment,                                   (4) shows that

investments are made               (Uii > 0)                   if and only if the expected total return

exceeds the expected social cost.                                   Therefore, equilibrium is efficient.


3,   Asyinetrjc Information and Unconstrained Collateral

A.   Private Equilibrium

        When individual investors' types are private information, lenders must

design sets of loan contracts that generate self-selection of each borrower

type into the appropriate contract.                                   Thus, lenders operate subject to               (1)

and a pair of incentive compatibility constraints:


                    U11           U12,          and


                    U22 a U21,

where    Uij      is defined in (2).                       It can be directly verified that the full

information equilibrium is not incentive compatible, because both types

would prefer the low-risk contract.

        Instead, with asymmetric information, collateral is used as a sorting

device.7     High-risk borrowers have a stronger preference not to post

collateral, because they have a larger probability of having to pay it.

       Whether collateral can induce complete separation depends crucially on

W,     the level of borrower wealth.                       This section examines equilibria and

government policy when borrower wealth is sufficiently large to allow

complete separation.            Section 4 examines markets characterized by insuffic-

ient wealth.

        With imperfect information, high-risk borrowers obtain the same loan

contract, and therefore the same utility, as in the full information

equilibrium.     Low-risk borrowers are not rationed, but their loan terms have

changed.     Specifically, low-risk borrowers indicate their type by posting

collateral.     In return, they pay a lower interest rate than in the full

information equilibrium.

Comparing (4) and (7), low-risk borrowers are worse off relative to the full

information equilibrium by                (l-r1)(l-fl)c.              The magnitude of the welfare
                                                   9




loss increases with        c1.

      The equilibrium with asyimnetric information and unconstrained

collateral is shown in Figure 1 as             (a1,a2).          High-risks obtain      a2     as

before.     However, any contract offered to low-risks must be incentive

compatible with     a2.     Of all such contracts,               a1    is the most desirable

contract for type l's that also earns nonnegative profits when extended to

type l's.      The reduction in low-risk borrowers                    utility to U from U
is shown by the shift from a to               a1.           Note that (5b) is binding in this

equil ibriun.


.     Government Credit

       Although there is no rationing in the above model, there is still a

role for government policy due to the efficiency losses created by the use

of collateral.      Because all investors receive loans in the private equilib-

rium, it seems natural to focus on loan guarantees (rather than direct

loans) in this context.9

       Loan guarantees ensure the lender of receiving an amount                      -y.,    where

o         p.     The government can set            11 — 12        y,    or choose the

separately.      In return for the guarantee, the lender passes on any collater-

al collected to the government.             The net cost to the government of a
                                     III                III
defaulted loan is           -    flc.      where       c.       is the collateral requirement

in the presence of the guarantee, and is discussed further below.                            The

government is subject to the same information constraints that private

lenders face.

In the preceding private Equilibrium II, banks received 9c and                                                       0       in

collateral on loans to type 1 and 2 respectively.                                        It is easy to verify that

          —   9c     and       12 — 0,            (9a)-(9c) reduce to the private equilibrium (Ga)-

(6c).     Only higher guarantee rates have real effects.
                                                                              III
        Using (9b)           increases in          11               cause    c1       to rise in equilibrium.

This result is contrary to standard intuition, which would suggest that as

11     rises, the necessary collateral should fall.                                    However, as           11     rises,

r1     falls, and the low-risk contract becomes more desirable to high-risk

borrowers.     Since (5b) binds,                   c1               uust rise to e1itinate the possibility of

having high-risks masquerade as low-risks.

        This situation is depicted in Figure 2.                                     Increases in        11       shift the

zero profit line for low-risk lending from I to                                                  Equilibrium
                                                                                          Ii.

contracts, which are constrained by (5a) and (5b), shift from                                                (a1,a2)             to

(aja2).       The collateral required at                                aj   is greater than         a1.         Therefore,

the existence of imperfect information reverses the usual intuition

concerrthg the effect of                 11       Ofl           C1.

        Any guarantee to low risks that reduced the collateral requirement

would make them worse off and thus would be rejected in favor of                                                   a1.       This

is illustrated by a guarantee that shifts the zero profit curve to
                                                                                                                     Ii'

such guarantees correspond to                               <

         Similar       arguments show that                  cf"            falls with increases in                 As

shown in Figure 3, a rise in                                shifts the zero profit line for lending

to high-risk borrowers from                      12       to        I,      which raises low-risk utility to

l3     from     132.        The equilibrium thus shifts from                           (a1,a2)     to     (a,a).        At

the latter points, kfl groups are better off and the collateral requirement

has fallen.

         Since the use of collateral creates efficiency losses, these results

will have important welfare implications.                                     Substituting (9a)-(9c) into (2)

yields expected utilities:

                                                                     (l-r1)(r1-r2)

rium.      Increases in                    raise both               1311     and 22        Thus, both types of

borrowers are better off with guarantees.

         Welfare calculations are based on total expected borrowers' utility

minus expected government costs of funding the guarantees.                                              Define overall

welfare as

The first two terms represent utility of each borrower type, weighted by

their population proportion; the last two tens represent net expected

government costs of providing guarantees to low-risks and high-risks
                       10
respectively.

        The main result from Proposition 1 is that the effects of government

intervention depend on how the incentive compatibility constraint, and in

particular the collateral requirement, is affected.

        Equation (13) states that increases in                       holding     2 constant,
                                                              l'
reduce welfare.           From (10), the guarantee raises             U11   by   ((l-ir1)(ir1-ir2))/


(l0-2))         However, from (12), the marginal cost per low-risk borrower of

raising
            l   is        (l-ir1) .     It   is easy to show that the marginal costs exceed

the marginal benefits.                This occurs because the rise in              raises   c1

which creates an efficiency loss.

        The second result states that subsidizing the high-risk group is

welfare-improving.               Using (11) arid (12), the government's costs equal the

benefits to high-risk borrowers.                 Since low-risk borrowers are also made

better off, there is a welfare gain.                   The rise in          increases the
                                                                       2
attractiveness of the high-risk contract, so that low-risk borrowers can be

offered more attractive terms.                 The fall in    c1     allows for an efficiency

gain.

      Equation (15) states that raising the guarantee rate on all loans is

welfare-improving.     From (9b), setting l —             — -y   yields    c/3-y   < 0,

so that collateral falls as the overall guarantee rate rises.                Therefore,

the net effect of universal guarantees is to weaken the incentive

compatibility constraint and raise welfare.


4.   Asymmetric Information and Constrained Collatexa].

A.   Private Equilibrium

      The effectiveness of collateral as a sorting device depends crucially

on the existence of sufficient end-of-period borrower wealth.                For example,

if   W — 0,    collateral cannot be used as a sorting device.             More generally,

suppose   w   < cf'   given in (Gb); then the low-risk contract offered in

Equilibrium II cannot be fulfilled by borrowers.               Lenders, knowing this,

will not offer the contract.       Moreover, because (5b) is binding in

equilibrium, if lenders simply reduced         c1    to   W,     the contracts offered

would not be incentive compatible; both groups would prefer the contract

meant for low-risk borrowers.

      Lenders can resolve this problem only by making the low-risk contract

less attractive to high-risk borrowers.11           Raising      r1   would discourage

low-risk borrowers more than high-risk borrowers, since the latter have a

smaller probability of actually having to pay the higher rate.                The only

alternative is to reduce     p1.    This adjustment will discourage high-risks

more, and restore incentive compatibility.           Therefore, when borrower wealth

is insufficient to permit collateral alone to act as a sorting device,

rationing of low-risk borrowers       (p1<l)    is required to restore equilibrium.

The intuition presented above is summarized in

defined as before.         Although the analysis will focus on subsidized loan

guarantees, analogous results can be shown to hold for subsidized direct

loans as well.

These private loans are, of course, supplemented by government-guaranteed

loans to some low-risk borrowers described by G' rG W).                     High-risk

borrowers obtain the same contract and utility as in Equilibria II and IV.

        Proposition 2 establishes that government subsidies to borrowers who

cannot obtain private financing increases the number of borrowers who cannot

obtain any financing, public or private.                  That is, private credit is crowded

out on a more than one-to-one basis.                   Although this result may appear

surprising, it is based on the equilibrium response of lenders to the shift

in the incentive compatibility constraint,

        For example, in the equilibrium with W > c1,                  an increase in

raised     c1   in order to restore incentive compatibility.                  Now, however,

collateral is constrained to equal                W, which is assumed to be less than           c.
As a consequence, increases in l (which reduce                       r1)    require that   p1

                                                        holding G constant, reduces           p*.

Therefore, raising the guarantee rate to low-risk borrowers increases the

extent of rationing.

        Similarly, consider a small increase in                PC,              l
If         were held constant, all borrowers would have an increased chance of

obtaining a cheap government loan, which would induce high-risks to

masquerade as low-risks.              If   p1   fell such that       p*    were unchanged from

 its previous level, high-risks would still prefer masquerading as low-risks

 to taking the high-risk contract.               To show this, rewrite (20) as


 (23)              U22       p*X21 +       (lp1)p(X2X21).
                                          17




Recall that this constraint is binding in Equilibrium V.        If        rises and

p*   is held constant, (23) is violated.       Therefore, in equilibrium,

incentive compatibility requires     p1    to fall enough to make    p*   fall in

response to the rise in          That is, increases in         raise the extent of

rationing.

        Although they increase the likelihood of any given low-risk borrower

being rationed, guarantees raise the cx post utility of those who do obtain

government credit, because of the reduced interest rate        rG    on guaranteed

loans.     The effects of these guarantees on the cx ante expected utility of

low-risk borrowers and on welfare is given in

        Equations (24a) and (24b) show that guaranteed loans raise the cx ante

expected utility of the targeted group.        This occurs even though the overall

probability of obtaining a loan falls.         Therefore, the targeted group

prefers to have the policy, even though fewer lower-risk borrowers obtain

credit when the subsidy is in place.
                                      18




     Equations (25a) and (25b) show that, as in Proposition 1, guarantees to

low-risk borrowers reduce overall welfare.     This occurs because the increase

in rationing represents an overall efficiency loss.      Following the approach

taken in Section III,   it is straightforward to show that guarantees to the

high-risk group reduce the extent of rationing.      Intuitively, these

guarantees make the high-risk contract     (U22)   more attractive, and through

(21a) raise         Because of the reduction in rationing, these guarantees

raise efficiency.


S.   Conclus ion

     This paper analyzes the effects of credit subsidies in markets

characterized by adverse selection.    The principal result is that the

effects of credit subsidies depend on how eligibility is determined.

Programs that subsidize the unrationed contract will reduce the extent of

rationing and raise overall efficiency.     In contrast, programs that target

borrowers who cannot obtain private financing raise the extent of rationing

and reduce efficiency.    The distinction is important precisely because most

government credit is designed to provide funds to those who do not receive

private loans. In the model presented here, such policies raise the extent

of rationing and create inherent tradeoffs among members of the same target

group: fewer of them obtain any type of credit, but those that receive

government loans are better off.

      Two concluding comments should be made.      First, the effects described

above represent equilibrium responses.     In particular, they take into

account the need to deter high-risks from pretending to be low-risks.       As a

consequence of this incentive compatibility constraint, whenever the

government eases some of the terms on low-risk contracts, the others must be

adversely affected in equilibrium.

     Second, the paper has focused on a fairly standard adverse selection

model, based on Rothschild and Stiglitz (1976)   Numerous extensions of that

and other models have shown that the nature of equilibrium can be affected

by incentive effects (Stiglitz and Weiss 1986), project characteristics, the

set of available financial instruments (DeMeza and Webb 1987), alternative

projects (Chan and Thakor 1987), information sharing (Yotsuzuka 1987), the

shape of the production function (Milde and Riley 1988), and other

characteristics,   The effects of credit policies in such alternative models

deserve further exploration.

independent work by Smith and Stutzer (1988)

     3.   As described in Section 4, raising the interest rate on the low-

risk loan cannot restore incentive compatibility, because low risks are more

averse to accepting a higher interest rate than high risks are.

sorting devices, the paper focuses on separating equilibria.              See notes 8

effects induced by collateral.

     8.   The existence of a separating equilibrium can be ensured by

assuming there is a sufficiently large proportion of high-risk borrowers, or

                                                                    See Rothschild and

Stiglitz (1976) or Besanko and Thakor (1987).                         There are no pooling

equilibria under the assumptions in this section.

     9.     Gale (1987) also examines government policies in which low-risk

loans are taxed and high risk loans are subsidized.                            These policies operate

through the same channels as guarantees and will be ignored here.

     10.     Therefore, the welfare criterion is total surplus, rather than a

Pareto measure.         In addition, (12) assumes that taxes are raised in a lump-

sum manner.

     11.     It is impossible to make the high-risk contract more attractive to

high-risk borrowers without losing money on high-risk contracts.                                   Due to the

Nash assumption, cross-subsidization of contracts will not occur in this

model, although it could in other contexts.                          See Stiglitz and Weiss 1989.

     12.     Besanko and Thakor (1987) show that under these circumstances (Sa)

requires that     W      Zp (if1-if2)/(if1Or2R-p)           -   Z1r2((l-1r1)+flif1J).         Loosely

speaking, this requires that             Z        is small relative to           W.


     13.     In order to rule out a pooling equilibrium at                            p. — 1,      ci — W,       it

is necessary to assume that         fi       C    (,r*(1-ir1))/(ir1(l,r*)),           where     ,r* —        +


(l*)1r2.     It may be thought that the allocation in Equilibrium V could be

broken by an offer that raises                   p1   and   r1,      holding     c1     at    W.     Such an

offer would earn positive profits if it attracted only low-risks.                                    However,

from (2),     dr/dp —     (k-c-Z)/pir    -       (r-c)/p.       Since this expression is

decreasing in     it,     any offer that raised                 p1    and   r1   relative to

Equilibrium V would attract both types and thus would not be offered.

     14.     Reducing the collateral requirement on government loans has the

same qualitative effects as raising p or

loans to accept public ones, I assume                           > PX1.

3L/3c2 < 0,               which implies c —                     0.        Substituting for c in (Sb) and

Using (1) and (Gb) and some algebra, it can be shown that (A-4) holds for

examining Figure 1.

         It is also straightforward to show that                                   3L/8p2 > 0,     which implies

This can be shown to be positive provided that                                   k -    r1   -       Z       > 0.         This

condition captures the idea that high-risks have a highr aversion to post-

ing collateral because they have a larger probability of having to pay it.

That is, the same condition implies, from (2), that                                      dc/dp                   rises with       ir.

substitute (8) into (2) into (A-l) and maximize subject to (5a), ignoring

Setting       8LIH/8c1 —          0        implies that        A > 0,    which implies that (Sb) binds.

Given     A > 0,    it is easy to show that                      cU     — 0.           Solving (Sb) for                          cH

described in the text.                  The effects of raising                            -y    are as follows.

     If   -y    c    scft,     the only effect of raising                            -y        occurs through raising

     so the increase in                           is welfare improving.                         When            scft,     further
                                         i                                                              -y




increases introduce opposing welfare effects.                                        However, the net effect is

always welfare-improving.                        Note that, for each high-risk borrower, the

benefits of raising                y    equal        (l-w2)&y2,              which equals the cost of

providing guarantees per high-risk borrowers.                                        The welfare effects thus

depend on comparing                au1/a             and the cost of providing guarantees to low-

risks,    (l-w1).            From (10),

Therefore, increases in                     -y    are welfare-improving.

Equilibrium         IV:      The problem is now to maximize (A-2) subject to (1),                                               (5b)

and a wealth constraint                     W <    c.        As before, taking derivatives with

respect to          c2       and   p2       yields p —                 1     and c —              0,     and the latter

result implies r — p1w2.                           The wealth constraint implies that                                   cf' —

The zero profits condition determines                                  rf'.       Only          p1     remains to be

determined.          Optimizing with respect to                             p1     implies that               A > 0      so that

(Sb) is binding.               Solving (Sb) for               p1           yields the expression in (16a)


Equilibrium V:               The problem is now to maximize (A-2) subject to (1) ,                                            (Sa)

W < c, and (20), and where                          U11      is given by (19).                       Values for

determined by solving (20) for                         p1.
