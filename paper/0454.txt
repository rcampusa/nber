                                   ABSTRACT



     This paper is an empirical exploration of the dynamic relationship between

health and cognitive development in a longitudinal data set compiled from two

nationally representative cross—sections of children. Our results indicate

that there is feedback both from health to cognitive development and from

cognitive development to health, but the latter of these relationships is stronger.

They also indicate that estimates of family background effects taken from the

dynamiá model —    which can be assumed to be less jufluenced by genetic factors

are smaller than their cross—sectional counterparts, but some still remain

statistically significant.

     The first finding calls attention to the existence of a continuing inter-

action between health and cognitive development over the life cycle. The

second finding suggests that nurture timattersit in cognitive development and

health outcomes.

       Recent   studies of children have documented the existence of a relationship

between health and cognitive development, reporting tyicallv that good health

is associated with higher levels of cognitive development (Edwards and Grossman

1979 and the references cited therein). This association may arise from

causality running in one or both directions. Poor health may imnede cognitive

development in diverse ways. Children who had excessively low birth weights

may experience defective brain functioning and abnormally low 10's throughout

their lives. Children who are frequently sick or who are undernourished may

be less well able to benefit from school Instruction because they either are

absent from school or are lethargic and nassive when nresent at school. A

similar comment can he made about children with vision or hearing nroblems.

Causality runs in the other direction when more intelligent children and ado-

lescents are better able to manage or avoid health nroblems. Such children

can better understand and follow instructions, and they might be more con-

scientious about taking prescribed medicine or following a snecified treatment.

In addition, they may better appreciate the importance of eating a nutritious

diet and act apnrooriatelv.

      While existing studies of childhood document this association between

health and cognitive development, they do not provide much evidence concerning

the direction of causality. This Is because they rely almost exclusively on

cross—sectional data. The use of cross—sectional data does not necessarily

preclude the investigation of causality, of course, but in the nresent context

the   underlying theory does not yield enough nrior restrictions to allow one to
address   this issue. Another stumbling block that arises when one tries to un-

ravel the complicated health—cognitive develonment relationshin with cross—sectional
                                        —2—


data Is the impossibility of holding constant unmeasurable genetic factors

which may be correlated with both health and cognitive develonment.

       A partial remedy for these problems lies with the use of longitudinal

data. With such data it is possible to directly model and estimate the dynamic

relationship between health and cognitive develonment. Causality is orobed by

examining which attribute of children is statistically nrior to the other.

For examnie, if   it is   found that early health status   influences   later IQ but

that   early IQ does not influence later health status, it is concluded that
health affects 10 but not vice—versa.        (This notion of causality is akin to
that   of Cranger 1969). The nroblern of senarating out the impact of unmeasured

genetic factors is not so readily dealt with, but it may have less damaging

consequences when longitudinal as opposed to cross—sectional data are used.

       In this paner we   investigate   the relationship between health and cognitive

development   using a longitudinal data set comniled from two nationally       renresen—

tatve cross—sections of children: Cycles II and III' of the Health Examination

Survey (lIES). Cycle II samnies 7,119 noninstitutionalized children aged 6 to 11

years in the 1963—65 neriod; and Cycle III samnies 6,768 noninstitutionalized

youths aged 12 to 17 years in the 1966—70 neriod. There are 2,177 children

common to both cycles, and they were examined in both neriods. These 2,177

children constitute the samole on which our longitudinal analysis is .hased.

For these 2,177 children we have measures of health and cognitive develonment

in both periods (childhood and adolescence) and an array of family background

variables taken from the first period.

       Two multi.vari.ate equations are estimated with these data. The first re-

lates adolescent health to childhood health, childhoor cognitive develonment,

and family background and the second relates nAol.escent cogntv'           develonment
to childhood cognitive development, childhood health, and family background.
                                            —3--



Thus,    the   resulting estimates will enable us to compare the effect of nrior

health on current cognitive development with the effect of prior cognitive

development on current health. As a byproduct, these equations provide

sharper    estimates of the environmental as          opposed to genetically—related

impacts of selected family background variables on             children's health and
cognitive development.

                          I. Some Theoretical Considerations
        The general type of model estimated here can         be represented by the
following      equation

(1)
         Yi,tAyi,_i+Bxi,_1+c,
where            represents   a vector of health and cognitive development    measures
in    period t    for   individual i.       is a vector of economic and background

variables      for that individual in     period t,   and A and B are matrices of coeffi—
cients) The variables in x1 are those that determine the quantity and pro-

ductivity of the various        innuts   in the   health and cognitive development oroduc—
tion    functions: family income, parents' educational attainment,

family size, and the        prices   of medical care, schooling, and nutrition.2

Some of these variables vary through time and some are assumed to be constant in

all periods. In the special case where                  is a dichotomous measure, (when it

denotes the presence or absence of a narticular illness, for example), equation

(1) can be directly interpreted as a transition probability function: it gives

the probability that individual i has a given health status in time t            conditional
on his health status in time t—l and on the values of the other nredetermined

variables in t—1..
                                             —4—




        Estimation of this type of model improves on existing cross—sectional
analysis of causality because it explicitly treats the time sequence of
changes in health and cognitive development. Briefly, this approach, suggested
by Granger (1969), relies on a temporal ordering of events: a variable x is
said to cause y if predictions of y conditional on lagged values of y and x

both are statistically superior to predictions conditional on lagged values

of y alone, in this setting, causality between cognitive development

and health can be discovered by examining the coefficients of childhood

health in the adolescent cognitive IQ development equation              and the coeffi-
cients of      childhood cognitive develooment in the adolescent health equation.

        The problem raised by omitted genetic factors is less tractable. Neverthe-

less, if such factors can be assumed to oi,erate once and for all by determining

the "endowed't levels of health or cognitive          development [y.       past   values   of
these    variables will fully embody and control for all genetic effects. Under

this    assumation,   the   fact   that   one cannot dirct measure genetic factors
does    not   mar the above analysis of causality. Even as restrictive an assumption

as this, however, cannot rescue cross—sectional work because cross—sectional

data do not typically include past values of the denendent variable.3

       An additional implication of this assumption is that the estimated impacts

of the various family background measures and of early health or IQ represent

true environmental (as oposed to genetic) effects. That is, they represent

effects that operate through the parents' demand for health or cognitive de-

velopment innuts or through the degree of productive efficiency. This is in

contrast to estimates generated from cross—sectional data. In the latter case,

the relationship between parents' educational attainment and children's 10,

for example, reflects both an environmental effect (more highly educated

mothers do a better job of educating their children) and a genetic effect

(more highly educated mothers have on average greater native intelligence,
                                        —5—


which is passed genetically to their children). When it is assumed that early

health or cognitive development fully embodies the genetic contribution,

family background variables will reflect only environmental influences.

       Admittedly, this assumption concerning genetic impacts is very restrictive.

With data like ours, however, which covers only two points in time, it is im-

possible to partition the effect of the unobservable genetic factors from

other time—invariant factors without making some fairly restrictive assumptions.

We choose to make this particular assumption for the balance of this paper be—

cause it has the advantage of permitting us to use single equation estimation

techniques, a not insignificant consideration with a data set as large as this
       4
one.

           To better illustrate the exact nature of this assumption and its necessity,

we present the following simplified two—period formulation, of which our model

is a special case (the l's are suppressed for simplicity):


(2a)
              H1=a1GH+b1E+c1
(2b)               a2 GH + b2 E + c2H1 ÷          +
              H2                           d2Q1

(3a)
              Q1a1GQ+1E+C
(3b)             =  ÷ 2 E + y2Q
                      GQ               +          +
              Q2


In   this two—period model        represents health.        represents cognitive develop-

ment, CU represents the time—invariant genetic health endowment, GQ represents

the    time—invariant cognitive endowment, and E represents a time—invariant
background variable. Since Gil       and   GQ are unobserved, we write H,,    and   in
terms of the predetermined values of H            and Q [assuming
                                                                  a1
                                                                     and     do not equal

        In   the context of this model the assumption of no direct genetic effects

after    the first period is equivalent to fixing a2 and a2 at zero. When these
are not zero, one cannot determine directions of causality because the error
terms in the equations are correlated with the explanatory variables and this
correlation leads to biased estimates of both d2 and 62. Nor can one obtain unbiased
estimates of pure environmental effects because the reduced form coefficients of
the-background variable (E) and of the lagged dependent variable (Q1 or 111)
embody both genetic (a1 and a. or a1 and 2 and environmental (b2 and c2
or 82 and           impacts.

                             II. Empirical Imolementation
A. The Data
       Equations (2b) and (3b) are estimated (under the assumptions that
a2
     = 0 and    a2 = 0)    using   the longitudinal         sample compiled from Cycles II

and III of the HES. Both cycles are described in detail in NCHS (l967a)

and (1969), respectively. Ninety—nine percent of the youths in the longi—

tudinal      sample are between the ages of 12 and 15 years at the time of
Cycle III, and the remaining one nercent are 16 years old.
                                       —7—




     The HES data include medical histories of each youth provided by the

parent, information on family socioeconomic characteristics, birth certificate

information, and a school report with data on school performance and classroom

behavior provided by teachers or other school officials. Most important,

there are objective measures of health from detailed thysical examinations

and scores on psychological (including EQ and achievement) tests. The physical

examinations   were given to the children and youths by pediatricians and dentists,
and the IQ and achievement tests were administered by       psychologists,    all of
whom were employed by the Public Health Service at the time of each cycle of
theHES.
     This paner useè only those data for white adolescents who at the time of
the Cycle II exam lived with either both of their parents or with their mothers
only. Black adolescents are excluded from the empirical analysis because
Edwards and Grossman (1979, 1980, forthcoming) have found significant race
differences in slope coefficients in cross—sectional       research using    Cycles II
and III. Separate      estimates for black adolescents are not presented because

the black sample is too small to allow for reliable coefficient estimates.

Cur working sample also excludes observations for which data are missing.6

The final sample size is 1,434.

     The health and cognitive development measures are described below. In

labeling these measures, we denote those that refer to childhood (from Cycle

II) by the number 1 at the end of the variable name, and those that refer to

adolescence (from Cycle III) by the number 2.


B. Measurement of Cognitive Develqpment

     Two measures of cognitive development are used: an 10 measure derived

from two   subtests   of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISCl,

WISC2), and a school achievement measure     derived   from the reading and
                                        —8—



arithmetic subtests of the Wide Range Achievement Test (WRAT1, WRAT2).           Both

measures   are scaled to have means of 100 and standard deviations of 15 for

each   age—groun (four—month cohorts are used for WISC and      six—month cohorts

are    used for WRAT) . wisc is a common IQ test, similar to (and highly corre-
lated with results from) the Stanford—Binet IQ test (Nd-iS 1972) .       The   full test
consists of twelve subtests, but only two of these——vocabulary and block design——
were administered In the lIES. 10      estimates based on these two subtests are

highly   correlated   with those based on all twelve subtests (NCIIS 1972). Simi-

larly, a test score based on the reading and      arithmetic subtests of Wide    Range

Achievement Test have been found to be highly correlated with        the full test
and with other   conventional achievement tests (NCFIS 1967b).


C. Measurement of Health

       The measures of childhood and adolescent health are: the neriodontal

index (APERI1, APERI2): obesity (OBESE1, OBESE2); thenresence of one or more

significant abnormalities as reported by the examining physician (ABN1, ABN2);

high diastolic blood pressure (HDBP1, HDBP2): the narent's assessment of the

youth's overall health (PFGHEALTH1, PFGHEALTH2): and excessive school absence

for health reasons during the past six months (SCHABS1, SCHABS2). These six

measures are negative correlates of good health, and with the exception of the

periodontal index, they are all dichotomous variables. Detailed definitions

of these health measures (as well as the cognitive development measures) annear

in Table 1.    All but two of    the measures——APERI   and ABN——are adequately ex-
plained by the table. Additional discussion of APERI and AB follows.
       The periodonal index (APERI, APERI2) is a good overall indicator of oral

health as well as a positive correlate of nutrition (Russell 1956). It is

obtained from an   examination   of the gums surrounding each tooth and is     scored
in   such a way that a higher value reflects noorer oral health. 8 Because the
periodontal index has marked age and sex trends, our measure is comnuted as

        aThe means   and   standard deviations are for the sample of 1,434 white

youths described in the text.

examination, 4       psychological examination, 5 =           school   form.


        cTh mean of this variable is not eaual to 100 because standard-

ization was done using the entire Cycle II or               Cycle III sample   rather

than the subsample reported here. In particular the mean in excess of

100 reflects the better cognitive development of white youths compared

to black youths.

        dh   mean of this variable is not zero because standardization was

done using the entire Cycle II or Cycle III sample rather than the sub-

sample reported here. In particular the negative mean reflects the

better oral health of white youths compared to black youths.


        °The mean and standard deviation are based on a subsample of 1,321

youths for whom the school form was available.

the difference between the adolescent's (or child's) actual index and the mean
index    for his or her age—sex group divided by the standard deviation for that
age—sex group. Note that oral health is one of the few aspects of health
for which a well—defined continuous index has been constructed.
        Significant   abnormalities (ABN1, ABN2) are defined to be heart disease;

neurological, muscular, or joint conditions; other major diseases; and in

Cycle III only, otitis media. This minor difference between the definitions

of    ABN1 and ABN2 will have little imnact on our results because otitis media
constitutes only a small percentage (about 1 percent) of all renorted abnor—
malities   in Cycle III.

        In choosing these six particular health measures, our overriding considera-

tion was diversity.9 Indeed, it is the well—known multidimensional nature of

health that led us to study a set of measures rather than a single composite

index. Diversity Is desired not only with resnect to the systems of the body

cov&red,   but also with regard to the degree to which the health conditions
can be affected by environmental influences. For example, both obesity and
theperiodental index are greatly affected by life style and preventive
medical care. In the case of either of these measures, therefore, one would
expect to observe a     significant impact of family background variables. On the

other   hand, health problems   like high blood nressure and significant -abnormali-

ties may not be responsive to family or medical Intervention. Such measures

may, however, have an impact on other aspects of health or on cognitive develop—

ment. Subjective health measures like the narents' assessment of the child's

health or school absenteeism have the advantage of reflecting neonle's ncr—

ceptions about their health. But, at the same time, they may depend on the

socioeconomic status of the family. For example, narents with low levels of

income and schooling may be dissatisfied with many asPects of their lives
                                         13 —




 including the health of their offspring. (This type of reporting bias is
 largely controlled for in our analysis, however, because we hold constant
both a group of socioeconomic variables and the lagged value of the subjec-
 tive measure.) A secondary criterion used in choosing the health measures
was reva1ence. In particular, we avoided health problems like abnormal
hearing that have a relatively low prevalence in this cohort.

D.    Measurement of Other Variables

       In addition to lagged (i.e. childhood) health and cognitive develonment,

each equation includes the set of family and youth characteristics defined

in Appendix Table 1. All family and youth characteristics are taken from

Cycle II (except for the variable INTERVAL which measures the elapsed time

between the child's two     examinations).   The child's age as of the Cycle II

exam and/or his sex are also included     when the   denendent variable is not

age and/or sex adjusted (that is, for ABN, PFCHEALTH,SCHABS, WISC, and

WRAT).10

       The rationale for including each of these     youth and family characteristics
variables   has been discussed extensively elsewhere (Edwards and Grossman 1979,

1980, forthcoming) and will not be treated here. In the empirical section we

discuss the effects of only the most important family background variables:

mother's schooling (MEDUCAT), father's schooling (FEDUCAT), and family income

(FINC).    We view Parents' schooling as representing the parents' efficiency


in the production of their offspring's health and cognitive develonment, and

family income as representing the family's command over resources.


                            III. Empirica1 Results

       Ordinary   least squares multiple regression equations for   the dependent
variables WISC2, WRAT2, APERI2, ABN2, HDBP2, PFGHEALTU2, OBESE2, and SCIIABS2
are   given in Tables A—2 through A—9 in the appendix.     Since the six adolescent
                                     —14—



health measures are negative correlates of good health, negative (positive)
effects of family background and lagged cognitive development in the health
equations reflect factors associated with better (noorer) health outcomes.
Alternatively,    positive coefficients of lagged health in the current health

equations signify that poor health in childhood    is associated with noor health
in    adolescence. Finally, negative coefficients of lagged health in the current

cognitive development equations mean that poor health in childhood reduces

cognitive development in adolescence.

       Although five of the eight dependent variables are dichotomous, the

method of estimation    is ordinary least squares. Preliminary investigation
revealed    almost no differences between ordinary least squares estimates and

dichotomous   logit estimates. Given the size of our sample and the minimal
improvement in the accuracy of the estimates, we    decided   to rely on OLS esti-
mation. When     the dependent variable is dichotomous, the estimated equation

can be interpreted as a linear probabilty function.


A. Causal Priorness

       In order to address the issue of the direction of causality between

health and cognitive development, we present in Table 2 an 8 by 8 matrix of

lagged coefficients from the 8 equations. The off—diagonal elements of the

matrix provide information with regard to mutual feedback between health and

cognitive   development, mutual feedback between various health conditions,
and mutual feedback between 10 (WIS() nd ncl'ieveiient (WRAT) .     The

elements on the main diagonal of the matrix are the own—laggedeffects, or
the   regression coefficients of the lagged denendent variable.

       We begin by looking at the own—lagged effects. The size of the own—

lagged coefficients are an indication of the nersistence of each health condi-

tion. For example, if the coefficient of the lagged dependent variable is

close    to one, this signifies that the health condition (or the stochastic
process governing the occurrence of that condition) has       a   relatively low
frequency and is slow to change. Coefficients close to zero indicate a
higher frequency process. For slowly changing conditions one would expect
to find that other ex!'lanatorv variables (besides the lagged dependent
variable) will not have as large effects as they would for conditions that
are more readily altered. When      the   deoendent variable is dichotomous, the
own—lagged coefficient can be directly internreted as the degree of persis-
tence in the particular aspect of health in question: in this case the
lagged coefficient is the difference between the expected conditional
probability   of an adolescent health condition given that the same condition

was present in childhood and the conditional      probability given that the con-
dition was absent in childhood. Each of the eight own—lagged effects is
positive    and statistically significant at all conventional levels of confi-

dence.11 The coefficients range from a high of .73 in the case of WRAT to

a low of .15 in the case of ABN.12 Among the dichotomous variables, obesity

is the most persistent obese children have approximately 50 percentage point

higher probabilities of being obese adolescents than do non—obese children.

        The cross—lagged effects, however, appearing off the diagonal

in Table 2, are    the   primary focus of this paper. From these

coefficients, it appears that causality runs more strongly from cognitive de-

velopment to health than vice versa. When the two cognitive development

measures are the dependent variables, only two of      the six health measures
(ABN1 and HDBP1) have significant impacts on      WISC2: and none have significant
impacts   on WRAT2 (the latter statement holds whether the statistical test is

done on each health variable separately or on the set of six). In the two

cases   where there is a significant imnact, the effect is as expected, with

poorer health being associated with lower values of WISC2. When the health
                                        U —



measures are the dependent variables, one or both of the cognitive develoi,ment

measures have significant impacts for four of the six health measure: APERT2,

ABN2, SCIIABS2, and PFGHEALTH2 (these results hold whether the statistical

test is done on WISC1 and WRAT1 separately or together). In all four cases,

higher levels of WISC1 or WRAT1 are associate,d with better health. To conclude,

while these off—diagonal elements affirm a two—way     relationship   between health

and    cognitive development, the link from cognitive develomnent to health appears
to be the stronger one.
       Several other interesting relationships   are evident in Table 2.   There is
evidence     of mutual feedbacks between 10 and achievement: childhood achievement

has a significant impact on adolescent IQ even when childhood IQ is held con-

stant; and childhood IQ has a significant impact on adolescent achievement

when childhood achievement is held constant. There are also dependencies

between some of the health measures: obesity In childhood is related to poorer

oral   health and   high blood pressure in adolesence,13 and a parental rating of

health in childhood as noor, fair, or good (as opposed to very good) is asso-

ciated with excessive school absence due to illness in adolescence. Finally,

there is one seemingly "perverse" and statistically significant relationship

in the table: high blood pressure in childhood is associated with better oral

health in adolescence.


B. Family Background Effects

       A   secondary objective of this paper is to obtain better estimates of the
Impacts of environmental factors on health and cognitive development. The
three environmental measures we focus on are mother's schooling (MEDUCAT),
father's schooling (FEDUCAT), and family income (FINC).
       Coefficients of these three variables in the adolescent health and cog-
nitive development functions are shown in Table 3. To types of estimates are
reported. Those in the first three columns, labeled cross—sectional coefficients,

are    taken from multiple regressions that control for all of the family and

youth    characteristics listed in Appendix Table 1 but exclude all lagged
(childhood) cognitive development and health measures. The estimates in
the last      three columns, labeled "dynamic" coefficients, are taken from

multiple regressions that include all lagged cognitive development and health

measures in addition to the family and youth charaéteristics. The first set

of estimates shows background effects as typically comnuted in a cross—section.

The second set shows background effects estimated in a dynamic context which

controls for initial levels of cognitive develonment and health. As we               argued
in    Section 1, the "dynamic" estimates are free of genetic bias if genetic

effects are fully embodied in the early health and cognitive development

measures)4 Under this assumj,tion, then, the "dynamic" coefficients represent

the pure contribution of the home environment           to cognitive develonment and
health outcomes in the interval between Cycles II and III.
        Let   us consider   first the impacts of the    three family background variables

on cognitive development. In the cross—section estimates, all six family back-

ground    coefficients are positive and statistically significant, and they tend
to remain significant when the lagged variables are included. The magnitudes
of the "dynamic" family background effects           are, however, much smaller than the

magnitudes of the cross—sectional effects. To be nrecise, the            ratios of
"dynamic" coefficients to the corresponding cross—sectional coefficients
range   from .15   in the case of mother's schooling in the WISC2 equation to
.47   in the case of family income in the same equation.

       In the case of adolescent health, the difference between cross—section

and dynamic family background estimates is less dramatic. First, fewer of

the cross—section estimates themselves show significant impacts: only mother's

educational attainment is a consistently important          variable   (excent when ABN2
                                       — 20 —




is    the dependent variable). Father's educational attainment has significant

positive health impacts for the periodontal index and the subjective health

rating, and family income is significant in determining only the subjective

health rating. All of the statistically significant background effects are

reduced in absolute value when childhood health and cognitive develomnent

are included in the equations. The ratios of the "dynamic" coefficients

to the corresponding cross—sectional coefficients range from .14 in the case

of, family income in the PFCHEALTH2 equation to .80 in the case of mother's

schooling in the SCHABS2 equation. Moreover, there are only three statistically

significant dynamic coefficients: those belonging to mother's schooling in

the APERI2, PFGHEALTH2, and SC}iABS2 equations.

       A clear message in Table 3 is that the "dynamic" estimates of family back-

ground effects on cognitive development and health are much smaller than the

corresponding cross—sectional estimates. The important point here, however,

is   not that the "dynamic" estimates of background effects are smaller than
the cross—sectional estimates. This decline was to be expected if our proce-
dure does in fact remove much of the genetic effects otherwise embodied in
the   family background variables.15    Rather, it is   the fact that after removing

the genetic component from the family background variables, family background,

and especially mother's education, remains an important determinant of cogni-

tive develonment and of some aspects of health. This finding is strong evi—

dence that the   family   environment nlavs n irnportnrit role   in t'e   nverili cia—

velopment of idn1scents.

       An interesting sidelight to the discussion o fnmilv background effects

is found in a comparison of the results for cognitive development versus

health. First, regardless of which set of estimates are used, family back-

ground variables as a group are less likely to have significant impacts on

adolescent health than on adolescent cognitive development. Second, according
                                      — 21   —




to the "dynamic" estimates, either one year Of additional educational attain-
ment for either parent or one thousand additional. dollars of family income
are associated with roughly the same increase in WISC2 or WRAT2. For the
health measures, however, the "dynamic" estimates show that mother's educa-
tional    attainment tends to have a larger impact than the other variables,

and it    is frequently the only background variable to be statistically signi-
ficant.    Taken together, these points suggest that' there is more "home produc-

tion"   of health than of cognitive development——at least in the period between
childhood and adolescence.

                           IV. Summary   and Implications

      Our exploration of the dynamic relationship    between health and cognitive
development    in adolescence has generated two important results. first, there, is

'feedback both from health to cognitive develonment and from cognitive develop-

ment to health, but the latter of these relationships, is stronger. Second,

estimates of family background effects taken from the dynamic model——which can

be   assumed to be less influenced by genetic factors——are smaller than their

cross—sectional'    counterparts, but some still remain statistically significant.
      The first finding calls attention to the existence of a continuing inter-
action between    health and cognitive development over the life cycle. Since

an individual's cognitive development (measured by IQ or achievement tests)

is an important determinant of the number of years of formal schooling that

he   ultimately   completes (see Grossman 1975), our findings may be viewed   as
the early forerunner    of the positive impact of schooling on   good health f'or

adults in the United States reported by Grossman (1975), Shakotko (1977),

and others.
                                           — 22 —




       The second finding suggests that nurture "matters" in cognitive develop-

ment   and health    outcomes.   All three background variables are important con-
tributors to      cognitive development, hut mother's schooling is singled out as

the    crucial component of the home environment in adolescent health outcomes.
This is an especially strong result because in the words of Keriiston and the
Carnegie Council on Children: "Doctors do not nrovide the bulk of health care
for children; families do        (1977,   P. 179)." Since the mother spends more   time

in household production than the father, her characteristics should be the
dominant factor in outcomes that are determined toa large extent in the home.
The importance of mother's schooling in obesity and oral health is notable be-
cause these are outcomes that are neither irreversible or self—limiting. In-
stead, they can be modified by inputs of dental care, medical care, proper
diet, and parents' time.
       The two findings interact with each other. Cognitive development in
childhood has a positive effect on health in adolescence, and cognitive de-
velopment in childhood is positively related to narents' schooling and family
income.    Both   findings imply that the health of adults is heavily denendent
upon their home environment as youths. They also imply that oublic policies
aimed at children's and adolescents' health must try to offset the problems

encountered   by offspring of mothers with low levels        schooling. In particu-
                                                            of

lar, they should try to     improve   the skills of uneducated mothers in their
capacity   as the main provider of health care for their offspring.

 tion, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and       the   National Center for Health

 Services Research (PHS Grant No. 1 ROl HS02917) to the National Bureau of

 Economic Research. We      are indebted to Ant   Colle for research assistance

 and to Anthony Cassese and Lee Lillard for their comments on an earlier draft.

 This is   a revision of a paper presented     at the fifty—fourth annual conference
 of the Western Economic     Association, Las Vegas, Nevada, June 1979.

      'This   is a reduced form equation derived by solving a system of equations
 that include a   family   utility function (with the health and cognitive develop-

 ment of each child in each neriódas arguments), a children's health
                                                                               production
 function,   a production function for children's cognitive development, and a
wealth constraint. Note that at any point in time, t, both                 and
                                                                                 x,_1 are
predetermined variables.

           detailed discussion of the tyoes of variables included in             can be
                                                                          x1
found in Edwards and Grossman(1979 and 1980).

     3One technique that has been used in cross—sectional analysis is to in-
clude indicators of the unobserved variable. These indicators, which are not
themselvespart of ttie original cross—section specification, are taken to
be instruments for the unobserved variable. An example is the inclusion of
test scores as a proxy for ability in earnings equations. Investigators
generally acknowledge that this is a second—best nrocedure because         it intro-

duces an errors—in—variables bias which may be nearly as large as the original
omitted—variables bias [Grilicheg (1974)].

     4See Shakotko (1979) for an alternative model formulated in the spirit
of the ability—bias oroblem as described, for exarmie, by Griliches (1977).
                                   F.- 2


While relaxing the restrictive assumption in the present paper regarding

genetic embodiment, Shakotko requires an alternative set of restrictions in

order to identify and estimate a factor structure.

     5Since H1 is correlated with the error term in equation (2c), the co-

efficient of    in this equation is biased unless the partial correlation

between    and Hi with E held constant is zero. This is extremely unlikely

because GQ and Gil are bound to be related, probably, in a positive manner.

The same comment applies to the coefficient of H1 in equation (3c). Note

that if the partial correlation between E and H1 or between E and Q1 is non-

zero, ordinary least squares of the reduced form environmental parameters,

given by the coefficients of E in (2c) or (3c), are biased.

     6We did not, however, exclude observations from the analysis if data

were missing for the school absenteeism variables (SCHABS1, SCHABS2) and

birth weight variables (LIGHTA, LIGHTB). (These variables are described

in Section 11—C below). Information on school absente'eismis taken from

the school form completed by the child's school. This form is missing for

roughly 7 percent of the sample. Since excessive absence due to illness

is the only variable taken from this form, a dummy variable that identifies

youths with missing Cycle II school forms (SCHABSUK1) is included in

all regression equations as an independent variable. Youths without a Cycle

III school form are eliminated from the empirical analysis only when SCFTABS2

is the dependent variable. Birth weight is taken from the child's birth cer-

tificate, which is missing for 14 percent of the sample. Since birth weight

is the only variable taken from the birth certificate, we do not delete these

observations, but rather we include a dummy variable that identifies youths

with missing birth certificates(BWUK) in the regression equations.

        7Although these and other test scores have been widelv criticized, they
are used here and elsewhere because they are so readily obtainable and be-
cause they roughly comnarable across diverse populations. TISC and TPAT
are adlusted for sex as well as for age in sone studies, but the variables
used here are not sex—adlusted.
        8
        Kelly   and Sanchez (1972, pp. 1—2) describe the neriodontal index as

follows:

              Every tooth in the mouth ... is scored according to the
              presence or absence of manifest signs of neriodontal
              disease. When a portion of the free gingiva is inflamed,
              a score of 1 is recorded. Then comnietely circumscribed
              by inflammation, teeth are scored 2. Teeth with frank
              periodontal nockets are scored 6 when their masticatory
              function is unimpaired and 8 when it is impaired. The
              arithmetic average of all scores is the individual's
              [periodontal index], which ranges from a low of 0.0
              (no inflammation or periodontal pockets] to a high of
              8.0 (all teeth with pockets and impaired function).


   -   9The   choice of appropriate measures of health in childhood   and adoles-

cence    is discussed in detail in Edwards and Grossman (1979, 1980, and forth-
coming).

       10The periodontal index and the two cognitive development measures are
continuous variables. In these cases we have experimented with the raw
score as the dependent variable in a     multiple regression that includes

in the set of explanatory variables age in Cycle II, the square of age,

the time interval between the Cycle II and III examinations, the square of the

interval, the product of age and the interval, and a dummy variable for male ado—

lescents.       The results obtained (not shown) with resnect to family background,

lagged health, and lagged cognitive development effects are similar to those

reported in Section III.

       11Statements concerning statistical significance in the text refer to
the 5 percent level in a one—tailed test except when the direction of the
effect is unclear on a priori grounds or when the estimated effect has the
"wrong sign.'t In the latter cases two—tailed tests are used.
       121f the dynamic      i,rocesses that we study   have the same structures over
time and if cross—lagged effects are ignored, they all have stable long—run
solutions. To be snecific, if H =
                                          a}{i + bE,     the long—run solution, obtained

                  =
by setting            Htl,   is H = (b/l—a) E. This is a stable solution when a is

positive and smaller than one.


       13This    finding is consistent with cross—sectional results reported by the
1977   National Heart, Lung, and      Blood Institute's Task Force. The Task Force

points out      that obesity is a risk factor in the incidence of high blood pressure
in   adolescents.


       Some evidence supporting the validity of this assumption anpears in

Appendix Tables A2 through A9. In particular,            the coefficients of birth
weight,   mother's age at the birth of the youth, and parental assessment of

the youth's health in the first year of his life are almost never statistically

significant. These variables are roxv measures of the genetic endowment. If

they had had large significant impacts in the dynamic equations, this would

have thrown into question the validity of our assumntion.


       15Even if the family background variables had no genetic comnonents, we

would still expect the "dynamic" coefficients to be smaller than the cross—

sectional coefficients because the "dynamic"        estimates represent short—run
effects   in the sense that they hold constant the 1agced values of health

and cognitive develom,ment. Since these lagged values themselves depend on

family background, the cumulative or long—run imnacts of family background
                                        F-5
are likely to exceed the "dynamic't or short—run impacts. To be precise, if
cross—lagged    effects are ignored, a full representation of the dymamic

health process that we study is (ignoring         stochastic   terms):
                =   ciGH   + b1E, and
                =
                    a   Ht_1 + btE, t=2,..., n.

Solving recursively, one obtains

The   parameter of E in      the above equation is the cumulative environmental

effect.    If the b all have the same sign, the long—run parameter unam-

biguously exceeds bt in absolute value. Of course,         the long—run i,arameter

estimate may be larger or smaller than the cross—sectional estimate if GH

is omitted from the equation.
