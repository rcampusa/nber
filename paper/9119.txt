                                             ABSTRACT

        This study compares the impact of OSHA inspections on manufacturing industries using data
from three time periods: 1979-85, 1987-91, and 1992-98. We find substantial declines in the impact of
OSHA inspections since 1979-85. In the earliest period we estimate that having an OSHA inspection that
imposed a penalty reduces injuries by about 15%; in the later periods it falls to 8% in 1987-91 and to 1%
(and statistically insignificant) in 1992-98. Testing for different effects by inspection type, employment
size, and industry, we find differences across size classes, but these cannot explain the overall decline.
In fact, we find reductions in OSHA’s impact over time for nearly all subgroups we examine, so shifts
across subgroups cannot explain the whole decline. We examine various other hypotheses concerning
the declining impact, but in the end we are not able to provide a clear explanation for the decline.

1.Introduction

       Congress established the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in

1970 to prevent occupational injuries and illnesses, and there has been considerable debate

since then over the effectiveness of the program. OSHA does tens of thousands of

inspections, and imposes millions of dollars in penalties each year, but most workplaces are

only rarely visited, penalties are low relative to the cost of abating many workplace hazards,

and many injuries are unrelated to OSHA standards.

       Many empirical studies examining OSHA have found little evidence of an impact on

injuries (e.g. Smith (1979), Viscusi (1979, 1986), McCaffrey (1983), Bartel and Thomas

(1985), Ruser and Smith (1991)). By contrast, a series of studies by Scholz and Gray found

significant impacts, using a large plant-level database for the 1979-85 period. Depending on

the analytical technique used, having an OSHA inspection which imposed a penalty was

associated with a 15-22% decline in injuries over a three year period (Scholz and Gray

(1990), Gray and Scholz (1993)).

       The present study extends these analyses to more recent years. To the 1979-85

dataset used by Scholz and Gray we add a 1987-91 dataset created earlier by one of the

authors (Gray (1996)), and a final 1992-98 data set created for this study. Although there

are some differences in sample composition across the three data sets, we use the same

variables and analyses for all three data sets to make the results as comparable as possible.

       We find that the average impact of OSHA inspections on changes in injury rates has

declined substantially over time, especially in the most recent data set, where the overall

impact is no longer statistically significant. Using our basic model, the point estimate of the

impact of an OSHA penalty inspection declines from 15% in the early 1980s to 8% in the




                                             1
late 1980s and about 1% in the 1990s. Models which include all OSHA inspections (with

and without penalties) show smaller impacts, but these impacts also decline across the three

periods.

       We looked for different impacts across various subgroups: inspection types,

establishment sizes, and industries. We do observe smaller impacts in the largest

establishments. However, we observe declines over time in the impact of OSHA

inspections on injuries within nearly all subgroups we examine, although the declines occur

to different degrees and at different times. The paper also examines a variety of possible

explanations for the decline in impact, but we aren’t able to provide a clear explanation for

the decline.

       The following section of the paper provides some background on the determinants of

occupational injuries and OSHA’s activity. Section 3 discusses the data and some

econometric issues affecting the analysis. Section 4 presents the results, and Section 5

summarizes the findings.



2. Background and Theory



       Figure 1 shows the injury rate per 100 full-time manufacturing workers from 1972 to

1999. The numbers are based on reporting to the annual Survey of Occupational Injuries

and Illnesses, conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The “lost workday case

rate” is divided into two categories: cases with days away from work and cases with only

restricted work activity. The rate for all lost workday cases changed relatively little from

1972 until the early 1990s, except for the expected cyclical changes. Injury rates typically




                                             2
fall in recessions and increase in booms, primarily because of the changes in the number of

newly hired, inexperienced workers (Robinson (1988)). However, in the 1990s the

manufacturing injury rate dropped by about 25% despite continuous prosperity during those

years. We also see in Figure 1 that the rate of injuries with restricted work activity rose

substantially after the mid-1980s while the rate for cases with days away from work

accounted for the decline in the 1990s (we return to this issue later).

       OSHA may affect injuries through several possible mechanisms (Mendeloff (1979)).

The agency enforces a set of safety and health standards and may create new standards. It

also provides information to employers and employees, both directly through consultations

and training activities and through the provision of educational materials. Most of OSHA’s

resources are devoted to its enforcement program. Inspections, backed up by the threat of

penalties for non-compliance, may push employers to comply with standards or even to

improve their overall safety programs. The threat of inspection may also generate

compliance actions in order to avoid expected penalties. Even though most workplaces are

inspected infrequently, especially in industries with low injury rates, the ability of workers

to request OSHA inspections enhances their potential deterrent effect.

       Equation (1) below summarizes a variety of factors that may influence the riskiness

of working at plant i in year t (RISKit). We begin with the inherent hazardousness of the

plant which may change over time (HAZARDit), the average experience or inexperience of

the plant’s workforce (EXPERit), and the degree of worker fatigue (FATIGUEit). In

addition we have three factors affecting the attention paid by the plant to safety issues. The

degree of general deterrence achieved by OSHA inspections at other plants in the same area

and industry (GENit) depends on both the expected probability of being inspected and the




                                              3
expected penalty for a violation (with penalty and probability getting equal weight if the

firm is risk-neutral). There may be a separate impact of current or past inspections

happening at this specific plant (INSPit-s), either because having an inspection leads the plant

to revise its expectations on the probability of future inspections or because OSHA follows

up some inspections to ensure that hazards are corrected, with the possibility of much higher

‘failure to abate’ penalties. ATTENit includes any other factors such as plant unionization

or workers compensation costs which could affect attention to safety.



(1)    RISKit = f(HAZARDit, EXPERit, FATIGUEit, GENit, INSPit-s, ATTENit).



       The actual number of injuries occurring in a workplace in a given year will depend

strongly on the underlying riskiness, along with some random error term. These errors may

be greater (in percentage terms) in smaller workplaces. To the extent that unusually high

injuries at time t-1 leads to increased attention to safety issues at time t, we would expect

some degree of negative autocorrelation in the unobserved random element of injuries.



3. Data and Econometric Issues


       The basic sample universe for the data sets has remained unchanged from the

original Scholz and Gray data set: establishments that are in manufacturing industries and

are located in states where OSHA has primary enforcement responsibility (the 29 “Federal-

OSHA” states, which include about 60% of the national work force). Manufacturing

workplaces have long been a focus of OSHA activity and are longer-lived and better-defined

than workplaces in other sectors (such as construction). This is important, since we allow



                                              4
OSHA inspections to affect injuries over several years. Information on injuries at the

establishments is merged with characteristics of OSHA inspections at those establishments

to create the analysis data sets.

         Our injury data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Survey of

Occupational Injuries and Illnesses which gathers data for hundreds of thousands of

establishments each year in a stratified sampling process that results in larger establishments

being more likely to be in the sample. Since we look at changes in an establishment’s

injuries over time we focus on those establishments that have BLS injury data for

consecutive years. This necessarily results in large establishments being over-represented in

our data sets, relative to all manufacturing establishments. We use the total number of lost-

workday injuries during the year as our injury measure. Earlier work with the first two data

sets also examined a measure of the seriousness of the injuries, the total number of days of

work lost due to injuries at the plant; but that information is not present in the revised

version of the BLS Survey which was begun in 1992.

         The BLS data is combined with information on OSHA inspections from OSHA’s

Integrated Management Information System (IMIS). Our key measure of inspection activity

(in addition to the year of the inspection) is whether or not a penalty was imposed.1 We

consider only two types of inspections: programmed inspections, targeted by OSHA based

on industry hazardousness, and complaint inspections, where OSHA is responding to a

written worker complaint. These two types account for over 80% of all inspections during

the time period studied.2 For almost all of the period examined in this paper, OSHA

targeted its programmed inspections by first identifying all establishments that were in 4-

1
 As reported in Scholz and Gray (1990), having a serious violation cited during the inspection is essentially
equivalent to having a penalty (95-99% overlap in our data).



                                                     5
digit SICs with rates above a state’s manufacturing average (Siskind (1993)). Then, it chose

inspection sites randomly within this set, excluding only those workplaces with fewer than

11 workers or those where OSHA had conducted a comprehensive inspection within the

previous 2 years. Complaint inspections were initiated by a written (formal) or oral

(informal) notice from a worker (or a union representative) about an alleged violation or

hazard at a workplace

           The OSHA and BLS records were linked together, using name and address

information to identify records that referred to the same establishment in a technique

developed by Fellegi and Sunter (1969) that calculates the probabilities of two records

matching, based on agreement or disagreement on their characteristics. The matching

methodology is explained in more detail in Gray (1996).

           Since our analysis focuses on injury changes, two consecutive years of BLS data are

needed to generate one observation for analysis. Table 1 describes some features of the 3

data sets. The original Scholz and Gray data set was restricted to those manufacturing

establishments which had BLS injury data available for all 7 of the years from 1979 and

1985, but a broader definition was needed in the later samples due to substantial cuts in the

BLS Survey sample size later in the 1980s. The 1987-91 dataset included all plants with at

least 2 consecutive years of BLS Survey data; the 1992-98 dataset includes all plants with at

least 3 consecutive years. If we had instead insisted on 7 years of BLS Survey data in 1992-

98, the size distribution would have been seriously skewed: of the 860 establishments with

7 years of data, only 21 had fewer than 100 employees and only 60 had fewer than 250.

This would have precluded any analysis of OSHA’s impact in those smaller size groups

which receive the majority of OSHA inspections.

       The basic model estimated by Scholz and Gray took the following form:

   (2) DINJi t = at + b0INSPi t + b1INSPi t-1 + b2INSPi t-2 + b3INSPi t-3 +

                        c1DEMPit + c2DHRSit + SIC2i + uit



The dependent variable (DINJ) is the log of the change in the number of injuries, so the

coefficients show the impact on the percentage change in injuries. Gray and Scholz (1993)

report extensive tests with alternative specifications. Since OSHA targets inspections at

high-injury-rate establishments, regressions of injury levels on inspections show a positive

(endogenous) relationship. They find that using injury changes greatly reduces the

endogeneity problem, and we follow this specification.

       Our focus is on the specific deterrence impact of OSHA inspections at this particular

plant. This impact is captured with four inspection dummies (from INSPit to INSPit-3), so

the 1983-84 change in injuries depends on four years of inspections (from 1981 to 1984).

An alternative OSHA measure, IPEN, refers to inspections which imposed a penalty

(following Scholz and Gray (1990)). In some models we allow for different impacts for

different inspection types, IPRG and ICMP for any programmed and complaint inspections,

and IPRGP and ICMPP for programmed and complaint inspections imposing penalties.

       Relating the other explanatory factors to those in Equation (1), we use changes in

employment (DEMPit) to measure changes in the experience of the workforce and changes

in hours (DHRSit) to measure changes in worker fatigue. To the extent that innate

hazardousness is fixed at a workplace, it will be differenced out of the model in change

form. Trends in industry hazardousness or changes in general deterrence are measured by

industry dummies (SIC2i). In some of our analyses we allow for differences in the impacts

of OSHA inspections for establishments in different employment size categories (1-99, 100-

249, 250-499, and 500+). When we do so, we include three employment size dummies in

the regressions.

        In some models we estimate different impacts of OSHA inspections for each 2-digit

SIC industry in each period. We then compare the estimated impacts with three different

industry-specific factors. First is the extent of general deterrence, measured by the number

of OSHA inspections per 1000 production workers in the federal OSHA states.3 Second is

the industry hazardousness, measured by the industry lost workday injury rate (taken from

the BLS web site, www.bls.gov). Third is the industry’s new capital investment divided by

its existing capital stock, since newer machinery is expected to be safer.4

        One issue that arises when comparing the results here with the published results of

the earlier studies is the choice of estimation method. All of the results presented here are

based on ordinary least squares regressions. Earlier studies (such as Scholz and Gray

(1990)) allowed for autoregressive errors, recognizing the possibility that shocks to injuries

in one year might increase attention to safety, generating negative autocorrelation or

regression to the mean in the injury generating process. We experimented with estimating

an autoregressive model with the newest data set, and found that while the autoregressive

terms were estimated to be significant, the results for the inspection variables were

essentially unchanged from those reported here (results available on request).

       More importantly, some of the earlier analyses of data from 1979-85 and 1987-91

used a ‘Chamberlain’ model (Chamberlain (1982, 1984)), which allows for the possibility

that inspection targeting leads the set of plants selected for inspections to include more

plants with poor performance in terms of injury growth (Gray and Scholz (1993), Gray

(1996)). Correcting for this selection effect results in a greater (negative) impact of

inspections on injury growth, with the model concluding that the inspected plants would

have done even worse if they had not been inspected. In the earlier research, using the

Chamberlain method increased the estimated impact of an inspection with penalty in the

1979-1985 period by 7%, from 15% to 22%. Using the 1987-1991 period the comparable

impact also rose by 7%, from 8% to 15%.

       Preliminary estimates of the Chamberlain model for the most recent period suggest a

similar impact (the reduction in injuries after a penalty inspection increases in magnitude

from about 1% using ordinary regression to about 7% using the Chamberlain model). Thus

the comparison across time periods gives a similar conclusion to the ordinary regression

results presented here, with a substantial reduction in the impact of an inspection with

penalty between Period 1 and Period 3. We concentrate on ordinary regression results in

this paper primarily because the Chamberlain estimation method requires complete injury

data, and hence can only be calculated for a small and unrepresentative minority of the

plants in the 1992-1998 period (860 plants, nearly all of them in the larger size categories,

with more than 250 employees).

4. Results

       Table 1 presents the means of the variables in the three data sets. There is a decline

in injuries over time (negative DINJ) within each of the three data sets. However, this does

not mean that rates declined continuously from Period 1 to Period 3. Each period happens

to begin when rates were fairly high and end when they were lower. The establishment size

distribution differs somewhat between the three data sets, based on changes in the BLS

Survey coverage and the number of years of injury data required for inclusion. The period 2

data set contains more small plants, since it only required two consecutive years of injury

data; the latest data set contains a higher proportion of large plants, due to the steady

shrinkage in the BLS Survey sample size.

       Table 1 also reveals some substantial changes in OSHA inspection activity across

the three data sets. In the earliest data set there were relatively high rates of inspections

(INSP), especially programmed inspections (IPRG). These inspections commonly failed to

impose penalties; only about one-third of all years with inspections had any inspections that

imposed penalties (IPEN), but in the later two periods this ratio was reversed. This pattern

can be explained by the existence of “records-check” inspections during the early 1980s;

these inspections began with a check of the plant’s injury rate records and stopped there if

the plant’s injury rate was below the average rate for manufacturing (Siskind (1993)). This

led to a large set of programmed inspections that did not impose a penalty (and did not

perform a ‘real’ inspection of the workplace).

       There was also some variation in the composition of inspections across the periods.

Because of the prevalence of programmed inspections (IPRG) in the first period, they

greatly outnumbered complaint (ICMP) inspections (.19 to .06). In the later periods the




                                              10
probability of a complaint inspection rose slightly (to .07), while the probability of a

programmed inspection fell dramatically (to .03). There was also an increase in the fraction

of complaint inspections which imposed penalties (ICMPP) over time, though not as

dramatic as the increase noted above for programmed inspections (IPRGP).

       Table 2 shows the basic regressions of injury changes on inspections and inspections

with penalty. The first column presents results from the original Scholz and Gray data set

from 1979-85. The second and third columns present results from the 1987-91 and 1992-98

data sets. As expected, growth in employment and hours worked increases the number of

injuries. Perhaps due to the ‘random’ nature of workplace accidents, the models only

explain about 12% of the variance in injury changes across plants in the earlier two periods,

declining to about 9% in the latest period.

       As found in the Scholz and Gray analysis, inspections with penalties have a larger

impact than other inspections (comparing IPEN with INSP). The main result in Table 2 is

that both IPEN and INSP coefficients became smaller in each succeeding period. Adding

up the cumulative IPEN effect in each period, it declines from 15.7% to 9.4%, then to 1.4%,

with the last period’s impact not statistically significant. We also combined data from all 3

periods in order to formally compare the IPEN coefficients across periods. The results (not

shown) confirm that the Period 3 results are significantly different from those in Period 1.

       In Table 3 we see the impact of combining the four years of OSHA inspections into

a single variable. IPENX shows the average impact of an inspection over a four year period,

so the cumulative impact is falling from 19.2% to 12.0% to 1.2% across the three periods.

Comparable regressions for each period including both IPENX and inspections with no

penalty (NOPENX) always found insignificant coefficients on NOPENX (results available).




                                              11
        The initial regression results presented in Tables 2 and 3 provide evidence of a

substantial decline in the measured impact of OSHA inspections on manufacturing

industries. We now consider different categories of inspections and establishments to see

how widespread the decline is. Looking at inspection type, Scholz and Gray (1997) found

that both complaint and programmed inspections affected injuries, but that complaint

inspections were less dependent on penalties for their impact. Table 4 shows the impact of

complaint and programmed inspections on injuries in each of the periods, confirming that

programmed inspections are more dependent on penalties for their impact. The impact of

complaint inspections with penalties declines more in the 1980s, while the impact of

programmed inspections with penalties declines more in the 1990s. However, these

differences between the inspection types were not statistically significant.

        Next we allow the impact of OSHA inspections to differ depending on

characteristics of the establishment. Table 5 examines the effects of inspections with

penalties in 4 different establishment employment size categories: small, under 100;

medium, 100-249; big, 250-499; and very big, over 500. We find much weaker preventive

effects of inspections in the largest establishments compared to the smaller establishments

(similar to results reported in Gray and Scholz (1991)). As expected, the model does a

better job of explaining the variation in number of injuries for larger workplaces. More

importantly we have declines in the estimated impact across the periods for nearly all cases,

and always smaller impacts in Period 3 than in Period 1. The timing of the decline varies

across size classes, but the decline is statistically significant for all but the medium plants.

        Next we allowed for different OSHA impacts across different industries, shown in

Table 6. Examining the model for all 3 periods together, we added interaction terms




                                              12
between IPENX and two-digit SIC manufacturing industry dummies. Each interaction term

provides an estimate of the effect at an establishment in that industry of having at least 1

inspection with penalty over a four year period. There are a few significant industry

coefficients, but there is no industry where the effect of inspections with penalties is

significant in more than one period. Not surprisingly, there is no significant correlation

across industries in their coefficients for different periods.

        Table 7 tests whether these industry-period coefficients are correlated with three

factors that might affect OSHA’s impact: the average lost workday injury rate in the

industry (bigger effects if there are more injuries per worker to prevent), the average

inspection rate in the industry (smaller effects when firms are expecting OSHA inspections),

and the average investment rate in the industry (smaller effects where there is newer, safer

machinery). These correlations are relatively small, and only two approach significance.

For industry coefficients based on all workplaces, higher investment rates were weakly

linked to smaller inspection impacts. Looking at workplaces with fewer than 250 workers

(where the effects were relatively larger in the last period), the link with investment rates

disappears but a weak negative relationship appears with the industry inspection rate.

        Finally, we consider the possibility that OSHA inspections have different impacts on

different types of injuries. Table 8 shows the results for our basic model, separated into

cases with days away from work (DAW) and cases with only restricted work activity

(RWA). One clear finding is that, even in Period 1, all of the impact of inspections with

penalties was on DAW injuries. There was no impact on RWA injuries. In Period 2, there

is even some indication that inspections were linked to increases in RWA injuries, but this

disappears in Period 3.

5. Discussion and Conclusions


        The initial regression results presented in Tables 2 and 3 provide evidence of a

substantial decline between 1979 and 1998 in the measured impact of OSHA inspections on

manufacturing industries: from a 15% reduction over the three years after an inspection with

penalty in Period 1, to a 1% reduction in Period 3. In this section we consider several

possible explanations for the decline, based on changes in OSHA policy and injury reporting

during this time, and relate them to our statistical results.

        One explanation for the decline could be a composition effect, with the data for

Period 3 inspections containing more observations where OSHA’s impact is small. Table 5

does show a smaller impact for large plants, which are more common in our data for Period

3 than they were in Period 1. This turns out to be offset by shifts in other groups, so the

predicted average impact is actually higher in Period 3.5 More importantly, the results for

all subgroups of the data show that the decline in OSHA’s impact is wide-spread, affecting

different inspection types, plant sizes, and industries, so it is unlikely that any composition

effects could tell the whole story.

        Other explanations for the decline could arise from measurement issues. During

most of Period 1 (1981-86) OSHA inspectors on programmed inspections followed a

“records- check” procedure: first checking a workplace’s lost workday injury and illness

rate, and terminating the inspection if the rate was below the manufacturing average. Such

“records-only” inspections never imposed penalties, so firms wishing to avoid OSHA


5
  The predicted impact was obtained by multiplying the Period 1 coefficients for each size group in Table 5 by
that group’s share of plants in each of the periods from Table 1.



                                                    14
inspections had an incentive to under-report injuries. Ruser and Smith (1988, 1991) found

evidence that lost workday rates fell for some plants subject to these inspections, but only

for uninspected establishments. This would lead our results to understate (not overstate) the

impact of inspections on injuries in the earlier period.

       Injury reporting might also have been affected by OSHA’s “egregious case” policy,

which started levying extremely large and highly publicized fines for recordkeeping

violations in 1986; if underreporting declined more at inspected establishments than

uninspected ones this would translate into a smaller observed OSHA impact. Still, this

seems unlikely to have played a large role in the observed decline, since it would explain

only the Period 2 changes, not the continuing decline in Period 3.

       Another reason why OSHA’s records-check policy might affect our cross-period

comparison is that plants with penalty inspections would include a disproportionate number

with unusually high pre-inspection injury rates (since they weren’t records-only). These

high rates might then be expected to decline in the years following the inspection (a

phenomenon known as “regression to the mean”). Scholz and Gray (1990) account for this

using a model with autoregressive errors and find that there was evidence of negative

autoregression (consistent with regression to the mean), but that the estimated OSHA

impacts were not affected. As noted earlier, we also examined autoregressive models and

found they didn’t affect our results. Even if regression to the mean led us to overstate our

Period 1 results, that should have led the decline in OSHA’s impact in later periods to be

concentrated in the results for programmed inspections, and to happen by Period 2. Table 4

shows a greater decline in the 1980s for complaint inspections with penalty, which were not




                                             15
subject to the records-check policy; the decline in impact for programmed inspections

doesn’t come until the 1990s, well after the records-check policy was being discontinued.

       A final reporting issue arises due to the steady growth since the mid-1980s in the

percentage of lost workday injuries that are classified as “restricted work activity” cases

rather than as cases with “days away from work.” As Figure 1 showed, the rate of RWA

cases grew very slowly until the mid 1980s, then almost doubled in the 2 years from 1986 to

1988 and continued growing at over 10% per year until 1995. Thus by 1996 about ½ of all

lost workday cases in manufacturing did not involve days away from work. We saw in

Table 8 that in every period, even 1979-85, OSHA inspections with penalties had no

preventive impact on the percentage change in the number of RWA injuries. Based on an

assumption of zero impact on RWA cases, over one-third of the drop in OSHA’s impact

could be accounted for by the growth of RWA cases. Of course, this is an explanation only

in an accounting sense; it provides no causal insights about why RWA cases have not been

affected. Indeed, since the growth in RWA cases in the more recent periods presumably

comes from cases that formerly would have been DAW cases, it is a puzzle why they are not

affected similarly by OSHA inspections.

       We now turn to explanations for the decline in OSHA’s impact that do not rely on

reporting changes or mismeasurement issues. A large increase in general deterrence could

in theory weaken the impact of specific deterrence that we measure, but the evidence in

Table 7 goes the other way: higher industry inspection rates are associated with more

negative (larger) inspection-specific impacts. This reversed sign (if believable) could

explain a small part of the decline in impact by the 1990s, when the number of inspections

fell by more than one-third and total penalties fell as well.




                                             16
       Another possible explanation is declining marginal effectiveness of repeated

inspections at the same workplace. Evidence for this has been found in past research (Weil

(2001), Gray and Jones (1991)). Since larger establishments are inspected more frequently,

the greater erosion in effectiveness that we find in the largest size group from Period 1 to

Period 2 and then in the next largest from Period 2 to Period 3 is consistent with declining

marginal effectiveness. The problem with this explanation is that OSHA had been

conducting inspections for nearly a decade before our Period 1, and the declining impact of

repeated inspections is most pronounced in the first few inspections, so most of the decline

in impact at large, frequently inspected plants should have already occurred by the start of

our data in 1979.

       A somewhat different explanation for declining effectiveness of inspections could be

that the standards that OSHA enforces have become less relevant to injury prevention over

time. Most of these standards date from the 1960s or earlier. Changes in manufacturing

technologies may have left many of the standards outdated or irrelevant. As a result, we

could find either that fewer violations are being detected or that inspections are relevant to a

shrinking percentage of injuries. The number of violations cited per manufacturing

inspection was substantially lower in the first period (2.4) than in the latter two periods (5.2

and 4.7), contradicting the first of these predictions. The second is harder to assess. The

results in Table 7 on investment rates provide a bit of support, since high-investment

industries (with newer, safer equipment) show a smaller impact from OSHA inspections, but

the effect disappears for those establishments with fewer than 250 workers (the only size

group with substantial effects in the last period).




                                             17
       Rising costs for workers’ compensation may have stimulated employers to increase

their efforts to a) prevent injuries, b) discourage workers from making claims, and c)

manage the disability process more closely to reduce the costs of claims. The costs of

workers’ compensation benefits per days away from work injury rose steadily during the

1980s and peaked in the early 1990s (Statistical Abstract (2001)). Greater attention to

workplace safety due to workers’ compensation programs may diminish the extra incentives

provided by OSHA inspections, but the impact of worker compensation should be on

injuries in general, rather than on injuries connected to OSHA standards. Since 1992, the

reduction in days away from work injuries (the only category for which we have injury type

data) occurred fairly uniformly across different injury types in manufacturing, as shown in

Table 9. To the extent that there were differences, the injury types generally believed to be

more related to standards such as “caught-in” injuries and falls from heights had less of a

decline than those believed to be less related to standards such as “bodily reaction”

(overexertion) injuries. This is consistent with a hypothesis that general financial incentives

like workers’ compensation, rather than inspections, were responsible for the injury decline.

       Finally, there may have been some changes in what actually goes on during

inspections. In the 1990s, especially after mid-1995, OSHA management de-emphasized

the importance of numerical measures of inspection activities (e.g., violations cited). It

placed more emphasis on problem solving and being more creative in encouraging firms to

reduce workplace hazards. This has led overall to fewer inspections taking more hours of

inspector time. These changes might have been expected to make individual inspections

more effective, but we find a declining impact of inspections instead.




                                             18
        After examining a variety of reasons for the decline in impact of OSHA inspections

on injuries, we have only found partial explanations. Some possibilities, such as changes in

data composition, OSHA’s records-check policy, and general deterrence, explain very little

or even go the other way. The growth in restricted work activity injuries can explain one-

third of the decline in an accounting sense, but this doesn’t explain why these injuries are

less affected. The increases in workers’ compensation costs in the 1980s may have led

employers to pay more attention to safety hazards, reducing the incremental incentives to

improve safety provided by OSHA inspections. We plan to explore these issues further with

more detailed analyses of the 1992-98 data, where we can test OSHA’s impact on specific

types of injuries.

Note:
Event types A, B, and C were identified by OSHA staff as those less likely to have injuries
related to OSHA standards. The case is strongest for category A.

Event types D, E, F, G, and H were identified as types more likely to have injuries related to
OSHA standards. The case is strongest for categories D and G.

Combined, these 8 categories included 95% of all days away from work injuries in 1998.
